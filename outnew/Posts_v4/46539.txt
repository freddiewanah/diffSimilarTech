ubuntu	debian
also check the link below if none of the above worked not sure if your question can be considered duplicate cannot install packages using node package manager in ubuntu
try sudo apt-get install nodejs-legacy it seems debian maintainers renamed the package to that

skip-lists	tree
i doubt that the skip-lists was the better choice than an e.g an avl tree even in 1989
in 1989 or 1990 as a student i implemented both it was not a good implementation of the skip-lists i must admit i was a novice in that time

34004017
skip-lists	tree
in 1989 or 1990 as a student i implemented both it was not a good implementation of the skip-lists i must admit i was a novice in that time
however the avl tree was not anymore difficult to implement. in contrast i had difficulties with that variable length forward pointers of the skip in list implementing in modula 2 which i primitivley solved with always using a maximum of 16 next pointers

34005607
octal	decimal
01188 is an octal nine followed by a decimal eighty-eight
any character that is not legal octal marks the end of an octal number

34005607
octal	decimal
any character that is not legal octal marks the end of an octal number
any character that is not legal decimal marks the end of a decimal number

34008193
swift	objective-c
in swift nil is not the equivalent of zero like it might happen in some cases in objective-c
nil is nothing since li is expecting a long integer and nil is not literal convertible and swift is statically typed you have to unwrap the number and make sure it is not nil zero is not nil

34008428
spaces	delimiter
the dots in a name spaces are not syntactic
the whole string is a token not the words delimiter by the dots

34009211
division	modulo
if you insist on die hard portability say you are programming on a ds9k you may instead use the types uint_least32_t and uint_least64_t or uint_fast32_t and uint_fast64_t that are always available under c99 but you need an extra mask that will be optimized out if not required regarding division you can use the c99 library functions div ldiv or lldiv to perform signed division and remainder operations in one call
the division modulo combination will be implemented in one operation if possible on the target architecture for the specific operand types

34009460
fgets	fseek
reading lines from the input file with fgets would be more reliable than your current method you cannot reliably compute the file size with ftell
c11 7.21.9.4 says for a text stream its file position indicator contains unspecified information usable by the fseek function for returning the file position indicator for the stream to its position at the time of the ftell call

34011040
google-chrome	firefox
note that google-chrome is not a supported browser for ssrs 2012
assuming you are trying to access report manager application and not the report server try this run internet explorer as administrator browse to report manager url you should see the report manager home page go to the security settings for the home page and explicitly add your user account with the content manager role you should now be able to browse to the home page with ie or firefox

34015136
entity-relationship	diagram
and the fk gets inappropriately called a relationship . the idef1x method records the use of nullable vs not null fks in its entity-relationship diagram rather than allowing a method to be chosen by implementers
this is a good idea because the nullability of an attribute is visible to users and affects the meaning of relationships tables. of course that is also a good argument to not to use entity-relationship formally and to specify directly by relational schemas . ...but only initially as to enforcing in the application domain that a school can have no headmaster only until it has had one in a typical sql dbms you can t constrain this declaratively

34015737
jar	war
if your project is currently a classic maven project you can create an aggregator module project pom.xml packaging as following this means the aggregator project will point to maven modules existing in subfolders your.artifact.id-application your.artifact.id-war and your.artifact.id-ear. the application module is a simple maven project providing your application logic and building a jar file out of it
it is not mandatory but it can also point as a parent to the aggregator project aggregation and inheritance are two different things in maven which can be mixed together or used differently . you can declare the parent project in modules as following in the application module you don t need to specify packaging since by default it will jar while in the ear and war module packaging will be respectively ear and war

34015737
jar	war
it is not mandatory but it can also point as a parent to the aggregator project aggregation and inheritance are two different things in maven which can be mixed together or used differently . you can declare the parent project in modules as following in the application module you don t need to specify packaging since by default it will jar while in the ear and war module packaging will be respectively ear and war
the war module will need to have the application module as its dependency

34018219
bower	npm
in contrast to bower the package manager normally used in node.js environments - npm - has a feature command called npm shrinkwrap which creates an npm-shrinkwrap.json file which locks down your dependency versions so that it is safe to run npm install afterwards. this is probably what you would want
however bower as it stands does not have this feature yet - there is a discussion about it going on on github here

34018608
division	modulo
you need to be a lot more specific with your question but i will explain what i assume its being done on those lines of code this is not a regular division it s a modulo division
the result is the remainder of the division of those two numbers

34022497
inline	inlining
the inline keyword is meaningless in your case compiler will inline your function if it can and wants to regardless of keyword
the keyword inline affects linking and not inlining

34024467

click on + button and type prefs in url schemes swift 3 swift objective-c and following are all the available urls prefs root general path about prefs root general path accessibility prefs root airplane_mode prefs root general path autolock prefs root general path usage cellular_usage prefs root brightness prefs root bluetooth prefs root general path date_and_time prefs root facetime prefs root general prefs root general path keyboard prefs root castle prefs root castle path storage_and_backup prefs root general path international prefs root location_services prefs root account_settings prefs root music prefs root music path eq prefs root music path volumelimit prefs root general path network prefs root nike_plus_ipod prefs root notes prefs root notifications_id prefs root phone prefs root photos prefs root general path managedconfigurationlist prefs root general path reset prefs root sounds path ringtone prefs root safari prefs root general path assistant prefs root sounds prefs root general path software_update_link prefs root store prefs root twitter prefs root facebook prefs root general path usage prefs root video prefs root general path network vpn prefs root wallpaper prefs root wifi prefs root internet_tethering prefs root phone path blocked prefs root do_not_disturb note network setting will not be opened in a simulator but the link will work on a real device
swift 4 note the following method works for all the versions below ios 11 for higher versions the app might get rejected since it s a private api sometimes we want to take a user to settings other than our app settings. the following method will help you achieve that first configure the url schemes in your project

34025463
implements	extends
that is impossible for because t 0 is the empty set and that s why you cannot implements proj for arbitrary p
if you extends you function to take a proof that p is not equal to 0 then you can implements it as follows

34029944
postgresql	mysql
this is not in the sql standard but is a postgresql extension
in mysql you do not have ilike

34032033
swift	objective-c
the nsdocument subclass is written in swift and calls an objective-c category to do this bit of work
since nsinvocation does not exist in swift i really don t see any other way

34032563
multiplying	multiplication
if you have two sparse tensors and need to multiplying them the simplest if not the most performant way is to convert them to dense and use tf.matmul note that the optional a_is_sparse and b_is_sparse arguments mean that a or b has a dense representation but a large number of its entries are zero which triggers the use of a different multiplication algorithm
for the special case of sparse vector by potentially large and sharded dense matrix multiplication and the values in the vector are 0 or 1 the tf.nn.embedding_lookup operator may be more appropriate

34032788
exponent	modulo
this code works for me beware the public exponent is assumed to be 3 bytes long i am not into python so please take it as a proof of concept and not as a solution
for the interesting parts as your pkcs#11 driver does not support rsa signature with a hash it is needed to calculate the hash and build the digestinfo asn.1 part manually the result is in the binarydata2 variable as rsa.new_pub_key accepts a tuple in openssl s format for bn_mpi2bn which it uses internally it was needed to prefix the modulo with one additional x00 to ensure it is interpreted as a positive number the x00 x00 x01 x01 x00 part given the function verify uses openssl s rsa_verify which takes as an argument a digest of signed data and not the data itself it was needed to obey and give it the digest which is re-used from the signature generation part and you would have to generate a fresh one if you plan to have a separate verify function note for sha256 you would need to use the appropriate digestinfo magic asn.1 string prefix see here for usable values + appropriate digest object from the hashlib + correct 3rd verify call argument

34034704
dictionary	map
you may redefine cfshow with so as not to show the wrapper dictionary
for natively recognized cf types - those that map onto js primitives - you ll see the specific type directly cfboolean for false

34045461
elasticsearch	kibana
you can see here the breaking changes they ve made for elasticsearch query language dsl
it doesn t since they did some massive changes on elasticsearch 2.x. some main query formats were changed and only on the newer kibana versions contain the correct code

34045937
client-side	server-side
bootstrap is a collection of css and client-side javascript
it isn t a traditional server-side mvc framework or anything else that would fulfil a similar role and doesn t do anything that would involve a database

34046707
config	ini
mysql.trace_mode is a runtime config option for ext mysql not mysqli
there is no equivalent ini option for mysqli

34048216
prepare	execute
this is c statement. for this particular task a cisc processor would come prepare with a specific instruction we ll call it mult
when execute this instruction loads the two values into separate registers multiplies the operands in the execution unit and finally third stores the product in the appropriate register. thus the entire task of multiplying two numbers can be completed with one instruction mult a b this is assembly statement mult is what is known as a complex instruction. it operates directly on the computer s memory banks and does not require the programmer to explicitly call any loading or storing functions. risc processors only use simple instructions that can be execute within one clock cycle. in order to perform the exact series of steps described in the cisc approach a programmer would need to code four lines of assembly load r1 a this is assembly statement load r2 b this is assembly statement prod a b this is assembly statement store r3 a this is assembly statement advantage - each instruction requires only one clock cycle to execute the entire program will execute in approximately the same amount of time as the multi-cycle mult command. these risc reduced instructions require less transistors of hardware space than the complex instructions leaving more room for general purpose registers

34051387
rdf	owl
exceptions are containers and uses of rdfs resource and rdf property
edit from the owl 2 specs 2.3 semantics the owl 2 structural specification document defines the abstract structure of owl 2 ontologies but it does not define their meaning

34054071
required	placeholder
magic in std bind will provide the hidden this parameter required by methods
if the function has parameters that are not known at the time of binding use std placeholder to save room to them in the method s parameter list

34060846
intersect	contains
intersect those packages names from those respective lists with packages lists assembled above that you did not want proguard to mess with
seeds should contains your jetty classes interfaces

34063403
build.gradle	gradlew
if you prefer to use android studio 1.5 instead of eclipse and try to port the project from the website execute and create svn working copy android-gesture-recognition-tool folder svn checkout android-gesture-recognition-tool notes a android studio supports checking out a svn project using its checkout from version control project wizard...however the project above does not have any build.gradle file b you can use tortoisesvn tool available from internet to create the svn working copy from android studio new project wizard start a new android project configure your new project type application name gesture trainer type company domain android.dfki.de select the form factors... check phone and tablet select minimum sdk api 8 add an activity to mobile choose blank activity customize the activity type activity name gesture trainer let gradlew finishes its job close android studio from the android studio s generated gesturetrainer project folder open gesturetrainer app src folder delete androidtest folder delete test folder open gesturetrainer app src main folder delete every folder in it copy res folder from the svn working copy into it copy assets folder from the svn working copy into it copy src folder from the svn working copy into it copy androidmanifest.xml from the svn working copy into it create aidl folder in it open android studio

34063766
swift	objective-c
maybe not yet exactly what you are looking for but you can use swiftify service to convert declarations from objective-c to swift
furthermore if above documentation tools allow to develop any sort of a plugin to integrate with it should be possible to automatically generate swift sources using our web api

34064957
bazaar	git	fossil	git
fossil also has the autosync feature to operate in an svn-like fashion with caveats and bazaar has always been able to work in a quasi-centralized fashion with commits going directly to the server
in particular having only a single checkout per repository is largely a historical git artifact and not representative of dvcs systems and as i noted gone as of the more recent git versions

34065088
octal	decimal
these are octal literals 01001 01002 not decimal
they will be interpreted as if they were 513 and 514 in a decimal base system during compilation

34065194
elasticsearch	kibana
facets were removed in the 2.0 release of elasticsearch
hence kibana 3 does not support elasticsearch versions greater than 1.7

34065194
elasticsearch	kibana
hence kibana 3 does not support elasticsearch versions greater than 1.7
this is mentioned in the kibana 3 documentation but not in the release notes

34069784
vsts	tfs
the tfs 2015 build agent vsts agent formerly vso agent doesn t listen on any of the ports so no port has to be opened on the target machine
it tries to connect to vsts on https i.e port 443

34070316
hex	binary
this way the solution must work with the number of ones each hex digit have
if i understood you correctly you want not to convert a hexadecimal number to binary but to count the ones that each hex digit have and accumulate they for example for a the number is 1

34070537
persistent	transient
javax.persistence.transient is only respected in the context of database persistent not beaninfo serialization
you use the wrong transient should use java.beans.transient for the annotation

34071755
build.gradle	gradlew
this is what i ended up with for gradlew based android studio 1.5 projects i think this is a very complete list. the only questionable option imho is whether you ignore files or not. they duplicate information from build.gradle are automatically generated and constantly updated by android studio but on the other hand new developers will need to import project instead of open an existing android studio project if you decide not to track them
contrary to the other answer i would strongly recommend checking all the gradlew wrapper files into vcs. the wrapper s purpose is to bootsrap the installation of gradle. if you for example want to set up automatic builds you only need to check out the project create local.properties or corresponding environment variables and execute gradlew assemble . the build system will then automatically install the gradlew version specified in your gradle-wrapper.properties to perform the assemble task

34073160
s-function	simulink
why are you doing this in an s-function when a from workspace block or one of the many other ways to get data into a model would seem to make more sense
it seems from your example that you re not really familiar with the way simulink works

34075725
ssl	https
you have to import endpoint ssl certificate to client-trustore.jks
the api console may not be giving you response due to following issues if you are using https you have to type the gateway url in browser and accept it before invoke the api from the api console this case there is no signed certificate in the gateway cors issue which may due to your domain is not in access allow origins response of options call if you create a api which having https backend

34076378
super	extends
in this example you are extends the react.component class and per the es2015 spec a child class constructor cannot make use of this until super has been called
also es2015 class constructors have to call super if they are subclasses

34076378
super	extends
also es2015 class constructors have to call super if they are subclasses
by contrast more detail as per this excellent stack overflow answer you may see examples of components created by extends the react.component class that do not call super but you ll notice these don t have a constructor hence why it is not necessary

34076378
super	extends
by contrast more detail as per this excellent stack overflow answer you may see examples of components created by extends the react.component class that do not call super but you ll notice these don t have a constructor hence why it is not necessary
one point of confusion i ve seen from some developers i ve spoken to is that the components that have no constructor and therefore do not call super anywhere still have this.props available in the render method

34078814
prng	random
if the prng s seed hashing function is good this will be just as random as its input
if it s not it might be more predictable for example a prng with only 64 bits of internal state will only produce 2 64 different values regardless of how many bits you seed it with

34079163
memcpy	strncpy
instead of use do i m sorry i advised you to use memcpy but you have to check the lenght of the string to know how many bytes to copy and is not the correct function to use
using strncpy is better because the copy stops when reach a null byte or the maximum number of characters that can be stored

34080672
swift	objective-c
if you just need to forward it to one observer then a simpler way is to override forwardingtargetforselector which is available in swift but if you want to do more than one or need to do other complicated stuff you need forwardinvocation
if you want to dynamically handle unrecognized messages without crashing you should override forwardinvocation and methodsignatureforselector in objective-c they are not available in swift

34080969
google-chrome	firefox
the problem you re experiencing isn t necessarily the code and it s actually not a problem with google-chrome
it s actually firefox doing more than perhaps it should

34082856
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome looks for this missing chain certificates by itself while firefox does not
but firefox caches intermediate certificates from earlier connections to other sites so if the right sites were visited before then the missing certificates are already known by firefox and will be used to complete the trust chain

34083807
dictionary	map
in particular outputs_info is the list of theano variables or dictionary describing the initial state of the outputs computed recurrently
and if you provide a none instead of a variable or a empty dictionary scan assumes that you will not use any taps for this output like for example in case of a map the number of elements in the outputs_info list should match the number of values returned by the scan step function

34088308
rsa	aes
begrudgingly using rsa properly the only reason to use rsa in 2017 is i m forbidden to install pecl extensions and therefore cannot use libsodium and for some reason cannot use paragonie sodium_compat either. your protocol should look something like this generate a random aes key
encrypt your plaintext message with the aes key using an aead encryption mode or failing that cbc then hmac-sha256

34092217
bower	npm
bower is good if you like asynchronous albeit somewhat more exposed dependencies less learning curve setup more get it done not having a bazillion options enjoy the amd dependency model npm is good if you like compiling your coffeescript typescript into heftier javascript files i haven t done this with bower so i don t know if it offers some of the transpiling options i assume it does want to leverage node s existing extensive library of packages via bower webpack want more customization over how you build your app enjoy the common js dependency model i m sure others can comment on the pros cons of each
it sounds like you already have your environment for this project setup to utilize npm i d not let a few more dependencies cause you to have to question that setup

34096078
super	implements
since this is super basic i recommend your dig into how java ee works. also this is pure java ee configuration and has nothing to to with app engine specifics whatsoever
edit i have not seen an ofyhelper implements like that before

34097084
swift	objective-c
+load has been deprecated removed for swift code
while existing objective-c code will still execute it even if called from swift new code should not rely on it

34098947
rpm	yum
the el6 aka dist tag is a convenience to the user as a suffix to the release and is not something that rpm can select on directly
it sounds like you have them in the same yum repository

34099530
client-side	server-side
bodypartwriter bodypartreader apis are only for reading or writing parts of a multipart encoded client-side request response hence they are under the multipart module
sending a multipart server-side response doesn t make any sense

34102628
realloc	malloc
since you use realloc not simply malloc it looks like data has already been allocated somewhere else presumably in the function that calls my_function
to clear any misconception upfront the assignment will not pass the updated value of temp obtained from realloc back to the caller since is passed by value

34102962
swift	objective-c
objective-c has nil but does not have in-built optionals while swift does
similarly java has null but not have implicit optionals while several jvm languages such as kotlin scala and ceylon do and did so before swift

34103477
sudo	passwd
to have it so you never need to use a passwd for sudo you could do something like ramish being your user or for specific commands or binaries if it s just hdfs you need again whatever your user is and whatever the commands are
your passwordless access is because you re using a key most likely rsa or dsa which does not have a passwd

34103477
sudo	passwd
to not have to enter a sudo passwd for your user you ll need someone with perms to add this to the sudoers file
currently your user will be allowed to use sudo

34104357
factors	matrix
so your code can be simplified to the layout of complex numbers in the blas routines is documented in therefore to multiply you can represent each complex number as two floating point numbers stored consecutively or you can represent the complex numbers using the dspcomplex complex or __clpk_complex structure which all have the same layout in either case the dimensions m n etc refer to the count of complex numbers so they are identical to the values in your example of real numbers and alpha and beta are an array as well to represent a complex factors
your existing code is a bit too complicated and has an error the input matrix and vector can be passed directly to the cblas_sgemv function matrixconverted and vectorconverted are not needed

34107893
google-chrome	firefox
some browsers like google-chrome will download the missing certificates other browsers like firefox will try to fill in with intermediate certificates cached from former connections to other sites
if this is not possible like with a newly created browser profile firefox will fail too with the message yahoo.co.uk uses an invalid security certificate

34108580
laravel	phalcon	codeigniter	phalcon
this shouldn t be necessary for frameworks like laravel or codeigniter since their code should already be included in your phpstorm project and thus accessible to the ide to facilitate code navigation auto-completion etc.
however since phalcon is a php extension you ll need to download its plaintext source files and include them as an external library in your phpstorm project

34108902
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
in case 2 you are making a cast to convert the uiviewcontroller to uinavigationcontroller hence the compiler didn t gave any warning
you should not try to convert uiviewcontroller to a uinavigationcontroller

34108995
uiview	subviews
all you have to do are the following steps add the uiscrollview as subviews of your uiviewcontroller add the uiview as a subviews of the uiscrollview add the uibutton as a subviews of the uiviewcontroller
do not add it as a subviews of the uiscrollview if you want it to stick to the bottom

34110047
boost	allocator
edit #2 with the boost variant it would look like this as you can see far more elegant however it has the limitation that you need to know all the possible types upfront the boost variant needs to know about all of them and they must be supplied as the template arguments
the above wrapper solution does not have that limitation but that comes with a price - there are extra memory allocator boost variant does not need any extra memory allocator and virtual method calls boost variant static_visitor uses the template machinery so the calls are direct

34111505
des	aes
and no des is not secure and in fact has been in brute-force range for at least a decade depending on attacker capabilities
it has been deprecated since about 1999 in favor first of triple-des formally tdea and then aes and was officially withdrawn about 2005 as i recall

34112065
g++	gcc
use g++ to compile c++ code not the common c-oriented gcc
g++ invokes gcc for compilation and linking with the right options for c++

34115594
comparator	comparable
trying to pass a foo into a foo object s comparator will crash
if you want to make a constraint that the two arguments are of the same type which is comparable to itself you would do something like however for the purposes of this function the constraint that the two arguments are of the same type is not technically necessary although it should be true in all normal use cases

34115802
profiling	debugging
now if you have the correct provision profiling and certificate you should not have any issues.
go into your project build settings and make sure provision profiling is set to automatic and that code signing identity is configured with the right certificate for debugging and release

34116178
flask	django
if you want to achieve editing of the layout files of the site like wordpress does it for themes you are going to need to implement an app to do that yourself i m not aware of any existing project that allows you to do that in django or in flask
in a nutshell you need to pick out what files you want to expose and have a view where you load up the text file open file display it in a django form in a textarea and save it back to the file again

34121824
punctuation	words
turn both into an array of course you may need extra processing to get rid of punctuation and other stuff but array_diff is essentially what does the job
although the question isn t clearly stated i suppose it s essentially this you have a file with text words separated by spaces and you want to delete all words that occur in the list

34124905
ansible	puppet
in a nutshell no ansible does not come with any predefined playbooks nor does ansible tower come with any predefined features like the ones you listed
ansible is a configuration management and orchestration platform much like puppet chef cfengine and others

34125813
decoder	encoder
in your example you have this for the netty4 component thus you are using the default encoder decoders which probably is not a text line based encoder decoder
you can probably find which is the default encoder in the documentation but i think you probably can learn more than me by finding that information

34131889
dataframe	multi-index
using a dummy dataframe for the example for a you can use get_level_values to get the individual levels as index objects or for b reset the index and set it back afterwards
the str methods indeed only work on single levels not on a multi-index

34133601
ssl	https
so the short answer is yes it is ok to send the password plaintext as long as the connection is encrypted with https ssl
the problem is a website doesn t have any alternatives but to trust in the https ssl connection

34136751
sse	avx
full bmi2 avx pshufb lut version vectorizable the data movement could be use avx 3-operand versions of the 128b sse instructions to avoid needing movdqa to not overwrite the table for pshufb
as long as you never run a 256b avx instruction you don t need to mess with vzeroupper

34137454
spaces	delimiter
or....perhaps what you re looking for is something like this the spaces after the comma within the split argument is not a typo
arrays.tostring method places a spaces after each delimiter

34139269
punctuation	words
the third marking group matches either any whitespace character or a period or a comma or an exclamation mark or a question mark the standard punctuation marks or a left angle bracket from an html or xml tag
a semicolon or colon is not matched and other non words characters are also ignored for a positive match

34139711
google-chrome	firefox
issue seems to be with firefox latest version does not support web driver. was facing similar issue used google-chrome driver instaed of firefox and it worked
when we download web driver and extract it to a folder changelog file will be there open it with notepad supported firefox version is mentioned

34142074
calloc	malloc
you can use either memset to clear out the memory of just use calloc which does it
malloc does not put garbage in the memory allocated it just doesn t initialize it to anything so you get whatever garbage is there

34143769
udp	tcp
first of all when you say that why we can not use udp that leads me to the assumption that you are not using tcp at all for this discussion
udp is the packet which contains some x number of bytes

34144055
google-chrome	firefox
downloading with google-chrome on win 7 failed all the time for me
i tried with firefox and although it gave the same error i was able to finish the download with retry button in downloads in firefox because it downloads not from the beginning of the file but resumes the downloading

34145568
mongodb	bson
not only is it another property of bad design covered earlier but also there are realistic hard limits on the size of output from mongodb and many sensible systems
single documents have a bson size limit of 16mb which will almost certainly be exceeded in any real world case when trying to do so

34155003
pthreads	fork
prior to any pthreads operations
where possible do not change signal handlers and masks you might need to do this prior to and subsequent to fork calls

34155200
implements	extends
and as it s not possible to achieve the n-ary multiplicity between java interfaces the uml invoker interface in the example i used in my question needs to be implements using a java interface that is implements by an abstract class and by extends that abstract class with concrete invoker subclasses
this would maintain malleability of the code while preserving the abstraction as shown in the implementation below here the client implementer uses the java interface which is implements by a java abstract class to provide the multiplicity with command interface and the access to that multiplicity to the concrete invokers

34155367
hive	hdfs
what i ve seen in the production today is spark hive hbase
imapala looks to me it require certain parts of hdfs this is why it doesn t work with posix fs and it s not hcfs

34157563
apache	nginx
it s not written for nginx nor is it written for apache
i mean seriously people have been doing composer with nginx for a long time

34160987
viewdidload	viewwillappear	viewdidload	viewdidappear
since it s not visible yet you cannot apply animations to it. viewdidload is only meant to configure your view controller s view and set up your view hierarchy - to add subviews
what you want to use is viewwillappear or viewdidappear to start your animation as soon as the view becomes or became visible

34161936
implements	extends
if you were implements your num in java and you wanted to support comparing num values you could either have your num class implements or you could provide a value of type that would describe how to compare two num instances
semigroup is like comparator not comparable you don t extends it you provide a value that describes how to append instances of your type

34162313
build.gradle	gradlew
as a quick test to make sure this is the problem you can add the following code in your section of your build.gradle
when you create a release apk for the play store gradlew runs proguard which can make some of your classes invisible to your code if not configured properly

34163885
implements	extends
having the convenience of not having to implements the methods might make you forget about those methods
for example if you implements applicationlistener then you are confronted with the life cycle of your application but if you extends applicationadapter then it can be easy to forget about the resize or dispose method

34165122
opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
check it out here you can run google-chrome opera and firefox natively so that s not much of an issue
when it comes to safari you again are likely to need a vm or a mac for testing

34166272
tabcontrol	tabitem
this is the default tabcontrol markup generated from a windows 8.1 box note that there are some subtle variances from one version to another but this will get you started note that this formulation will apply the template everywhere it s not locally overridden by a style somestylename property. if by chance you have blend installed you will have more flexibility in how these templates are previewed and may prove easier to style your colors and fonts
if it s the tabitem you want to customize follow the same procedure

34166547
namedtuple	dictionary
the docs and help namedtuple say to use c._asdict to convert to a dictionary
from the docs named tuple instances do not have per-instance dictionary so they are lightweight and require no more memory than regular tuples

34167803
noexcept	throw
what this means in practice is that conceptually a vector implementation typically tries to generate code for one of the following solutions for copying moving existing elements to the new storage in decreasing order of preference t is the element type and we re interested in class types here if t has a usable present not deleted not ambiguous accessible etc. noexcept move constructor use it
exceptions cannot be throw while constructing the elements in the new storage so there s no need to revert to the previous state

34167803
noexcept	throw
otherwise if t has a usable copy constructor noexcept or not that takes a use that
even if copying throw an exception we can revert to the previous state as the originals are still there unmodified

34167803
noexcept	throw
category s move constructor is still declared as above not noexcept in the op s case
this means that the code generated for emplace_back cannot use category s copy constructor so it has to use the move constructor even though it can throw see the first section above

34168818
strtol	atoi
you will find the atoi function in many situations but it s good to know about strtol as well
no atoi is not obsolete

34168818
strtol	atoi
is equivalent to strtol str null 10
for most of the cases lundin a very knowledgable c programmer says in atoi string to int that atoi is not deprecated your source is incorrect

34170097
bash	zsh
as you might expect you get the intended assignment if you quote the command substitution protecting the newlines zsh produces the same error as dash bash and ksh exhibit the same behavior
the bash man page doesn t give any hint as to why quoting isn t necessary although the ksh man page does allude to the argument to readonly as being a true assignment emphasis mine variable assignments

34170361
client-side	server-side
in an angularjs app the displayed html or dom a mix of tags and business data is generated client-side browser
it should not be generated server-side with php as you are trying to do

34173016
ssl	https
the official doc is not so clear so find below how to cross certify with the web server that have the ssl your want to cross certify to copy the server id in your notes client
in your client switch to id of the server go to user security people services find more about people services click the retrieve internet service certificate button check that the protocol is ok sometime specify other and fill port manually and do not put https for service name

34173291
fseek	fread
code have logical mistakes as follow initialise variables type cast not required first you have counted number of char in file so before reading again file rewind it by fseek fp 0 seek_set
in this if you are reading single char you should read complete file to read complete file do fread memory 1 count fp

34178428
oncreate	findviewbyid
reason is oncreate method is called before oncreateview and calling findviewbyid for accessing view s from fragment layout will return null due to views are not ready to access
and in current code calling findviewbyid using getactivity means accessing view from fragment container activity instead of fragment layout because getactivity method return context of activity instead of fragment which is required to access views from fragment

34184226
swift	objective-c
a lot of swift is designed to eliminate common causes of bugs that people have encountered including this one
this is stated in the swift programming language book under basic operators unlike the assignment operator in c and objective-c the assignment operator in swift does not itself return a value

34184546
pascal	delphi
so the expression has the same meaning as since in c values are regarded as true if they are non-zero in delphi pascal this expression would be
this is not really a delphi or pascal question

34185527
dictionary	map
suddenly a simple dictionary isn t enough you might need a tree of choices attached to each identifier found in the map or a more complex mapping of the identifier with signature data to a scope entry
in many algol like languages look in another scope requires going up the lexical nesting of blocks so each map must have an association with a parent scope

34187511
firefox	safari
you can find recent state here recently firefox added support for speech recognition but this feature is highly experimental see
speech recognition is chrome-only feature it does not support safari

34188062
pbkdf2	md5
make sure you use an algorithm designed to hash password like pbkdf2 or bcrypt
hashing algorithm like md5 and sha-1 were created to be efficient not secure and therefore should never be used to hash password

34188824
jar	war
it does not properly handles .war here s the alternative i found i eventually switched back to the regular war launcher and i managed to configure a folder which jar contents are added to the classpath using a springapplicationrunlistener such as this pseudo-code for concision this listener is instanciated by declaring it in a meta-inf spring.factories file
in spring boot 1.2 propertieslauncher handles .jar and .zip files as jar archives and everything else as exploded archives unzipped jars

34190878
content-length	content-type
also add a content-length header for the length of your post payload
you get 403 error not because of cookie header but a missing content-type header

34191940
punctuation	words
reversing the punctuation too
split the sentence on words boundaries which doesn t consume any of the string then split each words into its letters non-spaces with s using a lookahead so those aren t consumed

34192073
google-chrome	firefox
as explained above google-chrome the blink engine will use a different strategy than firefox and ie google-chrome will copy the contents with their css styling but omitting any styles that are not defined
firefox and ie on the other hand won t apply page-specific css they will apply the browser s default styles

34194211
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
safari does not support execcommand and google-chrome osx has a known bug code see jsfiddle where you can enter html segment into the textarea and copy to the clipboard with ctrl+c
i have done a few modifications on loilo s answer above setting and later restoring the focus to the hidden div prevents firefox going into endless recursion when copying from a textarea setting the range to the inner children of the div prevents google-chrome inserting an extra in the beginning removeallranges on getselection prevents appending to existing selection possibly not needed try catch around execcommand hiding the copy div better on osx this will not work

34195467
udp	tcp
try using tcp_nodelay option to ask tcp stack to immediately send data after application calls sendmsg you can also try iperf application to measure the tcp udp throughput which has options of running multiple threads on same socket
not sure but could be because i see that kernel tunes sk_sndbuf by calling tcp_sndbuf_expand very often on basis of tcp window size propagated by server

34195488
spaces	linefeed
if you want to allow embedded spaces modify the scanf formats this way but be aware that empty lines will not be accepted by this scanf format
the linefeed will stay in the input stream the second scanf will fail too and job and or hobby will have indeterminate contents letting printf invoke undefined behavior

34197791
factors	mean
replication factors is configurable you can change it for every file copy for example file1 may have replication factors of 2 while file2 may have replication factors of say 3 in a similar way some other properties can also be configured at the time of execution
i am not sure about what you exactly mean by namenode managing the storage here is how a file upload to hdfs gets executed - 1 client sends a request to namenode for file upload to hdfs 2 namenode based on the configuration if not explicitly specified by the client application calculates the number of blocks data will be broken into. 3 namenode also decides which datanodes will store the blocks based on the replication factors specified in configuration if not explicitly specified by the client application 4 namenode sends information calculated in step #2 and #3 to the client 5 client application will break the file into blocks and write each block to a datanode say dn1. 6 now dn1 will be responsible to replicate the received blocks to other datanodes as chosen by the namenode in #3

34197791
namenode	hdfs
i am not sure about what you exactly mean by namenode managing the storage here is how a file upload to hdfs gets executed - 1 client sends a request to namenode for file upload to hdfs 2 namenode based on the configuration if not explicitly specified by the client application calculates the number of blocks data will be broken into. 3 namenode also decides which datanodes will store the blocks based on the replication factors specified in configuration if not explicitly specified by the client application 4 namenode sends information calculated in step #2 and #3 to the client 5 client application will break the file into blocks and write each block to a datanode say dn1. 6 now dn1 will be responsible to replicate the received blocks to other datanodes as chosen by the namenode in #3
it will initiate replication when namenode instructs it. for you questions #3 and #4 it is important to understand that any distributed application will require a set of configurations available with each node to be able to interact with each other and also perform designated task as per expectation

34202753
rpm	yum
further reading installing an rpm from another rpm s post script install rpm within an rpm...continued rpm dependencies are discussed here tags data definitions manual dependencies as a rule you should use yum for installing even locally built packages to keep its database up to date
addressing op s question no you cannot install one rpm from within another rpm

34203576
treemap	linkedhashmap
you can use the fact that a linkedhashmap will retain insertion order - so specify a supplier in the tomap call so that it will create a linkedhashmap appropriately that won t be a treemap but your method doesn t declare that it returns a treemap just a map
if you really really need a treemap i suggest you change the signature - but that would be odd given that a treemap sorts by key rather than value

34205729
implements	extends
so any class extends doit automatically implements ido by the very nature of the fact it s extends a class that implements it
you can put the implements clause on the declaration but it doesn t have any further effect on the class

34206893
hive	hdfs
this concepts applied to all the data processing technology over hadoop like mapreduce hive and pig.this is the mail reason pig doesn t import the data into the system instead it goes near to data and analyze it
data locality an important concept with hdfs and mapreduce data locality can best be described as bringing the compute to the data. in other words whenever you use a mapreduce program on a particular part of hdfs data you always want to run that program on the node or machine that actually stores this data in hdfs

34210921
hive	hdfs
not to mention it be unlikely that a real hive table would have the join key s value stored twice
the only other solution i can think of and i m not recommending would be to store c as a file on hdfs that you have a non-managed likely external hive table configured to point to the directory you just stored the file into

34210921
hive	hdfs
the only other solution i can think of and i m not recommending would be to store c as a file on hdfs that you have a non-managed likely external hive table configured to point to the directory you just stored the file into
you could also have a hive view pre-created that sequences possibly trims extra columns like the duplicate cmr_id the columns so that you could then do a new load command using hcatloader and then use that alias for the hcatstorer store command

34216601
implements	extends
now class a will implements only interface a and other classes can implements both interface a and interface b
solution with java 8 use java 8 default methods and change definition of your interface as extends interfaces that contain default methods when you extends an interface that contains a default method you can do the following not mention the default method at all which lets your extended interface inherit the default method

34221066
gulp-sass	node-sass
it is a wrapper over node-sass which is the c version super fast on gulp-sass documentation they already have you covered with one example so your task should look like this hope this helps you to accomplish what you are looking for
i will assume you are using gulp-sass pluging if you are not using i suggest you to do it

34222428
spaces	delimiter
in the string as used here only spaces is a delimiter rather than all spaces as a single spaces is sufficient to delimit and the code will be faster than using all spaces
since you seem to have concerns over what a reviewer may say here s the code which actually does what you have asked for unstring edited-field delimiter by all spaces into ignore-this no-leading-space-field i m not at all sure how that would be difficult to review

34222428
spaces	delimiter
all spaces is any number of spaces from one to the size of the field it is being applied to
any delimiter named in unstring is not included in the into fields

34223477
udp	tcp
udp for instance is dgram protocol that has fixed packets that are readable separately
tcp by design is stream protocol it gets stacked up in the buffer if you are not fast enough to read it out

34224237
client-side	server-side
javascript renders client-side so you are asking browser to do something for you call alert console.log this is different from c# log something or any other thing that browsers allows you to do not your server
and you cannot call server-side code from javascript unless you have rest api for that call

34224294
invokelater	invokeandwait
- never seen this situations never needed to use invokeandwait in todays java versions java 1.6 and never versions awt event queue required initializations of awt swing jcomponents apis for awt swing gui doesn t guarantee ordering of events by using standard invokelater is output without j components everything is o.k. all three threads ends with success
by using standard invokelater and jframe everything is o.k. all three threads ends with jframe on the screen success this is correct output awating that

34224348
sudo	passwd
also sudo keeps a log of who does what for auditing purposes
sudo requires the passwd of the user calling it not the passwd of the superuser or the user specified by the -u option

34224348
sudo	passwd
sudo requires the passwd of the user calling it not the passwd of the superuser or the user specified by the -u option
that may seem backwards but the idea is that sudo can be configured to provide fine-grained control over what you are actually allowed to run as the superuser rather than giving you access to the superuser account itself

34224623
serializable	deserialization
when you run it on the cluster your tc will be serializable and shipped to the cluster nodes
there the deserialization of the instance does not call again the constructor to initialize stack

34224883
invokelater	invokeandwait
it must be initialized in java8 by using invokelater everything seems like as ending for reasonable usage of invokeandwait only - when standard constructor ends and its initialized from invokelater and funny joke in java8 doesn t matter if is there some jcomponents or not in comparing with java7 or java6 without jcomponents initializer start anonymous inner-class print.print method ref print.print print.print called from - anonymous inner-class lambda print.print print.print called from - method ref initializer end print.print called from - lambda by using jframe as jcomponent initializer start anonymous inner-class print.print method ref print.print lambda print.print initializer end print.print called from - anonymous inner-class print.print called from - method ref print.print called from - lambda print.print called from - lambda
note this answer is just and about how really the initial thread works with static methods in java8 it doesn t account for the behavior at runtime you have to test by using standard initial thread there must be invokelater used otherwise its fails sure it doesn t help you somehow if is called at runtime but have to test about .

34225828
super	extends
also super can only be called automatically after the overriding method not before which again in some scenarios is undesirable
also none of this help against re-binding the attribute during the lifetime of the object and class although this can be helped by using descriptors and or extends the metaclass to take care of it

34227176
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
this exception is thrown to indicate that there are no more elements in an enumeration. this exception extends the runtimeexception class and thus belongs to those exceptions that can be thrown during the operation of the java virtual machine jvm
it is an unchecked-exception and thus it does not need to be declared in a method s or a constructor s throws clause. finally the nosuchelementexception exists since the first version of java

34228362
udp	mtu
in theory you can have a udp packet size of approx 65 000 bytes but you need to take into account the mtu maximum transmission unit size of your transport and that will likely give you a much smaller packet
if you want reliable and lossless communication then udp is not a solution and i would advise a tcp-based mechanism

34229577
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome it is forwarded correctly to - but not in firefox what seems very strange to me
firefox shows ssl_error_bad_cert_domain

34230983
google-chrome	firefox
and google-chrome 52 even supports srcobject
it is not implemented yet in google-chrome but it works there if you use the official adapter.js webrtc polyfill firefox and edge support it natively fwiw

34230983
google-chrome	firefox
it is not implemented yet in google-chrome but it works there if you use the official adapter.js webrtc polyfill firefox and edge support it natively fwiw
update google-chrome 50 appears to support this now

34232105
rsa	aes
although openpgp takes advantage of rsa and other standard algorithms you cannot use the default c# rsacryptoserviceprovider
rsa is only one possible algorithm for openpgp and furthermore you need some symmetric encryption algorithm like aes which would also be available

34236282
required	placeholder
so we can use 1st as placeholder text placeholder attribute is not required
placeholder text will appear when the user didn t feed any value. selectbox in this scenario the 1st option will appear when the user didn t enter a value

34236344
required	placeholder
the select element implements placeholder by way of what the html5 spec calls a placeholder label option which is described thusly if a select element has a required attribute specified does not have a multiple attribute specified and has a display size of 1
and if the value of the first option element in the select element s list of options if any is the empty string and that option element s parent node is the select element and not an optgroup element then that option is the select element s placeholder label option

34243558
direct3d	directx
the fixedfuncemu11 sample is a direct3d 11 port of the legacy directx sdk s fixedfuncemu direct3d 10 sample
the shaders are useful for understanding the various direct3d 9 specific fixed-function pipeline but doesn t cover standard stuff like implementing standard lighting models in hlsl

34243727
super	extends
think of base traits classes as higher in the linear hierarchy and traits lower in the hierarchy as closer to the class object which is the subject of the linearisation. the linearisation affects how super is resolved in a trait it will resolve to the closest base trait higher in the hierarchy
thus linearisation of a with d with c with b is top of hierarchy a constructed first as base class linearisation of d a not considered as a occurs before d d extends a linearisation of c a not considered as a occurs before b b extends a c c extends b linearisation of b a not considered as a occurs before b not considered as b occurs before so the linearization is a-d-b-c. you could think of it as a linear hierarchy where a is the root highest and is constructed first and c is the leaf lowest and constructed last

34245834
serializable	deserialization
if a serializable class does not explicitly declare a serialversionuid then the serializable runtime will calculate a default serialversionuid value for that class based on various aspects of the class as described in the java tm object serializable specification
however it is strongly recommended that all serializable classes explicitly declare serialversionuid values since the default serialversionuid computation is highly sensitive to class details that may vary depending on compiler implementations and can thus result in unexpected invalidclassexceptions during deserialization

34247021
ubuntu	linux
the non-comment lines conform to the normal layout so the root entry is ubuntu 14.04 lts mac os x 10.11.2 the mac os x behaviour ignores or at least seems to ignore the fflush stdin thus not following posix on this issue
the linux behaviour corresponds to the documented posix behaviour but the posix specification is far more careful in what it says it specifies a file capable of seeking but terminals of course do not support seeking

34251617
viewdidload	viewdidappear
killing the app will call viewdidload again load latest values. scrolling will also load latest data in cell because cellforrowatindexpath will be called load updated values
you can call tableview.reloaddata in viewdidappear reason your tableview is not updating is that it is in the same state you set in viewdidload

34251617
viewdidload	viewdidappear
you can call tableview.reloaddata in viewdidappear reason your tableview is not updating is that it is in the same state you set in viewdidload
after changing your settings it still remained the same as viewdidload is not called again when navigating back from settings

34251617
viewdidload	viewdidappear
after changing your settings it still remained the same as viewdidload is not called again when navigating back from settings
although viewdidappear will be called when navigating back from settings

34253210
ng-show	ng-class
the other reason behind it was not working is you were using interpolation in ng-show ng-hide directive
directive you could refactor you template to use ng-class instead of using ng-show ng-hide by applying classes conditionally

34254574
super	self
class commonbase object def create self pass class base1 commonbase def create self super base1 self .create class base2 commonbase def create self super base2 self .create class c base1 base2 def create self super c self .create here c .create will call all four create methods each once
in other words you have multiple inheritance with class base1 object def create self ... class base2 object def create self ... class c base1 base2 def create self ... in class c you can choose whether to call the implementation from the parent classes or not

34256879
fgets	fread
there are a number of reasons that reading with line-oriented input functions such as fgets or getline will fail to properly read all characters in a file
text output functions suffer similar shortcomings attempting to write characters outside the printable range or characters that have alternate meaning as ascii reading and writing from a file in binary mode using fread and fwrite is not any more difficult than using fgets and fputs

34256879
fgets	fread
text output functions suffer similar shortcomings attempting to write characters outside the printable range or characters that have alternate meaning as ascii reading and writing from a file in binary mode using fread and fwrite is not any more difficult than using fgets and fputs
however using fread and fwrite you are guaranteed a correct and accurate copy of your data by avoiding the pitfalls inherent in attempting a general file copy in text mode

34259614
swift	objective-c
you shouldn t need to think about the address of a swift array but if you d like to momentarily get the address of an array s buffer you can do it this way this lets you see the buffer s copy-on-write in action
arrays in swift have value semantics not the reference semantics of arrays in python and objective-c

34263463
awt	swing
swing built on top of awt makes use of it when it calls getcomponentgraphics - a protected method of jcomponent it uses in its paint method where it paints component borders etc
but awt itself doesn t have any internal use for the foreground color and doesn t use it by default for painting

34268357
super	self
otherwise do not use super but call the base class constructor directly class b a def __init__ self a.__init__ self # ...
the error you get indicates that you are probably attempting to use super with old-style classes

34278252
memcpy	memmove
flip to upper partition with memcpy add 6 to head and tail note that since the two partitions don t overlap we don t have to use memmove we can use memcpy
if you require linear access to the array contents and you want to not perform frequent memcpy operations a possible solution for this is a flip buffer or sliding buffer

34278260
noexcept	throw
the reason for this change is that move constructing and destroying a temporary should be noexcept by default
if you want to have throw destructors with c++11 you ll need to declare the destructor as noexcept false when throw an exception from a destructor you effectively need to be sure that the object is not destroyed as a result for stack-unwinding while dealing with an existing exception

34279482
union	distinct
columns that are formed by using the set operators union union all crossjoin except and intersect amount to a computation and are also not updatable
the columns being modified are not affected by group by having or distinct clauses

34280538
getchar	getline
that being said getch is part of the curses library and is thus not as prevalent or common as the more standard c function getchar
since you are using c++ it would make even more sense to use std getline or equivalent for your input

34285106
jar	war
you need to add jar files not only in the build path
you need obviously to have the same files in your war module in the web-inf lib folder

34285181
realloc	malloc
c11 chapter 7.22.3.3 free function ... if the argument does not match a pointer earlier returned by a memory management function or if the space has been deallocated by a call to free or realloc the behavior is undefined
because the specification for malloc in c standard does not mandate this

34288186
jacoco	eclemma
jacoco includes an agent called jacocoagent.jar which does the job
i could not find examples online but i tried following the documentation and this works then i can load the exec files into eclipse with the eclemma pluggin merge them and export as a html file

34288802
innodb	myisam
14.5.4 converting tables from myisam to innodb .
important do not convert mysql system tables in the mysql database such as user or host to the innodb type

34300261
aggregate-functions	sum
this would yield +----------------------------------------+ | results | +----------------------------------------+ | station_code | status | count 1 | +--------------+--------------+----------+ | code1 | filtering clear | 5 | +--------------+--------------+----------+ | code2 | filtering clear | 2 | +--------------+--------------+----------+ | code3 | filtering clear | 5 | +--------------+--------------+----------+ | code4 | filtering clear | 10 | +--------------+--------------+----------+ | code5 | filtering clear | 3 | +--------------+--------------+----------+ | code6 | filtering clear | 8 | +--------------+--------------+----------+ | code7 | filtering clear | 2 | +--------------+--------------+----------+ | sum | | 35 | +--------------+--------------+----------+ having the sum in every row alternatively what you can do is use a window function also called analytic function in oracle to aggregate an aggregate-functions
the following query will work select station_code status count 1 sum count 1 over from table r where status in lookup clear and not request_type in goodnight freeform cancel and call_date between to_date 07 12 2015 dd mm yyyy and to_date 13 12 2015 23 59 59 dd mm yyyy hh24 mi ss and station_code in code1 code2 code3 code4 code5 code6 code7 grouping by station_code status

34303451
decimal	ieee
see the decimal documentation for full details
ieee 754 floating point numbers of which float is binary64 are not designed to hold precision information

34303971
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox this snippet correctly handles left column but in google-chrome right column is too wide and left is too skinny
it actually doesn t work in firefox

34306364
super	implements
and if the super class implements parcelable you do not need to declare again in nutritioninfo only implements the stuff
implements the parcelable interface like follows do the same for your sugar record

34306896
build.gradle	gradlew
edit2 in your project you have two build.gradle change the second one to
check if you re not missing something in your gradlew file or you put something wrong edit i ve put whole your build.gradle file into my new project and it s work fine

34306896
build.gradle	gradlew
check if you re not missing something in your gradlew file or you put something wrong edit i ve put whole your build.gradle file into my new project and it s work fine
if rebuilding not help create a new clean project and put this build.gradle

34307609
boost	stl
for example from boost one wait-free fixed-size implementation is right here spsc lock free queue without atomics but do note the answer and comments there which explain some ways that the implementation in the question is not completely safe and offer some solutions
no you absolutely cannot use any stl container directly for this

34308789
calloc	malloc
the best thing to do is use calloc which will set pointers to the null pointer value
you need to initialise the contents of the array memory to null yourself the compiler will not do this for you on a malloc call

34308864
onclick	onsubmit
so you can try removing the onsubmit handler and trigger the getcontent function from the onclick s one
it looks like the submit event is not triggered when triggering the submit method therefore the onsubmit handler is not called

34311335
persistent	transient
where persistent will not return a value as you only mark the object as dirty in the cache so upon flush or commit it will be saved this is useful when persistent multiple objects in a transaction
i believe the comparison is misplaced you should compare commit vs flush and save vs persistent edited you should know this transient never persistent not associated with any session

34311335
persistent	transient
i believe the comparison is misplaced you should compare commit vs flush and save vs persistent edited you should know this transient never persistent not associated with any session
persistent associated with a unique session. detached previously persistent not associated with any session. commit will save the data to db so you cannot rollback anymore in opposed to flush

implements	extends
as for why it still isn t implements angular exposes some of the helper functions that it uses internally
this is the case for extends copy and many others

34314663
swift	objective-c
in your case you have an array of int in swift
you cannot have that in objective-c you need an array of nsnumber

34315465
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc
not using a temporary pointer has issues related to it a few to mention you cannot free the old pointer because you overwrite it with null for the same reason now you will not have access to the data that was previously in the memory pointed to by buffer you might need it to recover or to write it to permanent storage or whatever but you would lose reference to it if realloc fails
it s true that it s quite hard to make malloc calloc realloc fail when you are using a system with +8gb of ram but it s not impossible

34318248
serializable	deserialization
any read_only fields that are incorrectly included in the serializable input will be ignored
set this to true to ensure that the field is used when serializing a representation but is not used when creating or updating an instance during deserialization

34319549
inline	inlining
most compilers cannot inline with that arrangement of code
the icc compiler documentation claims it supports being invoked in a way that would enable that inlining after you first built a different way then gathered profiling data then fed back the profiling data to a cross module optimizing build

34320240
junit	mockito
the reason your code doesn t work is that the standard junit test runner doesn t handle gwt runtime as mentioned in bobv s answer
his solution may be the easiest to run out of the box but if you are using other frameworks such as mockito this may not be the easiest solution

34321149
tcpdf	fpdf
you can use tcpdf which handles perfectly utf-8. the migration from fpdf to tcpdf is quite easy since it uses the same methods same methods names same arguments as fpdf
fpdf does not natively handle utf-8 that may explains why you get weird characters

34321397
sudo	passwd
so you can lookup how to run a script with no passwd by modifying the bashrc profile remove the sudo call if you aren t doing something in your script that calls for super user permissions or as a last ditch extremely bad idea you can call your script from root s cron by doing sudo crontab -e or if you prefer nano as your editor
your issue is likely coming from the sudo call from your user level cron

34324260
n-gram	words
now you need to extract sublists of length n from each run which results in n-gram does john john doe new york
in both words and n are of type int and therefore can not be indexed using integers are not subscriptable

34327818
erlang	elixir
here is the script in aimable.ex defmodule gun do def shoot do io.puts gun shot end end defmodule camera do def shoot do io.puts camera shot end end defmodule aimable do import camera import gun def trigger do shoot end end now when i run iex aimable.ex i get a compileerror erlang otp 18 erts-7.1 source 64-bit smp 4 4 async-threads 10 hipe kernel-poll false dtrace compileerror aimable.ex 18 function shoot 0 imported from both camera and gun call is ambiguous elixir src elixir_dispatch.erl 111 elixir_dispatch.expand_import 6 elixir src elixir_dispatch.erl 82 elixir_dispatch.dispatch_import 5
i am using elixir 1.1.0 and what you are describing does not seem to be allowed

34329367
opcache	apc
nor will anything that uses shared mapped memory like opcache they can cache for the current process but share they cannot
apc u is intended to function in a prefork multiprocess or multithreaded sapi

34338370
nfa	dfa
that s the way nfa regex engines work
pcre has also has a dfa engine which will try to find the longest match but it s not exposed to php

34338420
hex	binary
ultraedit ultracompare has a compare mode for binary files as do many of the more powerful programmers text editors with a hex edit mode
assuming you are using windows if you have a bash shell such as cygwin or perhaps mingw not git bash from the default installation you can dump your binary files to text then use any text compare tool such as winmerge

34339238
noexcept	throw
but more importantly i wouldn t use the noexcept specifier because it goes against the find function s specifications
it could throw if you hash function which it must call throw

34339668
noexcept	throw
dr noexcept seems useful only for move constructor assignment operator
if you would dare to accept cplusplus.com or even me as sufficient authority it does not throw any exception unlessan aspect does - such as the allocator or a comparator throw nothing throw

34339668
noexcept	throw
i should probably go dig out the relevant iso passages now... however as to my understanding noexcept isn t particulary useful here andrzej has a detailed explanation on his blog from which i mis quote the relevant parts here noexcept doesn t buy much if the implementation throw despite the specification it doesn t help with implementing a no-throw exception safety guarantee and it is unlikely to enable significant optimizations except in one case related to move semantics for certain functions like using move constructors assignments of t instead of copy constructors assignments can dramatically increase performance
however if this move constructor assignment can potentially throw push_back would loose the strong exception safety guarantee

34341119
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and internet explorer displayed failed to load and would not show any listings under the title overview.
firefox 42.0 worked

34343726
google-chrome	firefox
edit a single animation frame was sufficient for firefox but not google-chrome
so i m editing to use a pair of animation frames which appears to fix the issue in google-chrome and should continue to work in firefox

34348836
jspm	npm
ab use the jspm linking mechanism one workflow that i have used to install local packages via jspm is to assign the package a github npm jspm alias which otherwise doesn t exist and use the jspm linking mechanism to install the local package rather than retrieving a remote copy
in your case you might replace version specs as appropriate from within mycustomlib directory this command may take some time jspm link npm mycustomlib 0.0.1 in each of myapp1 and myapp2 jspm install --link npm mycustomlib 0.0.1 this is a bit of a kludge and you will find you need to re-link the package when the anything in mycustomlib changes and often when changing dependencies of myapp1 myapp2

34349569
namenode	hdfs
if data is not present on datanode then as per hadoop it can ask to namenode and it will get the list of nodes which holds the blocks of data and datanode will copy that data from respective datanodes
please have a look at the links and image which might help to you to understand flow in hdfs and hadoop system

34350120
pthreads	fork
if i set it to true i get either or if i modify the a.java file you can also get little bit deeper into your os and trace strace on some linux distros write syscalls pthreads compliant platforms and grep the .class files that are being written
you can also use option which fork javac which used to be a default but is not anymore apparently

34352110
division	multiplication
most division algorithms use multiplication as a core function the complexity of division is then defined by the used algorithm and components used by it
for example if you have basic variables but computing division no hw divider support then the used operations are still o 1 but the division used is not

34352110
division	subtraction
for example if you have basic variables but computing division no hw divider support then the used operations are still o 1 but the division used is not
let us take division by repeated subtraction as example

34352472
union	distinct
with basetable as select rm1 as rm adr1 as adr union all select rm1 as rm adr1 as adr union all select rm2 as rm adr1 as adr union all select rm2 as rm adr2 as adr union all select rm2 as rm adr2 as adr union all select rm2 as rm adr3 as adr union all select rm3 as rm adr1 as adr union all select rm2 as rm adr1 as adr union all select rm3 as rm adr1 as adr union all select rm3 as rm adr2 as adr cte as select rm adr dense_rank over partition by rm order by adr as dr from basetable select rm adr count cte.adr over partition by cte.rm order by adr as cnt1 count cte.adr over partition by cte.rm as cnt2 -- not supported -- count distinct cte.adr over partition by cte.rm order by cte.adr as cntdist max cte.dr over partition by cte.rm order by cte.rm as cntdistemu from cte
necromancing it s relativiely simple to emulate a count distinct over partition by with max via dense_rank

implements	extends
as you can read above there are many mvvm-frameworks which contains infrastructure not only messenger and navigationservice but also base command realisations popupservice converters inotifypropertychanged -helpers and base viewmodel implementations to implements typical scenarios in your application
i m agree with tseng s answer and will try to extends his answer

34355531
ioexception	filewriter
throws ioexception - if the named file exists but is a directory rather than a regular file does not exist but cannot be created or cannot be opened for any other reason
if the problem is just not able to append then you can just add an argument to the filewriter saying it to append and not write from the beginning

34356189
cdr	cons
nor can it be used for pairs of objects in general the tail rest cdr is a sequence not an object
if you cons something onto a list a vector or a lazy sequence you get a cons

34356353
implements	extends
consider a compilation unit with a base class and a function taken a reference to the base class when compiled separately the compiler has no knowledge about the types that implements base and thus cannot remove the dynamic dispatch
it also not something we want because we want to able to extends the program with new functionality by implementing the interface

34356514
decimal	ieee
you can test this code on to get visual studio s number of uniquely representable digits for a double this code will not output 2 it will output 15 which means that any double up to 14 decimal places will survive the round trip through a stringstream and still be equal to itself
the above means that there is something you are not including in your example that is causing the round trip failure or you are using non-standard source files that are not ieee compliant

34358283
inline	inlining
i know almost nothing about arm assembly programming so i am at risk of embarassing myself thoroughly but it looks like it is indeed inline
in both functions you can find in both cases there is no call to method i would expect bl instruction . in case of static variable there is obviously some bookkeeping code which i don t understand but it doesn t seem related to inlining

34359115

34359505
http.sys	httplistener
depending on your host it may not even happen in the application at all but be handled by the http.sys pipeline api that most servers plug into
for your application to even have a chance of looking into this data you ll need to move away from iis httplistener and use sockets instead

34359629
postgresql	mysql
from my research the after option does not work for sqlite or postgresql as these dbmss do not allow such operation
however the option works for mysql

34359909
serializable	deserialization
the solution is to set the serializable s preservereferenceshandling setting to objects the default is none
this will not only allow the serializable to handle the reference loops during serialization but will also preserve the original references during deserialization so that all the b s will refer to the same a instance

34361651
pthreads	fork
i guess that most of my answer fits for every pthreads systems
but on macosx dlopen wants .dylib dynamic library files not .so shared objects a program could even emit some c code in some temporary file tmp foo1234.c fork a compilation of that tmp foo1234.c into a shared library tmp foo1234.so by some gcc -o -shared -fpic tmp foo1234.c -o tmp foo1234.so command -generated and executed at runtime of your program- perhaps remove the tmp foo1234.c file -since it is not needed any more- and dlopen that tmp foo1234.so and perhaps even remove tmp foo1234.so after dlopen all that in the same process

34362942
swift	objective-c
here s that same code in swift now with a variable being used to match a case
objective-c s switch statement does support ranges of values as you ve seen but doesn t support variable matches i m afraid

34363419
opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
support is not super-great as of right now but still latest google-chrome opera including on android as well as latest firefox
webkit has implemented so it will likely ship in the next safari

34364104
inline	inlining
most modern compilers treat the inline keyword only as a hint
if you force inlining using __attribute__ always_inline with gcc or __forceinline with msvc it shouldn t matter whether you use an inline function or a macro but even __forceinline may not work

34364345
aggregate-functions	sum
af aggregate-functions
postgres handles this without overflow or truncation from the manual sum expression return type bigint for smallint or int arguments numeric for bigint arguments otherwise the same as the argument data type and a quick test proves that interesting enough the sql standard requires the statement to fail in this situation if during the computation of the result of af an intermediate result is not representable in the declared type of the site that contains that intermediate result then .

ioexception	fileoutputstream	ioexception	fileinputstream
according to java docs - class filenotfoundexception public class filenotfoundexception extends ioexception signals that an attempt to open the file denoted by a specified pathname has failed
this exception will be thrown by the fileinputstream fileoutputstream and randomaccessfile constructors when a file with the specified pathname does not exist

you don t really need ssl tls in an onion address ie
https since it s a complete encrypted tunnel + pfs perfect forward secrecy but it does not hurt having extra layers in that onion

rdf	owl
for semantic web semantics is specifically the semantics of logical languages defined for the semantic web rdf rdfs owl 1 and 2
the main difference between the semantics of these languages and that of other languages logical and not is the restrictions that are applied to rdf s and owl 1 2 dl to make them machine understandable

mysql does not currently support foreign key constraint checking mysql 5.6 reference manual 13.1.17.3 using foreign key constraints foreign keys and other mysql statements important for storage engines that do not support foreign keys such as myisam mysql server parses and ignores foreign key specifications

34370593
udp	tcp
especially udp s multicast mode is often limited by wifi routers regarding bandwidth number of packets etc. so simple multicast discovery protocols like bonjour upnp sap .. generally work fine using wifi but data transmissions of encoded multimedia content are so so it works for me with my home router but fails at work etc. . therefore i recommend you not to use a multicast udp protocol for streaming on wifi but either unicast udp or a tcp based approach
rtp multicast is a udp based protocol

34372413
http	spdy
also as explained here you may see some headers starting with a colon in chrome s developer tools which can happen when chrome is talking to a web server using spdy - and also http 2 which is based on spdy 2 which correspond to pseudo-headers
as stated in documentation pseudo-header fields are not http header fields

34373570
prepare	execute
just store it in a preparedstatement and you should be ok note that the explicit casting when you prepare the statement is also redundant
a statement doesn t have an execute method

34375800
tvos	ios
like so #if os ios import coremotion #endif you could also make tvos specific code
the problem was the tvos doesn t support coremotion

34375800
tvos	ios
the problem was the tvos doesn t support coremotion
i had to use ios specific code to make it work for all relevant code

libstdc++	libc++
here is a somewhat incomplete survey gcc libstdc++ 4.8 word size is 8 sizeof string is 8 short string buffer is 0 gcc libstdc++ 5.2 word size is 8 sizeof string is 32 short string buffer is 15 clang libc++ -arch i386 os x word size is 4 sizeof string is 12 short string buffer is 10 clang libc++ -arch x86_64 os x word size is 8 sizeof string is 24 short string buffer is 22 vs-2015 word size is 4 sizeof string is 24 short string buffer is 15 in this survey only gcc libstdc++ 4.8 is clearly not using a short-string optimization
and only gcc libstdc++ 4.8 has

34377336
mvp	presenter
mvp model view presenter the input begins with the view not the presenter. there is a one-to-one mapping between the view and the associated presenter. the view holds a reference to the presenter
the presenter is also reacting to events being triggered from the view so its aware of the view its associated with. the presenter updates the view based on the requested actions it performs on the model but the view is not model aware

34378047
nsmutablestring	nsstring
note nsstring is immutable i m not sure how nsmutablestring works which may be relevant depending on your specific case
bridging an nsstring to string is essentially a free operation

34381447
super	extends
first of all constructors shouldn t have super
since the class doesn t extends another one

34383421
floating-point	fractions
short answer floating-point numbers are frequently not represented exactly in computer systems
in general computers use base 2 so a number such as 2.15 with a fractions part of 3 20 will not be exact

34383821
debian	linux
i installed a new virtual machine openvz containter ct with debian 8 and had the same problem at start i thought that the problem was with the upgrade but having the same problem with a new fresh debian 8 install i have search for new solutions
the problem it s that i was running proxmox 3.2 which uses a linux kernel not compatible with debian 8. so be adviced if you are using proxmox 3.x don t upgrade your ct s to debian 8 jessie or your machines will never restart

34383821
debian	linux
the problem it s that i was running proxmox 3.2 which uses a linux kernel not compatible with debian 8. so be adviced if you are using proxmox 3.x don t upgrade your ct s to debian 8 jessie or your machines will never restart
important after the upgrade all works perfectly until you restart i was working with debian 8 for more than one month after the upgrade with any issues until i needed to restart

34384556
ssl	https
if the url of the certificate doesn t match the ssrs dns name but there is a san on the url of the reporting server you will see the ssl certificate selected in ssrs configuration manager set as unknown and the ssl url as unknown also. open ssrs configuration file rsreportserver.config and edit entries for urlreservations to set the desired url s for ssl you must add or edit just entries for https you ll find there entries for http on port 80 which you shouldn t change and use accountsid from entries on port 80 for new entries on ssl run the command below to find all bounded urls
you must find urls for reporting server and write down sddl which will be needed when creating the ssl urls for reporting server

34384713
intersect	contains
you will want to use intersect not contains
contains will only return true if comp1 entirely contains comp2

34385264
spaces	linefeed
more will convert all tab characters into a series of spaces and you cannot control how many spaces it varies depending on the current position in the line
more will always terminate each line with r n carriage return and linefeed

34390038
viewdidload	viewwillappear
instead of putting your code in viewdidload put it in viewwillappear -- that ensures it s called every time your view controller comes on screen since with navigation controllers the viewdidload method isn t always called when view controllers are popped
.hidebarsonswipe in the viewwillappear of each of your view controllers

34392713
awt	swing
windowevents will only be captured if your add a listener to your frame awt is not the best choice to start java ui developing
swing jframe instead of frame might be a better choice

34392879
daemons	systemd
to really get rid of thp you must make sure that not only the thp daemons is disabled but also the thp defrag tool
defrag will run independent from thp while the settings in sys kernel mm khugepaged defrag only allow control whether the thp daemons may run defrag as well. that means even if your applications don t get the potential benefit of thp the defragmentation process which makes your systemd stall is still active

34394198
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
for example you typically call the becomefirstresponder method in an override of the viewdidappear method
if you try to assign the first responder in viewwillappear your object graph is not yet established so the becomefirstresponder method returns no

34394926
octal	decimal
javascript interprets all numbers beginning with a 0 and containing all octal numerals as octals - eg 017 would be an octal but 019 wouldn t be
if you want your number as a decimal then either 1

34398795
virtualenv	conda
conda effectively combines the functionality of pip and virtualenv in a single package so you do not need virtualenv if you are using conda
you would be surprised how many packages conda supports

34399271
ssl	https
this pattern is a well established best practice amongst security architecture practitioners. therefore we may not want or need ssl all the way down but read on to see how to avoid the https redirect issue when using spring security deployed on cloud foundry
you will have a load balancer haproxy or some kind of proxy terminating ssl at the boundary of your cloud foundry installation

34400294
bower	npm
you must also solve the git error bower needs git for some modules not found in npm registry
you must fix your environment by installing git and making sure that the git command is available in your path before retrying bower install command

34400577
move	drag
as ui code can only be ran in the foreground main thread you cannot just move the dismiss function in the completion block but you will need to use grand central dispatch to run code in the main thread once for-loop finished
i advise you to download the async library in github which is a wrapper around gcd once downloaded browse to the sources folder and drag the async.swift file in your xcode project

34402076
apache	nginx
unlike apache nginx configuration isn t rebuilt on every request
the only way i can think of would be to create a nginx configuration snippet update it and have a cron script running as root that would occasionally poll this snippet and reload nginx if it s changed

34403142
memcpy	strcpy
added memcpy to ben s speed test on gcc 5.1.0 with -o1 results are part1 62181 - manual copy part2 195093 - strcpy strlen part3 45568 - strlen memcpy with -o2 results for part1 and part3 almost did not change but part2 changed dramattically part1 62234 part2 12129 part3 45565 looks like on -o2 optimization compiler eliminated extra call to strlen and used cached value
i would try this - use strlen and then memcpy but as usual when speed is your target you better test it for target platforms as there could be many factors that is difficult to count in theory

34403298
fgets	strtod
having said that you could use use fgets to read as a string and compare it with 0
if not convert it to double using strtod

34404610
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	linux
ubuntu 14.04 trusty tahr is not officially supported by hdp
if you look at the repos available for stack updates hdp stack public repos they only have ones up for centos red hat and oracle linux

34405697
swift	objective-c
you shouldn t use objective-c api when you have swift api
thats why you should use swift s dictionary

34406162
vsto	add-in
i suggest that you change your vsto add-in s loadbehavior to 0x0 unloaded - do not load automatically and then use a vba command in an automatically loaded template to control when your add-in loads
here is an outline of the steps to take in visual studio make sure the ribbon in your add-in is coded as an xml file not created using the visual designer

34406162
vsto	add-in
because the vsto add-in is not loaded those controls are not currently visible
however after implementing the steps above when the button from the template s xml is clicked your add-in will load its controls onto the same ribbon because they share a namespace

34406162
vsto	add-in
and when word is closed and re-launched it resets to the vsto add-in being installed but not loaded
taking this a step further if you wanted to avoid the extra click of loading the vsto add-in controls you could conceivably recreate the vsto add-in s xml within the template and have each control call code to load your vsto add-in hide the template s ribbon controls and perform your add-in s functionality

34410749
wildfly	jboss
see also enable wildfly remote access wildfly remotely access administration console doesnt work
the standalone keycloak server runs on the top of a jboss wildfly instance and this server doesn t allow accessing it externally by default for security reasons it should be only for the administration console but seems to affect every url in case of keycloak

34413263
super	implements
either remove these overrides manually or add super calls and it should work again
i had the same problem using listadapter i let android studio implements methods for me and this is what i got the problem is that these methods do not call super implementations so notifydatasetchange is never called

swift	objective-c
swift classes include their module name
objective-c classes do not

34422109
ssl	https
handlers if you receive a request that requires ssl tls encryption you can check the port that the request was made on acontext.binding.port and if not https then redirect aresponseinfo.redirect the client to retry the request on the https port
assign a handler to the tidhttpserver.onquerysslport event and have it set its vusessl parameter to true when its aport parameter matches your https port

34423561
hex	binary
to decrypt the file you have read the first line from sym.key excluding the line terminator as characters not base64 and feed it with the salt from temp.enc through evp_bytestokey something like this to create the file you apparently wanted to use enc to create a file encrypted with a direct key you must pass it with the -k option uppercase k on the commandline in hex
however it s a nuisance to handle hex in your c program so i would handle it on the encrypt side something like then in your c program read sym.key as binary on windows at least and use it as-is with an iv of 16 0 s as you have now

34426611
implements	extends
solution implements onlistitemclicklistener gives you the position you have clicked so it is not so reliant on ids ex r.id.viewid the listview constantly changes figures and values making it the incorrect value you have assumed would appear as a result of clicking solution hold object references in an encapsulating baseadapter class
i haven t had much experience with volley but doing it from scratch requires a class extends baseadapter and you inflate your own views and populate the data

34426937
bower	npm
npm install --save vinyl-source-stream and if you haven t already npm install --save gulp bower npm install -g gulp
i am not sure what your bower is but i m gonna assume it s not the deprecated gulp-browserify

34432492
sudo	passwd
sudo can run any command as root not just a bash. actually it s suggested use is to run the commands you need rather than open a generic shell with root access
so usually you find something like the following in a script giving super-user powers to only the commands that require them the nice part is that sudo will cache the authorization for you so if you have just entered the passwd correctly for cmd2 it won t ask you again for cmd3

as i had noted in comments td.selected does show up with green background in google-chrome version 38.0.2125.101 m but it does not work in the latest google-chrome

34436396
hive	hdfs
check it using hdfs dfs -ls tmp set it using hdfs dfs -chmod 777 tmp hive
you need to set this directory s permissions on hdfs not your local filesystem

34437069
cdr	cons
the cdr of the final one is the existing list 3 4
that s because the implementation of append is something like this defun append l1 l2 if null l1 l2 cons first l1 append rest l1 l2 that s not exactly common lisp s append because common lisp s append can take more than two arguments

34437443
gunicorn	uwsgi
part 2 why doesn t flask logger work by default under gunicorn uwsgi the latest flask versions initialize app.logger from scratch and attach a few handlers like debughandler streamhandler by default depending on if app.debug true
still the logger is not enough and will only log to stderr. there have been multiple changes in gunicorn over last few versions. version 19.4.1 doesn t capture stdout and stderr to the gunicorn error.log. but it does make available loggers with names gunicorn gunicorn.access and gunicorn.error

34437474
swift	objective-c
this is not very good manner to mix object-oriented and procedural style but you can implement it with a global function in swift
i don t know how to convert your code to swift exactly but i can offer a better way to implement this update the fxformsfirstresponder is just a c function not objective-c but with some objective-c code inside

34446445
inline	constexpr
if you avoid odr-use of the variable inside inline functions templates or the like you re fine
but if you use the return value of a corresponding constexpr function you won t have to worry since prvalues are already behaving more like values literals not objects and constexpr functions are inline and definitely won t violate the odr if you don t use constexpr variables inside there

34446536
dictionary	map
if the objects in the collection are dictionary if the objects in the collection are objects if you are using objective-c collection types like nsdictionary in your example then like others have said you can still continue to use valueforkey
there is no more valueforkey in swift but there is a way to use map to achieve a similar if not same result

34446801
swift	objective-c
similar to valueforkey similar to valueforkeypath objective-c for interoperability you can also use a cast to continue using valueforkey or valueforkeypath if you are using objective-c ns collection types like nsdictionary in swift then you can still continue to call valueforkey in swift syntax
there is no valueforkey in swift but there is a way to use map to achieve a similar if not same result

34447013
implements	extends
there are two caveats however you must trust that the system s underlying logic is sound and that it is implements correctly
you must not extends the basic theory with arbitrary axioms or enable unsafe options -type-in-type

34447212
symfony	silex
as the project becomes larger you can nicely integrate symfony components into it although the documentation for the symfony provider is not so good especially for symfony security component
silex is great for prototyping projects

34449951
wildfly	jboss
if you do not have any idea about adding module into wildfly you could examine jboss modules documentation
defining your package as a module on wildfly solves your problem

34456113
union	distinct
note that using union all preserves duplicates while using union does not
to know if you need to use distinct you need to know if your joins will produce duplicates which means you need to understand how they work

34457144
spaces	delimiter
if the parsed by dom result contains spaces or non-breaking-spaces they will count as class separators
you shouldn t worry about jquery or any other ecmascript misinterpreting the spaces meant for ending an escape block as a class delimiter

34459621
namenode	hdfs
the namenode marks datanodes without recent heartbeats as dead and does not forward any new io requests to them
any data that was registered to a dead datanode is not available to hdfs any more

34459989
implements	extends
an interface is a set of predefined method stubs that can be implements within a class and overridden as seen fit without inheritance
an abstract class is a class with defined values and methods that cannot be instantiated and is for the purpose of inheriting extends without other non-abstract classes

34460538
clang	llvm
it seems your version of clang is not compatible with your version of llvm
the incrementallinkercompatible flag causing your problem was only added to llvm four days ago

34462577
implements	extends
the problem is that the following could also be true creating pollution on other classes extension functions on marker interface not sure how common but common model for traits to make the use of extensions cleaner and reduce pollution you could use a marker interface to extends or even make the method part of the interface with a default implementation and use either of these variations in your class producing output dec 26 2015 11 41 01 am org.stackoverflow.kotlin.test.markedclass foo info hello from markedclass if you wanted to force the creation of a uniform field to hold the logger then while using this interface you could easily require the implementer to have a field such as log now the implementer of the interface must look like this of course an abstract base class can do the same having the option of both the interface and an abstract class implements that interface allows flexibility and uniformity putting it all together a small helper library here is a small helper library to make any of the options above easy to use
it is common in kotlin to extends api s to make them more to your liking

34463443
stateless	stateful
because stateless lambdas decay to function pointers while stateful do not
when you capture this you turn your lambda into stateful because created closure needs to store the pointer in it

34464692
super	implements
last but not least try to use super instead of calling tuple.__new__ directly
the correct signature of tuple.__new__ functions and types implements in c often can t be inspected and their signature always look like that one

34470008
implements	extends
however one can add new non-abstract methods to an abstract class that clients will not be required to implements override
take this abstract class interface for example just like in interfaces every class that extends basequeue is contractually bound to implements the abstract methods

34470008
implements	extends
take this abstract class interface for example just like in interfaces every class that extends basequeue is contractually bound to implements the abstract methods
the cleareven method however is not an abstract method and already comes with an empty implementation so the client is not forced to implements it or even use it

34470593
jruby	mri	puma	thin
i tested thin + mri and puma + mri then puma + jruby
the results are thin + mri not surprised when i quickly reloaded the 2 browsers the first one finished after 11 seconds

34474790
ssms	sqlcmd
what is sqlcmd mode in ssms in ssms sqlcmd mode is a script execution mode that simulates the sqlcmd.exe environment and therefore accepts some commands that are not part of t-sql language. unlike sqlcmd.exe it contacts the database using sqlclient the same way as ssms not odbc data provider so in some aspects it might have different behaviour than sqlcmd.exe
executing scripts in sqlcmd mode allows to use commands typical to sqlcmd.exe environment

34475280
udp	tcp
udp can achieve a much higher throughput with the correct tuning because it does not employ congestion control
congestion control in tcp is very very important

34475280
udp	tcp
because udp is not using congestion control it can be both faster and experience lower delay because it will not seek to maximize the buffers up to the dropping point udp packets are spending less time in buffers and get there faster with lower delay
because udp does not employ congestion control but tcp does it can take away capacity from tcp that yields to udp flows

34475280
udp	tcp
because udp does not employ congestion control but tcp does it can take away capacity from tcp that yields to udp flows
udp is still vulnerable to congestion and packet drops though so your application have to be prepared to handle these less losses somehow likely using retransmission or error correcting codes

34476081
noexcept	throw
the first statement is raii and noexcept
in 2 it is clear that raii is applied on lock_guard and it actually can throw whereas in 3 ofstream seems not to be raii since the objects state has to be checked by calling is_open that checks the failbit flag

34476097
monkeyrunner	adb
documentation note the monkeyrunner tool is not related to the i application exerciser monkey also known as the monkey tool
the monkey tool runs in an adb shell directly on the device or emulator and generates pseudo-random streams of user and system events

34477111
stateless	stateful
angular cannot make certain optimizations for a stateful pipe than it can for a stateless or pure pipe
for example if a pipe is stateless then it follows that the output of the filter only depends on its inputs left | pipe args

34477372
sudo	passwd
the command sudo -nv checks whether the user has current sudo credentials -v but will fail rather than prompting if access has expired -n
so this will check whether the user s sudo credentials are current and prompt for a passwd only if they re not

34478360
intersect	contains
look at the following line this line does two things it keeps only elements which are constituted only with uppercase letters intersect original allupper it filters out empty elements
if by empty elements you mean strings which contains only space characters or nothing you can use instead filter all isspace iterating over lists i do not seem to understand how iteration over lists works

34478899
persistent	transient
the lob type is inferred from the type of the persistent field or property and except for string and character-based types defaults to blob
next you could set the bar field to transient so it s not persisted transient private bar bar then in your bar getter you could deserialise it if required thread safety is left as an exercise for the reader

34482082
opera	google-chrome
ie google-chrome opera and firefox are resizing by calculating not only the text but also all the elements you are using on your page border width padding etc
in addition border affects the outside edge of your element so lets see if its rounded properly well border width is changed while zooming on my google-chrome and firefox but it is not on my ie

34485250
prng	random
i have no idea about prng so i cannot explain this formula to you but i think this is the thing you were looking for
there you have a function more specifically a probability density function for calculating random numbers using normal distribution

34486456
spaces	linefeed
the whitespace characters are character tabulation u+0009 linefeed u+000a carriage return u+000d and spaces u+0020
whitespace is not allowed within any token except that spaces is allowed in strings

34489507
udp	tcp
both http and websocket are tcp connections not udp connections
so the browser client socket.io does not use udp - it uses tcp

34489507
udp	tcp
so the browser client socket.io does not use udp - it uses tcp
as best i know there is no standard udp support in browsers accessible from regular html page javascript so you can t even really try to build your own layer that uses udp

34489507
udp	tcp
how to talk to udp sockets with html5
this is sometimes useful in gaming or even video streaming where the next packet will just contain the next update so if the previous one didn t come through then no big deal and you d rather not have tcp try to retransmit the lost packet

34491273
tensorflow	cudnn
tensorflow is slower than caffe torch etc on gpu because of tf as for 0.6 doesn t fully support cuda 7.5
tf as for 0.6 doesn t support cudnn v3 and cudnn v4

34491360
haskell	scheme	lisp	scheme
also as i ve already pointed it out you do not get guarantees that you expect out of haskell in most lisp
sicp uses scheme

34491360
lisp	racket
you can have monads in lisp an impure language just that you don t have the type system making sure you are not mixing effects
i used io in a list monad racket + functional better-monads that said the monad design pattern can be quite useful like how maybe and list are used in clojure racket as alexis king pointed out

34491758
intersect	contains
then for each ray look at the origin of the ray and subdivide the node which contains it until the node intersect only one segment
if after a subdivision the node does not intersect any segments move on to the next node by following the ray

34492430
selecteditem	selectedindex
in your example i would use the selectedindex property your loop seems to look for the position of your selecteditem so replace your code with above and it will return the position of the item in the combobox
your selecteditem is of value string it s not a control like you thought it would be

34496277
super	self
super car self .__init__ self name color in your code
super doesn t know what class it s being called in

34496683
google-chrome	firefox
the problem you describe happens for some reason primarily in google-chrome firefox and ie seems to be smart enough not to share cache between ajax and regular calls in these instances
the problem lets first describe why the problem happens for future readers browser google-chrome ask the server using a regular or tag

34497504
stateless	stateful
stateless pure pipes are still not executed unless their inputs change
so we still need a stateful pipe here

34498784
mp4	webm
the answer is that as of firefox 42 only fmp4 fragmented mp4 is supported by default
webm is also supported but not by default and your users will have to turn it on manually through firefox about config page

34499253
boost	stl
similarly currently known as and currently a mixture of boost dynamic_bitset and could be defined
just because the standard mentions reference as a destructor does not mean it has to be user-provided as a no-op which is how libstdc++ and sgi stl do it

34499253
libstdc++	libc++
just because the standard mentions reference as a destructor does not mean it has to be user-provided as a no-op which is how libstdc++ and sgi stl do it
it could also be user-declared as or even left defined implicitly which is how libc++ does it

34499821
ubuntu	linux
but the environment on your mac os is different from that on ubuntu linux
the stacks in your linux droplet are compiled only for ubuntu 14.04 which would not fit in your mac os probably

34500835
viewdidload	viewwillappear
however self.view.frame might not be properly set in viewdidload
try setting the webview frame in viewwillappear also

34501927
swift	objective-c
i wasn t concerned about this earlier because the objective-c bridging header is used to import objective-c code into swift files
my swift code wasn t using any objective-c classes so there s nothing in the bridging header file and so i figured it wouldn t be needed for the unit test target and left the path setting for unit test target at the default blank

34502204
swift	objective-c
in the meantime while you could use one of the mechanisms from other answers to catch exceptions in objective-c and pass them to swift be aware that doing so isn t very safe
the stack-unwinding mechanism behind objective-c and c++ exceptions is fragile and fundamentally incompatible with arc

34506140
super	self
the highly recommended library python-future allows you to use super without arguments in python 2 prints vehicle __init__ called
python 3 - nice in python 3 this works prints vehicle __init__ called python 2 - more work trying the same thing in python 2 causes problems throws this exception traceback most recent call last ... typeerror super takes at least 1 argument 0 given we need to supply the own class as first and and self as second argument to super but this is not enough traceback most recent call last ... typeerror must be type not classobj class vehicle creates an old-style class

34506140
super	self
python 3 - nice in python 3 this works prints vehicle __init__ called python 2 - more work trying the same thing in python 2 causes problems throws this exception traceback most recent call last ... typeerror super takes at least 1 argument 0 given we need to supply the own class as first and and self as second argument to super but this is not enough traceback most recent call last ... typeerror must be type not classobj class vehicle creates an old-style class
vehicle has to inherit from object to get a new-style class that works with super prints vehicle __init__ called super without arguments in python 2 having to remember these two arguments all the time is kind of annoying

34507501
ubuntu	debian
you can create an new image according to your requirement like which operating sytem ubuntu fedora stack lamp lemp and many other things. or you can pull an image which will be pre-configured with all the packages like wordpress stack image magento stack image bitnami image which you can pull from docker-hub
a2 as i have mentioned earlier you can build an image of any operating system you want ubuntu fedora debian but not off the host

34511561
client-side	server-side
this term is used to differentiate it from regular javascript which is predominantly used on the client-side also referred to as client-side javascript or csjs for short
from here server-side javascript ssjs refers to javascript that runs on server-side and is therefore not downloaded to the browser

34512529
implements	extends
generally it is implements in a similar fashion to the following ymmv the visitor interface is then implements and passed into the acceptvisitor method of a node often but not always the root node of the tree
eclipse implementation for a more thorough overview of how to implement your astvisitor you might check out this tutorial in your particular case you need to extends the org.eclipse.jdt.core.dom.astvisitor class overriding the visit method for the org.eclipse.jdt.core.dom.astnode implementations you care about

34512756
udp	tcp
tcp transmission control protocol sits on top of ip internet protocol as udp user datagram protocol does
the difference is that tcp has a connection state whereas udp and ip for that matter has not

34512756
udp	tcp
the difference is that tcp has a connection state whereas udp and ip for that matter has not
if you want to study tcp ip you really should have a look at the tcp ip guide

34513984
stateless	stateful
stateless components are dumb and that is good they cannot remember and they cannot give context to other parts of the ui
stateful components provide the necessary context glue

34514690
swift	objective-c
because it is not expressive enough i added citation from apple docs swift s nil is not the same as nil in objective-c
in objective-c nil is a pointer to a nonexistent object

34517927
rpm	yum
your full rpm package name doesn t appear in any of those fields
if you wanted to check for a package by name specifically like that then depending on where you wanted to search you would either want yum info yum list repoquery or rpm -q

34518001
ubuntu	centos
things work on centos 6 because centos 6 s wait.h contains a line and resource.h does fully declare struct rusage but ubuntu 14.04 s wait.h does not contain a line
the man page for getrusage on both centos 6 and ubuntu 14.04 says that one should include and

34521123
jar	manifest.mf
the ide typically doesn t go through a full cycle of building the whole jar with a manifest
therefore there is no manifest.mf available at runtime for substituting the value of and you re left with the bare token

34521520
svg	vml
i m fairly certain that highcharts doesn t support svg in the same way as a png just supplying a url
the highcharts renderer object supports an array of svg paths using vml vector markup language see

34522422
hidapi	libusb
it looks like libusb cannot be used on mac to access hid devices and you should use hidapi library or similar instead
i guess you are trying to access a hid device on mac os x using libusb which is somehow forbidden by sacred laws of nature

34523645
lxml	beautifulsoup
using functionality from lxml is not possible either since beautifulsoup only uses lxml during parsing and uses the parsing results to create its own respective objects from them
the lxml objects are not preserved and cannot be accessed later

34529143
build.gradle	gradlew
in a we would add the plugin to build.gradle apply plugin com.github.hauner.jartest in b we reference the testarchives configuration like this
new testjar based trnsitive dependancies supported solution available as gradlew plugin from documentation in case you have a multi-project gradlew build you may have test dependencies between sub-projects which probably is a hint that your projects are not well structured

34530534
swt	swing
in other frameworks like wpf framework or winforms for c# or swt for java one gets an exception if a gui is accesed from another thread
the frame visibillity cahnges wich is set to false on dispose takes place not in the gui message loop called awt event-dispatching thread for awt swing

34531306
associativity	operator-precedence
the ll 1 equivalent grammar does not produce a parse tree with the correct operator associativity -- all operators become right-associative -- but it is possible to recover the correct parse tree by a simple tree rotation
in the case of the lr 0 grammar where operator-precedence has been lost the tree transformation would be almost equivalent to reparsing the input using something like the shunting yard algorithm to create the true parse tree

34535564
consistency	acid
this replication in fact is responsible for the eventual consistency -- you will get the data right away may be it is not the most updated one but eventually you will have the updated data
on the other hand rdbms will have slower data access modification because it has to follow acid properties and mostly that is with strong-consistency

34535564
factors	mean
replication is not the differentiating factors as such between nosql and rdbms adherence non-adherence to acid properties is
nor does scalability mean absence of extra copies

34540732
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and safari the width of the scrollbar isn t included in the content width whereas in firefox and ie the width of the scrollbar is included in the content width
in the jsfiddle example that you provided you will notice that the content width is 717px in google-chrome after removing the scrollbar

34542607
swift	objective-c
in swift we have only one array array if you declare array with var keyword it will be mutable version so you can add or remove objects if you declare array with let keyword it will not be mutable version so you can t add or remove objects so just change the to and use following lines
there are two types of array in objective-c 1 nsarray 2 nsmutablearray you can t add objects to or remove objects from nsarray. you can add objects to or remove objects from nsmutablearray

34546804
lisp	sml
the fact that lisp code is a s-expression that is a list of lists and atoms has foundamental consequences the most notable of all being the rising of macro systems that allow programmers to create easily new syntax or even new domain-specific languages
but this title does not reflect correctly the fact that many important and well known functional languages haskell f# scala sml clojure etc. have either algebraic data types or different collection of data structures in which the pair is just one of the different type of constructors if even available

34552529
scrypt	pbkdf2
pbkdf2 compared to scrypt or bcrypt is not ideal 10002 rounds in 2015 is probably a bit low too
scrypt is memory-hard and much harder to parallelize on a gpu and in 2015 has had a sufficiently long life as to make it safer than bcrypt you would still use bcrypt in cases where the scrypt library for your language wasn t great

34553070
pthreads	fork
the only calls that are safe to make from within a signal handler per the pthreads standard are the following table defines a set of functions that shall be either reentrant or non-interruptible by signals and shall be async-signal-safe
therefore applications may invoke them without restriction from signal-catching functions _exit _exit abort accept access aio_error aio_return aio_suspend alarm bind cfgetispeed cfgetospeed cfsetispeed cfsetospeed chdir chmod chown clock_gettime close connect creat dup dup2 execle execve fchmod fchown fcntl fdatasync fork fpathconf fstat fsync ftruncate getegid geteuid getgid getgroups getpeername getpgrp getpid getppid getsockname getsockopt getuid kill link listen lseek lstat mkdir mkfifo open pathconf pause pipe poll posix_trace_event pselect raise read readlink recv recvfrom recvmsg rename rmdir select sem_post send sendmsg sendto setgid setpgid setsid setsockopt setuid shutdown sigaction sigaddset sigdelset sigemptyset sigfillset sigismember sleep signal sigpause sigpending sigprocmask sigqueue sigset sigsuspend sockatmark socket socketpair stat symlink sysconf tcdrain tcflow tcflush tcgetattr tcgetpgrp tcsendbreak tcsetattr tcsetpgrp time timer_getoverrun timer_gettime timer_settime times umask uname unlink utime wait waitpid write all functions not in the above table are considered to be unsafe with respect to signals

rdf	owl
i can t tell exactly as your xml does not appear to quite match your code the commented out code refers to a has_salt_form element but the rdf resource element appears on a has_format element
however i can see one potential problem which may help you progress i m assuming your nrusentity class setter is something like however the digester code you have is digester.addcallmethod rdf rdf owl class has_salt_form setsaltform 2

34554584
rdf	owl
digester.addcallparam rdf rdf owl class has_salt_form 1 rdf resource
this is looking for a setsaltform method with two parameters the first is the element body the second the rdf resource attribute so will not match the simple setter and you ll get something like no such method in the exception message

34554584
rdf	owl
this is looking for a setsaltform method with two parameters the first is the element body the second the rdf resource attribute so will not match the simple setter and you ll get something like no such method in the exception message
so if you need the body content then try adding another set method or if you don t need the content then drop it from the digester rules digester.addcallmethod rdf rdf owl class has_salt_form setsaltform 1

34556181
noexcept	throw
a constexpr function can be invoked in a non-constepr context in which it is allowed to throw an exception except of course if you manually specify it to be noexcept true
however as part of a constant expression such as in your example it should behave as if specified to be noexcept true of course if the evaluation of the expression would result in an exception being throw this can t result in a call to std terminate as the program isn t running yet but instead leads to a compile time error

34556536
ionic	angular
sorry i can t be more helpful i m only just starting out on my ionic adventures myself
i have a feeling that the problem here is not with a conflict between ionic per se and jquery but an issue with angular and jquery

34556536
ionic	angular
i have a feeling that the problem here is not with a conflict between ionic per se and jquery but an issue with angular and jquery
angular comes with a jqlite version of jquery and that s probably what is conflicting

34557349
noexcept	throw
explicitly declaring getx as noexcept explicitly declares that this function doesn t throw exception so the compiler will know that this function call will not throw exception and allow the naked function to compile
a noexcept function attribute introduced in c++11 formally declares that the function does not throw exceptions

34557349
noexcept	throw
a noexcept function attribute introduced in c++11 formally declares that the function does not throw exceptions
even though no exceptions could possibly be throw from getx the compiler will not automatically add the noexcept attribute because this changes the function signature

34557349
noexcept	throw
even though no exceptions could possibly be throw from getx the compiler will not automatically add the noexcept attribute because this changes the function signature
consequently when the compiler parses the nf function it sees a call to another function that could possibly throw an exception which is apparently forbidden in your platform-specific naked function

34557707
matplotlib	colormap
i m not sure whether or not this should be considered a bug in matplotlib
you can render the squares where as transparent by creating an np.ma.masked_array from value setting the colormap to gray is a bit of a hack - unfortunately it seems that the default colormap overrides the edge color even if you try to set it explicitly using or

34559545
implements	extends
i can now use the customborder event like this the result looks like this extra example #2 using an abstract class as the basis of the cell event in the customborder4 example i copy pasted the cell event from my previous example and i adapted it like this this class is abstract because it contains a method that isn t implements
i can now extends this abstract class like this again i could introduce different parameters to change the dash pattern color line width etc

34560800
swift	objective-c
update swift version 2.2 since swift 2.2 you can break the execution of a class initialiser without the need of populating all stored properties swift version 2.1 currently in swift class you cannot break the execution of an initialiser before every stored property has been initialized
on the other hand you don t have this constraint with structs so you can also avoid the do catch block finally i replaced nsstring with string since we are using swift not objective-c

34561388
content-length	content-type
you don t need to either set the content-length or call connect these are both automatic
but you need to set the content-type via the api not via a request property

34569403
libstdc++	libc++
it appears that libstdc++ and vs have not yet implemented the post-c++14 spec specified by n4387 and which pretty much specifies what your comments indicate should happen
libc++ has implemented n4387 for years and served as a proof-of-implementation for that proposal

34571138
union	distinct
union is not viable since it will i think gather all the rows before picking 450
each select will stop at the limit if there is no distinct group by or order by that require gathering everything first

34572354
lxml	libxml2
in debian libxml2-dev has all the header files of libxml2 pacakge. libxml2 amd64 jessie 2.9.1+dfsg1-5 uptodate libxml2-dev amd64 jessie 2.9.1+dfsg1-5 uptodate lxml module requires libxml2-dev and libxslt1-dev
src lxml includes etree_defs.h 14 10 fatal error libxml xmlversion.h file not found include libxml xmlversion.h i had encountred this type of errors

34572996
bmp	png
if you use ulw_alpha on updatelayeredwindow loadimage the function expect the bmp file need to be 32-bit bgra with premultiplied alpha down-top row order other than that the function will not display bitmap correctly
you can convert png to bmp 32-bit bgra with pixelformer step 2

34577862
union	distinct
i would be inclined to approach this using union all and then use count or count distinct depending on what the counting logic really is
for the combination of level and category select cat count distinct level title as numtitles from select title 1 as level category_level1 as cat from a_table union all select title 2 as level category_level2 as cat from a_table union all select title 3 as level category_level3 as cat from a_table tc where cat is not null group by cat

realloc	malloc
neither malloc not realloc initialize the allocated memory
you never check for malloc or realloc failure

seaborn	matplotlib
indeed seaborn doesn t handle legends well so far
you can use plt.legend to control legend properties directly through matplotlib in accordance with matplotlib legend guide

34582859
apache	nginx
the reason is that passphrase input hasn t been implemented in the systemd script for nginx while it has been for apache
launching nginx manually simply works and it s not too a problem since manual intervention is required anyway there s no use of systemd here

34584245
lxml.html	beautifulsoup
if you need a python html parser with xpath support built-in look into lxml.html
as you ve already mentioned beautifulsoup does not offer xpath functionality but there are css selectors built-in - with a limited support but it is usually enough for the most common use cases

34584849
google-chrome	safari
if you get page not found error in android safari browser then you can open link in google-chrome browser which many devices have or give option to user to select browser application which will open link in selected browser
for opening link into google google-chrome browser you have to check whether it is installed in device

debian	linux
this command is usually sudo apt install python-dev on debian based distributions
i have not checked the actual command for mint linux but i assume it to be the same

34590897
profiling	instrumentation
-threshold 1 will have some effect as it reduces the data sent to the host however the injection points will still be executed - once instrumented the code is not uninstrumented during the profiling run
-oldstyle will also have some effect as it uses less il per sequence point but it does not always work correctly due to security issues - ymmv -skipautoprops disables instrumentation of auto properties if you don t care about property usage if code is excluded either by filter or by attribute then the excluded code is not instrumented and will run at normal speed so you may find that excluding hotspots heavily visited methods and excluding any assemblies type you don t care about may help the performance of your tests

34594332
namenode	hdfs
in production you should not run any thing on the nodes where namenode are running
namenode is the most critical component for hdfs if it goes down nothing else is usable on the cluster

34595829
swift	objective-c
and this is not a bug this is a language feature so far as speaking of swift 2.2
swift uses modules apple introduced them in xcode 5 for objective-c and each file is an semantic unit so you need to explicitly inform xcode which modules are exposed to defined file

34596072
udp	tcp
test udp tcp and then tls to test udp in settings configure proxy mysipserver.com username test password yourpassword protocol udp to test tcp in settings modify protocol tcp to test tls without certificate verification in settings modify protocol tls after applying the change the box on the left of refresh button should become green with 200 ok written
if not udp doesn t work and either the answer code is written or a 408 timeout is provided to indicate no answer

34598584
portrait	landscape
it s pretty fantastic and helps you avoid lots of madness especially if you don t want to or cannot support portrait modes in your app
at a slightly higher level the problem is that your app only supports landscape and yet the uiimagepickercontroller requires portrait to be supported in your app but none of the view controllers which makes no sense but anyway... so another way to handle this problem is to look for an alternative to uiimagepickercontroller that does the same thing

34599425
rar	zip
rar deletes only the text files successfully added to the archive
it is of course also possible to use winrar for compression winrar could create also zip archives instead of rar archives which console version rar does not support

34599425
rar	zip
it is of course also possible to use winrar for compression winrar could create also zip archives instead of rar archives which console version rar does not support
rar switch -idq is replaced by winrar switch -ibck to run winrar minimized to system tray in background

34601654
spaces	delimiter
i am assuming the following format none of those elements may contain a spaces and they are always delimiter by a single spaces
the following code should work explanation this is the same code but with comments and more spaces awk has some tricks that you may not be familiar with

34602803
awt	swing
if you have ever looked at the internals of the swing awt stuff you would see that there is a lot going on under the hood interacting with native ui widgets
i would not use any swing awt class outside of the edt unless it specifically states that this is allowed

34604011
google-chrome	firefox
while you cannot record tests using the selenium ide in google-chrome or any other browser other than firefox you can run them from the ide in google-chrome ie and other browsers using the webdriver playback feature of selenium 2 ide
tests will need to be recorded and launched from firefox - google-chrome will launch before the first step of the test is executed

34604939
google-chrome	firefox
using your general code structure here s the decrement solution using your general code structure here s the reverse iteration solution you can also use other array helper functions to leverage more of the native array functionality going with an es6 set for a little more potential efficiency fyi in the previous code example i tried to do as it seems cleaner and that works great in ie and google-chrome but a bug in firefox keeps it from working there
the arguments in es6 is supposed to be an iterable that you can pass to the set constructor but firefox has not yet implemented that properly yet

34607815
translation	localization
see also cookbook core libraries utilities internationalization localization localization in cakephp cookbook models behaviors translation reading translation content
i18n translation uses the configure.language session value over the configuration value in case set but the translation behavior will not it relies on the configuration value only

34610984
ssl	https
self-signed ssl certificates are not used to bypass the ssl checking
if you are connecting to an https server that is using a self-signed certificate then you configure ion or other http clients to recognize that certificate

34610984
ssl	https
you bypass the ssl checking by not requesting an https url and having a server that supports a plain http url
if you actually have a server that is using a self-signed ssl certificate you can use my cwac-security library to create the

34611160
intersect	contains
forgetting for a second that storing delimited lists in a relational database is abhorrent you can do it using a combination of intersect and exists for example returns system --------- bpm xxx bpm sem xxx sem edit based on your question stating any i assumed that you wanted rows where the terms matched any of those provided based on your comment i now assume you want records where the terms match all
this is a fairly similar approach but you need to use not exists and except instead now all is still quite ambiguous for example if you search for bmp sem should it return a record that is bpm sem yyy it does contains all of the searched terms but it does contains additional terms too

34611757
build.gradle	gradlew
change in your build.gradle this line compilesdkversion 23 since you are using the compile com.google.android.gms play-services + you are using the the latest version 8.4.0 which has a dependency with support libraries v23 . it is the reason because gradlew uses the v23 instead of v22
in general it is a good practice avoiding the use of + in your build.gradle files because in this way you don t know which version you are using of your dependencies and you will not able to reproduce your code in the future

34613975
stateless	stateful
benefit this behaviour is stateless doesn t need much maintenance in the code by you and makes your entitymanager threadsafe
extended persistence context in short can be used for a stateful session bean only and is tied to the lifecycle of the bean

34614322
setinterval	settimeout
the general way to approach this would be to replace your lightnon functions with an array of functions or better a function that used an array of data create a variable to track which index of that array you want to deal with next use setinterval to every second run a function that sets the array calls the update function increments the variable tracking the index
settimeout is not a sleep function

34614401
swift	objective-c
you cannot use them in swift .swift or in objective-c .m files
it is perfectly valid to use an objective-c class from an objective-c++ file from swift

34614401
swift	objective-c
you can use objective-c to wrap c++ classes for swift usage
however it is not valid to use c++ from plain objective-c

34615859
ubuntu	debian
the latter should make it trivial to provide a package for ubuntu too
since i don t use debian or derivates any more i am not too sure wether they are really compatible there have been startup issues when i last built a .deb

34617089
lxml	elementtree
you did not import the elementtree module as a global name in your module only the lxml package itself
you need to import the elementtree module from the lxml package from lxml import elementtree see the lxml.etree tutorial

34620148
build.gradle	gradlew
just check your build.gradle file and add the jcenter repository otherwise you can use the last stable plugin instead of 2.0.0-alpha3 com.android.tools.build gradlew 1.5.0
could not find com.android.tools.build gradlew 2.0.0-alpha3. error 05-jan-2016 18 01 20 searched in the following locations error 05-jan-2016 18 01 20 error 05-jan-2016 18 01 20 you can check this repo using the broswer. it happens because this repo doesn t contain the 2.0.0-alpha3 version

34622644
httpclient	okhttp
i suppose that you re trying to use already unsupported library httpclient is not supported any more in sdk 23
you have to use urlconnection or downgrade to sdk 22 compile com.android.support appcompat-v7 22.2.0 if you need sdk version 23 add this to your build.gradle you also may try to download and include httpclient jar directly into your project or use okhttp instead

34623431
kerberos	ntlm
the ones you have by default for applicationpoolidentities which seems a good place to start but not necessarily all required access this computer from the network adjust memory quotas for a process allow log on locally bypass traverse checking generate security audit details impersonate a client after authentication - often not available by default on locked-down environments log on as a batch job - often not available by default on locked-down environments log on as a service - i m not sure this is needed replace a process level token if you re using windows auth and kerberos provider negotiate then depending on the url and if kernel-mode auth is on you might need to set up an spn
i suggest switching to ntlm if possible

34624888
udp	tcp
if you are running docker and using riemann in udp then there are a whole other set of things to check
i m assuming that you are running riemann and riemann-dash on the same computer and not using docker for either of these riemann listens to port 5555 udp for events port 5555 tcp for events port 5556 tcp for queries so there are several combinations of possible problems riemann is not running at all riemann started up and then fell over and died

34628629
tvos	ios
apple provides an example of how to do this in searchviewcontroller.swift in the uikitcatalog tvos sample code
apple deprecated uisearchdisplaycontroller in ios 8 and removed it for ios 9 which is why it s not available on tvos

34628997
bower	npm
this isn t a major issue as you compress your bower bundle using gulp-uglify i have forked your code and done the necessary changes in it - check them here
as stated in the bower handbook the module system that bower uses is the same as node so packages published to npm that were originally intended for use in node but not browsers will work just fine in the browser too

34628997
bower	npm
as stated in the bower handbook the module system that bower uses is the same as node so packages published to npm that were originally intended for use in node but not browsers will work just fine in the browser too
increasingly people are publishing modules to npm which are intentionally designed to work in both node and in the browser using bower and many packages on npm are intended for use in just the browser

34629374
swift	objective-c
in emphasis mine in note error handling in swift resembles exception handling in other languages with the use of the try catch and throw keywords
unlike exception handling in many languages including objective-c error handling in swift does not involve unwinding the call stack a process that can be computationally expensive

34632259
fiddler	charles
i tried wireshark horrible burp ok just not good enough fiddler mono version buggy as hell charles many more
non of these tools felt half as useful as fiddler on windows

34632993
ssl	https
it may be offloading the ssl prior to reaching your site
also as you point out simply specifying https in the browser does not guarantee that your ssl certificate is working and configured correctly

34636243
decoder	encoder
this is because your decoder is generating the output that would be send back the chain of handlers this output won t be seen by the encoder if the decoder was above that
your decoder shouldn t be called a decoder following the netty naming we need to change your decoder to send the generated data actually back the chain instead of into the non-existing void

34636522
arraylist	treeset
most of the main collection implementations arraylist linkedlist hashset ... do accept null values though
perhaps the one you are most likely to encounter that does not support null s is a treeset that relies on elements natural ordering or on a comparator that rejects null s

34637950
ienumerable	iqueryable
5 the retrieved detached objects should be added to a returned list or you could yield return the results one by one with ienumerable is return type
returning an iqueryable isn t possible in this case but an ienumerable will do as result

34641174
istream	getline
std getline is simmilar to std istream getline except that it uses std string instead of char arrays
in both the parameter delim means a delimiting character but in a way that it s the character which when encountered std getline stops reading does not save it and discards it

34642604
rdf	owl
note that turtle is just a serialization format for rdf
in rdf parent is an iri we d need to know what the prefix stands for in order to know exactly what it is and it s the subject of at least one rdf triple parent rdf type owl class . the turtle snippet that you re showing isn t actually legal turtle

34645552
implements	extends
a class can only implements interfaces not classes
it can extends only one class

34646004
direct3d	directx
see anatomy of direct3d 11 create device you should take a look at the directx tool kit and the direct3d win32 game template
you have not stated which os you are using but the most likely cause of the failure is that your system does not have the correct direct3d sdk debug layer installed

34647551
constexpr	inline-functions
the compiler is free to fold away functions without constexpr but the programmer can t rely on it doing so
inline-functions may or may not resolve to constant expressions which could be optimized into the end result

34647551
inline	constexpr
inline functions may or may not resolve to constant expressions which could be optimized into the end result
however a constexpr guarantees it

34647551
constexpr	inline-functions
however a constexpr guarantees it
an inline-functions cannot be used as a compile time constant whereas constexpr can allow you to formulate compile time functions and more so objects

inline	constexpr	constexpr	inline-functions
an inline-functions cannot be used as a compile time constant whereas constexpr can allow you to formulate compile time functions and more so objects
a basic example where constexpr makes a guarantee that inline cannot

34648107
prepare	execute
thanks to this stack overflow question and answers i was able to find out that code is not execute in the background state to prepare it for the suspended state
the background mode is a transition state to prepare the app to be screen shotted

34648139
debian	centos	ubuntu	centos
besides that a init script from debian ubuntu will not work on centos without modifications
some required files like the helper methods from the init-functions do not exist on centos

34649066
ssl	https
you can find a hints from here configuring curl for ssl you are not getting the error msg because you need to print it like below alternately you can run your curl with verbose enabled to see the things happening with your curl request
you are probably getting error due to ssl in your url https issue

34649219
swift	objective-c
object pointer types in objective-c header files are treated as implicitly unwrapped optionals in swift because the compiler doesn t know if nil is a valid value
your code should compile if you add an exclamation mark after each of the types in the block you are passing to postuserprofile however a better solution is to add nullability annotations to your objective-c header file

34650328
opencv	emgucv
the emgucv cannot find the opencv dlls
simplest solution go to your emgucv installation the bin folder find inside the folders x86 and x64 copy these folders to the bin debug bin release folder of your project

34650690
mongodb	bson
you can see examine it for example in wireshark when you connect to a mongodb database that does not use ssl tls filter for tcp port 27017
the mongo java driver uses the mongodb wire protocol . it is a socket oriented bson communication protocol

34656008
swift	objective-c
for starters setobject forkey approach doesn t even work on pure swift types
this will only work on objects which inherit from objective-c types

34656008
swift	objective-c
if we have a code base in which some of our objects are inheriting from objective-c objects which basically any project will have uiviewcontroller etc and some of our objects are pure swift objects which you will tend to have when you re creating your own swift classes from scratch then our swift objects will not be able to implement this same pattern
if we have some objects of both types we ll either have to implement the pattern i show above for all of them and then we have consistency or we ll have to implement one pattern for some types and another for other types swift structs would definitely have to implement the above pattern you can t just make them inherit from nsobject and then we have inconsistency which we don t like

34656034
prepare	execute
from the documentation after prepare is called the application cannot change command parameter data types and sizes
otherwise during the next execute execsql execproc open call an exception will be raised

34657739
backtracking	greedy
in other words these formatters do not backtracking to try alternative matches
in regex terms the optional sections are greedy

34660408
dictionary	map
note that dictionary is a mutable collection so if you were to actually call dict.clear it wouldn t return a new empty dictionary it would mutate the existing one by clearing all elements
the immutable f# data structure usually used for key-value relationships is map see for things you can do with map

34661365
uicollectionview	uitableview
what you instead need is a uicollectionview with a custom layout object that controls the position of the cells
this ll be a fair bit of work but you are allowed finer grain control that the uitableview doesn t give you

34663429
google-chrome	firefox
i can reproduce the problem on mac os and google-chrome too
there is an open related issue here simulate key events at highest level in google-chrome also see related issues keys.enter keys.tab keys.space are not working on google-chrome 44 sendkeys command under mac does not work as a workaround run the tests involving sending keys to the browser in firefox

34665184
implements	extends
i would implements like this
you should not use overly complex regex if you can avoid them because they are hard to read at least for everyone but yourself hard to extends hard to debug although there might be a small performance overhead in using many small regular expressions the points above outweight it easily

34666180
uialertview	uialertcontroller
uialertview was deprecated in ios 8 in favor of the uialertcontroller
unfortunately this proves to be a tricky problem because the accepted solution won t work as apple explicitly doesn t support subclassing uialertcontroller the uialertcontroller class is intended to be used as-is and does not support subclassing

34667296
asp.net-mvc	html.actionlink
this microsoft support page says to resolve the tilde notation to the rewritten urls by using the same behavior as in web pages razor v2 set the iis_wasurlrewritten context to false in each web page or in application_beginrequest in global.asax for the global setting as follows note the change of the iis_wasurlrewritten context affects the tilde notation not only in the html elements but also in the asp.net-mvc helper methods
for example if it is set to false the tilde notation in url.content and html.actionlink returns the rewritten urls

34667342
swift	objective-c
if you have defined your own swift base class you must first declare that it conform to customstringconvertible and then implement it a class that does not conform to customstringconvertible merely prints the class name
the reason why most of the classes you use have a default implementation of customstringconvertible is because nsobject the superclass of all objective-c classes implements it

34667937
profiling	debugging
one way to do this is use rebar3 to run a shell under the test profiling then start the debugger and set up your breakpoints and such this will pop up the debugger gui
once the debugger is set up and ready run your test under eunit assuming you set up a suitable breakpoint in the debugger this will hit it but you ll likely run into a problem with this approach by default eunit tests time out after 5 seconds which doesn t give you much time for debugging

34668713
google-chrome	firefox
sample code change the browser in google-chrome you would always get only the visible area on the resulting screenshot here is the relevant chromedriver issue with a lot of information about the issue and multiple workarounds chromedriver2 take screenshot is not full page somewhat surprisingly it should though work in firefox - switching to it if possible google-chrome screenshots that take up the entire screens are not like firefox s
firefox will capture the entire screens even parts of it that are not currently viewable

34668970
stateless	stateful
a stateless deleter cannot remember to delete something else
you can add a stateful deleter to unique_ptr that supports aliasing but then you ll have to alias manually

34669039
swift	objective-c
2 if you are using your pure swift framework in objective c files ensure that the foo-swift.h header has generated the correct interface by going to foo.h and then clicking on the top left corner menu of the xcode code editor and then choosing includes- foo-swift.h i had to rebuild the foo framework a few times until xcode caught-up with the change and then generated the correct interface in objective c so you may need to do that as well your swift classes inherit from nsobject or they won t be available to objective c code
in xcode 7.2 using swift 2.1 i managed to get past the mentioned error by making sure that the build settings of your pure swift framework called foo are as follows 1 build settings- packaging- defines module yes 2 build settings- swift compiler - code generation- install objective-c compatibility header yes if you do not need to import your swift framework into objective c set this setting to no 3 erase the string value of build settings- swift compiler - code generation- objective-c bridging header 4 build settings- swift compiler - code generation- objective-c generated interface header name foo-swift.h if you do not need to import your swift framework into objective c erase this setting as you did in step 3 5 make sure that build settings- packaging- product name foo 6 add to the public umbrella header of your framework foo.h which you can use to import your swift code to objective c the following line #import foo-swift.h but if you do not need to import your swift code into objective c skip this step 6 add the following line to the swift file where you want to use the module foo import foo important notes 1 ensure that your umbrella header foo.h is set to public in the file inspector otherwise this won t work

34673327
calloc	malloc
malloc doesn t normally initialize the allocated memory. you should use memset to initialize the allocated memory or use calloc which does initializes the allocated memory with zeroes
you should allocate memory for 11 chars 10 + 1 for 0 and don t cast the pointer returned by malloc

34676272
multiplying	multiplication
you will achieve a better runtime when multiplying multiple vectors bi at once using matrix multiplication
this will not achieve the performance of a pure matrix multiplication but working with larger slices of b is probably the fastest memory efficient solution

34677127
monkeyrunner	adb
sample program quoting android developers documentation the monkeyrunner tool is not related to the ui application exerciser monkey also known as the monkey tool
the monkey tool runs in an adb shell directly on the device or emulator and generates pseudo-random streams of user and system events

34678576
viewdidload	viewwillappear
in viewdidload it has just loaded your view from the xib or storyboard not sized it yet
the size should be correct when viewwillappear is called

34678812
build.gradle	gradlew
copy task dependencies third solution cortesey of rage example files build.gradle unfortunately this does not seem to work for my setup but gradlew is happy and files are downloaded when needed since they are cached
first solution don t leave gradlew

34679463
amd	umd
if you are writing an application that will run purely in node.js you should be using commonjs modules not amd modules when you compile your typescript files
if you are writing an application that will run both in node.js and in the browser you should be using umd modules not amd modules when you compile your typescript files

34682185
ubuntu	linux
you gave the output as linux dell 3.16.0-50-generic #67 14.04.1-ubuntu smp fri...i686 i686 i686 gnu linux the i686 tells us this is a 32-bit version of ubuntu not 64-bit
had the output included x86_64 then you would be on a 64-bit ubuntu

34682694
ireport	subreports
how to get report_count from subreports in ireport
you should put the header text inside the subreports in for example a title band in subreports make sure you do not have the attribute whennodatatype on jasperreport tag so it uses default value nopages if the subreports has no records the attribute default will ensure that nothing is returned and you will not see the title

34687948
spaces	delimiter
to use a cleaned file we need to filter your source file to some temporal test file all spaces and tabs replaced by one only spaces between fields use 20 or 50 lines if the original file is too big
then either you choose to use some other delimiter for awk not the default spaces . you could split fields in awk on runs of two spaces or more fs +

34688675
consistency	acid
this is called immediate consistency
in contrast there are nosql databases which are not acid compliant

34688843
zsh	subshell
you can simply drop the while part and using grep -c in some shells like zsh and ksh the last part of pipelines was run in current shell so your function will work in those shells
the return 0 statement was associated with while loop body and since when each parts of pipelines in bash was run in subshell the return 0 cause the subshell executed while loop exit not the entire function

34691413
ssl	https
most certificate authorities will also include the corresponding apex domain if you purchase www.example.com but you need to check with your ssl certificate provider
last but not least the ability to redirect http to https traffic really depends on your service provider in this case parse.com

34691891
division	addition
the time complexity may or may not be reduced if you use such division of the array element at all depending on what is the algorithm in question
for example if the algorithm is simple addition between x numbers

34692351
viewdidload	viewdidappear
ok not a bug the issue is that in viewdidload the view hierarchy is not fully set
if you use viewdidappear then the hierarchy is set

34693546
vsto	add-in
microsoft office applications can disable vsto add-in that behave unexpectedly
if an application does not load your vsto add-in the application might have hard disabled or soft disabled your vsto add-in

34693546
vsto	add-in
if an application does not load your vsto add-in the application might have hard disabled or soft disabled your vsto add-in
hard disabling can occur when an vsto add-in causes the application to close unexpectedly

34693546
vsto	add-in
it might also occur on your development computer if you stop the debugger while the startup event handler in your vsto add-in is executing
soft disabling can occur when a vsto add-in produces an error that does not cause the application to unexpectedly close

34693546
vsto	add-in
soft disabling can occur when a vsto add-in produces an error that does not cause the application to unexpectedly close
for example an application might soft disable a vsto add-in if it throws an unhandled exception while the startup event handler is executing

34693546
vsto	add-in
when you re-enable a soft-disabled vsto add-in the application immediately attempts to load the vsto add-in
if the problem that initially caused the application to soft disable the vsto add-in has not been fixed the application will soft disable the vsto add-in again

34693546
vsto	add-in
if the problem that initially caused the application to soft disable the vsto add-in has not been fixed the application will soft disable the vsto add-in again
read more about that in the how to re-enable a vsto add-in that has been disabled article

34694444
jar	war
i ll bet your maven module is not setup with if your module is set to jar default then it tried to deploy as a standard java application where you are going to launch your own server
since you want a managed vm with appengine running you need to package as war and then the plugin will take care of the rest

34696658
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in my example etag header accessible only in google-chrome browser
safari return only simple response headers while firefox doesn t return any response headers

34696883
bash	subshell
just bash printing line of the file line1 line2 line3 with printf you can use as the field width then provide a number in the arguments
i m running this in a subshell so altering ifs does not affect the parent shell

34697180
setinterval	settimeout
settimeout call doesn t block the browser s main thread instead what it does is schedule your function call whenever your browser is idle and then exits immediately which subsequently terminates the caller thus no recursion occurs i would prefer using setinterval in your case for the sake of readability and avoid any confusion of recursive calls edit based on comment made by paulpro thanks
i assumed setinterval does the same with settimeout with delay and calling the same function but it doesn t settimeout runs in sequence and only schedule the next call when your function calls runupdater whereas setinterval just schedules ignoring the state of the function being called tl

bower	npm
it looks like things like gulp and bower are installed in usr lib while the rest of your files are in usr local lib
this answer suggests that npm usually installs into usr local lib via symlink if you have your setup correctly and you re not installing via sudo so presumably you changed that variable sometime in the past

34700628
stateless	stateful
it is up to the application server to determine if it want s to create multiple instances of stateless session beans or not
stateful session beans keep state per client

34701327
lxml	beautifulsoup	html5lib	beautifulsoup
for example the html5lib tree builder doesn t support exclude_encoding use the lxml parser
the problem is that beautifulsoup converts the original encoding to unicode if the from_encoding is not specified using a sub-library called unicode dammit

34702845
rpm	yum
below are the steps i performed- downloaded the required rpms wget wget wget install it again erase packages rpm -e rpm -qa | grep mariadb --noscripts remove the config files rm -rf var lib mysql rm etc my.cnf
i reinstalled mariadb and then uninstalled using rmp not yum

floating-point	fractions	fixed-point	fractions
one is a fixed-point value ergo fixnum and the other is a floating-point value float
a fixnum can represent integers only but a float can represent both integers and fractions but it behooves me to mention not all fractions

34706105
erlang	elixir
you should have the erlang docs in iex soon
actually their are plenty of modules currently in erlang that are not present in elixir

34706105
erlang	elixir
actually their are plenty of modules currently in erlang that are not present in elixir
importing all of them would not make much sense since corresponding erlang modules are available and its quite easy to use them in elixir too

34706105
erlang	elixir
importing all of them would not make much sense since corresponding erlang modules are available and its quite easy to use them in elixir too
also from the docs elixir runs in the same virtual machine and is compatible with otp

34706105
erlang	elixir
not only that all the tools and libraries available in the erlang ecosystem are also available in elixir simply because there is no conversion cost from calling erlang from elixir and vice-versa
as for the documentation elixir is still relatively new people are working on it

34706111
spaces	delimiter
you do not know how much spaces will be between eth0 and link encap.
in order to make this determinstic you use tr so the output after the tr -s command is eth0 link encap ethernet hwaddr 01 23 45 67 89 ab now we are only interested in the part of the hardware address since we know that there are four elements before the hwaddr we can cut them away eth0 link encap ethernet hwaddr 01 23 45 67 89 ab # 1 2 3 4 5 we do this with cut -f 5 -d where -d is the delimiter and we are interested in the fifth field

34706438
subtraction	addition
addition subtraction many architectures support so called carry flag
it s set when the result of addition overflows or result of subtraction doesn t underflow

34706438
subtraction	addition
it s set when the result of addition overflows or result of subtraction doesn t underflow
the behaviour of those bits can be show with long addition and long subtraction

34706438
subtraction	addition
analogically for subtraction
this gives 2 instructions however because of instruction pipelinining it may be slower than that as one calculation depends on the other one to finish so if cpu doesn t have anything else to do than 64-bit addition cpu may wait for the first addition to be done

34706438
addition	multiplication
this gives 2 instructions however because of instruction pipelinining it may be slower than that as one calculation depends on the other one to finish so if cpu doesn t have anything else to do than 64-bit addition cpu may wait for the first addition to be done
multiplication it so happens on x86 that imul and mul can be used in such a way that overflow is stored in edx register

34707401
spaces	delimiter
since address is not_analyzed 1300 s belmont road will be stored as it is but _all field will have spaces delimiter words with standard analyzer applied like 1300 s belmont etc
from the doc the _all field is a special catch-all field which concatenates the values of all of the other fields into one big string using spaces as a delimiter which is then analyzed and indexed but not stored

34708416
google-chrome	firefox
the solution is to focus the input at the end of success or done function like this it works on firefox google-chrome and ie 11+ perhaps 10
quite a long time after question but i found a workaround for ie and google-chrome not tested on opera and already ok for firefox

34709076
g++	gcc
the last problem is this one cmake usr lib64 libstdc++.so.6 version glibcxx_3.4.21 not found ... what this error is telling you is that the version of cmake you are invoking has been built with a later version of g++ than the one you have installed
specifically glibcxx_4.3.21 was introduced in gcc-5.1 and your cmake was built with that or later version of g++ but the system libstdc++.so.6 came from earlier version of gcc

34709399
multiplying	multiplication
so it is a simple matter of writing the outer loop and inner loop to compute the proper number of terms and sum them for each term in the result so as to not waste time multiplying and adding zeros
this will significantly reduce the number of additions and multiplication from n 2 and n 3 for a normal matrix multiplication to n n-1 2 and n n+1 n+2 6 for a product of upper diagonal matrices

34710393
arp	udp
replace all mentions of arp with neighbor and equivalent
it seems as if the method you have chosen to send a udp packet fails if the dst mac is not already in the arp tables

34710393
arp	udp
it seems as if the method you have chosen to send a udp packet fails if the dst mac is not already in the arp tables
somehow doing it this way causes the kernel to not arp for the dst mac maybe because you have manually inserted it into the packet - but - the packet transmission fails nevertheless because it doesn t exist in the arp table

34711027
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
you can try this code the above code will only work with uiviewcontroller not uinavigationcontroller stacks
if you are using a uinavigationcontroller you should do the following solution 1 add to appdelegate.h a variable property nonatomic assign bool blockrotation

34711440
octal	decimal
therefore the literal constant 0 is in fact syntactically an octal constant
that is the reason why misra rule 7.1 is formulated in the following way octal constants other than zero and octal escape sequences shall not be used. since 0 is an octal constant they explicitly have to allow its use - decimal constants finally are those that start with a digit 1..9 and then possibly further digits 0..9

34712804
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome implements an offsetwidth in the svgtextelement prototype which allows jquery to return a width
but it s not a standard property and firefox doesn t implement it

34717036
client-side	server-side
in order to have the transaction run in a different database it is required to switch to another database beforehand on the client-side
ggendel your reasoning about _usedatabase being the problem source is correct a transaction is not allowed to change the database in-between and neither or several other server-side operations foxx actions

34725319
awt	swing
according to david holmes awt was on the other hand originally intended to be accessible by multiple threads which might also explain why the javadoc of strict awt classes component and container do not inclcude the thread-safety warning usually found in the javadoc of swing classes swing is not thread safe...
in this regard component#gettreelock returns the static final lock object shared by all awt components

34725319
gridbaglayout	boxlayout
but strangely enough this pattern is not consistently applied to all java layoutmanagers - gridbaglayout does synchronize on the tree lock in the method getlayoutinfo but does not do so in the method arrangegrid although both methods access the component tree
boxlayout on the other hand does not synchronize on the tree lock at all see also this thread

34725319
awt	swing
i ll conclude with thomas hawtins words on this subject swing is single threaded awt is not
however awt has thousands literally of threading bugs which are unlikely to be fixed

34735630
google-chrome	firefox
in browsers with native html imports like google-chrome the polymer.html file is imported before your index.js script is run so it has access to the polymer variable
i think you are using a browser without native html imports such as firefox as you can see here here is jsbin demo using your code that works in google-chrome but not firefox notice i m also placing a tag into the body so you can see that it s working otherwise it s the same as your example

34737664
google-chrome	firefox
then on a browser like google-chrome that natively supports web components the upgrade of dialog to a paper-dialog will happen synchronously and we immediately have a paper-dialog to interact with
however on a browser like firefox that requires polyfilling the upgrade is asynchronous and an immediate attempt to invoke dialog.toggle will fail typeerror dialog.toggle is not a function as i found out if i just give the polyfill a chance to work i then have an upgraded element to interact with simply waiting for the upgrade to happen before interacting with the element seems to be ok most of the time

34737883
punctuation	words
so punctuation mark is completely ignored
your pattern is actually saying interpret as unicode words boundaries with letters in between or not the and words boundaries with digits in between or not again a

34738803
rpm	yum
bin sh #rpm -ivh rpm -ivh yum -y install puppet so i was able to install puppet 3.x rather than puppet 4.x - and i used an existing vagrantfile with simple provisioning and all was ok when i vagrant up the vm provisioning for puppet was running and packaged installed
first things i d say make sure to cleanup at the really end run cleanup.sh after puppet.sh will list all available packages and installed packages to know which packages are installed you should run yum list installed you might have an issue in your repos or mirrors if you do not get any output at all from your command as you installed from rpm you can also run rpm -qa | grep puppet to find out if the package has been installed you should get something like depending the version from a quick view the script looks good - i do install from the following script so it does basically the same - update its very strange i created a box from your gist and the box was okay - puppet was installed

34739539
dbcontext	objectcontext
the remove method will also remove the child entities if cascade on delete is on because you re using it on the dbcontext where the relations are defined note you have to put it on in ef too not only database
entitystate.deleted will just mark the state of the entity as deleted in the objectcontext and try to delete this one entity when you call savechanges

34742210
clang	llvm
however nvvm ir is specified for llvm 3.4 and you may encounter problems if you use ir generated by newer llvm clang versions
the nvptx backend from llvm however does not have this restrictions and can generate ptx code without problems

34742709
swift	objective-c
for the time being you have two options switch from jsonmodel to another json deserialization library with support for swift define your models in objective-c i know this isn t ideal but i m afraid a workaround is not possible with the current jsonmodel behavior
jsonmodel does not support swift due to incompatibilities with the reflection supported by the objective-c runtime

34753339
uialertview	uialertcontroller
this naming convention is not related to uialertview which is deprecated but rather to its replacement - uialertcontroller that was introduced in ios8
instead of specifying button titles when using uialertview with uialertcontroller you add actions

34755242
.htaccess	httpd.conf
if you re using an .htaccess if you re editing the main apache config file httpd.conf or apache2.conf
i know the op is using .htaccess but just in case other people having this issue see this discussion first presumably you want to test if the requested string does not match a directory not match a file and not match a symbolic link - so you need add a

34755577
domcontentloaded	onload
it is an incredibly popular mistake to use load where domcontentloaded would be much more appropriate so be cautious
that quote in itself should prove that onload should not be relied on if you want the full dom to be loaded properly before you start manipulating it

34756412
implements	extends
punch doesn t directly implements this but you can extends your repository class to provide this
it will look similar to how the base class implements countasync

34761913
sudo	passwd
sudo is used to execute a command on a unix linux system that is otherwise not available to regular users
it will ask for a passwd of the current session user

34765795
postgresql	mysql
other languages oracle postgresql etc how to get the current epoch time unix timestamp
if you re not bothered about dates before 1970 or millisecond precision just do -- sql server select datediff s 1970-01-01 00 00 00 datefield almost as simple as mysql s built-in function -- mysql select unix_timestamp datefield

34768730
implements	extends
so bean does not implements an interface in that case we uses inheritance in order to generate such proxies spring uses a third party library called cglib
cglib c ode g eneration lib rary is built on top of asm this is mainly used the generate proxy extends bean and adds bean behavior in the proxy methods

34771143
multiplying	multiplication
multiplying a binary floating point number by a power of 2 in this case 2 16 is precise provided that it doesn t cause a floating point overflow or underflow in the case of negative powers of 2
every floating point implementation should handle that multiplication in precisely the same way

34773800
implements	extends
in this class you can ofcourse implements some public method to set menu in subclasses etc
im not sure if i understand you correctly but maybe make class which extends after activity or if you use appcompatactivity etc. for example class mycustomactivity extends appcompatactivity implements there your actionbar and then in every new activity class where you need that actionbar just extends mycustomactivity

34773809
tensorflow	cudnn
please see the tensorflow cuda installation instructions
it s not finding cudnn - i tensorflow stream_executor dso_loader.cc 93 couldn t open cuda library libcudnn.so.6.5

34773809

34775058
swift	objective-c
this works fine appdelegate swift view i would verify your refresh_ui is set on both correctly and that your observer is added properly before you dispatch
i just ran a quick test and there doesn t seem to be any special considerations for calling notifications from objective-c to swift

34776919
swift	objective-c
to summarize an objective-c method maps to the following swift method func dosomething throws
the first overload is marked unavailable to swift hence it is not visible

34777133
ssl	https
i ran into the same or similar problem when a laravel 5 application was not aware of being behind an ssl load-balancer
i have the following design client talks to an ssl load balancer over https ssl load balancer talks to a back-end server over http that however causes all the urls in the html code to be generated with http schema

34779308
uiview	cashapelayer
the best way to tackle this is not by creating a view uiview but a layer cashapelayer
you can create a cashapelayer from a path thus describing your shape with vectors as opposed to a bitmap

34779771
uiview	subviews
as dia kharrat noted in that post the overlay uiview s frame was not large enough
the clipstobounds property for a uiview is by default set to no which means its subviews are still visible even if they are outside the parent s frame.

34781365
awt	swing
unless you have a major driving cause to i d avoid using awt directly in this way and would use swing swing superseded awt 16+ years ago so you re likely to get better community support
see creating a gui with jfc swing for more details since applets are been actively blocked by most browsers now days i d also question their use here missed the please do not dissuade me from using awt or applets disclaimer i see the logic in extending an applet

34782171
cpython	pypy
not enough reputation for comment left on top answer beardc this doesn t seem to be cpython thing
pypy gives me typeerror keywords must be strings the solution with only works because the dictionary to be merged only has keys of type string

34782711
build.gradle	gradlew
in your build.gradle not the app gradlew it should look like this
make sure your gradlew module is up to date

34783888
implements	extends
you will need to take a look at the strategy design pattern to see how you can implements this
in java you cannot have a class which extends inherits from multiple classes

34784977
erlang	elixir
the erlang documentation gives an example on how to use this to build infinite lists but it is unlikely that you will encounter this in the wild
the idea is that the tail is in this case not a list but a function that will return another improper list with the next value and function however we can achieve infinite streams much more easily in elixir using the stream module another pseudo use case of improper lists is with so-called iodata or chardata values

34788819
ubuntu	linux
note bash on ubuntu on windows does not have access to the gpu so all of the gpu options for installing tensorflow will not work
the dated installation instructions for bash on ubuntu on windows are basically correct but only these steps are necessary prerequisites enable the windows subsystem for linux feature gui reboot when prompted run bash on windows steps no longer needed turn on developer mode enable the windows subsystem for linux feature command-line then install tensorflow using apt-get sudo apt-get install python3-pip python3-dev sudo pip3 install --upgrade and now test tensorflow and run an actual neural network python3 -m tensorflow.models.image.mnist.convolutional earlier answer after learning about the developer preview of bash on windows

34788819
ubuntu	debian
most use a vmware 7.1 workstation to host ubuntu 14.04 lts or ubuntu 15 or debian
i also have one dual boot of ubuntu 14.04 lts on my windows machine to access the gpu as the machine with vmware does not have the proper gpu

34791831
profiling	debugging
in case your action not returning html code e.g json api and you want to use profiling quick and dirty solution even quicker and dirtier solution - returning non response type in controller will raise exception with profiling enabled response return 1
if your application is running by symfony you can also use x-debug-token which contains debugging token and x-debug-token-link header which contains link to profiling page

34795849
division	addition
what you suggest is a possibility but passing index as a parameter is neither division of problems into sub-problems nor combining the results
in addition it is also important to consider that in java methods are not only identified by their names but also by their input parameters return types etc

34797369
noexcept	throw
relating to my comment depending on whether a what literal is acceptable i had something like this in mind i ve added some code that allows deriving from a std exception type type requires constructor with single literal argument could check that this is also noexcept
i m passing it an empty string literal so std exception class should at least not throw

34799656
bash	subshell
no manually running a new shell via bin sh or bin bash etc. is not a subshell in this context
a subshell is when the shell spawns a new shell instance on its own to handle some work

34800956
ssl	https
all you need to do is change the snippet to force it to go through an ssl connection by adding an explicit protocol instead of the protocol relative url that is the default
the reason you are running into problems is because adblock will block this script if and only if it does not go through https

34803186
linefeed	delimiter	spaces	delimiter
an initial spaces in the format will skip this linefeed and any intial blanks before the address you should also protect the other scanf with s formats by adding the size modifier to prevent buffer overflows
your code does not compile the include filenames miss the and delimiter

34806699
noexcept	throw
also consider functions with const-ref parameters x is noexcept allright
the call in y however is not because it includes a possibly throw implicit conversion

34809703
laravel	codeigniter
codeigniter module laravel codeigniter ---------------------------------------------------------- layout control yes no orm yes no error stack trace yes no class auto loading yes yes database mysql yes yes database sqlite yes yes database mssql yes yes database postgresql yes yes database cubrid yes yes odbc drivers yes no database mariadb no no authentication library yes no external modules yes yes form validation rules yes yes internationalization yes yes database module object-oriented hybrid object-relational template language blade template engine blade php proprietary design pattern active-record active-record model-view-controller model-view-controller dependency injection observer singleton event-driven mtv factory restfull facade so some open source library s can use with both of this frameworks but not all phpmailer phpexcel..
codeigniter is an php framework

34810430
hive	hdfs
i had the same experience and i resolved it by adding to my flume config files the hdfs sink configurations i used the hdfs.inuseprefix value of . in order to hide the file from my hive query while still streaming
issue i noticed while running select queries on hive on external tables which have locations that files were streamed into it i get encounter such errors as java.io.filenotfoundexception file does not exist hdfs hmaster 9000 data etl sdp statistics ppasinterface some path to a partition some_files.tmp examining the flume log file showed a rename of the some_file.tmp to some.file was the reason for failure

34810602
strcpy	strncpy
you re responsible for ensuring points to a valid buffer that is big enough to contain the string you want to copy there if you re using strcpy strncpy - those functions does not create a new string they just copies bytes from one place to another place and it s up to you to ensure that other place is valid memory where the bytes can be stored
strncpy strncpy mem- b num sourceids num - source string_size

34810686
multiplying	subtract
if the start value a is any of those target values then you can easily climb to the goal b by multiplying by 2 and subtract 1 if necessary
if a is not one of those values then you begin by subtract 1 from a until you reach one of those target values

34811012
prepare	execute
you need to use a union - so the query would be select version from table1 union all select version from table2 mysql does not allow the table name to be included in the query as a variable - so as you don t want to write a fixed query but use the results from another query - you would need to build up a string to create the full query then run the query as a prepare statement see docs here the tables name from sync_table can be extracted combined into a single comma-separated string with the group_concat function
the resulting string can be modified with the concat replace functions to create your required query then execute as a prepare statement as follows select group_concat tablename from sync_tables into var

34812442
opera	safari
as the css supports won t work on your targeted unwanted browsers safari 7-8 ie 10 android browser 4.4 uc browser for android and opera mini 8 your browserupgrade message will be visible on those using this rule
there is a few browsers that still does support the non-prefixed flex but doesn t support supports ie 11 1 and opera mini 8 but luckily we can address them with a couple of css specific rules

34812605
client-side	server-side
that s a server-side concept not a client-side concept
so your server-side code needs to resolve that to an actual path

34813007
noexcept	throw
the question of whether you should mark this function noexcept is a separate matter
but a function simply being noexcept should not be confused with the belief that parts of a function call expression will never throw

34813007
noexcept	throw
but a function simply being noexcept should not be confused with the belief that parts of a function call expression will never throw
my personal feeling on the matter is that you shouldn t be marking random functions noexcept to begin with

34818210
equals	gethashcode
if you implemented gethashcode but did not implement equals the framework would resort to using reference equality to check for equality which would result in every instance creating a collision
if you implemented equals but did not implement gethashcode you might run into a situation where you had two objects that were equal but resulted in different hash codes meaning they d maintain their own separate values in your hash table

34824444
swift	objective-c
this means your property should be declared like so the realm swift documentation recently gained a property declaration cheatsheet which hopefully clarifies the requirements for the different types of declarations
the documentation you quoted includes the following emphasis mine list and realmoptional properties cannot be declared as dynamic because generic properties cannot be represented in the objective-c runtime and should always be declared with let

34832558
operands	scalar
a note from array vs matrix operations concerning array operations like if one operands is a scalar and the other is not then matlab applies the scalar to every element of the other operands
this property is known as scalar expansion because the scalar expands into an array of the same size as the other input then the operation executes as it normally does with two arrays

34833976
calloc	malloc
for a known number of strings you have allocated the correctly note because the cast is not necessary in c you could write it like this for allocating memory as you read the file for strings of unknown length use the following approach allocate a buffer using of a known starting size calloc is cleaner read into the buffer until you run out of space
use realloc to increase the size of buffer by some increment double it repeat steps 1 through 3 until file is read also when working with buffers of unknown length and you would like its contents to be pre-set or zeroed consider using calloc over malloc

34834509
gtk	cairo	clutter	cairo
clutter is one specifically designed to be used with gtk but there are also others
cairo doesn t animate things and it doesn t have the concept of objects

34837839
punctuation	words
if you want to match the leading this you will also need to add the case-insensitive flag i if you did not have punctuation it would be more efficient to use the following alternative in es6 before es6
in your code isn t interpreted as javascript language but as regex language and will only match wordsi . you can craft your regex in the following fashion i added b words boundaries to make sure the removed words are not parts of words

34838600
profiling	debugging
one way of debugging this would be to export the appx files using the tool in visual studio and during the export process to make sure that the debugging symbols are included and the app has been exported using the debugging profiling see this msdn article on packaging universal windows apps but instead of building them for store upload choose to not build them for store upload
this should ensure that the app is outputting any debugging messages

34843881
implements	extends
yes you have to implements a realm but this is not difficult
you just have to extends jndildaprealm and override the queryforauthorizationinfo method

34845071
daemons	systemd
there is no point looking for that file on your windows file systemd because the docker daemons does not run on windows
as you are using the docker toolbox the docker engine or daemons runs in a virtual machine created with virtualbox

34845320
setinterval	settimeout
first you want setinterval not settimeout
settimeout only executes once after the specified delay while setinterval executes once every interval

34850860
serializable	deserialization
if field can not be serializable then you will have an exception
the solution is to create some other backing fields that will be used only for serialization and deserialization purposes

34853857
rpm	yum
for instance on amazon linux i ran rpm -qa | grep php56-common and passed the result to debuginfo-install
note that installing debugging symbols using the standard package manager might not give the desired result - on amazon linux i got debugging symbols for a different version of php when running yum install php56-debuginfo and gdb didn t like that

34855068
vmware	virtualbox
if nested virtualization is important for you i suggest you try other virtualization applications that support it kvm or vmware esxi vm player
nested virtualization is not supported by virtualbox

34857798
firefox	safari
the issue is that firefox does not allow to decrease the line-height more than the currently active one
at first this looks like a firefox bug it works as described in the op in chrome ie safari

34859122
arp	tcp
the arp frame as seen in the tcp ip guide does not include the ip header
it means the match you specified will never match an arp packet since it only looks for the packet s destination ip

34859243
lisp	scheme
in this respect it is like algol and pascal and unlike most other dialects of lisp except for common lisp
the fact that scheme is statically scoped rather than dynamically bound means that the environment that is extended and becomes current when a procedure is called is the environment in which the procedure was created in which the procedure s defining lambda expression was evaluated not the environment in which the procedure is called

34871488
freebsd	linux
pyinstaller has been used successfully with aix solaris and freebsd but is not tested against them
pyinstaller once tried to support cross-compilation from linux - windows but later dropped the idea

34879475
jar	manifest.mf
for example if myjar.jar contains another jar file called myutils.jar you cannot use the class-path header in myjar.jar s manifest to load classes in myutils.jar into the class path
you can add your dependencies as jar files to your jar assembly-descriptor.xml pom.xml but unfortunately you can t use the class-path header in manifest.mf see adding classes to the jar file s classpath note the class-path header points to classes or jar files on the local network not jar files within the jar file or classes accessible over internet protocols

34879475
jar	manifest.mf
you can add your dependencies as jar files to your jar assembly-descriptor.xml pom.xml but unfortunately you can t use the class-path header in manifest.mf see adding classes to the jar file s classpath note the class-path header points to classes or jar files on the local network not jar files within the jar file or classes accessible over internet protocols
to load classes in jar files within a jar file into the class path you must write custom code to load those classes

34879621
udp	tcp
if you need performance think about switching to udp which seems not be limited by the maximum package size and additional overhead
the time increase seems to be connected with the maximum allowed data in one tcp package

34880877
innodb	myisam
if you are using innodb as mysql engine it doesn t allow composite primary keys with an auto increment
but if you change to the myisam engine it would be possible to do so

implements	extends
aspnetuser s tables will be there but not necessarilly a wpf project need to use it as a login method furthermore i suggest you to keep your entities in the business layer i also encourage not to use dataannotations there then make your data layer map them with entity framework using fluent api and encapsulate ef inside your concrete repositories which should be in data layer just implements repositories interfaces from business layer
make your dbcontext extends identitydbcontext but don t make your user extends applicationuser you could make an applicationuser has an user instead

34883145
union	distinct
union all instead of union so duplicates are not removed
distinct on instead of distinct because this is your intention

34885072
strcpy	malloc
solution you should use strcpy to copy the content of a string
that said please see this discussion on why not to cast the return value of malloc and family in c

34885139
libstdc++	libc++
live example note that his is one of the very rare examples where libstdc++ 6.0 svn trunk can currently
do something that libc++ 3.9 svn trunk cannot

34887761
centos	linux
on redhat centos run sudo systemctl start docker
to initialize the base filesystem run or manually like install docker-machine on linux to install machine binaries on linux locally global macos on macos the docker binary is only a client and you cannot use it to run the docker daemon because docker daemon uses linux-specific kernel features therefore you can t run docker natively in os x

34888471
move	drag
if it is selected it will not be in the not selected array and you can move the mouse pointer over other shapes while dragging shapes without them becoming dragged
creating arrays of objects you would like to drag also helps with hierarchy

34888634
sudo	passwd
on ubuntu this should do it sudo service postgresql restart another solution alternatively if user permissions are not a huge concern for you you have no other users on your system such as in a vm you can give yourself postgresql-superuser privileges this will then allow you to create a new db localdbname as well as load the plpgsql extension which seems to be necessary in this case
it appears to be insufficient to have the createdb role because of plpgsql . now you should be able to run your original command without pguser or pgpassword heroku pg pull heroku_postgresql_herokudbcolor localdbname --app herokuappname edited answer if you are still being prompted for a passwd when running the heroku pg pull command you will want to set a passwd for the new postgres user which may be the same as your os login user echo whoami

34888634
sudo	passwd
addendum caveat it may not be a good idea to combine the two solutions because you may have issues running sudo -u postgres .
if the postgres user is authenticated by md5 but no passwd is set which is usually the case on linux installations by default

34889234
strcpy	strncpy
#define strcpy dst size src strncpy dst src size you should ask your ide where strcpy is defined
strcpy is not strcpy as c c++ are case sensitive

34889234
strcpy	strncpy
strcpy is not strcpy as c c++ are case sensitive
probably strcpy is a preprocessor macro wrapping strncpy

34889366
lisp	scheme
that this error does not happen in mccarthy s original lisp is one result of the bug
fixing this bug which took more than a decade to full satisfaction enables us to use closures in lisp - like in common lisp which learned it from scheme

34889441
dictionary	map
you are getting an object or associative array or dictionary or hashtable which is not orderable in javascript
you have three options convert to a true array if you don t care about keys or if you can insert the keys into the objects use an index array and sort that instead or in es6 use map and its contract that it shall preserve the order of items in order of insertion but it only works on new javascript environments

34889904
realloc	malloc
realloc accepts null and behaves like malloc with such as argument free accepts a null argument and does nothing
do not cast the return value of malloc nor realloc

34890285
strdup	malloc
each word is copied into memory allocated by malloc by the strdup function
strdup is not part of standard c but part of posix and probably present in your environment possibly written as _strdup

34891043
innodb	myisam
one can use the functions for innodb tables but it will not use spatial keys
based on this percona post spatial indexes rtree are only supported for myisam tables

34892324
sudo	passwd
actually since the script should be running as root anyway using sudo is unnecessary
which is fortunate because if sudo was needed it wouldn t work because there s nobody there to enter the admin passwd to authorize it

34892324
daemons	systemd
custom launchd daemons should be installed in library launchdaemons not in systemd
el capitan will block installations in systemd

34893793
swift	objective-c
objective-c class yourswiftclassname uiviewcontroller in your project setting search for below flags and change it to yes both project and target defines module yes always embed swift standard libraries yes install objective-c compatibility header yes then clean the project and build once after build succeed it should probably import below header file in your objective-c class .m file #import yourprojectname-swift.h boooom
allow xcode to do its work do not add create swift header manually

34893793
swift	objective-c
allow xcode to do its work do not add create swift header manually
just add objective-c before your swift class ex

34894757
strcpy	malloc
hence when you try to call the function strcpy to copy data into the pointer the program crashes since it is not copying the data to valid memory
you might want to do some research into the function malloc which allows you to allocate memory on the heap for your tmp ptr

34900585
swift	objective-c
in swift there are no exceptions
in objective-c there are exceptions but you shouldn t really use them except for program terminating issues

34904950
shadowing	named
the typealias a is shadowing the other class type a
one solution is to prefix the shadowed type with the module named to tell the compiler that it s not the same type as the typealias one

34906662
persistent	transient
you either should persistent your newly instantiated transient useraccount before persistent executive or add a suitable cascade option to your executive entity
transient instance must be saved before current operation this means that you re persistent an instance of executive which has a relationship with a transient useraccount instance an instance of useraccount which has not persisted yet

34906687
rspec	capybara
recent versions of rspec try to help you avoid this by not creating by default specs that have both of the dsls builtin and instead have separate spec types spec api and spec features for each see here
it looks like you are using both the capybara dsl visit and so on and request specs

34907422
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
need to create a new runtimeexception for emptystacks why would i extend java.lang.runtimeexception when to choose checked and unchecked-exception the above are not more than words which means that in the end the final design following the language specification creating anti-patterns is up to you but what you should always keep in mind and decide act accordingly per case is that one layer s runtime exception is another layer s checked and acted upon exception
yes catching the runtimeexception and creating a new path inside your application isn t allowed because it s completely wrong to catch the runtimeexception as the main reason that it has been thrown has to mainly do with things like the resources of your system for example and such other things not related with your code

34908326
required	placeholder
the tf.matmul op required that both of its inputs are matrices 2-d tensors and doesn t perform any automatic conversion
your t1 variable is a matrix but your x placeholder is a length-2 vector a 1-d tensor which is the source of the error

34909941
google-chrome	firefox
try using google-chrome or safari if possible
it looks like this might be related to a bug where the graph visualization does not work in the firefox browser

34910248
swift	objective-c
but those don t cover all cases in particular it doesn t catch objective-c returning a pkphysicsbody instance which means any attempt to add initializers to skphysicsbody in swift will fail
because the objective-c alloc init process is reduced to one initializer call in swift. i d consider this a bug and recommend filing it with apple

34911674
hive	hdfs
currently importing of sequence files directly into hive is not supported yet
but you can import data --as-seuquencefile into hdfs and then you can create an external table on top of that

34913143
equals	gethashcode
also i m not convinced that your equals implementation makes any sense
when two objects are compared for equality first their gethashcode values are compared

34913143
equals	gethashcode
only if those are different is the equals method run so that if two objects that hash to the same value are different this will be detected
since your gethashcode implementation doesn t refer to the base it may make no sense for your equals method to do so

34914206
bash	subshell
from the bash manual subshell spawned to execute command substitutions inherit the value of the -e option from the parent shell
when not in posix mode bash clears the -e option in such subshells. example 2 behaves differently when bash runs with --posix

34914674
ssl	https
if you are communicating with a server that does not support ssl you can add an exception for that domain in your app s info.plist
ios 9 introduced app transport security which requires https and a minimum tls version

34920834
spaces	delimiter
those include spaces tab-characters and new-line characters
this is not a complete list of possible word delimiter but it s better than

34921090
email	dkim
the issue is because of google apps security. you can t use same email id with more than 2 apps. as gmail needs to sync it and it is obvious to receive such error
even setting spf txt dkim record is not enough for it

34921338
udp	tcp
for example udp especially if the messages aren t heavy and intense
usually when you terminate your write half of tcp connection it means that you re done with communicating and you just wait for your partner whether it s a server client or equal counterpart to finish with it s transmissions

34923152
cloudant	couchdb
note cloudant does not yet have the newer couchdb feature where the server will automatically hash the password for you cloudant auth lacks _users database so as the answer says see the couchdb wiki security page about hashing passwords
you will need to find a javascript sha1 implementation such as cryptojs cors you will likely need to enable cors which is also described in the cloudant documentation the cors chapter with all of the above things in place you can create users or change their passwords by updating documents

34923504
phpstorm	webstorm
that plugin is available for intellij idea only and not compatible with any other products like webstorm phpstorm etc possibly because it may require java-specific functionality that other ides do not provide
you can see all webstorm-compatible plugins if you switch to webstorm tab

34924587
postgresql	mysql
it s unclear which db you re using but keep in mind that some dbs doesn t support a timestamp with time zone column type as known from oracle and postgresql dbs
for example mysql does not support it

34924705
g++	gcc
in case of debian and ubuntu this can be done by apt-get install g++
the error given gcc x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc error trying to exec cc1plus execvp no such file or directory indicated that c++ compiler package was not installed

34927092
dictionary	map
if you need to lookup the pid of an agent for other reasons though because say your server sometimes needs to pro actively send data to a possibly connected host then you either have to get a list of all the supervised host agents and pick out the right one for this you would use supervisor which_children 1 as per hamidreza s answer or you would maintain a map of host ids to pids using map gb_trees dictionary ets etc
which is correct depends on how many hosts you could have - if it s more than a handful then you should proabably maintain a map of some sort so that the lookup time doesn t become too big

34928035
google-chrome	firefox
internet explorer wouldn t open it for me and the docs say google-chrome may not like the separate js file i had to use firefox
i just right clicked the file and picked open with firefox

34929583
lisp	racket
linked lists the lists you encounter by default in lisp don t support efficient random access
so since strings are arrays in racket you d expect there to be some counterpart to the x i notation which isn t very lispy

34930832
ffmpeg	libav
updated since doesn t affect mp3s since ffmpeg is known to have some mp4 codec issues another thing you can try is use avconv and avprobe instead of ffmpeg and ffprobe as post-processors for youtube-dl
you can download the latest windows binaries here libav windows binaries

34933421
client-side	server-side
being new to node typescript and webpack i failed to understand that webpack should be used for client-side scripts while the twilio-node library is a server-side library as discussed loosely here
in other words you shouldn t use require twilio in any client-side scripts...only node scripts

34933791
super	implements
a method declaration may override a super class method and implements multiple unrelated interface methods at the same time then when you use this naive approach and invoke printcandidates new b .getclass .getmethod foo
it will print candidate i1.foo candidate i2.foo candidate b.foo candidate a.foo but note that interfaces support multiple inheritance and also redundant implements specifications you may change above scenario as and we will get candidate i2.foo candidate i4.foo candidate i2.foo candidate b.foo candidate a.foo note how the declaration i2.foo appears twice but when i4.foo has an annotation it should have precedence as it overrides i2.foo whereas i1.foo doesn t appear but needs to be considered and is not overridden

34934901
ubuntu	linux
i then added a repo to ubuntu updated it and forced it to upgrade libstdc++6 sudo add-apt-repository ppa ubuntu-toolchain-r test sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get upgrade sudo apt-get install libstdc++6 problem solved tested with isql after that i tried testing using pdo_odbc php it then gave me the same driver not found error. to solve this i had to create a symbolic link to fix libodbcinst.so.2 sudo ln -s usr lib64 libodbcinst.so.2 lib x86_64-linux-gnu libodbcinst.so.2
i also had the same problem on ubuntu 14 after following the microsoft tutorial for sql server linux odbc driver

the file exists and after running an ldd it showed there were dependencies missing opt microsoft msodbcsql lib64 libmsodbcsql-13.0.so.0.0 usr lib x86_64-linux-gnu libstdc++.so.6 version glibcxx_3.4.20 not found required by opt microsoft msodbcsql lib64 libmsodbcsql-13.0.so.0.0 opt microsoft msodbcsql lib64 libmsodbcsql-13.0.so.0.0 usr lib x86_64-linux-gnu libstdc++.so.6 version cxxabi_1.3.8 not found required by after searching for a while i found its because ubuntu s repo didnt have glibcxx on version 3.4.20 it was at 3.4.19

34935706
swift	objective-c
this works only if you import foundation as swift is doing in that case some bridging to objective-c types - a nsarray -like object in this case
if you don t import foundation then you are not even allowed to make the assignment because a swift array is a struct and not an object

34935706
swift	objective-c
if you don t import foundation then you are not even allowed to make the assignment because a swift array is a struct and not an object
this is documented in the anyobject type description this means you can even call methods on your array that don t necessarily exist on nsarray but exists in the objective-c world like for example numbers.lowercasestring nil and swift will gracefully return you a nil value instead of throwing you a nasty object does not recognises selector exception like it would happen in objective-c

34936621
viewdidload	viewdidappear
first of all if you try to set the bounds of cashapelayer on viewdidload you ll get incorrect dimensions as for the superview isn t rendered on the device at the moment yet
it should be created on viewdidappear

34936748
ssl	https
your s3 redirection configuration stays the same but you ll create a cloudfront distribution configure your domain name as an alternative domain name there load your ssl cert into cloudfront use the bucket-name.s3-website-xx-xxxx-xx.amazonaws.com web site endpoint from the s3 console as the origin server and point route 53 to cloudfront instead of s3
no it s this the website endpoints do not support https

34938115
persistent	transient
transient annotation means that entity fields are fields that do not participate in persistent and their values are never stored in the database
try to remove transient annotation from azienda property of agente class

34938209
inline	inlining
as a minor bit of trivia which hopefully does not confuse you gnu gcc used to treat inline and extern inline exactly opposite the way that the c99 c11 standard treats them
in this case gnu would interpret inline as use this definition to inline with and produce the out-of-line externally visible definition of this function and it would treat extern inline as only use this definition for inlining

34938209
inline	inlining
in this case gnu would interpret inline as use this definition to inline with and produce the out-of-line externally visible definition of this function and it would treat extern inline as only use this definition for inlining
if inlining does not occur then emit an extern reference to the function which must be defined elsewhere

34938320
swift	objective-c
swift optimizes code to call direct memory addresses instead of looking up the method location at runtime as in objective-c
so by default swizzling doesn t work in swift classes unless we 1

34940104
required	placeholder
constraint validation if the element has its required attribute specified and either none of the option elements in the select element s list of options have their selectedness set to true or the only option element in the select element s list of options with its selectedness set to true is the placeholder label option then the element is suffering from being missing
if the value of the first option element in the select element s list of options if any is the empty string and that option element s parent node is the select element and not an optgroup element then that option is the select element s placeholder label option

34940104
factors	mean
the valid invalid pseudo-selectors can themselves help to style a select element depending on whether a value has been chosen or not but it depends on a few factors
they are as follows by chosen you mean to check if a valid value has been chosen and not just any choice

34941447
swift	objective-c
swift 3 does not require objective-c but swift 4 does sample
xcode 9 swift 4 you can addtarget to your text fields to monitor for the control event .editingchanged and use a single selector method for all of them create the selector method and use guard combined with where clause swift 3 4 uses a comma to make sure all text fields are not empty otherwise just return

34945129
decoder	encoder
maybe the header of the file required to initialize the video decoder is not at the start of the file but at the end and the browser has to download the whole file until it reaches it
this is uncommon nowadays but old video encoders used to place the mp4 header at the end of the file instead of at the beginning because it simplified the encoder s implementation

34949592
dataframe	multi-index
then you can reformat this multi-index as follows note that i included a _ here as my example dataframe column names did not yet have this
first you can reshape the dataframe with stack this gives you a series with a multi-index two index level from the original index and column names

34951197
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
this is what you want to emulate set the uitabbarcontroller as is initial view controller add a relationship to each scene whether it is a uinavigationcontroller or not if a scene is a uinavigationcontroller it will behave like any root navigation controller with its own view stack back button an so forth
running the app above then tapping on item 2 will present this navigation controller if you cannot make the uitabbarcontroller the initial view controller at launch you can make it become root later on using this technique this will present the architecture above albeit without animation nor any way to navigate back

34951861
laravel	yii
turned out that similarily to the laravel solutions above it may be caused by a wrong spelled or not yet existing table name wrong spelled or not yet existing column name duplicate foreign key name in the same database being used in different tables
this happened to me in yii 1.x migrations too

34954739
bmp	png	bmp	tga
bmp format do not support transparency at least most common 3 version only work gl_bgr mode and its masked modifications
use png dds tiff tga simplest instead

34954983
rdf	owl
rdf xml adds lots of complexity that you shouldn t have to worry about
the fact that you re working with an owl file makes things even more complex because owl is another abstract representation it s just axioms

34954983
rdf	owl
rdf triples rightarrow
rdf xml owl doesn t know anything about parse type collection and rdf xml serialization it just knows about owl

34954983
rdf	owl
rdf xml owl doesn t know anything about parse type collection and rdf xml serialization it just knows about owl
there s a mapping that knows about owl and about rdf and that s what produces the rdf triples

34954983
rdf	owl
there s a mapping that knows about owl and about rdf and that s what produces the rdf triples
rdf doesn t know anything about parse type collection

34955310
bash	zsh
here s an example function you could add to your .bashrc you may have to adjust if you use a shell other than bash
i think it should work with zsh and maybe ksh but i have not tested it with those

34956142
factors	matrix
it removes one item which is not a considerable amount given the other factors especially the recursion
a similar example that comes to mind is an n n 2d matrix

34956542
swift	objective-c	nsexception	nserror
if you re working on a swift project you could create an objective-c class which implements your nsfilehandle methods that catches the nsexception s like in this question but otherwise you re out of luck
seektoendoffile and writedata are not marked as throws they don t throw an nserror object which can be caught in with a do-try-catch block which means in the current state of swift the nsexception s raised by them cannot be caught

34958254
backgrounding	multitasking
what an application developer should know is that once an activity is in backgrounding home button pressed incoming call received etc. onpause followed by onstop have been invoked its process may similar to what you did with android.os.process.killprocess ... or may not be killed
see multitasking the android way by dianne hackborn for the reference

34959210
strcpy	strncpy
strcpy does not know how many characters to copy as mentioned by other engineer
you have to use strncpy function and then terminate the string by since 4 is the index of 5 th character which is max size

34962619
keystore	jks
it seems that the problem was with the certificate i was using. i tried to import the .crt file created with the keytool and then add it to a keystore programmatically. even though i am still not sure why it didn t work before i fixed this by skipping the certificate import and imported the keystore directly keystore.jks on windows server and keystore.bks on android client
this is how i created the keystore.jks keytool -genkeypair -alias serveralias -keyalg rsa -keysize 4096 -keystore keystore.jks -keypass changeit -storepass changeit -validity 10950 since jks is not supported on android i made a copy of the keystore and renamed the extension to .bks on the new one. then i used a program called keystore explorer to convert the keystore.bks to bks-v1 format so it works on android

34964208
bower	npm
i assume you ran the command bower install within your solution root folder so it must be somewhere otherwise bower install will close without changes
if you want to make it install again use the command bower install --force please make sure that you have git some packages and dependencies may require and node installed access the solution root path and run the following commands npm install assuming that one of the packages will be bower run bower install if not run npm install bower -g to install globally and so that you can run bower from any folder then

34964208
bower	npm
if you want to make it install again use the command bower install --force please make sure that you have git some packages and dependencies may require and node installed access the solution root path and run the following commands npm install assuming that one of the packages will be bower run bower install if not run npm install bower -g to install globally and so that you can run bower from any folder then
npm install bower to install on your solution then

34964336
strdup	malloc
you should allocate strlen word + 1 or use strdup word
you should not cast the return value of malloc either in function insert you call alpha multiple times this is inefficient you could use a switch statement function main has multiple issues you do not check if is provided to the program

34967887
implements	extends
but that doesn t implements list or anything familiar so freemarker doesn t know how to list it
if you extends defaultobjectwrapper or whatever object wrapper you are using so that it wraps jsonarray -s into a templatesquencemodel -s and then use configuration.setobjectwrapper yourcustomobjectwrapper then you will be able to list it

34970942
profiling	instrumentation
with time profiling you can measure usage cpu time not memory consumption
to inspect memory usage you can use xcode built in memory tool the 6th icon in xcode navigator or use allocations instrumentation for more detailed report

34972452
build.gradle	gradlew
it s not the presence of the build.gradle file that makes it gradle-based but it s how the project was set up in the first place
you ll need to re-import your project to finish the conversion to gradlew

34973213
union	distinct
if you want the true set union you need to run distinct on your resulting rdd
union method is not a set union operation

34977435
base	fractions
these two fractions have identical values the only real difference being that the first is written in base 10 fractions notation and the second in base 2
unfortunately most decimal fractions cannot be represented exactly as binary fractions

34979745
client-side	server-side
this is useful for pure client-side apps such as mobile apps or javascript-based apps
unfortunately for the case of client-side python apps the oauth flow in the dropbox python sdk is currently only built with server-side apps in mind and so only implements the code flow and not the token flow

34980492
prng	random
the prng-generated sequence is not truly random because it is completely determined by a relatively small set of initial values called the prng s seed if you create the random instance using the constructor that accepts a seed you will always get the same sequence of random numbers
this can be very useful because it allows you to do deterministic simulations of computations that require random numbers

34980590
ssl	https
the ssl directive is used to enforce the listening socket to understand ssl
however in your case it doesn t make sense to have the socket listening on 80 to use https

34983559
rtp	rtsp
direct sdp playback is useful essentially only if you have a broadcast multicast rtp stream or a continuous push rtp stream not if you have a vod stream that would otherwise be issued by rtsp
when you receive the sdp from the server during a rtsp request it is customized by the server to tell you where it s going to send the stream it s starting

34983751
move	drag
you ve move one tab. rinse and repeat for the other tabs
this isn t exactly what you re asking for but i think this is close enough drag the tab from the source window to the target window and hover near the other tabs in the source window

34987275
jar	war
this means that rather than trying to build both a jar and a war you can just run the war using java -jar
the problem is that spring boot s maven plugin isn t involved in the creation of the jar so it hasn t been made executable

34987275
jar	war
the problem is that spring boot s maven plugin isn t involved in the creation of the jar so it hasn t been made executable
when spring boot repackages a war file it is made executable

34990604
jar	manifest.mf
ordinary jar files in the root of an ear file are not accessible to any other modules without additional configuration such as the addition of a meta-inf manifest.mf file containing a class-path entry in your web module
an easier alternative to this is to place your resources jar in the lib directory of your ear file

34992290
symfony	silex
i would think that it is the same for silex as it is build on symfony
in symfony you need to change the type in your formtype for older versions of symfony it looks like this the twig doesn t care about the input type

34993938
libstdc++	libc++
libstdc++ shipped their file system library as part of the 5.3 release
libc++ has a file system library in development but it will not be part of the upcoming 3.8 release

34995389
floating-point	fractions
floating-point numbers are subject to rounding errors since some fractions could require infinite number of digits to be expressed without rounding and computers are not handling infinite number of anything very well naturally
and decimal floating-point numbers in binary-based computers could be even trickier

34996555
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i ve also tested the alternative code which can be found here which seems to have better current support through all browsers google-chrome firefox opera safari ie 10 ie 11 the working implementations seem to change year to year so i wanted to offer an update of what i ve found myself to work at the moment
i just wanted to write a quick note of what i ve observed now in 2016 of the different approached suggested the above codes offered by netcoder and david work for me in the following browsers google-chrome opera it does not seem to work in firefox safari or ie 10-11

34996901
swift	objective-c
the swift code is much better overall
the objective-c code works but isn t really the proper way

34997173
svg	vml
i don t think you can give it an existing element to use as svg
i suspect this is because raphael does not only create svg but possibly vml if its one of the very old browser versions

swift	objective-c
so based on my research till now it can t be done i even tried subclassing the nsproxy class in swift but just couldn t call the super.init and code never compiles but however same thing works in objective c so i ended up doing this approach i created a protocol using note the keyword objective-c before protocol is essential else you would not be able to pass it as a variable also adding objective-c limits the usage of protocol to objective c runtime features so don t expect to get full features of protocols in swift if you need to use it in some dictionary or places where it should conform to nscopying class then use nsstringfromprotocol and nsprotocolfromstring methods now i have wrote a objective c helper class to do the initialization objchelper.h objchelper.m now to use it however in future if anyone can offer a better answer then please be sure to post it here
comparing with objective c and swift swift offers extremely limited access to runtime language access

35004679
swift	objective-c
swift does away with the alloc init initialization pattern from objective-c and replaces it with a construction syntax similar to that seen in java or c++
when in a swift class interface or in apple s documentation you see something like that means you can create a thing by calling it with the following construction syntax it doesn t matter if it s a class or a struct or if you see other things like convenience or required or public before init .

build.gradle	gradlew
for completeness this is the setup i was creating pretty much simultaneously with hotkey main settings.gradle include shared client server main build.gradle client build.gradle server build.gradle shared project s build.gradle contains only apply plugin kotlin and well i m not sure if using shared libraries is straightforward or necessary in many cases so i guess it could even stay empty
gradlew client build generates javascript file in server s static resources folder

35005186
bash	subshell
the bash manual says expands to the process id of the shell
in a subshell it expands to the process id of the invoking shell not the subshell

35005803
uptime	reboot
you can check how recently the system was reboot with uptime or some similar command
if the system has been reboot and the containers have not been restarted afterward you can focus troubleshooting on the systemd unit file and service startup

35007278
onresume	onpause
when an activity is first run it will call oncreate and after it is created it will call onstart to get the activity started which proceed on to onresume
when the application enter another activity the previous activity will be onpause and onstop if i m not wrong

35013614
build.gradle	gradlew
broken structure android-multi-project-sample + .gralde + .idea + app + build + gradlew + myapplication2 - .gitignore - android-multi-project-sample.iml - build.gradle - gradle.properties - gradlew - gradlew.bat - local.properties - settings.gradle results in the following error error 8 0 cannot change dependencies of configuration myapplication2 classpath after it has been resolved
working structure with upper case sub project android-multi-project-sample + .gralde + .idea + app + build + gradlew + myapplication2 upper case

35013950
spaces	delimiter
this way you will not need to add those spaces manually
as of jdk 1.8 you can use a stringjoiner which is more convenient in your case stringjoiner is used to construct a sequence of characters separated by a delimiter and optionally starting with a supplied prefix and ending with a supplied suffix

35014997
ubuntu	linux
system info mysql workbench community gpl for linux unix version 6.2.3 revision 12312 build 2280 64 bit configuration directory home arsen .mysql workbench data directory usr share mysql-workbench cairo version 1.13.1 os linux 3.13.0-76-generic cpu 4x intel r core tm 2 quad cpu 2.40ghz 1596.000mhz - 5 83gib ram distribution ubuntu 14.04.3 lts
if option diagram properties and size is disabled grayed out you can try to run mysqlworkbench with sudo sudo usr bin mysql-workbench i am not good at linux there should be some miss-configuration leading to this

35017585
prepare	execute
if the element has a src attribute does not have an async attribute and does not have the force-async flag set the element must be added to the end of the list of scripts that will execute in order as soon as possible associated with the document of the script element at the time the prepare a script algorithm started
the task that the networking task source places on the task queue once the fetching algorithm has completed must run the following steps if the element is not now the first element in the list of scripts that will execute in order as soon as possible to which it was added above then mark the element as ready but abort these steps without executing the script yet

35020134
libstdc++	libc++
libstdc++ does not comply with this requirement but libc++ does the ios_base failbit should be set on it s respective istream on events such as the numeric pointer and boolean input overloads of technically the overloads of num_get get they call if the input cannot be parsed as a valid value or if the value parsed does not fit in the destination type
source if only the ios_base failbit is set on a basic_istream exceptions mask and an event occurs causing the ios_base failbit to be set such as extracting an invalid number as described above under libstdc++ an exception is still rethrown which does not conform to the standard under libc++ no such exception is thrown meaning the standard is upheld libc++ invalidates bugs requesting it s mirroring of libstdc++ behavior there is a now invalidated bug against libc++ for this very issue

35020493
gridview	sqldatasource
to get around that each child gridview will need its own data source
you could continue the way you are and create a separate sqldatasource for each of the child gridviews but i m guessing the amount of child gridviews is not constant

35020493
gridview	sqldatasource
you could continue the way you are and create a separate sqldatasource for each of the child gridview but i m guessing the amount of child gridview is not constant
in that case you will need to get rid of the child sqldatasource and bind a data source such as a datatable to each child gridview

35024341
daemons	systemd
the only thing d-bus needs in order to work is the d-bus server daemons itself
this is invoked via dbus-launch which can be integrated into shell startup scripts in the event that the x init systemd isn t used

35027923
ssl	https
if it s not builder.. then the request is redirected to ssl
try this you can also use a rewritecond to exclude builder from the https rediretion the rewritecond checks to ensure that the requested uri is not builder

35028046
noexcept	throw
returning a null pointer from an operator new means allocation failed but only if the function is declared noexcept otherwise the function most throw a std bad_alloc or something derived from it
as it stands your program has undefined behavior if you add noexcept you should find the constructor isn t called as the function now correctly signals that allocation failed

35029207
http	spdy
it is with http
you should not serve gzipped content over http spdy http2

35029207
http	spdy
you should not serve gzipped content over http spdy http2
there are two attacks that are possible when you serve gzipped content over http crime and breach

35036066
factors	matrix
from image coordinates alone we don t know scale factors
so when we multiply inverse of homography matrix x y z are not equal to x y z

35036959
required	placeholder
alternatively you could write custom extractors if there are relatively few different getx functions then your code becomes simple pattern-matching like this if the node-finding rules are so irregular that it s not amenable to any of these approaches you can at least use a for comprehension that s the equivalent code to what you gave which you may find more aesthetically pleasing sadly because you ve heavily anonymised the question and don t indicate how many of these lookups would be required or how complex they are i can t recommend a specific solution
if geta etc are placeholder for something with parameters like getvalue a you can write a simple function that took root and a b c and easily walk the tree checking for nulls along the way

35038731
swift	objective-c
the advantage of the first variant is that you don t have to use the objective-c attribute on your method and you can even just use a closure instead of a method if you want you can use the returned value to stop listening for the notification later notificationcenter.default.removeobserver observer there used to be another advantage in using this method which was that it doesn t require you to use selector strings which couldn t be statically checked by the compiler and so were fragile to breaking if the method is renamed but swift 2.2 and later include #selector expressions that fix that problem
a nice way of doing this is to use the addobserver forname object queue using method rather than the addobserver _ selector name object method that is often used from objective-c code

35043080
noexcept	throw
and according to the way that implicit exception specifications are determined in except.spec 16 since an implementation can add both arbitrary parameters with default arguments and members it s implementation-specific whether or not these special member functions are noexcept
consider lwg 1371 none of the exception types defined in clause 19 are allowed to throw an exception on copy or move operations but there is no clear specification that the operations have an exception specification to prove it

35043525
inline	inlining
in release mode il is identical and both versions of validate are inline in this particular example
you cannot rely on inlining always if a function is big then compiler could choose not to inline it this is true for methods i am not 100 sure this is true for f# nested functions

35043525
inline	inlining
you cannot rely on inlining always if a function is big then compiler could choose not to inline it this is true for methods i am not 100 sure this is true for f# nested functions
it is not possible to mark them inline and force inlining - need to consult f# specs if such functions behave like methods or are always inlined in release

35044284
ubuntu	debian
the debian packages should be independent of the ubuntu version you re using
debian packages for neo4j are not experimental - in contrast to rpm packages

35045719
floating-point	fixed-point
iostreams are a pain for formatting floating-point values
you should store integer pennies or tenth-pennies because though you re not measuring in whole numbers of dollars your values are actually fixed-point

35048461
uilabel	uitextview
if my theory is true your code should look something like this in any other case where the naamitem is not an uilabel uitextview or uitextfield you should make sure the naamitem is of type string
i bet your naamitem is a uilabel or something like that and you forgot to append the .text

35050079
antivirus	norton
if you trust the suppliers of pywin32 more than you trust the suppliers of norton disable or uninstall your antivirus and go ahead with installing pywin32
i can t make the decision for you which one you trust more but in my opinion in general antivirus today simply doesn t work

35053376
mongodb	bson
and of course if you did not want to store the order permanantly then arrays can at least be manipulated in the aggregation framework in a manner that will usually be more efficient than processing via javascript of mapreduce or even super fancy over multiple documents with new mongodb 3.2 operators but the most performant consideration in all cases is that the data should be an array and not nested under named keys of an object ideally be stored in the order of the most common use case for access on reading
the final thing to really look at here is that if you really intend to store 50 000 messages in an array or even a single document because no-one ever exaggerates wildly when asking questions on stackoverflow then these would always be better off existing in their own collection where even if the bson document limit were not exceeded the most likely event would be it was exceeded the performance considerations would indeed be terrible

35056527
qthread	qobject
filereader should be a qobject and not a qthread subclass
then you create a basic qthread object and move your worker reader to it using qobject movetothread

35060940
xsl-fo	xslt
one possibility to achieve this is converting the xml-file to xsl-fo and then use apache-fop to transform it to a postscript-file with fop -xml input.xml -xsl xml2fo.xsl -ps output.ps at the moment i couldn t find a simple xsl-file on the net for this task but this depends on what you like the output to look anyway
creating a basic xslt for this transformation should not be that hard

35061812
build.gradle	gradlew
a adding to build.gradle
b setting options miscellaneous gradlew task execution automatic tasks to netbeans should not add tasks automatically

35061913
clang	llvm
so far as i can tell there is no command-line option to list which architectures a given clang binary supports and even running strings on it doesn t really help
clang is essentially just a c to llvm translator and it s llvm itself that deals with the nitty-gritty of generating actual machine code so it s not entirely surprising that clang isn t paying much attention to the underlying architecture

35062389
erlang	elixir
variables in erlang have to start with a capital letter
variables in elixir on the other hand do not

35064229
uiview	subviews
it seems that your view hierarchy is self.view - uiscrollview - uiview - uitextfields
in this case the for loop on will not give you uitextfield s as they are not direct subviews of self.view

35064254
factors	matrix
one is that the order of the factors matters because it s just coercing that out and selecting columns by factors level not by the column name
the other is that the resulting output is a character not a numeric because in the conversion to a matrix the type character is chosen because of the key column

35064461
portrait	landscape
let s say view a is one of the landscape views of your app and b is the intended portrait view
now when the device is initially held in portrait on a and b is then accessed the view doesn t change the orientation to portrait since the device was already in portrait

35064461
portrait	landscape
now when the device is initially held in portrait on a and b is then accessed the view doesn t change the orientation to portrait since the device was already in portrait
i d suggest tell system that b is initially in landscape while preparing the segue and then in your viewdidload for b s view controller change the orientation to portrait

35064571
retrofit	okhttp
you can find them here edit since retrofit 2 relies on okhttp for network operations you will not need to add okhttp dependency explicitly once you have added the retrofit2
also imho use retrofit 2.0 although its still in beta in my opinion its mature enough

35067002
move	drag
you likely want your callback code to look more like this this sets the drag bounds of your header view to move freely between the top of the container view and the bottom clamping it so it doesn t go off-screen
by itself this will only move the header view

35069181
decimal	ieee
the analogy only extends so far the mantissa is a modification of the coefficient found in the decimal scientific notation you might be familiar with and there are certain bit patterns that have special meaning in the standard
the ultimate result of this storage mechanism is that the integer 760500000 cannot be exactly represented by ieee 754 binary32 with its 23-bit mantissa it loses integer-level precision after the integer at 2 mantissa_bits + 1 which is 16777217 for 23-bit mantissa floats

35071427
swift	objective-c
unfortunately there isn t a way to do this purely with swift
however you can expose the property in an objective-c file in your test target and then put that in your test target s bridging header

35072276
bower	npm
if you want to use npm on the client you may consider using bower which is designed for that purpose
the node module system is not compatible with browsers so bower transpiles the javascript into something that will work

35076203
rvm	bundler
i can tell from your path that you are also using rvm gemsets which complicates the matter a bit further but this is confusing enough so i didn t go into that -- everything i wrote still stands except your system-wide gems is really the current rvm gemset
personally i believe you d be better off not using the rvm gemset feature -- things are confusing enough without it and it isn t really needed anymore now that we have bundler rvm gemsets were invented before bundler existed several years ago

35079826
implements	extends
coming back to your question regarding the example code in journaldev article shape is abstraction triangle is redefinedabstraction color is implementor redcolor is concreteimplementor a concrete shape object triangle extends shape but does not implements the color interface
redcolor and greencolor actually implements the color interface

35082912
comparator	comparable
so you will have to supply a suitable comparator yourself
also atomicinteger does not implement comparable and that is why you cannot use map.entry.comparingbyvalue

35087391
bower	npm
i needed to install the version by specifing it explicit sudo npm install -q bower 1.3.8 and yes i had to run this with sudo
for me npm install -update bower was not sufficient

35089143
fgets	fseek
fgets would stop reading input if it sees a newline
also fseek may not work on stdin and it s unnecessary for your purpose

35091533
implements	extends
it just wouldn t have been possible to implements c++03 without it

35091634
implements	extends
i came upon this question in 2016 there are much easier ways to implements this than the accepted answer and the highest voted one
use an xmpp php library the most common one being while this library doesn t support adding a user out of the box you can very easily extends it here is the class i wrote for adding a user you must enable in-band registration in the ejabberd.cfg file as it s denied by default access register allow all

35093182
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
1.png is a red square 2.png is a blue square another option for imagemagick is like this convert -background cyan -bordercolor lime 1.png -rotate 15 -border 5 -background yellow -bordercolor magenta 2.png -rotate 15 -border 5 +append result.png or this convert -background cyan -bordercolor lime 1.png -rotate 15 -border 5 -background yellow -bordercolor magenta 2.png -rotate 15 -border 5 -append result.png
this is how you could do it with imagemagick but graphicsmagick doesn t indeed seem to want to do rotation and borders

35094209
dictionary	map
a dictionary is a hash table built for o 1 lookup time
a dictionary is also known as a map data structure because it implements a mapping like a function specifically a goes to 1 b goes to 2 and thus dictionaries have an implies direction in this case abc- 123 not 123- abc

35099458
pthreads	fork
to discern executables requiring the pthreads emulation layer from the ones that do not the latter are called mingw minimal gnu for windows when the former are called msys executables
this reliance on msys incurred challenges too though some of our changes to the msys runtime -- necessary to support git for windows better -- were not accepted upstream so we had to maintain our own fork

35101719
addition	multiplication
using a logarithm only seems to reduce accuracy overall first because of the logarithm itself and second because floating-point addition of numbers of differing magnitudes is not well-behaved
unless you care about the difference between a probability of 2 -1024 and a probability of zero for some reason that your question does not tell i do not see why you would want to change the well-behaved multiplication in the first formula into the peril-fraught additions in the second one

35103681
innodb	myisam
if your table engine is myisam it would be much faster because it would simply read number of rows in the table from stored value however innodb engines will need to do a full table scan
it is not recommended to store a count inside of the table itself so if this is something you re worried about use the myisam engine if possible

35104023
sudo	passwd
now open up the file and edit the parameters to your liking sudo nano odoo_install.sh there are some things you can configure change to your likings at the top of the script
you can choose if you wish to install wkhtmltopdf or not which version you d like where the location is and most importantly what the master admin passwd is

35104126
primes	modulus
an lcg has a full period if and only if the modulus and the increment are relatively primes a - 1 is divisible by all primes factors of m if m is divisible by 4 a - 1 must be divisible by 4
our modulus is 2 32 meaning a must be a number of form 4k + 1 where k is an arbitrary integer and c must not be divisible by 2

35105646
vsto	add-in
if an application does not load your vsto add-in the application might have hard disabled or soft disabled your vsto add-in
hard disabling can occur when an vsto add-in causes the application to close unexpectedly

35105646
vsto	add-in
it might also occur on your development computer if you stop the debugger while the startup event handler in your vsto add-in is executing
soft disabling can occur when a vsto add-in produces an error that does not cause the application to unexpectedly close

35105646
vsto	add-in
soft disabling can occur when a vsto add-in produces an error that does not cause the application to unexpectedly close
for example an application might soft disable a vsto add-in if it throws an unhandled exception while the startup event handler is executing

35105646
vsto	add-in
when you re-enable a soft-disabled vsto add-in the application immediately attempts to load the vsto add-in
if the problem that initially caused the application to soft disable the vsto add-in has not been fixed the application will soft disable the vsto add-in again

35105791
calloc	malloc
note that calloc nmemb size cannot just call because of potential arithmetic overflow which in the case of size_t arguments is defined in the standard
for example calloc -1 -1 must fail but instead would return malloc 1 if naively calling

implements	extends
using java 8 as an example setlength is implements in abstractstringbuilder
it does a few things errors if the new length 0 ensures that the stringbuilder has enough capacity for the new length which it will if you re shortening the length fills in 0s for the additional length if you re extends the length which you re not sets the this.count field to the length you specify putting it all together if you re shortening the length this is o 1 a few quick checks and then a field assignment

innodb	myisam
if you want to use transactions than make sure you can only apply this for innodb or bdb table types not for myisam
if you are using innodb and want to use t rans_begin than make sure after execution of all queries you need to use trans_commit otherwise this will not display anything in your database

access_key your api key returns limitations 10 000 requests per month requires ip address parameter requires registration to get your api key no ssl https with the free plan jsonip.com try it returns limitations the response includes upsell and politics json test try it returns limitations no ssl https goes down a lot over quota so i wouldn t use it for production returns ipv6 address if you have one which may not be what you want nekudo try it returns limitations blocked by ad blockers using the easyprivacy list stupid web tools try it returns limitations no ssl https keep in mind that since these are all free services your mileage may vary in terms of exceeding quota and uptime and who knows when if they will be taken offline down the road exhibit a telize
most of these services also offer a paid tier in case you want more features like ssl support

35124012
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
reload the tableview in viewdidappear or viewdidlayoutsubviews method will make it to work
reason why your code not worked actually as per view life cycle the methods are called in following manner init loadview viewdidload viewwillappear viewwilllayoutsubviews called more than once viewdidlayoutsubviews called multiple time and lastly viewdidappear

reason why your code not worked actually as per view life cycle the methods are called in following manner init loadview viewdidload viewwillappear viewwilllayoutsubviews called more than once viewdidlayoutsubviews called multiple time and lastly viewdidappear
now actually the tableview get loaded in method viewdidload whereas the autolayout constraints that you apply were going to be applied after that method

35124704
udp	tcp
this might include switching from udp protocol to tcp or rewriting your code as an in-kernel driver or switching to a real-time os that can make better guarantees about response times
the first thing to understand and accept is that you cannot guarantee that no udp packets will be dropped

35126141
ssl	https
note ssl tls can be used with a certificate not signed by a trusted authority but the client will show a warning about that
https is http inside a ssl tls tunnel

vaadin	wicket
i wil be short in my observations vaadin is entitled to be free but imo is not so beautiful like that
if you need support help documentation for that painful and tricky problems that you encounter then you are screwed because you do not have so good documentation community when compared with wicket

35127579
vaadin	wicket
vaadin also requires good java knowledge but you can easily do some spaghetti code if you want just saying not doing..
wicket really separate the web technologies javascript html etc. from the framework technology java

the end of the text indicates the end if a sentence if not otherwise ended through proper punctuation
sentences must be at least two words long unless a linebreak or end-of-text

35133579
implements	extends
the reason for the components not showing up despite you already set the bounds for the components is because you are implements your gui in a bad manner and in the wrong order
first of all it is not advisable to extends a class to jframe unless you have a valid reason doing so instead you may extends to a jpanel and add your customized jpanel to the jframe

35133974
namedtuple	dictionary
you could create a class or you could use a dictionary or you could use a namedtuple
it s not entirely clear from your question how you intend to use them but with all of these solutions class dictionary namedtuple you can pass the objects around as a single entity

35139056
kerberos	ntlm
microsoft has been strongly advising everyone to switch to kerberos and stop using ntlm wherever possible since windows2000 was released
kerberos performance and security is far better than ntlmv1 or ntlmv2. it s not even up for debate

35139056
kerberos	ntlm
kerberos performance and security is far better than ntlmv1 or ntlmv2. it s not even up for debate
every third packet needs to be sent to the domain controller for challenge response when using ntlm

35139759
multiplying	subtract
keep in mind that we don t need the values on the diagonal as is equal to 0 and we are only missing cases where and so that s why we multiplying by 2. we then multiplying by k and get p
it s not clear how you want to normalize so i just subtract the mean and divided that by the standard deviation

35140865
bash	zsh
history is an extension feature available in other shells such as bash ksh and zsh but not generally in sh on some operating systems sh is a link to bash but bash checks the name it was run with and disables many extensions when called as sh
you could do shell_exec bash -c history

35141887
swift	objective-c
not the answer i was hoping for unfortunately although swift error handling resembles exception handling in objective-c it is entirely separate functionality
if an objective-c method throws an exception during runtime swift triggers a runtime error

35142599
daemons	systemd
the python-daemon code doesn t dictate how to use that daemons in a service
to implement the service you need something to run that daemons systemd init upstart launchd all can do the job

35143014
postgresql	mysql
for example according to this answer postgresql doesn t allow modifying constraints in alter table statement
mysql also doesn t allow modifying constraints

35143438
sudo	passwd
to reset the passwd follow these steps can be helpful if you really forget your passwd and you can try it anytime even if you re not in the situation at the moment stop mysql sudo etc init.d mysql stop or for other distribution versions sudo etc init.d mysqld stop start mysql in safe mode log into mysql using root mysql -uroot select the mysql database to use use mysql
reset the passwd flush the privileges flush privileges

35144687
gson	jackson
if you are using gson jackson or any such json parser libraries i think retrofit uses one internally i m not sure you need to -keep any and all pojo classes and its fields and its names
edit adding serializedname in case of gson annotations to the java pojo class fields also helps as then gson doesn t have to reflect and get the field names which proguard changes and therefore gson will use wrong json field names to parse json

35145303
bash	zsh
in bash ksh88+ mksh pdksh or zsh you can also use expression or let expression
though not used originaly in the script while programming in bash it is worth knowing that is a bash keyword similar to but more powerful than the command

35147232
profiling	benchmarking
one is compilation profiling separation as discussed by rafael above
but this behaviour is not controlled by the forks annotation unless you choose 0 forks which means no subprocesses are forked to run benchmarking at all

35160951
lxml	beautifulsoup	lxml	html5lib
what you want to do works if you use lxml instead of html.parser from the documentation that said there are things you can do to speed up beautifulsoup
if you re not using lxml as the underlying parser my advice is to start. beautifulsoup parses documents significantly faster using lxml than using html.parser or html5lib

35161606
oncreate	onstart
according to the documents only oncreate and ondestroy will be omitted since the fragment is not created or destroyed
however onactivitycreated onstart and onattach are always called

in swift 3 it looks like the access level of a method is correctly imported from swift to objective-c and does not need to be marked as ns_unavailable in order to disallow it from being available

swift	objective-c
in swift 3 it looks like the access level of a method is correctly imported from swift to objective-c and does not need to be marked as ns_unavailable in order to disallow it from being available
of course there is no new method in swift so that will still need to be marked as ns_unavailable to maintain the singleton properly

google-chrome	firefox
it doesn t mention anything about applying this behavior when the display state changes as google-chrome is apparently doing only when the element is first inserted into the dom
this actually appears to a be a bug in google-chrome as firefox is following the html spec

35170057
setcontentview	findviewbyid
edit because creating dialog object no need to in inflate again which is passed in setcontentview for accessing view s just use dialog object to call findviewbyid method like
problem is occurring because button click listener is added to button s using dialogbuttonsview view object but it is not pass as dialog view to setcontentview method.change dialog.setcontentview r.layout.dialog_main

35171489
quicksort	heapsort
this cannot be achieved with a pure quicksort so modern library sort algorithms are actually based on introsort or similar
this algorithm falls back to a different sorting algorithm -- normally heapsort -- if it detects that the partitioning is too biased

35173432
ssl	https
it s safe because you re using ssl
basic authentication isn t acceptable for plain-text requests but since https encrypts everything it shouldn t be an issue

35176084
equals	compareto
your compareto implementation may tell that two objects are not equals despite an equals test would return true
this would never happen with bigdecimal or any other practical example of a natural ordering not consistent with equals i know of

35182833
spaces	delimiter
otherwise it stands for the whole matched portion of the pattern spaces see the manual
is not an optimal choice for the substitution delimiter ndash

35184634
implements	extends
the proper way to implements this decorator would be to do
trying to extends a function that has been created via .bind is not going to work for you

35188004
tvos	ios
pods for different targets can be separated in podfile using most pods at the moment do not support tvos
for those pods here are the steps to make them work in your project clone the git repo on your local disk if a version of the pod is being used in another target ios target change the name otherwise cocoapods will complain restkit -- restkittv and use path in podfile to point to the location of the cloned repo update the podspec file in the cloned repo modify the name to be compatible with the new name change the platform to tvos or add tvos to the list of supported platforms or add files to the target add source code .m files to compile sources of build phases for the target add images to copy bundle resources add frameworks to link binary with libraries

35189561
quicksort	mergesort
a good example for this is quicksort vs
mergesort - in general mergesort is consistently faster than quicksort however quicksort is done in place and doesn t require allocating memory unlike mergesort

35192941
punctuation	words
you may want to add other possibilities here like punctuation
the issue is that b is only for boundaries around ascii characters as stated in the docs at ascii words boundary w on one side and w a or z on the other and é is not ascii

35194178
matlab	simulink
i know about digits function in matlab so if you have model main computations makes in matlab function block you can try this but this not be really what you want
looks like we can t control simulink precision by our hands in simple way but i find two interesting methods go to configuration parameters hardware implementation and choose here microcontroller you need

35195097
viewdidload	viewdidappear
once the tab bar view controller is loaded you can use the delegate methods to inject updated dependencies and use it in viewdidappear because viewdidload will not get called once its selected in the tab bar
in the rootviewcontroller s viewdidload you can iterate thru childviewcontrollers and find the various child controllers that you want and set the dependency to each of them

35195194
google-chrome	firefox
you can implement it via google-chrome logger which has also a php extension available
besides that you can try it with the newest version of firephp but as far as i can tell it works only with firebug 2.x which doesn t work while firefox is working in multi-process mode

35195639
dictionary	map
if all the words in words are keys in your dictionary d the solution is as simple as if there are non-overlapping words use where default is some default value in case a key cannot be found in the dictionary
map sum value_pairs will give you the sum of the elements

35195988
division	subtraction
there the part creates a matrix division which results in the n n shape rather then the expected n 1 shape
therefore the subtraction does not work any more

35203471
spaces	delimiter
more generically when processing a batch of files some of which have spaces some not just skip the grep ls | sed s| | |g | xargs ... then of course the filename may have other whitespace than blanks a tab that assumes you have a sed that supports -r extended regex such as gnu sed or recent versions of bsd sed freebsd which originally spelled the option -e before freebsd 8 and supports both -r -e for compatibility through freebsd 11 at least
otherwise you can use a basic regex character class bracket expression and manually enter the space and tab characters in the delimiter

35204414
operands	scalar
i believe what you re thinking of are cases like this the value computations of the operands of an operator are sequenced before the value computation of the result of the operator
if a side effect on a scalar object is unsequenced relative to either another side effect on the same scalar object or a value computation using the value of the same scalar object and they are not potentially concurrent 1.10 the behavior is undefined

35205399
bower	npm
bin bash npm install node_modules bower bin bower install before running the new job be sure that bower is included in the dependencies list in your package.json file dependencies bower 1.6.5
if you have devdependencies that bower depends on npm install will not install them

35205399
bower	npm
if you have devdependencies that bower depends on npm install will not install them
as a workaround you can move the required dependencies to the dependencies section of your package.son file or you can run bower install locally before pushing your app

35206820
lisp	scheme
in scheme lisp every if returns a value
it isn t quite a full function is lisp due to the limitation of the internal structure of the interpreter or compiler but for most purposes you can treat it as just another function

35206832
interpolation	splines
i can t seem to use poly with degree 23 but using a lesser degree is already enough to show you why this won t work this does more or less go through all the points and it would indeed if i managed to use an even higher order polynomial but otherwise it s probably not the kind of smooth curve you want. a better option is to use interpolation with splines
this is also an interpolation that uses polynomials but instead of using just one as you tried it uses many

35211074
dictionary	map
you need to manually map a dictionary to a custom object for yourself
the dynamodb object mapper for android currently does not support complex data type mapping for the array and map

35212350
super	self
the most important thing to remember about super is that inside foo.go you do not know what class super foo self will refer to because you do not know if self is an instance of foo or a descendent of foo
despite its name super does not necessarily refer to a superclass

35212350
super	self
despite its name super does not necessarily refer to a superclass
super b self refers to the class in self s mro that follows b

35212350
super	self
you can see the mro for d with this means that from d.go super d self refers to b
when b.go is called as a result super b self refers to c not a

35212350
super	self
when b.go is called as a result super b self refers to c not a
this is because self is still an instance of d so it is d.__mro__ that dictates what gets called next not the static superclass of b

35213113
build.gradle	gradlew
in build.gradle change the classpath dependency for the hibernate4 plugin at the top of the file in the buildscript dependencies .
section as follows classpath org.grails.plugins hibernate5 5.0.1 the classpath section is there for the gradlew scrips like schemaexport and that section does not support auto versioning

35214158
build.gradle	gradlew
i should note that many other posts on the net regarding this topic suggest setting your runner to com.android.test.runner.multidextestrunner and exculde some dependencies in com.android.support multidex-instrumentation 1.0.1 in your build.gradle
that solution appears to no longer be the case and doesn t work as of gradlew 1.5.0

35214904
setinterval	settimeout
the reason i like to use settimeout and not setinterval in these situations is that settimeout is only called after the previous function has completed
setinterval can get back-logged and freeze up your page

35216636
super	self
in python 3 you can write the far simpler super .__init__ ... this is yet another reason to upgrade
you want this super comparativeannotatorconfiguration.transmap self .__init__ ... this is a consequence of python s class scoping rules class variables are not in scope inside methods

35219039
multiplying	multiplication
if you want to use row and column vectors then by the standard rules of matrix multiplication you need to multiplying a 1-by-n array a row vector by an n-by-1 array a column vector to get a 1-by-1 result and numpy will give you a 1-by-1 array rather than a scalar
dot for 2d input is matrix multiplication not a dot product

35224672
arraylist	treeset
for ex add arraylist is o 1 but for treeset it is o logn search for arraylist is o n and for treeset is is o logn and so on.
that is major difference apart from internal implementation and this enables treeset to provide functions like subset tailset headset which are not possible with a arraylist

35224672
arraylist	treeset
that is major difference apart from internal implementation and this enables treeset to provide functions like subset tailset headset which are not possible with a arraylist
presence of prefix tree creates a confusion about visualizing a treeset as a hierarchical data structure or linear one

35226019
onclick	onsubmit
you will have to use onclick instead of onsubmit
onsubmit is valid for a form not for a button

35227550
noexcept	throw
this member function is not marked noexcept for two reasons noexcept has been used very sparingly in the std lib
in general durations are allowed to be based on arithmetic emulators which might have a throw copy constructor

35229958
seaborn	matplotlib
the left axis is from seaborn not matplotlib
you can turn it off using in response to tcaswell comment bellow seaborn adds splines to the plot

35232236
bmp	png
consider ext_list would expand to png bmp and since the expansion is not quoted ext would be assigned png then bmp
if you incorrectly wrote then ext would take png bmp gif then tif as its values

35232636
bower	npm
rxjs 5 has not been added to bower no
at this point npm is recommended

35234037
multiplication	modulo
you then sum up those multiplication
you perform a modulo on the above summation with the number 11 that is sum 11 if the modulo return back 0 then the given isbn is valid if anything else then is not

35234037
multiplying	modulo
as you can see from the above reference your mistakes are the following you don t multiplying the 10th digit by 10
an isbn is valid if the modulo returns 0 and not 10 as you wrote

35234495
inline	inlining	inline-functions	inlining
under some circumstances it may inline every call to an internal or inline-functions so that that function does not appear as a separate function at all
at other times it may indeed emit a function with internal linkage but that does not prevent it from inlining some calls to that function anyway

35234883
serializable	deserialization
i like sticking with attributes on this one here is the method i use when needing to deserialize a property but not serializable it or vice versa
step 1 - create the custom attribute step 2 - create a custom contract reslover step 3 - add attribute where serialization is not needed but deserialization is step 4 - use it hope this helps

35236138
uilabel	uitextview
notes using uitextview is a great alternative to multiple line uilabel without the bug
uitextview does not exhibit any of the iulabel other oddities either like alignment errors or flickering

35236158
rsa	aes
symmetric encryption such as aes is extremely fast in comparison to asymmetric encryption such as rsa
however aes cbc provides only confidentiality not integrity authentication or non-repudiation

35237114
implements	extends
if you want all instances to have a certain field why not just use an abstract definition you can implements that using a def or a val
right just inside the definition of your trait or the object extends it

35237688
implements	extends
the interfaces are unrelated but there could be classes that implements all three interfaces so there could be instances that can be cast around merrily
the reason it does not work with classes is that a given class can extends only one superclass so there cannot be any class that extends both class a and class b

35240487
punctuation	words
ideone code demo the regex matches b - leading words boundary - one letter - 2 or more sequences of one or more horizontal whitespace h+ followed with a letter b - trailing words boundary - match only if not followed with zero or more whitespace or punctuation before the end of string
you may use the following regular expression see the regex demo it will match at least 3 letters separated with space only if not at the end of a sentence not matched if followed with any whitespace with punctuation at the end of the string

35240948
setcontentview	findviewbyid
in your activity you are not calling setcontentview anywhere
therefore listview listview listview findviewbyid r.id.listview

35241455
implements	extends
imagine you decide to implements various behavior for history of different types vehiclehistory and vesselhistory
so you create those classes extends history override some methods in them and refactor a few of methods in history class so that not new history but new vehiclehistory is called

35241460
bower	npm
perusing the doc here is what worked for me npm install -g bower # if not already done meteor add mquandalle bower echo directory .meteor local bower .bowerrc # if you use bower install --save then create a bower.json file at the top of the proj tree that reads like this name myapp version 0.0.1 dependencies leaflet 0 leaflet.markercluster 0 private true re-run your app with meteor run and presto the stylesheets and javascript of your modules are embedded into your page without even having to edit the
meteor search bower turns up a few hits which i haven t taken the time to compare in any depth

35244676
swift	objective-c
unfortunately it s not possible to subclass a swift class in objective-c
straight from the docs you cannot subclass a swift class in objective-c

35245434
shadowing	named
clojure.core let keys title author title hahaha println title hahaha be wary that hiding bindings like this introduces some problems shadowing
say you had a valid key named but then in your code you used the named function from inside with-valid-keys you would get the bound value of named not the function

35245911
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome however does parse them but this is not expected behavior cross browser send valid iso strings from server or any format recommended in plugin docs from fullcalender docs when specifying event objects for events or eventsources you may specify a string in ietf format ex wed 18 oct 2009 13 00 00 est a string in iso8601 format ex 2009-11-05t13 15 30z or a unix timestamp
because the date strings provided are not valid and firefox will transpose those to invalid date when passed to new date

35247138
swift	objective-c
nsjsonserialization is a foundation api not a swift standard library one
as such it comes from objective-c on darwin even though it has probably been reimplemented on linux

35247138
swift	objective-c
in objective-c that s quite good enough since all things that are objective-c objects are reference types that can be referenced as one common type id or in swift anyobject
on the pure swift side there are types that are not reference types array dictionary int string ...

35252462
required	placeholder
it might work for required inputs but not for inputs with values in
in this case the placeholder will disappear and you cannot warn users with the wrong inputs

35253799
selenium	appium
webdriver aka selenium webdriver specifies a client-server protocol known as the json wire protocol
...in other words appium webdriver clients are not technically test frameworks -- they are automation libraries

35257826
super	self
for a solution that works on python2 and python3 try super c self
from the docs on super you gave no arguments to super so it does not know what to do on python2

35258290
oncreate	onstart
so here is your answer you are creating the view in oncreate which is displayed after the execution of onstart
it s not like that whatever you do in oncreate has no visible effect

35260098
scrollable	panels
similarly rotating the mouse wheel may not affect the hovered scrollable
i think it depends on the window manager and the look feel but in some cases you will scroll the scroll panels that contains the focussed component - even if the mouse cursor is outside of this component and even if it is over a scollable component you can also observe this for example in the windows explorer

35265444
ireport	subreports
basically a crosstab is the better solution overall but if you need something simpler maybe you re not familiar with ireport or one-shot-like you could think about a subreports
if you re not familiar with crosstab as previously suggested you could create a subreports just to show the column totals and put it before the detail band for example in the page header band

35276183
dictionary	map
you will need to instantiate them as such once you have the sorted dictionary instances you can use linq to map or filter or do whatever else is desired on them
when items are added to the dictionary they are automatically sorted based on either the for the given tkey or the default icomparer if not explicitly provided

35277120
clang	llvm
it would be a complete solution but i am not sure it qualifies as lightweight because you need to understand the details of gcc internals but neither is a clang llvm approach
you ll probably need more than a week of work notably to learn about the internals of gcc or of clang llvm btw your problem is less easy than what you believe since contains a conditional

35278301
spaces	delimiter
then you can construct a for-loop excluding the header and footer like this inside loops you can use explode again with spaces as the delimiter to get an arrays for every line
this should work because it looks like all the values at the beginning of each line do not have spaces

35279628
client-side	server-side
the way you are doing is really strange - you cannot call server-side button event from client-side javascript
you can either use regular input html tag with pure client-side calculation or server button control with ajax based on your requirement

35279956
bower	npm
bower should be installed using npm install -g bower please refer to our documentation about jenkins setup
that s because jenkins s node environment is not complete make sure bower is in its path

35280591
explode	substr
this is simple solution using substr explode and str_replace eval.in demo obviously it works only if there are not curly or squared brackets inside the sigle strings
first of all it remove from the original string opening and closing brackets then explode transform a string in array the string by and performs a foreach loop through obtained elements etc...

35285964
google-chrome	firefox
but the same is not true for internet explorer and google-chrome
firefox is the most traditional browser thus selenium webdriver do not require any additional utility to be set before launching the browser

35286554
punctuation	words
rather than use the loop with str.replace for each punctuation character use str.translate this gets you the same result as the tutorial code now the count is up to 753
running the tutorial count to get a sum of positive words in the tweets gives me 753 hits not 1105

35291383
vbscript	vba
here is an example of something that would replace a series of characters followed by a hyphen and another series of characters to the hyphen-less version if you are not familiar with regex captures a match means any of these 1 returns the first match first group of parentheses if for example you wanted letters and numbers it would look like this a-za-z0-9 - a-za-z0-9 also if you really want vba for this you can either use the vbscript regular expression library or you can record these steps as a macro and clean it up to suit your needs
while you certainly can use vba you actually don t even need it for this

35292371
icalendar	rrule
it is not clear whether you care about rrule only as a convenient way to express something that recurs or whether you want to use the full icalendar format
assuming the later option 1 is covered by rfc5545 you would store a master vevent containing the base information along with the rrule + one vevent for each instance that is an exception to the base event where each exception is identified by its recurrence-id

35292874
swift	objective-c
vanilla swift classes do not
what you want to do is the following in the above code myprotocol2 is equivalent to your uiscrollviewdelegate hence what you will do is notice that another class subclasses nsobject this is because if you do not do so you will get the error anotherclass does not conform to protocol nsobjectprotocol this error is because uiscrollviewdelegate itself is defined to be extending nsobjectprotocol which is an objective-c protocol implemented by nsobject

35294811
bower	npm
i runned this in command prompt npm install -g bower if that does not work you need to make sure that node.js is installed before
and make sure the following path is in the windows path environment variable userprofile appdata roaming npm i had this problem when publishing an asp.net 5.0 - asp.net core 1.0 project the next error was that gulp was also not found

35295308
wildfly	jboss
until my boss decides that we should move to wildfly i am opening a bounty just in case someone has alternative solution no i will not compile my own jboss with patches
my research showed that one possible solution is to use container interceptors which existed in earlier versions of jboss and appeared again in jboss 7.2

35297102
viewdidload	viewdidappear
viewdidload merely means that the view controller has a view
the view does not appear on the screen until viewdidappear

35299904
apache	nginx
basically php the zend engine is something that is often used along side a web server apache nginx and mod_php is one of the ways of doing that but perhaps not the best
mod_php is an apache module

35300996
daemons	systemd
and because the script is waiting for the pkill to complete it is still alive and gets killed and returns -1 for that reason there is also the killing signal in the result of wait but the jenkins slave daemons isn t printing it
either come up with more specific pattern for pkill use proper pid-file or switch to systemd which can reliably kill exactly the process it started

35301634
boost	allocator
although using std string and boost run counter to those goals
some c-style string manipulation that makes more assumptions about the string it s processing and ignores max-length safety allocator by using a big buffer on the result of getmodulefilenamea would be much less total machine code. idk why but only shows the basename the filename without the directories even though printing its length shows it s not just the bare name

rpm	yum
if you can t find the r-java rpm package for rhel5 anywhere maybe you can configure java for r manually. on centos7 you can see below that r-java contains no files and only configures r for java you can probably configure java for r manually and then install for example rjava as a standard r package as described in the installation paragraph at
on centos 7 i performed the following steps as root install r base packages without using the existing r-java # yum install r-core.x86_64 r-core-devel.x86_64 install a jdk not only a jre

pthreads	fork
in releases of solaris prior to solaris 10 the behavior of fork depended on whether or not the application was linked with the pthreads library
when linked with -lthread solaris threads but not linked with -lpthread pthreads fork was the same as forkall

35304752
erlang	elixir
if for example that was written the code demonstrated there isn t all that uncommon in erlang note the remark this goes through irc a lot
elixir s ability to simply rebind names saves us from having to generate new dummy names for things all the time

35304844
interpolation	splines
scipy implements many different interpolation and smoothing methods so i encourage you to look at the documentation here
one option would be bicubic splines smoothing scipy.interpolate.smoothbivariatespline you could then plot this as before using plt_surface personally i m not a big fan of 3d plots - whenever i see a 3d plot there is almost always a clearer way to represent the data in 2d

35304977
build.gradle	gradlew
i had the same problem and it was due to apply plugin com.google.gms.google-services not being at the bottom of the app build.gradle
figured it out by looking at the gradlew console

35305144
bower	npm
but based on the other comment about bower and after asking for opinions from other devs it seems like bower may not be the top choice after all
that leaves npm as another good option since nuget is not the top choice due to the reasons mentioned in the long answer below

35305144
bower	npm
here s an old blog post 2014 from scott hanselman on why you shouldn t be using nuget for this this old blog post does recommend bower but new info suggests that bower may have some long-term issues
so you may have to go with npm in case bower eventually disappears

in c you might have with the designated initializer feature introduced in iso c99 you can write this as but before c99 gcc introduced a similar feature with a different syntax gcc or more precisely g++ supports this in c++ mode as well but c++ has not adopted c99-style designated initializers
the gcc manual says that the version of this feature has been obsolete since gcc 2.5 which was released in 1993 so it definitely should not be used in new code

35312064
namenode	hdfs
seems like you installed a single-node cluster but conceptually the namenode and datanode s are distinct and in your configuration the datanode s live listen on the private side of your ec2 vpc
you could reconfigure your cluster to host the datanodes on the public ip dns see hdfs support for multihomed networks but i would not go that way

35314818
serializable	deserialization
if you cannot alter the response from the api you ll need to implement a custom serializable as to object isn t supported by restsharp
this article summarizes how to use json.net as the serializable which would enable you to use whatever rules you needed to for your deserialization

35315819
google-chrome	firefox
it doesn t work with google-chrome because google-chrome uses the google-chrome pdf viewer to render pdf
it won t work in firefox either because firefox uses pdf.js

35316211
g++	gcc
or at least force it to use the headers and dynamic library from the same version as found on the target by overriding the header and library search paths to point to copies of the older files although that might not work as the newer g++ might not be able to compile the older headers if they contain some invalid c++ that the older g++ didn t diagnose
you can map a glibcxx_a.b.c symbol version to a gcc release by checking n.b

35316317
dictionary	map
counter returns a dictionary like object which it s keys must be hashable
and since lists are not hashable you can convert them to tuple using map function note that using map will perform slightly better than a generator expression because by passing a generator expression to counter python will get the values from generator function by itself since using built-in function map has more performance in terms of execution time 1

35317898
config	ini
for example i ve added the option at the very beginning of the php.ini file but when i put the config option how this is shown in the example under section it does not work as expected it looks like the option is ignored when i add option to the 20-xdebug.ini like it is suggestion in the accepted answer the option is accepted because this file has only section
out of curiosity i tried other included ini files and it looks like i can use any one

35319419
client-side	server-side
if you meant client-side the following code from this answer should work
from when to not just use socket.close simpler smaller solution if by this end you meant server-side this answer should help

35319786
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
basically if you are just dimissing a presented uiviewcontroller or popping a uiviewcontroller from the navigation stack you don t need to use unwind segues although it does the same for you
but think of a case where there are uinavigationcontroller a b c and then a rootviewcontroller r then think of a condition now if you want to go back to yvcontroller to your project rootviewcontroller where you just started up.there is no way as poptorootviewcontroller pops to the navigation stack of the b uinavigationcontroller .now what you do..either use delegate or change window rootviewcontroller which is not a good idea

35322923
ioexception	printwriter
problem here is that in this case you will not able to know that exception is where whether due to indexoutofboundsexception or ioexception just you know that a exception occurs let us understand the concept it is better to know why the code fails due to which particular type of exception whether indexoutofboundsexception or ioexception now the code with handling of different exception here we could come to know that whether it fails due to creation of file at location e outfile.txt drive not on my system error printed as caught exception e outfile.txt the system cannot find the path specified entering try statement printwriter not open next case now when i comment the line list.add new integer i
then it clearly says that it fails for index out of bound exception entering try statement caught indexoutofboundsexception index 0 size 0 closing printwriter so for the purpose of debugging the application properly and efficiently it is good

35323847
http.sys	httplistener
the reason is that the httplistener doesn t actually manage the underlying socket - it simply registers application-level prefixes with the http.sys driver who in turn manages the underlying connection
to use so_reuseaddr you could create a tcplistener and set the socket option on the underlying socket accessible through the server property with setsocketoption but now you have to implement all the convenient things that httplistener provides on you own header parsing content validation etc.

35324433
erlang	elixir
will show you all the loaded modules from erlang that start with the letter c and will show you all the functions available in that module
unfortunately as of elixir 1.2 the h command does not yet work for erlang modules

35327598
g++	gcc
i m assuming you are using as your toolchain but even if you are not the problem is that whatever toolchain you are using it probably predates gcc g++ 4.9
the problem is that jessie raspbian 4.1.x uses gcc g++ 4.9 as its toolchain and opencv is making use of an stl feature that is new to that version of the compiler

35327598
g++	gcc
the problem is that jessie raspbian 4.1.x uses gcc g++ 4.9 as its toolchain and opencv is making use of an stl feature that is new to that version of the compiler
therefore if your application is built with a toolchain that predates gcc g++ 4.9 it will not link

35327598
g++	gcc
therefore if your application is built with a toolchain that predates gcc g++ 4.9 it will not link
the solution is to either get a toolchain that is at least 4.9 or greater or stick with the wheezy release of raspbian which uses gcc 4.6

35328962
pickle	dill
the longer answer is that pickle can only serialize classes that are defined inside of a file but not in the interpreter or more generally in __main__
however dill can generally pickle these kinds of dynamically built classes because it treats __main__ like a file and parses python s built-in buffer to get the class definitions among other things

35328962
pickle	dill
however dill can generally pickle these kinds of dynamically built classes because it treats __main__ like a file and parses python s built-in buffer to get the class definitions among other things
hiding the class definition inside of a string and then using exec to generate the class well that is a case that dill is not capable of handling yet

35329198
lxml	beautifulsoup
what you have is not html but xml so you probably shouldn t be using beautifulsoup but rather using lxml directly
the lxml element does have a replace method but you must pass it an element not a string

35329289
cloudant	couchdb
this is sound advice regarding saving passwords in general but this doesn t work with cloudant at all
it doesn t really work very well with couchdb either

35335078
aggregate-functions	sum
you can include case statements within aggregate-functions
here you could choose sum case when salesrepname is null then 1 else 0 end as online and sum case when salesrepname is not null then 1 else 0 end as telesales

35336078
ssl	https
you must force ssl https where sessions are used
if you just use ssl https for login and http for the rest of the session this doesn t make you safe as the phpsessid cookie is sent in plaintext via http

35336078
ssl	https
if you just use ssl https for login and http for the rest of the session this doesn t make you safe as the phpsessid cookie is sent in plaintext via http
as far as i know the only way to compromise php s session mechanism is to steal the phpsessid cookie using man-in-the-middle attacks which can be totally made useless if you have a valid ssl certificate and use of strong cipher suite for your webserver

35336102
realloc	malloc
according to the c docs realloc reallocates the given area of memory that must be previously allocated by malloc calloc or realloc and not yet free with free otherwise the results are undefined
you have an out of bound problem as well at the following lines when you try to access at check the following code out live don t forget to realloc using the right size not using an hardcoded 4 and check for the edge case in which size is zero after deletion

35337705
swift	objective-c
swift generic classes are not compatible with objective-c
see when you create a swift class that descends from an objective-c class the class and its members properties methods subscripts and initializers that are compatible with objective-c are automatically available from objective-c

35338493
build.gradle	gradlew
for this to work the two build.gradle files must not be modified at the same time before syncing once for all
i had to follow the following steps step 1 modify the lib s build.gradle exactly as kane said step 2 clean rebuild step 3 modify the app s build.gradle also as kane said step 4 gradlew sync

35345235
phpstorm	webstorm
such support is not possible in webstorm v11 phpstorm v10 -- only css is available as injectable language
however the next version webstorm v12 phpstorm v11 already supports it -- just use appropriate in case of less attribute on your tag

35347979
setinterval	settimeout
you are using setinterval test 5000
that is not a function but a statement that runs immediately so that the js engine can evaluate the result and pass it to settimeout in the same way it would immediately evaluate 3+3 and pass 6 to the function if you had used settimeout 3+3 100000 instead

35349581
cvs	svn
otoh if you are not welded to vss and don t want to use either tfsc or git subversion standalone is a very good alternative cvs is a dead issue and is not being supported
my current client has development teams using either git or svn for their .net yuck projects

35350811
pdcurses	ncurses
if you look at the header file from pdcurses that particular function is the only one treated in that way defining a macro to use the function with a pdc_ prefix
if you happen to be cross-compiling from cygwin for example and if the cmake macros are not setup used properly they could find the system ncurses which does not use that naming convention

35354087
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox
update fixed code in the code snippet so that it now also works in google-chrome and safari not just in firefox
it appears that some es6 language features let const destructuring symbols work in firefox but at least some of them don t work in google-chrome or safari

35354260
gedit	sublimetext
it seems that currently there is no support for julia latex completions in gedit 3 afaik
alternatives juno ide installation instructions ijulia notebook install ijulia start the jupyter notebook server alternatively you can try ijulia online here juliabox google authentication required but environment is persistent and integrated with other services like google drive tryjupyter no authentication required but files are not persistent open a new notebook with a julia kernel and type to see the full list of completions after selecting one type again sublimetext you ll need to install ijulia the sublimetext package control manager and the following plugins ijulia an ijulia frontend for sublimetext 3 julia completions make all of julia s utf-8 autocompletions available in sublimetext open an existing .jl file syntax highlighting will be auto detected or a new file press ctrl+shift+p then type julia and select set syntax julia alternatively save the new file with a .jl extension

35357504
opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
elements with are not supported in google-chrome internet explorer firefox or opera 15 and newer
partial support in safari

35359739
innodb	myisam
in my case the problem was that one of the referenced tables was innodb and the other one was myisam
myisam doesn t have support for foreign key relations

35362453
ssl	https
calling over http can resolve this problem in these situations at least until you configure ssl on the remote
this issue can also be caused by making curl calls to https when it is not configured on the remote device

35363056
swift	objective-c
the solution is to use the unsafebitcast function to convert the swift closure to an objective-c compatible object before adding it to an nsarray and back before using it in swift
edit as of swift 3 this is completely unnecessary and doesn t even work

35363056
swift	objective-c
edit as of swift 3 this is completely unnecessary and doesn t even work
adding closures to objective-c arrays works out of the box in swift 3

35363911
prepare	execute
first you must prepare a query with the query function
then you must execute it with execute but then you must also retrieve the results this isn t done automatically

35367355
required	placeholder
to compare your code output 2016-02-12 11 16 55 required formatting 2016-02-12est11 16 55 change this date y-m-d h i s strtotime now to this date y-m-dth i s strtotime now 2
placeholder the placeholder is tarih not tarih note the colon so you should ensure that the key for the placeholder is correct

35369162
oncreate	setcontentview	oncreate	findviewbyid	setcontentview	findviewbyid
and add these lines after your setcontentview r.layout.adv_just_java_app call in oncreate
you cannot call findviewbyid until after setcontentview

35371121
swift	objective-c
in swift not so much
think of swift s array type the same way you think of nsarray in objective-c

35371854
rvm	bundler
rvm doesn t install automatically bundler gem after installing ruby. so each time you ll install a new version of ruby via rvm you ll have to run gem install bundler command after
another solution is to edit your rvmrc configs in .rvmrc or etc rvmrc and add this line will force rvm to install bundler gem and run bundle install if gemfile available

35372625
lodash	underscore.js
these are my opinions- take with a grain of salt aurelia purist the aurelia purist doesn t use lodash instead opting to write modern javascript using the new array methods that ship with es6
sometimes the aurelia purist consults you might not need underscore.js when he or she is in doubt

35373887
implements	extends
in fact this feature isn t implements yet in the http support
as a workaround you need to extends the browserxhr class of angular2 as described below to set the responsetype to blob on the underlying xhr object then you need to wrap the response payload into a blob object and use the filesaver library to open the download dialog the filesaver library must be included into your html file see this plunkr unfortunately this will set the responsetype for all ajax requests

35373892
jspm	npm
if you need some thing that cannot be replicated with native ecmascript or you really prefer to use lodash install it using jspm jspm install lodash lodash is an alias for npm lodash defined in jspm registry
jspm will install lodash from npm s registry but will manage it itself - inside jspm_packages and with system.js module loader

35373892
jspm	npm
jspm install npm lodash.map this will install lodash s map module
note that we need npm prefix this time since jspm doesn t have aliases for standalone lodash modules

35374556
implements	extends
the color.rgba type implements the rgba method to satisfy the color.color interface now the rgba type represents the colour channels with the uint8 type giving a range of 0 0xff
simply converting these values to uint32 would not extends the range up to 0 0xffff

35379538
flask	django
even if you don t use django say your api project is based on flask you can still import django models in flask modules
behind the scene of django models there s the database which doesn t care from where it is queried and django just provides a convenient way to use the db via python classes

35384906
google-chrome	firefox
correct location for your userchrome.css file should be c users xxxx appdata roaming mozilla firefox profiles random string .default google-chrome c users xxxxx could be different on other windows versions
the google-chrome folder might not excist so just create it

35386317
build.gradle	gradlew
to do so you need to update your gradlew script to not treat test failures as fatal in your test block of the build.gradle then you can run your gradlew script in jenkins and let it analyse the junit results which will set the build status to successful or unstable depending on whether the tests pass or fail
the gradlew java plugin writes test results in junit xml format to build test-results test-hellotest.xml in your example

35389931
intersect	contains
so the regular expression allows exactly one character being one of the following the and the following are unioned and the resulting character class is intersect with which simply removes the a character
valid strings are for example but a is not as well as each string that contains more than one character

35395514
strdup	malloc
you could use the posix function strdup does both operations in one call
as johan wentholt correctly outlined in his answer you must allocate memory for both the student structure and the string its member name points to but you must return the new structure so the caller can do something with it you code invokes undefined behavior because you did not allocate memory for the string worse even you left the name member uninitialized malloc does not initialize the memory it returns

35396966
laravel	phalcon
laravel has a growing community it also has some features like migration generations.if performance doesn t matter you might as well use laravel
but if you are at all concerned about the speed of your application then i would suggest phalcon

35397111
implements	extends
in a lot of application we need a base implementation class and then we extends that class baseimplclass implements isomeinterface so rather than having a baseimplclass you have an option of defining these default implementation in your interface which can be overrriden if required
if you have any helper or utility classes you can use static methods in interface ...which are public final and can not be overridden and now if you think of diamond problem which may occur if a class implements multiple interface with same default method signature we will have ambiguous situation

35397974
rdf	owl
for future reference the shacl rdf shapes constraint language work at w3c is intended to shore up these kinds of constraint violation problems that are not possible to answer with owl
owl s open world assumption is going to prevent you from finding the set of individuals that have values for the roles hasstudent hassection and grade_code have one and only one value for them. however using sparql you could create an ask query that does just what you are asking for a bit akward syntactically since the aggregates need to be computed by a select statement

35398351
ubuntu	debian
note it is likely that your application compiled on ubuntu 15.10 does not run on debian 8
this is because ubuntu 15.10 uses a newer version of libc and libstdc++ which is not available on debian 8

35398351
ubuntu	debian
this is because ubuntu 15.10 uses a newer version of libc and libstdc++ which is not available on debian 8
you can work around that issue when you use ubuntu 14.04 as the compile machine

35398381
google-chrome	firefox
using filecontents in getdata doesn t work in google-chrome for me but works with firefox
dataformats.dib would allow you to work with the bitmap directly but unfortunately google-chrome doesn t seem to support this one either

35399572
stateless	stateful
you need that form of thread safety if the stateless session bean has member variables that are themselves not thread safe a saxparser
however since stateless session beans don t have client affinity like stateful session beans the use cases are admittedly relatively rare and the servlet programming model seems to have shown that this level of protection is probably not necessary so if you don t need the thread safety then as of ejb 3.1 you can use a singleton session bean with bean-managed concurrency

35401156
multiplying	subtract
to convert a fractions to its binary representation you will multiplying the fractions by 2 and if the resulting number has an integer part greater than 1 your binary representation of that bit is 1 if not your representation is 0
if greater than one you subtract 1 from the number and repeat until you have exhausted the number or reached the limit of precision in question

35401156
floating-point	fractions
for example note how the floating-point fractions value will tend to zero rather than reaching your limit of digits
if you attempt to convert 0.78 which is not capable of exact representation as the fractions to 1864.78 in a 32-bit floating point value you will reach a different conversion in the 12th bit

35401182
gridview	sqldatasource
why not use prerender to reset the gridview
i won t reveal the sqldatasource here but suffice to say with the prerender i can reset my gridview and turn on the columns i want with the headers i want

35403786
swt	swing
maybe it makes sense to expose a couple of buttons previous next and upon the click just to call the web service with some paging parameters dynamic model i might be wrong but from the name of the class of table model somehow i ve deduced that you re using swing it doesn t really matter though it can be web swt or whatsoever
in this case maybe you should provide some kind of listener that would trigger the data loading in background threads in swing ajax in web when user scrolls over the data

35411733
google-chrome	safari
by using google-chrome you should be good by just updating it to the latest version 48.0.2564.109 m at the moment i write this answer
if you re using older browsers even not that old like ie safari android browsers etc that doesn t support maps you ll have to polyfill it

35418204
google-chrome	firefox
this gives us something very close to a masonry layout as can be seen in this jsbin example of a dense grid layout again note that you will need nightly dev versions of google-chrome webkit or firefox to see how it works
here s an image of the result as viewed in google-chrome canary some things to note the row dense packing algorithm doesn t really make a difference here as the items happen to stack up in a pattern that leaves no holes but i put it in there for completeness

35421093
prng	random
a seed is not necessarily the first number in the sequence of random-numbers generated by a prng
the seed is only used to initialize the random-number generator which is pseudo random

35421815
dictionary	map
if you want to get to a standard .net mutable dictionary you use the constructor which accepts an idictionary map implements idictionary so this step is very straightforward
there isn t a convenient function to go from dictionary to map but there is a built in dict function which converts from a sequence of tuples to an see

35421815
dictionary	map
there isn t a convenient function to go from dictionary to map but there is a built in dictionary function which converts from a sequence of tuples to an see
the simplest way i know to do the dictionary to map conversion is the reverse is easy with the dictionary function note that the above function returns an idictionary the implementation of which is both internal to the fsharp.core library and not mutable

35423782
build.gradle	gradlew
n.b please do not modify your original build.gradle file provided on the tutorial
the above error is due to the build do not includes our web restful service main application class files into the gs-rest-service-0.1.0.jar file because of the src main java hello folder is not under the gradlew build scope

35426332
flask	django
but similar things should also be possible with node.js flask etc
and maybe even php in django you use # comment here # django will not render the comment to the browser and you will not be able to see it in the source code

35429415
build.gradle	gradlew
if it is not so then try adding this in your gradlew dependency build.gradle provided org.glassfish javax.annotation 10.0-b28
it look like you are using proguard and it is stripping annotations. to get saved from it add this lines to your proguard-rules.pro if not using proguard make sure that you havn t written something in your app build.gradle something like this note android does not come normally with many of the javax.annotation library by default

35429653
build.gradle	gradlew
simply add this to build.gradle all you really need are the feature file and the steps java files that implement the glue code
you do not need the xxxcukestest.java file with a runwith annotation since gradlew ignores it

35429960
inline	inlining
another debug option is to not inline code - this keeps your named functions intact
inlining may put that single finction inside three other functions which complicates debugging a bit

35430244
factors	matrix
a scaling matrix looks like | sx 0 0 | | 0 sy 0 | | 0 0 1 | where sx and sy are the scale factors in the x and y axis
you want to concatenate these matrix using cgaffinetransformconcat but as according to its doc note that matrix operations are not commutative the order in which you concatenate matrix is important

35431614
coldfusion	railo
the java xml parser that coldfusion uses exposes that information via getencoding and getversion
this ll work on coldfusion but not on lucee or railo

35433795
sudo	passwd
so it is not equivalent so sudo su otheruser where root logs in to the user account without a passwd but is is a simple way to switch between users in your script only typing each passwd once
the way i achieve this is with you will be prompted for the passwd of otheruser though only once

35434639
noexcept	throw
but if you re 100 that no expression in sapucconverter format can throw then you can use the noexcept specifier
if sapucconverter format or any function that might be called when logmsg is expanded assuming it s a macro is not declared noexcept then as far as the code that calls them knows they may throw

35434719
factors	matrix
that is because r kept the level data of the original dataset the problem arises when your training set is somehow constructed using eg the function data.frame or any other method that drops the levels information of the factors
try the following you see in the second line that the level b has been dropped and consequently the model matrix isn t what you want any longer

35439124
swift	objective-c
the fact that you are dipping into an objective-c cocoa feature reachable from swift doesn t change that.
how i can totally dynamize class instanciation in swift you can t

35445125
realloc	malloc
a dynamic array may be resized using the realloc library function like so while the memory for the array elements themselves is taken from the heap or whatever dynamic memory pool the memory for the pointer variable p will be allocated from either a .bss or .data segment or from the stack based on p s storage duration static or auto
memory allocated with malloc or realloc is not initialized

35445618
division	multiplication
but these divisions can be replaced by multiplication with inverse of p without any problem since the first incorrectly rounded division will be compensated by remainder r and second incorrectly rounded division does not really matter the last bits of correction q1 won t change anything
one possibility is to track error of m and p into m1 and p1 with classical dekker schewchuk then correct the naive division that ll cost you 2 divisions but should be near half ulp if i didn t screw up

35445846
google-chrome	safari
webrtc works perfectly fine on android so will work in cordova or even just google-chrome
however apple s safari which uses webkit does not currently support webrtc

35447787
division	exponent
the problem isn t the division itself
if the exponent of a and k are the same almost no precision is lost and if the absolute difference between the exponent is greater than the significand size then either if a has larger magnitude or if k has larger magnitude

35448764
spaces	delimiter
rules a single spaces must be used as delimiter
any string in the given string-set doesn t contain a spaces

35449216
swift	objective-c
starting with step 1 it says create an objective-c command line tool and change the search paths. not swift
you can create a swift framework for the code you d put in your command line tool but the tool itself must not compile any swift code

35452468
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
summary without a js delay solutions will probably work in firefox ie safari but not in google-chrome
while some of the proposed solutions work for fragment links hash links within the same page like a menu link that scrolls down i found that none of them worked in current google-chrome when you want to use fragment links coming in from other pages

35452967
arraylist	treeset
this solution allows the iteration over the original linkedhashmap not the new arraylist as has also been proposed
the question requires a linkedhashmap in reverse order some answers suggesting using a treeset but this will reorder the map based upon the key

35454134
retrofit	okhttp
imo retrofit is not the best tool for downloading a file unless the file contains json
using retrofit version 2 means you are using okhttp under the hood

35463283
elasticsearch	kibana
you may find things like kibana unable to connect elasticsearch at given url
you can check kibana logs for why it is not starting at all

35463790
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome seems to work fine but firefox doesn t
according to this post firefox 4 should support it

35463924
stateless	stateful
if you use a slsb stateless session bean then you are not permitted to exit the called method without finishing transaction see ejb 3.2 8.3.3 enterprise beans using bean-managed transaction demarcation
on the other hand sfsb stateful session bean can exit a method without finishing the transaction and that could be finished in other call

35464872
operands	scalar
it is an lvalue and it is a bit-field if the operands is a bit-field
if x is not of type bool the expression ++x is equivalent to x+ 1 so this is perfectly legal output 16 16 1.9 program execution intro.execution 15 ...if a side effect on a scalar object is unsequenced relative to either another side effect on the same scalar object or a value computation using the value of the same scalar object the behavior is undefined

35466143
calloc	malloc
typing misra malloc into your favourite search engine leads us to which asks as per the rule we are not supposed to use functions like malloc free calloc etc
but malloc is a very common requirement

35466231
google-chrome	firefox
at the time of this writing webkit-based browsers google-chrome and safari adhere to this design principle
firefox and edge do not

swift	objective-c
the problem is nstimer and the whole selector business are objective-c stuff and do work in swift domain thanks to bridging
however swift s default protocol implementations are not bridged to objective-c wonderland yet and that s why your timer fails

35470285
swift	objective-c
however swift s default protocol implementations are not bridged to objective-c wonderland yet and that s why your timer fails
basically from objective-c perspective objects of type a do not respond to a selector dofoo period

client-side	server-side
it s possible to use react-router for both client-side and server side routing
the transition.to call worked fine on the client-side but threw an exception when server-side routing kicked in and returned the cannot get page

super	self
and your myauthorization class from tastypie.exceptions import unauthorized from tastypie.authorization import djangoauthorization class myauthorization djangoauthorization def is_authorized self request if request.user.is_superuser and search in request.path return true # more business logic here to check the other endpoints raise unauthorized unauthorized def read_list self object_list bundle self.is_authorized bundle.request # call your custom validation # fallback to the djangoauthorization read_list return super myauthorization self .read_list object_list bundle refer to the docs for a complete list of functions you can override to add more business logic
i m going to suppose you have been configured your prepend_urls and hence you have wrapped a function called dispatch_search so something like this will raise an exception if user is unauthorized to use the endpoint edited from here below when inheriting from the djangoauthorization class you also can override the methods read_detail self object_list bundle read_list self object_list bundle to raise an exception if user should not be able to read an specific resource or the resource list itself

and on ecma 262 reference saying s should match white spaces like u0009 tab u000b vertical tab u000c form feed u0020 spaces u00a0 no-break spaces ufeff byte order mark and other category zs and also line terminators like u000a linefeed u000d carriage return u2028 line separator and u2029 paragraph separator you can use the following code to remove elements that are either empty or whitespace only if trim is not natively available in case some old browsers behave differently with s replace it with character class and you can also customize it further to include new unicode spaces to come
based on this mdn reference s matches a single white spaces character including spaces tab form feed linefeed and other unicode spaces

implements	extends
custom converters if you need to communicate with an api that uses a content-format that retrofit does not support out of the box yaml txt custom format or you wish to use a different library to implements an existing format you can easily create your own converter
create a class that extends the converter.factory class and pass in an instance when building your adapter

last but not least you need to implements the consumer
again best ist to extends org.apache.camel.impl.defaultconsumer

google-api-python-client	oauth2client
it is a google-api-python-client error
same here it seems that there is not a lockedfile in the oauth2client 2.0 also i found an open issue at github

each time a client connects a new instance of imapprotocol is created. then the imapprotocol executes and answers for each client implements capability login fetch select search store then in my tests i start the server during setup with when i want to simulate a new message and stop it at teardown self.server.close asyncio.wait_for self.server.wait_closed 1 cf edit i had a buggy stop of the server i rewrote it with asyncio.protocol and modify the answer to reflect the changes
as i didn t find something convenient in python 3 for my needs mail part of twisted is not running in python 3 i did a small mock with asyncio that you can improve if you d like i defined an imapprotocol which extends asyncio.protocol

35492538
octal	hex
when using the escape character the number s after it are treated as an octal number and it does not need to be prefixed with a 0 as the compiler know it is an octal number
this is why x is needed if you want to use a hex number

35493704
ienumerable	iqueryable
the big difference is which overload of the select method you use or notice that the first one operates on an iqueryable object and the second one operates on an ienumerable object
using ienumerable extensions with entityframework causes that ef retrieves all data and a projection is done on your program side ef doesn t create an appropriate sql query

35496612
namenode	hdfs
if so restart the namenode to make sure that it is running with the current configuration displayed in cloudera manager
sometimes the cloudera agent needs to be restarted as well for it to generate configurations properly if that doesn t work then run find out the files affected and verify that the replication factor is set to 1 since you have only one datanode you can check replication factor for a file by running hadoop fs -ls path to file.txt then look at the number in the 2nd column in the output note be sure to add the hdfs gateway role to the server you want to run the hadoop commands from

ssl	https
for now it seems downgrading to version 1.34.0 will fix the could not verify stripe s ssl certificate issue
stripe s ruby bindings verify the https certificate on stripe s servers api.stripe.com to ensure you re really communicating with stripe and not with a malicious third-party a.k.a

35507482
ienumerable	icollection
note that for historical reasons is based on ienumerable and is based on and so on ienumerable but isn t based on icollection
in general if you want the type t of an you can taken from note that with the changes i ve introduced i ve created some small side-effects a collection not based on but only on ienumerable will return typeof object

google-chrome	firefox
the problem was google-chrome and safari
i am not sure why but the client app works perfectly with mozilla firefox but does not connect through safari or google-chrome

35512886
g++	gcc
i need g++ to allow this unrecognized command line option
no that option is not supported by upstream gcc

35515286
amd	umd
simple add librarytarget commonjs2 or librarytarget amd to the output key in the webpack config and make sure you are importing react in your component
you re probably bundling your module as umd which is causing the bundle to utilized a global react variable which doesn t exist in the consumer app

35516246
memcpy	malloc
so when you then try to copy from that address with memcpy you get a fault
if you want a to point to an integer with the value 100 the correct way is you also need to fix the way you call malloc in allocate_pool your code is just allocating enough space for a pointer not the entire pool structure

35518839
ssl	https
now connections to that listener on your aws elb should be properly configured for ssl tls connections that browsers will trust
thus the https listener configuration would look something like load balancer protocol https load balancer port 443 instance protocol http instance port 80 cipher default policy ssl certificate --server-certificate-name name note that you do not want to use port 443 for the instance port as well

35518839
ssl	https
thus the https listener configuration would look something like load balancer protocol https load balancer port 443 instance protocol http instance port 80 cipher default policy ssl certificate --server-certificate-name name note that you do not want to use port 443 for the instance port as well
if you do that says that you want https from the elb to your instance which is not usually needed

35519101
hex	binary
the 02 means we want the the output to be 2 characters wide with zero padding for hexadecimal numbers that are smaller than 2 hex digits
i m not sure why you want to print those bytes in binary but it s easy enough to do so

35520671
comparator	comparable
if this is the question farazdurrani the posts are being sorted in the wrong direction i want the most recent posts to be at the top of the page but the first post stays at the top of the page and the most recents are added to the bottom then you post is obvious implementing the comparable interface if not you cold not add it to an treeset without explicit comparator
a treeset sort its items but you want it it in the inverse order you have a lot of options invert the compareto t o method in you post class multiply the result with -1 but i guess this is not the best solution because it would affect all other functions that base on post s comparable implementation

35520671

uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i could make another uiviewcontroller with the second tableview but i don t want to make my tab bar disappear
it wouldn t if you used a uinavigationcontroller

35526285
division	multiplication
since this is probably not desired you should do one of the following convert one of the terms to float float 1 2 from __future__ import division which enables the python 3 behavior just replace the term with 0.5
you didn t use the multiplication operator in math equations the multiplication operator is often left out

35527203
udp	tcp
in any case if your protocol is just sending small messages and if packet loss reordering or duplication are acceptable than udp might be the better choice because the overhead connection setup ack.. is smaller and it takes less memory
you could also use a single socket to exchange data with all 1000 nodes whereas with tcp you would need a separate socket for each connection socket is not the same as port

35528837
fgets	fread
according to fgets blocks until the specified number of bytes have been read
i suggest trying fread or some other input reception function that isn t blocking and then read only one byte at a time

35530254
strcpy	malloc
you have to allocate memory for your string assign that memory to name and only then do strcpy
you have malloc -ed the struct but you did not malloc the string

35532629
nsstring	nsobject
it can only contain a property list data type nsdata nsstring nsarray nsdictionary nsdate and nsnumber
under these circumstances it makes sense why anyobject was chosen since those 6 data types do not inherit from a common subclass besides nsobject . usually people mention that nscoding and nskeyedarchiver can resolve the issue but i haven t seen more examples explanations beyond that

35533281
namenode	hdfs
the namenode marks datanodes without recent heartbeats as dead and does not forward any new io requests to them
any data that was registered to a dead datanode is not available to hdfs any more

35534602
hex	binary
on the client you re parsing it as hex but on the server you re passing it as a binary string which is used as-is
you either need parse it on the server now it is aes-128 and not aes-256 pass new buffer 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef hex or change the encoding on the client from aes-128 to aes-256 pass cryptojs.enc

35539221
webchromeclient	webviewclient
onpagefinished is not part of webchromeclient therefore you can t override it
it belongs to webviewclient

35542032
ienumerable	iqueryable
if you returned an ienumerable your code would retrieve all values of one table from the database and then perform filtering in memory which is inefficient
an iqueryable is not actually a collection of entities rather it describes how to obtain that collection

35543103
division	exponent	division	addition	multiplication	exponent	exponent	addition
note that in many but not all cases division or multiplication by a constant multiple of 2 can be done with addition alone specifically adding a shift count to the exponent
the result of a floating point division is a sign flag a significand an exponent a set of flags overflow underflow inexact etc - see fenv getting the first 3 pieces correct but the set of flags incorrect is not enough

35543103
division	exponent	division	multiplication
the result of a floating point division is a sign flag a significand an exponent a set of flags overflow underflow inexact etc - see fenv getting the first 3 pieces correct but the set of flags incorrect is not enough
without further knowledge which parts of which pieces of the result actually matter the possible values of the dividend etc i would assume that replacing division by a constant with multiplication by a constant and or a convoluted fma mess is almost never safe

35544336
gif	ico	png	ico
whether to go for gif ico png svg or something else for your favicon depends on a number of factors
the major reasons to go for ico are format supported by the majority of browsers internet explorer before 11 doesn t support anything else

35544336
gif	png
reasons for gif animated gif is the only possibility to get an animated favicon as most browsers do not yet support svg for favicons and even if they do whether they support javascript or smil animations in the case of favicons may be questionable
if your icon exists in only one size and support in older versions of internet explorer is no concern you might prefer png or gif because of the smaller file size

35544336
gif	ico	png	ico
if your icon exists in only one size and support in older versions of internet explorer is no concern you might prefer png or gif because of the smaller file size
however ico files if stored properly are not significantly larger than png files because since windows vista ico files can store png

35544336
png	ico
however ico files if stored properly are not significantly larger than png files because since windows vista ico files can store png
so a corresponding ico file would be 22 bytes bigger 6 bytes header plus 16 bytes entry

35545051
bash	subshell
bash is clever enough to not actually start a subshell for a simple backgrounded command
so it should be sufficient to do i don t know of a way to do this without a subshell

35545121
spaces	delimiter
assuming your path variable was assigned properly without spaces in the assignment fixing step by step for an input file test.txt with one example path your original command doesn t do much as you ve mixed
and as the delimiter

35546457
google-chrome	firefox
see webkit bug 107389 when looking at the headers for each you can see that googleadservices doesn t send any cors information which should cause google-chrome to not load the resource
this is what firefox does however google-chrome seems to require the attribute to properly block

35546528
dictionary	map
dr minus error checking it looks pretty much like use map to turn the into a split up and then build the dictionary of from that using reduce
or by adding an extension to dictionary quite a useful extension btw you can use it for a lot of map filter operations on dictionaries really kind of a shame it doesn t exist by default it becomes even simpler of course you can also combine the two map calls but i prefer to break up the individual transforms

35549074
udp	tcp
tcp performance was always lower than the best udp and its performance varied wildly by over 600 depending upon the os
with tweaks you can make most os perform roughly the same using tcp but by default most are not properly tweaked

35550418
uilabel	uitextview
why are you using uitextview when you can use uilabel for you situation
uitextview does not have autoscaling property

35552307
client-side	server-side
if you re allowing user sessions to be managed client-side though jwts then you should not be keeping track of sessions server-side
since tokens are client-side it should be of no concern to your application how many have been generated as there is no additional overhead for you

35552307
client-side	server-side
since tokens are client-side it should be of no concern to your application how many have been generated as there is no additional overhead for you
if you are concerned about multiple users logging in as the same account then jwts is not the way to go - a server-side managed system would be better where tokens issued can be limited to a number of simultaneous sessions only

35552733
xlsb	xlsm
running macros on another workbook is only possible with microsoft office excel binary worksheet xlsb format
if you re facing the same issue - use an xlsb to save the macros in not xlsm

35555279
coalesce	nvl	coalesce	isnull
you can use left joins like this you didn t specify your dbms so i used coalesce
not all dbms supports that so you may have to change it to nvl or isnull or something

35558365
inline	inlining
the insedge function is not marked with a phased inline or noinline so the inliner is free to inline it whenever it s fully applied
in the definition of insedges we see foldl flip insedge g es inlining foldl gives flip is now fully applied so we can inline it now insedge is fully applied so ghc may choose to inline it right then and there before the rule ever has a chance to fire

35560073
super	self
your super call is incorrect
update so that self is not called as a method argument - as you have it written it will always fail

35560938
hive	hdfs
the filesystem object abstracts most aspects of file management so hive does not have to worry if a file is on s3 or hdfs as the hadoop hdfs layer takes care of that
when dealing with files each file has a path that is a url for instance hdfs dir file or s3 bucket path . the path class resolves the filesystem using the getfilesystem method which would be s3filesystem for an s3 url. from the filesystem object it can get the file size using the methods for filestatus using the getlen method

35564684
implements	extends
and if they are not then java compiler cannot be sure that implements class has implementation of all methods of interface until it checks for each method from each implements interface
if you will define interface c as public interface c extends b then you will not get the error because in this case java compiler will be sure that all methods are implemented

35567873
vbscript	jscript
both hosts expose the wscript object which is where you specify the return code as an argument to the quit method note that vbscript doesn t use parenthesis on void sub method calls wscript.quit 123 if you want to return the value from msgbox you can provide it directly wscript.quit msgbox foobar your .cmd batch file will need to know the numeric value of vbyes vbno and vbcancel
...i suggest doing all of the scripting from within the vbscript file and avoiding the use of .cmd .bat files completely if you can as vbscript is much more readable and powerful though i prefer using the jscript language instead but that s just me

35568466
jar	manifest.mf
but even if it does not there is no reason you can t have meta-inf manifest.mf being put into the jar
then you will have a self-runnable jar file

35569406
build.gradle	gradlew
i ll assume you already have sharedcode build.gradle working at this point
in the android build.gradle apply the j2objc gradlew plugin to sharedcodetestcontracts build.gradle and also make sure you ve specified a j2objclinkage dependency on the shared code assumption 1 your ios module is a pure xcode objc swift project not a java gradlew project that is compiled with j2objc

35569406

if your ios module is a java gradlew project this is still possible but with a different process

implements	extends
so only one row in curriculum can be marked unique - to implements your restrictive requirement one can not a partial unique index team_curriculum_uni_idx enforces only a single reference to it
if there were multiple unique curriculums to be referenced once only we would remove the unique constraints on curriculum.team_unique and extends the partial unique index on team to curriculum_id team_unique

35573627
equals	compareto
assertequals checks if the numbers are equals in value and scale that means 1000 is not equals to 1000.00
if you want to compare only the numeric value you should use compareto method from bigdecimal

google-chrome	firefox
as of beginning of 2016 for me the following syntax works with jquery 1.12.0 ie 11 11.0.9600.18204 update 11.0.28 kb3134815 .find z row firefox 44.0.2 .find z row google-chrome 44.0.2403.89m .find row the syntax doesn t work in any of the browsers mentioned above
i found no way to apply a namespace in google-chrome

35576409
firefox	safari
firefox has restrictions that user must give command to do paste like keyboard event and editable input must be focused so we do tricks here - on ctrl down we focusthat input field on release unfocus
html js safari doesn t implement datatransfer.items so there s no way to extract image data a screenshot copied to the clipboard in javascript

35577698
super	implements
an arrowfunction that references super is always contained within a non- arrowfunction and the necessary state to implements super is accessible via the scope that is captured by the function object of the arrowfunction .
the problem here was that i was using arguments es5 syntax within an arrowfunction in my example arguments in this case does not refer to the arguments of the arrow functions which is what i wanted- any reference to arguments super or this within an arrowfunction are resolved to their bindings in the lexically enclosing function. hence i could re-write to a traditional function though the better solution was to simply use the new rest arguments es2015 syntax instead for example here is the official blurb from babel any reference to arguments super or this within an arrowfunction are resolved to their bindings in the lexically enclosing function

35577786
alarmmanager	timertask
and i so wish that this were the default... i want the service to stay there quiet and be executed at the right time. i m using a timertask use alarmmanager to arrange to get executed at the right time

35579703
spaces	delimiter
as the docs on the authorize endpoint says about the scope parameter scope optional spaces delimiter list of grant scopes you would like to have permission to access on behalf of the user
your scope request parameter should have the scopes spaces delimiter not comma delimiter

35580321
google-chrome	firefox
provided you have enabled --allow-file-access-from-files it will work in google-chrome and doesn t cause any changes in safari
it turns out that adding text after solves this issue for firefox

35581019
cdr	cons
l k low high p car l loop loop low cons car l high cdr l else loop loop cons car l low high cdr l
l k low high p car l loop low cons car l high cdr l else loop cons car l low high cdr l loop l but the trouble is that the lambda s body can t refer to the loop name yet as it is being defined you could just replace let with letrec and then it d work but that s not what you re asking here

35583367
hive	hdfs
for example with the default value of hive.exec.scratchdir in hive 0.14 you would set this value to tmp hive user.name .staging and in hive 0.14 set to tmp hive- user.name .staging you shouldn t have to do this with user.name and it s not a good idea to do so for reasons that are off-topic for this answer
unless you re using hdfs federation and you ve configured hive to put the .staging dir for a job on a different fs namespace than the destination dir which is very unlikely to ever happen with the default settings you probably don t want hive to do the distcp

35584997
google-chrome	firefox
the iceconnectionstatechange handler should fire after 5-10 seconds of not receiving data from the peer anymore in google-chrome
firefox is working on that currently

35586192
swift	objective-c
as i understand that swift handles objective-c tagged pointers which are obtained from the objective-c runtime nsnumber nsdate but does not use tagged pointers for pure swift classes
from the swift abi class layout swift relies on the following assumptions about the objective-c runtime which are therefore now part of the objective-c abi information about objective-c tagged pointer layout ... the following assumptions are part of the swift abi swift class pointers are never tagged pointers

35586966
coalesce	isnull
the isnull return value is always considered not nullable assuming the return value is a non-nullable one whereas coalesce with non-null parameters is considered to be null
so the expressions isnull null 1 and coalesce null 1 although equivalent have different nullability values

35590862
required	placeholder
this way required is respected jsfiddle demo it s worth noting though that you shouldn t really use placeholder in place of a true element
for example mozilla as always puts it best do not use the placeholder attribute instead of a element. their purposes are different the attribute describes the role of the form element

35591680
udp	tcp
intercepting http requests and then routing them over udp to your backend udp-http server you can bypass a lot of tcp overhead in the operating system stacks
you can also have front ends which pipe through on udp themselves which shouldn t be too hard to do yourself

35592019
implements	extends
then you implements the obligatory methods then you define your init override ondraw then drawbmp
one way to achieve this firstly your class must extends view and not activity

35595462
ssl	https
because cpanel has ssl entry in httpd configuration with documentroot usr local apache htdocs and due to that https is showing defaultwebpage
you have not installed ssl on your domain so you can not redirect your https to http version you will have to install self signed ssl on your domain to get this resolve

strcpy	memmove
this is because strcpy doesn t allow memory areas overlapping
you may want to use memmove s s + 2 sizeof s + 2

libstdc++	libc++
so using some features of c++11 with libstdc++ is not possible
the reason is this one mainline libstdc++ has switched to gpl3 a license which the developers of libc++ cannot use

35600339
libstdc++	libc++
the reason is this one mainline libstdc++ has switched to gpl3 a license which the developers of libc++ cannot use
libstdc++ 4.2 the last gpl2 version could be independently extended to support c++11 but this would be a fork of the codebase which is often seen as worse for a project than starting a new independent one

35606154
swift	objective-c
could it be that you forgot to set the app delegate s name in the swift version
also make sure to add objective-c to the swift app delegate class if it isn t already and try this is a really long shot adding the dynamic keyword to the delegate methods

35608948
jar	manifest.mf
odds are in your case that your ide lacks the two jar files on the same class_path but the details of how to fix that are specific to your ide and the types or projects you have created
if your jar file is a library it doesn t get a main-class entry in its manifest.mf

35608948
jar	manifest.mf
if your jar file is a program it needs to include both the main-class entry in its manifest.mf and the manifest should probably mention the required jar files with a class-path entry in manifest.mf
if your jar file is a program that is embedded in other programs it shouldn t be but it happens the other programs will control the startup behavior

35610079
interpolation	splines
speed could then be calculated using r s splinefun routine which can return not only the splines interpolation for position but also the first derivative giving an approximation of speed which is both continuous and depends upon more than two of neighboring data points
code could look like the splines speeds disagree with the speeds from the original calculation but this seems to be a result of the constraint on continuity at the data points

35610301
postgresql	mysql
if your database is postgresql you can get the next id with this example for a table called users unlike the other answers this value is not affected by the deletion of records

35611316
factors	mean
if you want to convert all factors in the dataframe you can use something along the lines note that this converts all factors and might not be what you want if you have factors that do not represent numeric values
if unnecessary conversion is a problem or if there are non-numeric factors or characters in the data the following would be appropriate on a more general point though the type of your variables should not prevent you from filtering if with filtering you mean subsetting the dataframe

35612044
bash	zsh
to run chkchroot as a command do not include it inside bash interprets your chkchroot as an implicit -n chkchroot which is always true and does not run chkchroot
zsh does not allow this which is why it complains

35612869
google-chrome	firefox
intermediate results i did not notice any performance difference between each of the four scenarios however i did notice that firefox was about 4x faster than google-chrome for both scenarios
to be more specific it takes google-chrome about 1 seconds to process each scenario whereas it takes fixefox only 0.25 seconds

35613723

writing a swift extension wouldn t work in my case
for using method swizzling i created a new objective-c class in my main bundle with the method i wanted to replace inject into the cocoapod

35614914
ssl	https
ssh is not implemented by chrome but rather it implements ssl
it also does not implement smtp but rather when you visit a website like gmail or yahoo mail you are simply visiting a website via http or hopefully https

35616327
mongodb	bson
just because there is no helper for implementing the or operators does not mean they cannot be used as long as you are connecting to a mongodb 3.2 instance of course
all you really need is a custom class supporting the aggregationoperation interface that will allow construction using dbobject then you can use that class in aggregation pipeline construction like so and that is the equivalent of the documentation example as an interface for aggregationoperation the class easily mixes with the implemented helpers so you can still use features even if there is no buit in helper to work out the bson object construction for you

35617776
ssl	https
you d have to decrypt it which is not easy - wireshark has code that can sometimes do it if you provide the right information but as the wireshark wiki entry for ssl indicates and as a look at the wireshark code to do the decryption will show there s a significant amount of work involved
it s the s in https that s the problem

35618484
bash	subshell
the bash manual does not appear to mention this
the err trap is not inherited by subshell including function calls unless you set -o errtrace

35621915
super	extends
there are some caveats tho you cannot use decorators in base class to use dependency injection you must provide constructor arguments via super you can by default only extends one class
you can make a base class with common functionality and extends it when you want to inherit common things or change overwrite specific things

35622830
swift	objective-c
its just that in objective c using a nil object does not crash whereas in swift it crashes
you can verify this by checking if the cell is nil or not in objective-c and putting a log

35625007
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
hence it doesn t work in google-chrome
the getclientrects method is supported in firefox from version 3 in opera from version 9.5 and in safari from version 4

35628095
union	distinct
performance on time union all union so union is much better than the union all with distinct in performance-wise
the difference between union and union all is that union all will not eliminate duplicate rows instead it just pulls all rows from all tables fitting your query specifics and combines them into a table

35628095
union	distinct
the difference between union and union all is that union all will not eliminate duplicate rows instead it just pulls all rows from all tables fitting your query specifics and combines them into a table
a union statement effectively does a select distinct on the results set

35633721
hex	binary
to find which field has invalid characters you can test it with this query select top 1 char 31 +char 31 + hex 0x1f field from sysobjects for xml auto type the result will be msg 6841 level 16 state 1 line 3 for xml could not serialize the data for node field because it contains a character 0x001f which is not allowed in xml
to retrieve this data using for xml convert it to binary varbinary or image data type and use the binary base64 directive

35636077
seaborn	colormap
although i am not sure if this is the result you expect you can save your dataframe in png by plotting the dataframe with seaborn heatmap with annotations on like this mwaskom software seaborn generated seaborn.heatmap.html#seaborn.heatmap it works right away with a pandas dataframe
you can look at this example efficiently ploting a table in csv format using python you might want to change the colormap so it displays a white background only

35638350
hex	binary	octal	binary
in fact you may have noticed that if you follow the normal conventions as i have here 10 always represents the number corresponding to the base you re working in 2 in binary 8 in octal 16 in hex etc. you can also make some inferences based on having too many digits
for example 2 is not a valid number in base 2 binary because the only valid digits are 0 and 1

35639233
subtraction	multiplication
this will provide the same result 1.2 since subtraction really isn t affected by decimal points when represented as fixed-point
if speed matters and you don t have multiplication routines that can ignore the decimal most won t you may need to build them since at 8x8 you won t have enough space to shift the entire value into the left-side for some operations i implemented 24x8 fixed point registers in my pic 16f library to allow higher precision when performing computations on 16x8 fixed point

35640653
google-chrome	firefox
the fact that transform-origin has no influence on svg in google-chrome 48 is expected
well the reason is not exactly clear but it seems that it is part of the ongoing effort from mozilla to slowly bring support for svg 2 in firefox

35641763
swift	objective-c
their performance is so close to swift unsafe buffer based arrays that using unsafe memory buffers does not really seem worth the trouble any more which is big
btw objective-c nsarray performance stinks

35641998
persistent	transient
furthermore since jpa treats fields marked with the transient keyword as having the transient annotation the field will not be persistent by jpa either
on the other hand fields annotated transient alone will be converted to a byte stream when the object is serialized but it will not be persistent by jpa

35641998
persistent	transient
on the other hand fields annotated transient alone will be converted to a byte stream when the object is serialized but it will not be persistent by jpa
therefore the transient keyword is a stronger condition than the transient annotation

35641998
persistent	transient
the server does not care to persistent estimatedminutesremaining but the client certainly cares about this information
therefore the estimatedminutesremaining is annotated using transient

35642399
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
uitabbarcontrollerdelegate provides the method func tabbarcontroller _ tabbarcontroller uitabbarcontroller didselectviewcontroller viewcontroller uiviewcontroller
if you re using a uitabbarcontroller and not just a uitabbar look into using uitabbarcontrollerdelegate rather than uitabbardelegate

35642677
hex	binary
pdo param_lob shall be used instead using pdo param_str for file columns to make sure db has output the correct file through the driver convert the varbinary max field into hex string and hand it over to php normally using this method converting the column to varchar max rather than nvarchar max because hex strings do not need any support to unicode and leave a plain hex string
then hex strings can be convert back from hex data to binary through php function hex2bin efficiently

35642677
hex	binary
then hex strings can be convert back from hex data to binary through php function hex2bin efficiently
the solution additional information when selecting varbinary column from sql server native client 11.0 and odbc driver 11 for sql server neither converting the column to varchar or not php outputs a corrupted binary result which is unwanted

35651203
implements	extends
you cannot add new interfaces without changing the base class though as it has to declare that it implements those interfaces
an interface gives you access to an aspect of a class as opposed to a derived class that actually extends the base class

35655930
swift	objective-c
the swift do - try - catch syntax is designed to handle the errors analogous to the nserror patterns in objective-c not for handling fatal errors exceptions
do not be confused by the similarity of swift s error handling do - try - catch with the completely different objective-c exception handling pattern of try - catch

35656012
ng-app	ng-controller
update here s a fiddle update 2 fiddle with table update 3 for some reason it is not working when setting it on a div inside the tbody tag i moved the ng-app to table and ng-controller to tbody and it works
define ng-controller in an element different from ng-repeat you might be repeating the ng-controller directive for each row

35659781
portrait	landscape
looking at the layout in portrait there is probably not enough content to even need the view to scroll
i plugged this into android studio and was only able to scroll when in landscape

35660209
google-chrome	firefox
there are polyfills to add smil support to google-chrome
you cannot animate attributes with css animation and in svg 1.1 which firefox implements y and width are attributes

35661316
apache	nginx
apache has a setting specific for intermediate certs but nginx does not so it must be within same file as your regular cert
just wanted to add to this since i ran into the same problem and nothing i could find anywhere would work e.g downloading the cacert.pem file setting cafile in php.ini etc. if you are using nginx and your ssl certificate comes with an intermediate certificate you need to combine the intermediate cert file with your main mydomain.com.crt file and it should work

35666988
express	node.js
as it is just a convention widely used by express link and node.js itself does not care about that specific environment variable
the definitions for the process variable can be found in default node.js d.ts from definitely typed and added in your typings.json like this node github definitelytyped definitelytyped node node.d.ts i do not think there are any definitions for the particular node_env variable

35668837
spaces	delimiter
so in your case we will use spaces as a delimiter you may also find a more lengthy solution without it here
you may use stringutils reversedelimited reverses a string that is delimiter by a specific character. the strings between the delimiter are not reversed

35671352
client-side	server-side
some kind of client-side code must exist in order to create a client-only postssearch collection
this is because you said this collection doesn t exist on server-side database

35673909
qthread	qobject
because only run runs inside a separate thread you have to consider the following signals belong to the instance ergo signals have a different thread affinity then the run slots belong to the instance ergo slots have a different thread affinity then the run - accessing shared data that is processed both inside a slot and inside run requires explicitly employing thread-safety mechanisms such as mutexes and semaphores if you do a lot of stuff inside your slots you will still freeze your ui as if you are not using your qthread that said there are some scenarios where you may want to have to employ slots and signals in a qthread but such implementation would have to be directed towards controlling the instance of qthread and not what it s actually running in a separate thread using run
here is a small demo i have written as a demonstration of how to implement slots and signals and interact with a separate thread using qobject

35673909
qthread	qobject
note that the usage of qthread is actually not necessary
you can also use a qrunnable for example though you have to explicitly tell it to inherit from qobject too or to use a separate subclass of qobject created by you because qrunnable doesn t support slots and signals it s not a subclass of qobject

35678249
noexcept	throw
it depends on what you think noexcept should mean
the standard library seems to treat it as a keyword meaning the function can t possibly fail not just that it doesn t throw

35678249
noexcept	throw
if you follow their convention you shouldn t make it noexcept
however if you want noexcept to mean only that it doesn t throw then you should

35678837
tensorflow	cudnn
the most important thing to realize about tensorflow is that for the most part the core is not written in python it s written in a combination of highly-optimized c++ and cuda nvidia s language for programming gpus
much of that happens in turn by using eigen a high-performance c++ and cuda numerical library and nvidia s cudnn a very optimized dnn library for nvidia gpus for functions such as convolutions

35681481
rsa	dsa
you need to add pubkeyacceptedkeytypes +ssh-dss into your .ssh config or rather generate standard rsa keys which work without issues
debug1 skipping ssh-dss key home myuser .ssh id_dsa for not in pubkeyacceptedkeytypes you generated dsa key which is not supported by default

35681549
realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
you cannot use sizeof to retrieve the actual size allocated by malloc calloc or realloc
some malloc implementations have a function to do that but it is non standard

35682385
g++	gcc
all your g++ calls use the -c option
from gcc s help -c compile and assemble but do not link your last g++ call should not have the -c option

35684644
ecj	javac
eclipse uses its own compiler called ecj rather than javac from the jdk which behaves differently when it encounters errors
whereas javac will immediately stop and not produce any output ecj does produce class files as output

35686286
portrait	landscape
if the problem is that for certain screen configurations small screens portrait config etc. the tabs need to be scrollable because they don t fit the screen and for other screen config sizes the number of tabs fit perfectly in the screen you could just use the resource qualifiers to define your tabs differently for different screen config sizes
as an example imagine your tabs do not fit in portrait but do fit in landscape

35686286
portrait	landscape
as an example imagine your tabs do not fit in portrait but do fit in landscape
hence one might want the tabs to be scrollable in portrait and fixed in landscape

35686621
profiling	benchmarking
unless forks 0 not recommended as benchmarking isolation is gone mixed compilation profiling etc meant mostly for debugging all benchmarking are run in separate processes
so each trial setup teardown for a given benchmarking will run once for that jvm

35689703
symfony	silex
you can actually use symfony form 3 with silex but createbuilder function now requires you to adhere to the new way of passing in types as arguments
silex documentation has not been updated to reflect this

35690158
profiling	debugging
then assuming you ve got the certificate and provisioning profiling configured properly you then open up the project in xcode on your remote mac to submit to itunes connect
my confusion was this when building to ios for testing debugging you do a build and run aka f5 but when you are ready to do the production build you must just choose build in visual studio not build and run

35690408
client-side	server-side
easy to do if using server-side pagination but possible even if client-side
if you fixed on using client-side not server side pagination + search meaning that the js does the search not your own server code then look at custom search

35690408
client-side	server-side
if you fixed on using client-side not server side pagination + search meaning that the js does the search not your own server code then look at custom search
relatively new feature i think not used it myself as if i wanted a custom search i would use server-side code

35690586
prepare	execute
you already have an array of keys and values to bind in so after you prepare the statement loop through it and bind accordingly notice that you must use bindvalue since bindparam will not work
the php manual states why unlike pdostatement bindvalue the variable is bound as a reference and will only be evaluated at the time that pdostatement execute is called

35693118
centos	linux	daemons	systemd
docker needs the ip address of the docker0 interface rather than the interface name so we use ifconfig to retrieve that so for my systemd the host s interface on the default docker0 bridge is accessible as 172.17.0.1 appending | cut -f 10 -d to that command should filter the output to just the ip address since i m assuming a systemd-based linux with a systemd provided docker package we ll query the systemd package s service file to find out how the service is being started the first thing we re looking for is the exact command used to start the daemons which should look something like this the second part we re looking for is whether or not the service is configured to use an environment file as indicated by one of more lines like this when an environment file is in use as it is on fedora 23 then the way to change the docker daemons settings is to edit that file and update the relevant environment variable the existing options entry on fedora 23 looks like this to change the default dns resolution settings we amend it to look like this and then restart the docker daemons with this change implemented docker containers should now be reliably able to access any systemd your host systemd can access including via vpn tunnel which was my own reason for needing to figure this out you can run curl inside a container to check name resolution is working correctly docker run -it centos curl google.com replace google.com with whichever hostname was giving you problems as you should have only ended up finding this answer if you had a name resolution problem when running a process inside a docker container configuring docker using a systemd drop-in file caveat since my systemd uses an environment file i haven t been able to test the drop-in file based approach below but it should work - i ve included it since the docker documentation seems to indicate they now prefer the use of systemd drop-in files to the use of environment files if the systemd service file doesn t use environmentfile then the entire execstart entry can be replaced by using a drop-in configuration file we then tell docker to clear the existing execstart entry and replace it with our new one with the additional settings we then tell systemd to load that configuration change and restart docker references docker systemd config reference systemd service file reference dnsmasq reference firewalld reference setting up dnsmasq without an existing local resolver on the host
the problem here is that many modern linux systemd run dnsmasq implicitly so what you re now aiming to do is to set up a second instance specifically for docker to use

35693173
multiplying	division	multiplying	multiplication
it is also common knowledge that 22 10 is not representable exactly in binary floating-point so all you are achieving instead of multiplying by a slightly inaccurate value is dividing by a slightly inaccurate value
in fact if the intent is to divide by 22 10 or some other real value that isn t necessarily exactly representable in binary floating-point then half the times the multiplication is more accurate than the division because it happens by coincidence that the relative error for 1 x is less than the relative error for x

35693173
multiplying	multiplication
another remark is that your micro-benchmark runs into subnormal numbers where the timings are not representative of timings for the usual operations on normal floating-point numbers and after a short while value is zero which again means that the timings are not representative of the reality of multiplying and dividing normal numbers
and as mark ransom says you should at least make the operands the same for both measurements as currently written all the multiplication take a zero operand and result in zero

35694681
ssl	https
the force ssl package won t work for an environment where the server is behind a load balancer that redirects to the server as http
as far as the server is concerned all traffic is http not https so you ll end up with an infinite loop

35696558
fileoutputstream	filewriter	fileoutputstream	bufferedwriter	filewriter	bufferedwriter
when that s a filewriter this will ultimately close a fileoutputstream and tell the os that you re done writing to the file
the garbage collector will automatically call close not on the bufferedwriter or the wrapped filewriter but on the fileouputstream

35699041
build.gradle	gradlew
we will just add something to it in the lib s build.gradle
notice that the task is implicit and isn t in the gradlew file at all

35699072
build.gradle	gradlew
make sure you are using at least version 23.2.0 of appcompat in your build.gradle the vectordrawable and animatedvectordrawable libraries do not need to be added separately the official anouncement blog you linked to gives a couple of different ways to ensure android studio does not convert your vector drawables into pngs
there are two different methods depending on what version of the gradlew plugin you are using so you should follow the appropriate one

35700939
swift	objective-c
so swift objective-c would be complaining about the same thing here what you re trying to return and the declared return type of the method do not match
in case it s helpful since you seem perhaps more familiar with objective-c than swift here s what your swift method would look like if we translated it back into objective-c and again this would generate the same or similar compile time warnings or errors because the return type does not match the method signature

35700939
swift	objective-c
in case it s helpful since you seem perhaps more familiar with objective-c than swift here s what your swift method would look like if we translated it back into objective-c and again this would generate the same or similar compile time warnings or errors because the return type does not match the method signature
but objective-c would not crash for unwrapping nil but swift will

35707077
translation	localization
unless you have downloaded the author s original storyboard your storyboard will have all different object ids so xcode won t know how to associate the correct translation to the correct objects
i don t think xcode will import localization for objects with objectids it doesn t recognise

35708911
decimal	ieee
you re looking to solve essentially the same problem that python s repr solves namely finding the shortest decimal string that rounds to a given float
except that in your case the float isn t an ieee 754 binary64 double precision float but an ieee 754 binary32 single precision float

35708932
implements	extends
there simply isn t any mechanism to say that your anonymous inner class is going to implements multiple interfaces
in fact an anonymous inner class can t even extends a class and implements an interface at the same time

35708932
implements	extends
in fact an anonymous inner class can t even extends a class and implements an interface at the same time
the innve class has to choose either to be a subclass of a named class and not directly implements any interface at all or to implements a single interface

35710314
persistent	transient
from the documentation on activity lifecycle note because onsaveinstancestate is not guaranteed to be called you should use it only to record the transient state of the activity the state of the ui you should never use it to store persistent data
instead you should use onpause to store persistent data such as data that should be saved to a database when the user leaves the activity

35713708
content-length	content-type
post http 1.1 user-agent fiddler host localhost 5076 content-type application json content-length 7 alice when a parameter has frombody web api uses the content-type header to select a formatter
in this example the content-type is application json and the request body is a raw json string not a json object

35714225
prepare	execute
because local variables are in scope only during stored program execution references to them are not permitted in prepare statements created within a stored program
prepare statement scope is the current session not the stored program so the statement could be execute after the program ends at which point the variables would no longer be in scope

35714225
prepare	execute
a prepare statement created within a stored program continues to exist after the program finishes executing and can be execute outside the program later
a statement prepare in stored program context cannot refer to stored procedure or function parameters or local variables because they go out of scope when the program ends and would be unavailable were the statement to be execute later outside the program

35718053
nsstring	nsobject
so not any of the following instances nsdata nsstring nsnumber nsdate nsarray or nsdictionary
if your testingarray has a custom nsobject inside it this is where your problem is

35720598
bash	subshell
it will be set to greater than zero if any matching file is found ... is used for arithmetic evaluation in bash .. creates a subshell for the above commands so that current shell s env is not affected
in bash you can use when it find a matching file it will exit with 0 and prints files exist. when it doesn t find any matching file directory with the given glob pattern it will exit with 1 and print files don t exist explanation shopt -s nullglob causes shell to fail silently if no matching file is there for the glob set -- assigns given arguments to the positional parameters etc

35724212
ssl	https
while it might work within one network it will not work within another and if you try to combine ftp with ssl to secure the transport it gets even worse
http and https instead work usually without problems

35724496
octal	decimal
here i don t know why it prints 0o755 prints 493 because they re the very same value one in octal one in decimal once converted to a numeric value the int object it s stored in doesn t indicate what base was originally used
octal is in this case used because unix file permissions are convenient to group in 3-bit groups you get one digit each for owner group and other permissions each of which contains read write and execute bits

35724909
hex	binary
hex is just a way to represent number
the same statment is true for decimal number system and binary although with exception of some custom made numbers bignums etd everything will be stored as binary as long as its integer by integer i mean not floating point number

35725313
scikit-learn	libsvm
scikit-learn does not do this and leaves it up the user to realize that the same scaling approach needs to be taken on both training and test data
i only thought to check this after encountering and reading this guide from the nice people behind libsvm

35743252
bower	npm
at the moment there is none if your only option is bower
a lockfile a la composer or a shrinkwrap mechanism a la npm is in the works however it seems to have stalled as there are currently not enough contributors maintainers to test the feature and maintain it in the long run

35745958
hlsl	glsl
when creating one of the hlsl files in visual studio their default item type can be seen in the property panel is hlsl compiler
this means that the compiler chain tries to compile this files with the hlsl compiler which is not going to work out when the file contains glsl code

35746977
erlang	elixir
there are other folks that are doing data related stuff with elixir erlang and there is disco that allows you run mapreduce jobs in erlang
data science is very broad topic there many things involved i would like to add my 2 cents you sure can do data science in elixir but it may not do certain things very well like some of the other tools do but you can get pretty far i use elixir for data cleaning and data formatting

35747806
ionic	angular
to save the resoltion to bower.json or just add the below and change it to the version you want so now your project will say i need angular version x and then ionic says i need a different one but you in your bower.json you specify which to override
if you want to look into this more look at the bower.json file within bower_components ionic bower.json there is also a .bower.json not quite sure of the difference here

35748657
sudo	passwd
dr to access newer versioning of mysql mariadb after as the root user after a new install you need to be in a root shell ie sudo mysql -u root or mysql -u root inside a shell started by su - or sudo -i first having just done the same upgrade on ubuntu i had the same issue
what was odd was that sudo usr bin mysql_secure_installation would accept my passwd and allow me to set it but i couldn t log in as root via the mysql client i had to start mariadb with sudo mysqld_safe --skip-grant-tables to get access as root whilst all the other users could still access fine

35753931
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu 14.04 apparently uses liblablgtk2-ocaml-dev-2.16.0
for some reason which is not really explained in the corresponding debian repository this .deb seems to include a patch to specifically not install some parts of the library

35755989
mongodb	bson
lookup is essentially combining two documents into single bson document so mongodb document size limit is biting you back
if yes do it the way you have to do in previous versions of mongodb where lookup is not supported

35756058
floating-point	fractions
in short floating-point numbers numbers are represented as + - d 2 e with respectively in the single-precision case d being limited to 0 d 2 24 and in the double-precision case 0 d 2 53
note that even fractions numbers with a simple expression in decimal like 0.1 are not automatically representable exactly in these formats

35760603
onresume	onpause
i believe it s not really a problem to have callbacks executed while in the paused state so i would just put the register unregister in onstop onstart but if you really want to make sure you can put them in onpause onresume
onpause onresume is called when your activity does not have the focus anymore but could still be visible think a dialog or alert on top of your activity

35763094
noexcept	throw
you have not declared it as noexcept
that is what the looser throw specifier is telling you

35766881
bash	subshell
it s a little convoluted but non-interactive non-login bash instances don t read the profile files
your path settings does not get picked up by the subshell which is actually bin sh which might not even be bash at all

35767709
jar	war
given that you are running a jar and the api does not accept a null docbase the trick is to pass an empty folder so no content is accessible from it you can see here a more complex example allowing running over jar war or source folder and automatically opening the browser after startup
the doc base path must resolve to a folder and in your case is set to the current running jar

35777704
swift	objective-c
i have not tested this code only translated it from objective-c to swift
in objective-c code like this works

35779783
move	drag
i believe i have fixed this issue though i have not confirmed the specific symptom triggered by a window resize since we move to a statically sized jsplitpane and resizing the window doesn t change the divider position anymore
however we were having another issue which i believe was caused by the same underlying issue after moving the divider from position 0 one could no longer manually drag the divider back to position 0

35780118
bash	subshell
i am not sure if you can never tried to install conda or modify environments outside of bash though
the main problem with using conda outside of bash or zsh is that it requires the activate and deactivate scripts to modify the local environment meaning that they must be sourced rather than executed in a subshell

35780988
swift	objective-c
since objective-c isn t namespaced you still need to pick unique names for each nested class but at least the swift side is properly namespaced
at this time i think that interface builder only recognizes the names of objective-c classes

35782090
google-chrome	firefox
in either case be sure to send x-content-type-options nosniff to prevent content type sniffing that happens in google-chrome ie
i m not sure if firefox will treat an image tag that points to a javascript file will treat that as javascript due to sniffing but your script-src should prevent that from being terrible

35782144
scipy	sympy
interestingly scipy does not seem to supply that functionality
an alternative is converting the lti system into a sympy rational function

35782706
spaces	delimiter
this allows simplification of the cut command which incidentally strips the leading spaces from the output and also makes tr s -s option unnecessary cut -sd -f2- -s means that lines not containing the delimiter separator specified with -d are skipped which skips a trailing empty line empty except for the byte-offset column that hexdump may output
-d splits the input into fields using a single spaces as the delimiter

35790712
noexcept	throw
it takes offense at this funny-looking declaration the outermost noexcept is a noexcept specifier stating that d d is noexcept if and only if its constant-expression argument evaluates to true
the inner noexcept is a noexcept operator that checks at compile time whether its argument expression which is not actually evaluated throw no exceptions

35790712
noexcept	throw
the inner noexcept is a noexcept operator that checks at compile time whether its argument expression which is not actually evaluated throw no exceptions
because d d int is noexcept inherited from b this should be true

35790712
noexcept	throw
because d d int is noexcept inherited from b this should be true
cppreference.com explicitly notes that using the operator inside the specifier is allowed emphasis added the noexcept operator performs a compile-time check that returns true if an expression is declared to not throw any exceptions

35790712
noexcept	throw
cppreference.com explicitly notes that using the operator inside the specifier is allowed emphasis added the noexcept operator performs a compile-time check that returns true if an expression is declared to not throw any exceptions
it can be used within a function template s noexcept specifier to declare that the function will throw exceptions for some types but not others

35790712
noexcept	throw
it can be used within a function template s noexcept specifier to declare that the function will throw exceptions for some types but not others
now the class should be considered complete within the noexcept specifier due to 9.2.2 of the standard bold emphasis added a class is considered a completely-defined object type 3.9 or complete type at the closing of the class-specifier

cpython	ironpython	cpython	pypy
worth reading pep 0008 programming recommendations code should be written in a way that does not disadvantage other implementations of python pypy jython ironpython cpython psyco and such
for example do not rely on cpython s efficient implementation of in-place string concatenation for statements in the form a + b or a a + b

implements	extends
you can extends spring s user class or implements the userdetails interface in one of your own entities and put an instance of that entity in the securitycontextholder after successful authentication
suppose you a have user entity not to be confused with spring s org.springframework.security.core.userdetails.user then you can implements the userdetails interface like following then you can define a userdetailsservice to search users based on the username and return an instance of the user entity if possible

35794955
ssl	https
recent comments suggest that there is an issue with this on ssl with newer nginx versions but i m on 1.4.6 and everything is good
as of march 2016 i ran into this issue trying to post json over https from python requests not that it matters

35801059
cloudant	couchdb
here s what your cq index should look like and what the subsequent query looks like you can try it yourself in the query section of the cloudant dashboard or via curl with something like this that database is world-readable so you can see the sample documents i created in there here dig the seinfeld theme d
this is a lot like my response at cloudant selector query but here s the deal applied to your question the easiest way to run this query is using cloudant query or mango as it s called in the forthcoming couchdb 2.0 release -- and not the traditional mapreduce view indexing system in couchdb

35802087
spaces	delimiter
it is not itself a token of any kind. tokens do not have to be separated by white spaces but it is often necessary to avoid ambiguities
nor does visual studio tokens are delimiter bounded by white-space characters and by other tokens such as operators and punctuation

35805359
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
it s tough to gauge from the parameters you posted but just based on you saying that this works perfectly in safari but doesn t work in google-chrome or firefox it sounds like this could be a cors issue
firefox and google-chrome have different requirements for cross-origin requests than safari

35805708
portrait	landscape
but the zooming isn t handled well as that in portrait mode
in dataviewcontroller.m file of library code in viewwillappear is there for that disable zooming if our pages are currently shown in landscape setting no to yes here will enable zoom in landscape mode

35806775
mvp	presenter
arguably fxml gives you more of a mvp architecture which is similar
there are variants of this too but generally the presenter will observe the model and update the view when data in the model changes as well as update the model in response to user interaction. so your model might look like your buttonpanel.fxml doesn t change your controller has a reference to the model

35807939
multiplication	modulo
other operations may take much longer on 64 bit values than on 32 bit values such as multiplication and divisions or modulo operations which are probably the bottleneck in your implementation
your code uses many divisions and modulo operations these are most costly on unsigned long long than on int values especially for the last loop where the divisions are not compiled as multiplication

35808320
client-side	server-side
you can t really change shared state on the client. from the vaadin docs shared state should be considered read-only on the client-side as it is not serialized back to the server-side
i think what you re looking for is rpc rpc calls from the client-side to the server-side are made through an rpc interface that extends the serverrpc interface

35815422
postgresql	mysql
the newer postgresql statement added in 9.5 was designed with an awareness of mysql s syntax
the decision not to use the same syntax was intentional because mysql s statement has big ambiguities around handling of multiple unique indexes etc where it basically shrugs and says dunno

35816785
multiplying	division
that is the conversion must not divide by any number except 1 only multiplying
for example the first example does not compile because it would require division by 60 resulting in h which is not equal to 30min

35819346
factors	mean
there must be some other factors
seeing a cpu spike doesn t necessarily mean the data was inserted

35821400
base	fractions
so now the question becomes how to convert between base
the simplest solution is to divide by x repeatedly - each time convert the remainder to base x and add it to the front of your output string until there s nothing left then use the integer part of the division for the next iteration so in base 35 the decimal number 7158 is represented by the symbols you choose for 5 29 18 if you try the example above yourself by multiplying the fractions part of each division by 35 you may get some results which are not integers - computers work in binary and are automatically doing the base conversion and only work with a fixed number of digits - i.e

35827011
erlang	elixir
unfortunately it s not possible. to interconnect erlang vm nodes you d need epmd port 4369 to be open. heroku doesn t allow opening custom ports so it s not possible
in case you d want to establish a connection between your phoenix server and elixir node you d have to two nodes on the same machine start phoenix using iex --name phoenix 127.0.0.1 -s mix phoenix.server start iex --name other_node 127.0.0.1 establish a connection using node.ping from other_node should return pong not pang two nodes on different machines start phoenix using some external address iex --name phoenix 195.20.2.2 --cookie someword -s mix phoenix.server start second node iex --name other_node 195.20.2.10 --cookie someword establish a connection using node.ping from other_node should return pong not pang both nodes should contact each other on the addresses they usually see each other on the network

35827609
build.gradle	gradlew
if you use gradlew in command line the language level works fines as specified in build.gradle file
but when import gradlew java project into intellij idea gradlew s plugin take responsibility to generate idea s project setting files unfortunately the plug in does not respect build.gradle s sourcecompatibility targetcompatibility property instead it use idea s setting so i think this is a bug of gradlew s idea plugin

35828653
swift	objective-c
the problem with the library is that swift struct cannot be bridged to objective-c so you cannot create the peekviewaction array
i have updated the code with objective-c support so now you can use another static method to show the peekview

35829656
google-chrome	firefox
this is a bit tricky to make it work in google-chrome you just need to add on every level
but this will not work in firefox

35829679
super	self
since the generator expression creates an additional function super without arguments does not work there
however since your superclass is not probable to change in the middle of execution of a method you can move it out of the generator expression - this should also speed things up however as static methods are inherited in python you could call the super method via self provided that you didn t override it in a subclass

35829679
super	self
however since your superclass is not probable to change in the middle of execution of a method you can move it out of the generator expression - this should also speed things up however as static methods are inherited in python you could call the super method via self provided that you didn t override it in a subclassing
thus in this simple case you can write def to_expr self return + str self.op + .join self.bracket_complex child for child in self.children the implementation detail is that if no arguments are provided the first argument shall be the value that is in the __class__ cell of the caller frame and second shall be the first argument given to the caller function

35829773
super	self
answering your implied question in java the static method would get inherited so i wouldn t even need the super call but in python this does not seem to be the case
staticmethod s are inherited outputs hello hello note that you cannot simply write class b a def b self a python will never resolve a simple name to a method staticmethod

35830398
profiling	instrumentation
run your app with the time profiling instrumentation it will tell you where is your bottleneck
not sure if you have looked instrumentation

35830468
jar	war
if you re planning to use another standalone tomcat server to deploy your boot application which i do not recommend first you should tell your build tool to package your application as a war not jar
then modify your main boot application entry point to support that and finally deploy your war file to your tomcat server either by using intellij or manually

35832178
lasagne	keras
here are some suggestions i m not sure if they will actually close the performance gap you are observing according to the keras documentation the highway layer is initialized using glorot uniform weights while in your lasagne code you are using orthogonal weight initialization
unless you have another part of your code where you set the weight initialization to orthogonal for the keras highway layer this could be a source of the performance gap

35833458
memcpy	strncpy
to extract a fragment from a string use memcpy and add a final 0 by hand
incidentally strncpy will not null terminate the destination if the size argument is less than the length of the source string

35838827
spaces	linefeed
if unicode is set this will match the characters plus whatever is classified as spaces in the unicode character properties database
if you need to support all unicode spaces use this expression will match any whitespace that is not a linefeed

35847272
dbcontext	objectcontext
entitydatasource uses the underlying objectcontext not the dbcontext
this is why you never see anything go directly through your savechanges overloads on your dbcontext

35847981
udp	tcp
you can still create raw sockets for udp or for ip itself
in the case of ip itself you cannot transmit packets from your raw socket that have the protocol number set to tcp

35848615
google-chrome	firefox
solution found from this google-chrome defect transfer-encoding chunked not support on text plain
if you want to output chunked plain text in google-chrome - just like what firefox is doing by default - you need to use the x-content-type-options nosniff header

35850843
vbscript	jscript
nope no named groups in vbscript regular expressions
vbscript uses the same regexp engine that jscript uses so it s compatible with javascript regex which also doesn t have named groups

35851881
oncreate	onstart	onresume	onpause
an activity starting up from scratch goes oncreate onstart onresume user sees the activity on screen
once the application is paused you get a call to onpause and onstop if the activity is not visible and on resume you get a call to onstart and onresume

35852220
erlang	elixir
the problem that i see is that arity is very important in elixir erlang and i don t see how to account for that in a straightforward way
your example doesn t make a whole lot of sense to me because there is only a single type of function in elixir but function is a type that you can implement protocols for

35853376
required	placeholder
it turns out our implementation required the content-type header value to be lower case application json works whereas application json doesn t
i ve updated this issue to be the placeholder for the fix

35855689
config	ini
there probably is something in the app or database directory that s causing some fatal error and your php config is set to not display any errors
execute php --ini to find out which ini file is used and then configure it to show errors

35856360
bower	npm
installing angular from npm typically means that you re going to serve it from your node_modules folder or you will be using bower
i would advise against using npm install --save angular your node_modules should contain just server-side dependencies if you re not using bower in most cases

35856360
bower	npm
i would advise against using npm install --save angular your node_modules should contain just server-side dependencies if you re not using bower in most cases
additionally npm packages use commonjs which isn t preferred in the browser

35856466
portrait	landscape
if you want to store the picture as portrait you will need or not need manual rotation of the jpeg regardless of your activity orientation
on most devices camera can only produce landscape jpeg files

35856651
nfa	dfa
if you have a regular expression without any optional such as ab the nfa graph doesn t have to contain any epsilon edges
an important concept in nfa simulation and nfa to dfa translation is the epsilon closure a set of states reachable from a state by following epsilon transitions

35858467
swift	objective-c
since kvo is part of the objective-c runtime the change dictionary is an nsdictionary not a native swift dictionary
an nsdictionary can only hold objective-c objects which is why in swift it becomes a not a and cgpoint is not an objective-c object

35862334
qthread	qobject
do not extend qthread
extend qobject instead

35865751
build.gradle	gradlew
found a workaround add this to your build.gradle file and do not use multidextestrunner
this is a gradlew bug with multidex as discussed in android issue 194609 m... felixschulze.de .

35866246
equals	gethashcode
however the reverse is not true equals hash codes do not imply object equality because different unequal objects can have identical hash codes
furthermore the .net framework does not guarantee the default implementation of the gethashcode method and the value this method returns may differ between .net framework versions and platforms such as 32-bit and 64-bit platforms

35866587
inline	inlining
think of a lambda as a small object with a function call operator is somewhat equivalent to so you see the function body itself can be inline if it is seen in the same translation unit as it is called and possibly if not by some smarter compilers
since your invoke is a template it knows the actual type of the lamdba and you don t force it to jump through function-pointer hoops which a big inhibitor of inlining

35874631
ssl	https
sending data in plaintext over ssl is safe enough for those applications and trying to replace ssl with your own encryption scheme is almost certainly more trouble than its worth. you should probably get your own ssl certificate
i don t know what restrictions azure has on https access if any and its always bad practice to rely on a key you cannot control

35881413
persistent	transient
entitymanager.persist is used to make a transient instances persistent
in this case transient a term used by hibernate but valid for other persistence providers as well means an entity which doesn t have a representation in the persistence context or the underlying datastore

35882715
coalesce	isnull
as a result the returned value that originated in the input y is truncated after three characters.that means isnull would not change the type but coalesce would
output coalescexy coalesceyx isnullxy isnullyx ---------- ---------- -------- ---------- 1234567890 1234567890 123 1234567890 notice that with coalesce regardless of which input is specified first the type of the output is varchar 10 the one with the higher precedence

35882768
postgresql	mysql
postgresql for example doesn t have this problem
from mysql docs some statements cannot be rolled back

35885327
base	fractions
83.79 .to_d is representing the fractions 8379 100 exactly in internal representation because it uses a base 10 or a power of it while 83.79 .to_f is not because internal representation uses a base 2 so these are not equal
that s not the same for 83.75 because is is represented exactly in both base 2 and 10 this is 83 + 1 2 + 1 4

35886756
jar	war
the option of assembling your project as a jar wont be available until sdk version 3.0 which is still under development
however if you still want to have a taste of it you could use this method if what you seek is packaging your projects as war not a jar you should then run mvn package on your project then use some tool like alfresco-mmt alfresco module management tool to apply that amp to an ootb war you could check this page for the list of options available in the alfresco mmt

35889107
hash-collision	key
since bucket collision are not necessarily hash-collision the binary search will first search the hash codes
only when the hash codes are identical and the key appropriately implements comparable its natural order will be used

35889427
spaces	linefeed
so first usage is transliterate - change p to d and t to g echo pot | tr pt dg dog second usage is squeeze repeated characters via -s option echo moooooo | tr -s o mo final usage is delete characters via -d echo minced | tr -d nd mice so coming to your question you want to squeeze spaces and replace with linefeed
why not just replace multiple spaces with newlines

35890490
knitr	latex
i don t see a straightforward solution to postpone evaluation of sexpr after evaluation of code chunks but it is still easy to use sexp with values defined later in for example an abstract use a separate file myabstract.rnw for the abstract add where the abstract is supposed to be included and knit myabstract.rnw at the very end of the main document document.rnw myabstract.rnw key to understanding how this works is to realize that knitr processes the document before latex does
therefore it doesn t matter that the latex command includes myabstract.tex before not referring to time but referring to the line number knit myabstract.rnw generates myabstract.tex

35891045
uiview	subviews
one way of doing that is by creating a iboutlet of the uibutton and adding that button instance as a subviews newview above an existing uiview
code also if you are not able to figure out the order of the uiview then you can check that in xcode when running the project in debug mode under debug window there is a button highlighted in below image debug view hierarchy you need to click that

35892248
jar	war
in fact it is not needed to change to jar output
the generated war is already executable

35892871
snappy	lz4
i m not sure if there s any spark integration able to handle lz4 compressed kafka payloads so i think you could try using gzip or snappy compression on the producer side if that s possible
compression type 3 stands for lz4 compression which is obviously not supported by the client you use

35894477
uiview	subviews
instead of that add new uiview with same frame and constraints as your imageview object then add your effects as a subviews of a uiview object
you add your blureffectview as a subviews of myimageview but you can not change alpha or give animation to uiblureffect nor uivisualeffectview

35897790
decimal	ieee
you should not use float as float is an approximate representation of a decimal value. see msdn documentation why we should not use float here the float and real data types are known as approximate data types
the behavior of float and real follows the ieee 754 specification on approximate numeric data types. approximate numeric data types do not store the exact values specified for many numbers

35897932
clang	llvm
you can use clang or this online demo to check what that type is
llvm ir does not define any special string or char types

35898995
namedtuple	dictionary
② using namedtuple s if you do not want to change your yaml then you can make the config class a child of namedtuple and when you load the yaml data you can create the namedtuple out of a dictionary
to do so in the following snippet i m creating a recursive function nested within the load class method that walks through all dictionary s and nested dictionary s and convert them into namedtuple s

35899372
swift	objective-c
i can see from your crash logs that you have swift components in your app at least the appdelegate
swift components unlike objective-c components aren t compatible with the objective-c forward messaging system out of the box

35899372
swift	objective-c
swift components unlike objective-c components aren t compatible with the objective-c forward messaging system out of the box
my gut feeling is that you have a swift object in your code that conforms to a protocol is added as a target notification observer or is somehow expecting one of its functions to be called by forward messaging

35902006
serializable	deserialization
in the method registry with copyreg a serializable would need to register the method that enables the serializable to create a new object of the required type and imbue it with the saved state
for a serializable to not be required to be installed on load the serializable would need to include all of the required deserialization methods within the pickled object itself this is possible because a pickle is recursive

35907599
vsts	tfs
and the alternative way to achieve this feature would be create an application service to track the build event and send out email notification base on the build status you want via vsts rest api or tfs api
there isn t any way to do this with the alerts feature in vsts for now

35914372
swift	objective-c
for further information see this is not working anymore in current swift but can be easily adapted
i managed to solve the problem myself by pursuing the objc-runtime idea and creating an object factory in objective-c that calls the initializer s implementation by its pointer to ignore the unavailable mark

35922934
g++	gcc
i am not pointing to a g++ inside the ndk itself that may or may not work i dunno import option
using gcc arm_linux_android_4.9 scratch android-stc bin aarch64-linux-android-g++

35923228
multiplying	subtract
it will be number in range from 0 to 1 but we are interested in range from 0 to 150 hence multiplying
and all of that is subtract from 150 because we want to count from 150 to 0 not the opposite

35923294
super	self
example code class basehandler webapp2.requesthandler webapp2 base handler def dispatch self # useraccess aborts if the user does not have permission to use a handler useraccess self.request super basehandler self .dispatch ..
class examplehandler basehandler def get self ..... i use a config file with the allowed roles for a handler

35927098
implements	extends
actually the base class does not have to be an extension of view a contextmixin extension is sufficient the base class should look like this the views then can be implements as follows this way you avoid redundant code and at the same time you can keep the structure simple
a possible solution using class based views is to create a base view class that will collect the common context data and then extends it as necessary for the specific data and template

35928400
client-side	server-side
you ve got two choices - do the filtering client-side or rearrange your queries to make the most efficient use if you re after c select
include is used to eagerly load relationships but unfortunately entity framework does not support filtering these collections server-side with either lazy or eager loading

35928853
ssl	https
https ssl is not a current feature of wakanda cloud
however https ssl is a feature of wakanda server when you host it yourself

35928894
trie	tree
in huffman encoding bits represent left or right in a trie data-structure to be able to continue you have to use some codes for this continues another level which is why not all 8 values can be encoded in 3 bits
if you have more values to encode you need to use more bits for some values - this is the whole point of huffman coding that some combinations are short others are longer and sometimes even longer than the original but because it s based on what is the most common it s fine because they will be rare... how to construct and decode a huffman tree is about four-five pages in your typical algorithms book and if you haven t got one of those you probably want to find one - either a real paper one or an e-book

35929297
client-side	server-side
to change the language on my application i just need a control that changes the cookie value client-side and then do a simple postback to the server
it doesn t matter if such control is on the content page or in the master page it doesn t even need any code on the server-side because all the processing is done on the method above and the cookie gets set on the client-side even before the page is posted

35931876
bash	zsh
thus with no control over the execution environment you cannot write shell scripts that are fully immune to tampering unless you know that your code will be executed by dash ksh or bash with the workaround in place
if you re willing to assume that unset has not been tampered with the most robust approach is to use unset -f to ensure that unalias and command are unmodified not shadowed by a shell function unset -f unalias command functions unlike aliases must be undefined explicitly by name but not all shells provide a mechanism to enumerate all defined functions unfortunately typeset -f works in bash ksh and zsh but dash appears to have no mechanism at all so that undefining all functions is not always possible

35937001
punctuation	words
you could fix that by replacing punctuation by spaces but in the end you don t need that replacement as you can change the split pattern to punctuation or space but you are then filtering the split results by accepting strings solely consisting of words characters only
since you have already removed all punctuation and spacing characters this will sort out strings having characters that are neither words space or punctuation characters and i m not sure if this is the intended logic

35938782
realloc	malloc
so how can realloc start allocating a memory from base address 0 from realloc manual in case that ptr is a null pointer the function behaves like malloc assigning a new block of size bytes and returning a pointer to its beginning
so in case the previous pointer is null it doesn t mean that realloc has to start allocating from base address 0

35939420
viewdidload	viewdidappear
calling it in viewdidload won t work since the view itself is not in the window hierarchy yet hence can t present another view controller
you need to call showreviewprompt function in viewdidappear

35948096
udp	tcp
1 how can it confirm that the packets actually reached ... intact and uncorrupted udp is an unfairly despised protocol but come on this is going way too far here
- udp have checksum just like tcp 2 how can it confirm that the packets actually reached ... within a time frame it does not because this is not what udp is about nor tcp by the way. as can be seen from its source code here ...what it does though is check for out of order packets

35948378
inline	inlining
so the problem is that ghc-7.8 inline even while ghc-7.10 doesn t
this happens due to added rules for int and integer which don t allow inlining

35949352
client-side	server-side
createdataset is usually a local operation for initializing a client-side dataset into an empty state
if tclientdataset is anything to go by afaik it cannot be used create a server-side table

35950975
multiplying	multiplication
however actually proving this can happen for the example you ve given is slightly beyond me you can kind of see it by calling inspect_asm on the function generated and noticing there s a lot of add multiplying instructions but not obvious function call
if you look at the code generated by cython the key line i think is pynumber_multiply is the standard c-api function to call the multiplication operator so there s no reason to believe that it doesn t just act the same way as a normal multiplication call

35953535
multiplying	multiplication
unlike normal math multiplication matrix multiplication will change the result depending on what order you multiplying
in normal math multiplication but this does not hold true for matrices note the not equals this becomes more problematic when you need to apply several different transformations

35956203
implements	extends
for this to work it would need to accept comma-separated integers and then have some kind of parser implements in the app to filter your results by multiple conditions
i cannot give you the complete answer but i can tell you that you have few options if you have the skill you can try and extends the mentioned app and implement the parser and url patterns yourself

35957604
comparator	comparable
also you should define your class as extending instead of a raw comparable so you don t have to mess around with casting and runtime type checking edit the improvements in jdk 8 s comparator interface allow for a much more elegant implementation with the same behavior
from a mathematical standpoint complex numbers can t be ordered and as such aren t a good fit for the the comparable interface

35958801
required	placeholder
if you want to have a whole custom message not only a custom attribute name for when the usrroleid is required then you can add an entry for that user the custom key in the same file
so adding this will use that custom message but without an attribute placeholder

35959183
explode	substr
i your the string contains a at the end so when you explode that the last also gets counted and the last fragment contains nothing because there is nothing after the last so just remove the
or if you cannot remove that last then just substr the string hope it helps you

35964303
swift	objective-c
looking at those instructions i think the step where it says to add that line to your application delegate is in error assuming your app delegate file is written in swift
besides that line is in objective-c syntax not swift. because you already included that line in the bridging header you don t have to add anything to any of your swift files to use the aws sdk -- it s included for you automatically

35964803
spaces	delimiter
terminals strings needs to be enclosed between quotation marks non-terminal symbols on the rhs are to be separated by spaces
each non-terminal results lhs can be made up of one or more rhs combinations and each combination is delimiter by the pip symbol | it is cfg s convention to use capitalized letters for non-terminals but it s not necessary

35967097
floating-point	fractions
why it only happen with float because it s meaningful for floating-point number but not for an integer number
according to the ieee754 floating-point representation the positive infinity is the value with all bits of the exponent set and all bits of the fractions cleared 0x7f800000 which is greater than the largest finite value of float 0x7f7fffff

35969075
jar	war
spring boot docs also says do not use the src main webapp directory if your application will be packaged as a jar
although this directory is a common standard it will only work with war packaging and it will be silently ignored by most build tools if you generate a jar

35974210
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
run the code from viewdidappear not from viewwillappear
the problem with viewwillappear is that it is called before the view is actually visible so you cannot present another view from it yet

ocaml	scheme
approaches that are used in scheme will not work as is in ocaml

google-chrome	firefox
this one is trickier because browsers are inconsistent in this behavior but here s an example for google-chrome
working example for google-chrome not firefox others untested this works in google-chrome because throw test will pass uncaught test as the first argument to onerror which is almost valid javascript

hive	hdfs
cassandra is not adequate for ad-hoc queries so i would recommend that you use hive on cassandra mapping your cassandra tables to hive tables usig the connector cassandra_handler_for_hive and then use hive to do joins and conditions on non partition keys i should mention that the performance of queries using hive with cassandra is not reasonable i have had a case where count on a table with 500m records took 1 hour on 4 nodes
as a work around i used to copy the tables in hdfs after that do the computation using data on hdfs but this is not good solution if you are seeking the fresh data

multiplying	subtraction
also fwiw i suspect that your solution of next after b will not always do what you think -- most of the time what is going to happen is the adaptor is going to compute b - a as a floating point number then take a sample from the entropy source convert it to a floating point number in the range 0-1 with a static cast then multiplying by the factor b-a add a and return the result
an epsilon change in b is likely to get lost in the floating point subtraction if a and b are not of exactly the same scale and then the change would have no effect
