clang	llvm
here is the best listing i ve found that correlates apple s clang versions with the llvm versions previous versions used to say what llvm version they corresponded to but starting with 7.0 apple decided to no longer do that
they even define the __clang_version__ and related preprocessor macros to indicate the apple version number not the llvm version

36000744
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
subclasses of runtimeexception unlike those of exception do not need to be explicitly caught although they can be
from the runtimeexception javadoc page runtimeexception and its subclasses are unchecked-exception

36004048
lxml	libxml2
with a recent build of libxml2 driving your lxml installation the output of the sample code you posted will instead produce what you expected consistently preserved whitespace
the most likely catalyst for this curious behavior is that like me you re on windows and using a python version that lxml doesn t publish a binary package for

36004048
lxml	libxml2
the most likely catalyst for this curious behavior is that like me you re on windows and using a python version that lxml doesn t publish a binary package for
in such a scenario one portion of the lxml website points you to the official unofficial windows binaries for libxml2 so that you potentially via the pip install script can build a new lxml binary that supports your python version

36004048
lxml	libxml2
you re not using lxml wrong and it s not that lxml doesn t support preserving whitespace in this scenario as so many other so entries might have you think
it s just that you were unwittingly using a version of libxml2 that has a bug that s since been fixed

36009440
spaces	delimiter
tr then sort by four columns numerically note the n s sort -t -k3 3n -k4 4n -k1 1n -k2 2n finally convert the commas not followed by spaces back to colons or as a single pipeline
first convert the colons to commas to have one delimiter you can specify to sort

36009490
intersect	contains
you can do that using a pip module pip install datetimerange which can be used you can check whether one range intersect the other but it does not show whether the range is fully within the other
to check whether a time range contains another you still have to check boundaries though i believe this is a good opportunity for a patch to implement the __contains__ method in a fashion that supports for datetimerange as lhs argument of the in operator

36011192
junit	testng
now it should be fixed since that explains why with some releases you can see junit as direct dependency of testng. but it is not the expected behavior and you can exclude it from the classpath without problem if you don t need it to run some junit tests
disclaimer i m a testng contributor

36015571
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome is not commonly used by screenreaders and is lacking in some key accessibility areas
nvda is most commonly used with firefox as it s the one of the best browser-screenreader pairings

36018543
ssl	https
this is not well documented by ssl manual ssl_get_error however this error message comes from libcurl built which is used by the securetransport darwinssl tls backend you can find its osstatus in securetransport.h header file from my experience this usually happens when you re behind the proxy or connected to a limited network which uses authentication mechanism
so please verify that you re connected to the right network via wifi and your other https works correctly

36020024
bower	npm
due to this fact the watson-developer-cloud npm module was not written with bower in mind and loads some files from disk programmatically
bower cannot handle this - it has to know which files to load from disk ahead of time time

36020093
wildfly	undertow
you re right that 1000 rps feels awfully low for wildfly given that the undertow server powering it is one of the fastest in java land and among the 10 fastest period
starting points to optimize make sure that you do not have request logging on that could cause an i o bottleneck use the latest stable jvm and it s probably worth using the most recent wildfly version that your app works with

36023362
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
in at least xe2 and later you can use this version is case-sensitive so if the first argument was somename it would take the not present in array path
use indextext for case-insensitive comparison

36033713
ssl	https
if you try to do https on port 50915 the initial ssl handshake message clienthello is treated by tomcat as a plaintext http request and of course it is a totally invalid http request hence error parsing http request header
if you try to do http on 50921 the java ssl code tries to process the http request as a clienthello which doesn t work at all so it throws an exception and actually says possible plaintext in the exception message

36034037
ansible	puppet
terraform doesn t replace configuration management tools like ansible chef and puppet
this can be solved using a setup where say a ansible run is triggered to reconfigure the slaves when the master is reprovisioned

36039683
ssl	https
the hostname must be the same it is the port must be the same it isn t you have 80 and 443 which are the defaults for http and https the scheme must be the same http and https are not the same you should mitigate this by using ssl everywhere
don t use plain http for some things and https for others

36040990
required	placeholder
placeholder value is not blank i would like this to meet the required condition placeholder text is just displayed when you value is blank
your required condition will be met if your value is blank

36041798
implements	extends
here i m just defining one for handling 404 not found case to replace the default spring boot s error handling mechanism completely we can implements errorcontroller
instead of just implementing the errorcontroller here i m extends abstracterrorcontroller which implements the errorcontroller and provides some auxiliary methods like getstatus

36045329
build.gradle	gradlew
firstly the project s root-level build.gradle file secondly the build.gradle file of the android module thirdly and finally the build.gradle file of the sharedcode java module that s it
update as of version 4.6.0 of the com.jfrog.artifactory gradlew plugin publishing artifacts in a multi-module project just does not work

36045418
multiplying	multiplication
z7 you can multiplying those at simd speed and have 8 multiplication at a time using float8 type and continue as many times as you need not just 8
at each multiplication you have responsibility to check for errors and overflows

36045418
multiplying	multiplication
if it is a gpu simply multiplying items and instruction level parallelism + hyperthread engine of gpu achieves efficiency
if it is cpu you should first check if your cpu supports vertical multiplication instructions i doubt such thing exists if not then you need to multiplying on array elements not vector elements

36045999
decimal	ieee
if you want exact numbers you d use the decimal formats that have fixed precision for decimal values and are intended for financial calculations
ieee 754 floating point is often slightly imprecise and casting will truncate not round

36050841
decoder	encoder
if it is supported try to confirm your encode command with filesink fakesink and decoder comand with videotestsrc
according to its manual x264enc support i420 yv12 y42b y444 nv12 i420_10le i422_10le y444_10le if the format is not supported try another camera or another encoder

36052391
equals	compareto
the double is compatible with ieee 754 arithmetic in which a nan is not equals to anything not even itself but 0.0 and -0.0 are equals
double is designed to have an equals method is compatible with its compareto reflecting a total order and with its hashcode so hash tables will work with double keys

36054455
erlang	elixir
if i m not mistaken erlang doesn t know how to handle utf8 in char lists as well so it might be implemented this way for historical reasons
however elixir is nice enough to convert utf8 characters in a char list literal to the appropriate code points so you can later convert it to a binary and get the proper utf8 characters iex internally uses the inspect protocol to print return values

36057971
knitr	latex
as the existing answers are outdated here a more up-to-date solution resizing local images as of knitr 1.12 there is the function include_graphics
include_graphics emphasis mine the major advantage of using this function is that it is portable in the sense that it works for all document formats that knitr supports so you do not need to think if you have to use for example latex or markdown syntax to embed an external image

36061774
serializable	deserialization
looks like yaml serializable doesn t like it
i used deserialization with specified type as you mentioned and this is what i get swagger 2.0 info title uberapi description moveyourappforwardwiththeuberapi version 1.0.0 host api.uber.com schemes - https basepath v1 produces - application json this is my whole code update two issues here

36068693
super	extends
it may be used as the value of an extends clause of a class definition. subclassing constructors that intend to inherited the specified dataview behaviour must include a super call to the dataview constructor to create and initialize subclassing instances with the internal state necessary to support the dataview.prototype built-in methods
not all constructors allow you to call them es6 classes however dataview can be subclassing using the extends syntax the dataview constructor is designed to be subclassable

36071859
queue	fifo
read the queue interface documentation queue typically but do not necessarily order elements in a fifo fifo manner
among the exceptions are priority queue which order elements according to a supplied comparator or the elements natural ordering and lifo queue or stacks which order the elements lifo last-in-first-out

36074957
linefeed	delimiter
on the server side you are using tidiohandler.readln which is expecting the client to send a line of text delimiter by a linefeed character or a crlf string
but your client script is not sending that delimiter at all so readln does not exit and the server consequently does not call tidiohandler.writeln to send a response

36080390
shadowing	named
this is called shadowing
according to jls 6.4.1 some declarations may be shadowed in part of their scope by another declaration of the same named in which case a simple named cannot be used to refer to the declared entity

36080390
shadowing	named
shadowing makes you can use the same named without creating a new named which is kind of bothering because naming a variable is not quiet simple
and in the loop sample which is not supported in java but is a great sample to show the advantage of shadowing sometimes in code block you may declared some temporary variables without modifying other variables outside the block

36080763
lisp	scheme
you can see that the syntax of lisp does not really make this clear
scheme indentation can seem a little funky at first but once you get used to it it makes the code a lot easier to see without having to juggle parentheses in your head

36081666
profiling	debugging
when php storm intellij idea doesn t like my behat version i have to use something like this create run profiling point to behat file set required behat parameters configuration file feature folder tags specify custom directory relatively to which all these paths are note i specify wip tag to run tests that are tagged as wip i m currently working on
if you want to debugging the actual behat code this method always worked for me

36083577
super	extends
you cannot multiinherit classes in scala as for the question - why traits as i see it this is because traits are stackable in order to solve the famous diamond problem even though trait a super is base for t1 it calls b implementation rather then base
this is due to trait linearization so for classes if you extends something - you can be sure that this base will be called next

36087738
comparator	comparable
if your element class does not implement comparable and you can t make change it to implement it you can use an external form of comparable called comparator which is an interface like this which you don t add to the class that you re wanting to compare - you implement this interface as a separate class so that compare returns a negative number zero or positive number if you consider and respectively
then you d use where comparator is an instance of a class implementing

36089417
uicontrol	uigesturerecognizer
one way to solve this problem is convert the root view which is the superview of the two textfields and the tableview to a uicontrol . then add a touchdown or a touchupinside event handler to the control which will dismiss the keyboard
i much prefer using uicontrol over uigesturerecognizer to solve such problems because it handles events elegantly and obeys hierarchy so for instance if a uitableview is its subview the uicontrol will not interfere with scroll and touch events on the uitableview

36090911
innodb	myisam
max key length is 767 bytes as you can see the message is different because it is an innodb message not a myisam one
the other type of error 1071 for innodb tables is error code 1071

36091111
swift	objective-c
parsing json can get pretty complicated in swift
one of the ways to parse this in swift would be like this - i see that you have answered your question where you first convert it to nsdictionary but that is kind of not needed because you are converting the swift type ot objective-c type just so that you can use it in the objective-c way

36093619
dictionary	map
you are presumably using python 3 where dict.values returns a dictionary view object instead of a list and does not provide the index function
however it appears that you are looking to map every code separately back to the original character

36094621
implements	extends
however the ability is not built into the code and will need to be implements by extends some of the classes already provided
in the following example this is implements using the threadingtcpserver and streamrequesthandler classes

36096185
thin	webrick
they will look for thin but if it is not available they will both fall back to using webrick
the solution is to install thin on your ubuntu server with gem install thin

36098455
google-chrome	firefox
it works in google-chrome 49 google-chrome 50 and safari 9 and it doesn t rely on display flex
it doesn t work in firefox edge and ie11

36099875
google-chrome	firefox
at the current time it is not possible in google-chrome because it cannot create a mediastreamaudiosourcenode from webrtc streams i hope this limitation will go away soon
thus the moderator s browser must be firefox

36099986
perforce	svn
in perforce the right way to work with files is to marked them that you re going to work with them p4 edit ....in theory another guys will be available to view it in practice it is not comfortable perforce client workspace prepare in your local system need more time then svn due to extra configuration that should be done
from my practice perforce designed to store also huge blob files like software distributions svn store all its data as text

36102352
jar	war
the first think that you have do is insert the dependency in pour pom like below with this dependency you say at spring boot that the embedded tomcat dependency are provided and this have the effect that your spring app don t have the tomcat dependency inside the jar
the second think that you have do is change the pakaging proeprties in your pon from jar to war like below the third and last think that you heve do is refactor the standard application boot startrer like below for your configuration in application properties may be fine but i suggest you to put the your jsp under a specific folder and then refactor the your config for point to the new path and not just under web-inf but this is just an advice

36106095
trie	tree
analysis of the problem if you print out the trie you will see that you build a tree expanding the branch corresponding too the letter
you have done this because you insert one letter at a time but this is not the normal layout of a trie similarly when you search for an element if it s the root element everything is ok

36106376
oncreate	setcontentview
activities are run in order of the android lifecycle so oncreate is not called first
it is just the first opportunity you have to call setcontentview to inflate your layout

36106713
xrange	enumerate
from itertools import izip for index item in izip xrange limit items print item if not requiring the index itertools.islice you can use itertools.islice for item in itertools.islice items 0 stop print item which doesn t require assigning to the index
composing enumerate islice items stop to get the index as pablo ruiz ruiz points out we can also compose islice with enumerate

36107274
realloc	malloc
you will completely lose data in your matrix so this is not really realloc ing anything
you could just as well free and malloc the top-level array getting possibly better performance

36108532
dictionary	map
is a dictionary literal so that continues to have the behaviour of producing a dictionary
python doesn t need to look up what dict means - it skips this step and directly generates byte code to construct a dictionary in the byte code it continues to use build_map as before it builds a map dictionary based on the code you ve written

36108532
dictionary	map
python doesn t need to look up what dictionary means - it skips this step and directly generates byte code to construct a dictionary in the byte code it continues to use build_map as before it builds a map dictionary based on the code you ve written
the meaning of dictionary has changed as you mentioned

36108936
octal	decimal
octal do not pad a numeric literal with a leading zero
that tells java to interpret the literal as an octal base-8 rather than as a decimal base-10

36109538
swift	objective-c
the reason for this annoying strategy is that swift itself is still changing and evolving swift 2.2 will go final any day now revolutionizing the language once again
thus swift cannot be part of the system like objective-c

36110385
opentype	woff
ie actually pioneered webfonts and svg fonts as technology not to be confused with opentype fonts with svg outlines were abandoned in early 2015 because the limitations were insane once real webfonts started to become available
as of 2016 you just need woff

36110385
opentype	woff
april 2017 edit windows vista sp2 went out of support this month and as such ie9 is now officially no longer supported as for ttf otf you don t want to use these online any more than you would want to use tiff images rather than jpg or png even though woff is just a thin wrapper around a ttf otf data woff woff2 allow the data to be compressed whereas plain opentype does not
furthermore ttf otf are universal for systems that support opentype fonts and so are scrutinized more for correctness especially by versions of ie

36110385
opentype	woff
furthermore ttf otf are universal for systems that support opentype fonts and so are scrutinized more for correctness especially by versions of ie
using woff which as a filetype makes it explicit this is a w eb o pen f ont f ormat a less strict form of scrutiny means that some fonts that would fail a system opentype verification pass may still work just fine as webfonts due to the fact that not all required-for-universality opentype data is necessary for a font to work in just a web context

36110385
opentype	woff
using woff which as a filetype makes it explicit this is a w eb o pen f ont f ormat a less strict form of scrutiny means that some fonts that would fail a system opentype verification pass may still work just fine as webfonts due to the fact that not all required-for-universality opentype data is necessary for a font to work in just a web context
finally you get a choice in woff formats format 1 just called woff is the older format and uses compression based on deflate similar to png compression

36110609
innodb	myisam
mysql s preferred engine is innodb
what i have discussed assumes that not myisam

36110653
uilabel	uitextview
what you are likely going to want to use is uitextview instead of uilabel so it can be clickable
uilabel can style it like a url but doesn t support opening the url

36116194
udp	tcp
i think people usually use recvfrom for udp
because in tcp once the connection gets established the address information does not change and hence recvfrom always returns none for connection-information field

36119660
oncreate	onstart
why not oncreate
and in the onstart method check if that boolean is true if it is do not go on with the process that causes bugs otherwise go on

36120640
mongodb	bson
as for mongodb documentation then technically it is not documented there because the actual retention of order is therefore a bson spec where the order of keys is guaranteed
and bson is not actually restricted to mongodb

36120640
mongodb	bson
and bson is not actually restricted to mongodb
as for the actual question let s look at the code from the from the inner functions of the bson serializer used and so on in the listing which is basically iterating each entry in the map and then subjects each member to the same test conditions and branching not exactly the most dry code as would be done on general top level inspection

36121217
bash	subshell
bash has a built-in variable to determine where words are split ifs is set to so word splitting takes place at commas
instead of piping to the while loop i use redirection which has the advantage of not spawning a subshell

36121889
sse	avx
sse set of instructions though very useful are not the latest vector extensions
the avx advanced vector extensions enhances sse by providing 3-operands and 4 operands instructions

36122307
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian
i didn t find much about this on the web though i don t understand why not -- surely many many people use emacs on ubuntu
and maybe the problem isn t even restricted to ubuntu but occurs in any debian linux

36122511
cdr	cons
your poly-eval doesn t actually combine make-term coef power with the recursive call to poly-eval cdr poly factor so it gets lost
you should cons the here -result to the there -result

36124360
implements	extends
to do that you will need event filters on 2. this is how the fire method of the togglebutton is implements as you can see it toggles the setselected state if the node togglebutton is not disabled
you could extends the togglebutton and override this fire method to stop this from happening

36125198
factors	mean
workaround for the memory issues a possible workaround would be to inherit your listelement as expandedlistelement so that the numbers in its containers aren t interpreted as factors but as number of repetitions
so the expandedlistelement 1000|a would mean that your list has one thousand listelements that look like this 1|a

36125710
multiplying	multiplication
in this specific case of multiplying a list or any sequence by an integer it is slightly more efficient to do than
both give the same result but calls list.__mul__ first the latter calls int.__mul__ first which given a list returns notimplemented then python proceeds to calling and of course multiplication is not generally commutative

36127536
punctuation	words
you need to first get the words that are dupes and then build a regexp to match them all with optional whitespace or punctuation etc
- adjust the pattern later and replace with an empty string the first pattern is b w+ b - match and capture into group 1 a whole words consisting of characters - make sure this value captured into group 1 is repeated somewhere to the right of the current location not necessarily right after the words

36127627
implements	extends
you have written the onclicklister method however you have not implements the interface
try changing this public class mainactivity extends appcompatactivity to this public class mainactivity extends appcompatactivity implements view.onclicklistener and implement onclick view v method in the class in place of your onclicklistener regarding the t1 issue

36133314
comparator	comparable
for that you have 2 options the objects can implement comparable or you can provide a comparator to the priorityqueue itself via its constructor
the reason why you get an error is because the comparator you provided is null so the priorityqueue relies on the objects being comparable - and i guess your gokhemon class is not

36133565
operands	scalar
the standardese is in intro.execution except where noted evaluations of operands of individual operators and of subexpressions of individual expressions are unsequenced
... if a side effect on a scalar object is unsequenced relative to either another side effect on the same scalar object or a value computation using the value of the same scalar object and they are not potentially concurrent 1.10 the behavior is undefined

36134396
base	fractions
this is because converting the decimals between base isn t exact in general it s similar effect effect you get with 1 3 having infinite decimal expansion 0.33...
example outputs for me 3.14159200000000016217427400988526642322540283203125 so when you start multiplying this by 10 in your question code you can see how it doesn t become an exact integer in a long time and by then it is far beyond range of int so your condition is never true either there is fractions part or the double is too large to fit in integer

36140069
opencms	magnolia
i guess you are not speaking of using mysql for the persistence of the meta data but really to store the binary content a mistake that by the way opencms another java-based open source webcms made in their architecture design - imho
note that usually large files are not stored in the database itself with magnolia but on the file system

36141272
punctuation	words
to adapt this to more real-world situations you probably need to use string#scan to pull out more specific words instead of getting tripped up on things like punctuation or hyphens
if you want all of the words uniquely sorted this is not the most optimal implementation but it should work

36144781
google-api-python-client	oauth2client
for example google-api-python-client 1.4.2 try installing the latest google-api-python-client while maintaining the existing oauth2client installation
this can be achieved by installing google-api-python-client without dependencies then manually installing any missing dependencies that are not already installed in datalab

36146810
bower	npm	gruntjs	package.json
using the bower module directly - instead of gruntjs which i am re-growing to loathe - may have resulted in a more refined solution
browserify-shim is not transitive across node modules it can be used to correctly shim top-level in your own package.json modules but it cannot shim modules in other npm packages with their own package.json files

36151768
move	drag
the graph display is encapsulated in a div then add the event handlers for jointjs first the pointerdown event where we store the start position of the drag then the end of the drag pointerup when we delete the variable we store the position in it also acts as a flag whether there is an active drag in progress as jointjs does not expose a paper pointer move event we need to use the mousemove document event
for example with jquery we get the drag start coordinates and the current pointer position and update the paper position using the paper.translate call

36158657
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
another issue you have is that you are using autoresetevent which means that if you paused and then resumed only one of the workers will awake which is not what you want
you want all workers to awake so you need to use manualresetevent instead

36160046
inline	inlining
the inline specifier instructs compiler to inline the function if it can but doesn t impose the inlining
if you require that the compiler inlines the function use forceinline or __forceinline to force the inlining

36160046
inline	inlining
if you require that the compiler inline the function use forceinline or __forceinline to force the inlining
anyway when inlining functions consider that this is not always the best solution

36161304
swift	objective-c
the #selector expression requires a swift function method reference
when swift compiles your source it doesn t know that the objective-c and methods will exist so it can t generate function references for them

36162606
bash	subshell
a standard shell expects f bash understands both but if you don t have a shebang line or you execute the scriptfile using the sh command you will end up using the system s default shell which might not be bash
the shell does not create a subshell to run a function

36164503
scrollable	panels
this class implements the scrollable interface and allows your to override the scrollable methods by using parameters
so the basic code would be the first jtextpane with fixed width 70 of parent panels and the second jtextpane with fixed width 30 one way to do this might be to use a jsplitpane so you have a divider between the two text panels and the text doesn t merge into one

36166507
g++	gcc
for example here are settings that are relatively close to g++ -wall which is convenient if you want to develop with one and have a good chance of a clean build with the other icpc -wall -warray-bounds -wchar-subscripts -wcomment -wenum-compare -wformat -wuninitialized -wmaybe-uninitialized -wmain -wnarrowing -wnonnull -wparentheses -wpointer-sign -wreorder -wreturn-type -wsign-compare -wsequence-point -wtrigraphs -wunused-function -wunused-but-set-variable -wunused-variable -wwrite-strings this isn t an exact match for gcc -wall
there are differences between gcc s and icc s implementation of the above warnings

36167869
prepare	execute
not at the individual prepare statement
that function returns the first automatically generated value successfully inserted for an auto_increment column as a result of the most recently execute insert statement

36168201
onresume	onpause
if you call onresume in onpause it would just execute that method
calling onresume does not mean your app will resume

36169706
3des	aes
do not use 3des it has been superseded by aes is is not sufficiently secure for new work
3des is a 168-bit key 24-bytes sometimes for compatibility a 112-bit key 16-bytes is used

36171455
serializable	deserialization
generic type information is not serializable as it s removed in the run time by type erasure
you can t get exact generic object after deserialization

36175914
coalesce	isnull
for a standard oracle 12c installation try using nvl or coalesce instead
isnull is not yet a standard oracle function at least in the oracle 12c version that you say you are using

36177198
g++	gcc
looks like you link with gcc instead of g++
the difference is that g++ also links in libstdc++ whereas gcc does not

36177471
swift	objective-c
dynamic dispatching using #selector or selector doesn t see your swift protocol extension
instead try avoiding objective-c altogether if possible

36183651
dictionary	map
each call is o n so a single conversion to dictionary can be more efficient if you have wide rows and multiple calls
in general you should avoid calls like this using udf is as inefficient but much cleaner in general using built-in sql expressions should be preferred over map you shouldn t map directly over dataframe

36185708
single-quotes	double-quotes
use single-quotes instead
you are using double-quotes when converting the original password string since allow for string interpolation the parser tries to expand which since it probably doesn t exist results in an empty string thus you end up with the string you see in your output

36186033
vsto	add-in
also microsoft office applications can disable vsto add-in that behave unexpectedly
if an application does not load your vsto add-in when you try to debug it the application might have hard disabled or soft disabled your vsto add-in

vsto	add-in
if an application does not load your vsto add-in when you try to debug it the application might have hard disabled or soft disabled your vsto add-in
see how to re-enable a vsto add-in that has been disabled for more information

pandas	dask
though it does not support all of pandas functionality you can get really far with it
there is now two years after the question an out-of-core pandas equivalent dask

36190835
onclicklistener	onitemclicklistener
might be one of two things. you have implemented onclicklistener but you have not set the listview to listen to that specific class nor have you called any method in your oncreate that will set the listview s listener to that class
secondly i think you might need to implement onitemclicklistener and not onclicklistener since thats what is on the listview an item

retrofit	okhttp
though retrofit 2.0 is promised to be faster but has been changed a lot.sticking with 1.9 will not have any complications
use retrofit version 1.9 and okhttp version 2.3 works pretty fine with all devices

36200642
firefox	safari
the reason is firefox returns 0 for document.body.scrolltop
instead firefox wants you to use document.documentelement.scrolltop which - however - does not work safari

uiview	calayer
ref calayer details calayer with uiview
this method does not exist directly to use this you have to use calayer class itself

36202105
swift	objective-c
in most cases you should not need to modify this setting. any public objective-c headers listed in this bridging header file will be visible to swift
the objective-c functionality will be available in any swift file within that target automatically without any import statements

36204023
swift	objective-c
you can call objective-c code from swift print systemutil .uptime
write a objective-c class like the accepted answer you mentioned getting ios system uptime that doesn t pause when asleep

36206664
direct3d	direct2d
what direct3d cannot draw naively is styled lines with camphored edges etc
direct2d can draw styled lines either via emitting texture triangles or using software rasterization

36207484
setcontentview	findviewbyid
by using setcontentview you re replacing your whole layout with another one and it seems in this case like you re replacing your layout that contains r.id.drawer_layout with another one that doesn t contain it
the null pointer exception then happens when you try to use findviewbyid and closedrawer when the layout containing the drawer isn t there anymore it s been replaced with another using setcontentview

36208849
comparator	comparable
one requires the list elements to implement comparable and the other more general one requires you to provide an object implementing comparator for use in determining the desired relative order of the objects
arrays do not implement comparable which is equivalent to saying that they have no natural order but the class of the objects containing them could be made to do so

36209173
comparator	comparable
to be more general i m actually going to implement a comparator for given this new comparator and your existing type it s easy to sort you should get the output 0 0 2 3 0 1 1 2 0 1 4 5 the comparing factory method i am using takes two arguments a function to extract a key from each object in the list and a comparator that can compare the extracted keys
if the extracted key has a natural ordering and implements comparable for example it s a string then it isn t necessary to specify a comparator

36209173
comparator	comparable
if the extracted key has a natural ordering and implements comparable for example it s a string then it isn t necessary to specify a comparator
alternatively if you can modify myclass you could give it a natural order by implementing comparable and moving the comparison to its compareto method as shown in other answers

36210722
ssl	https
this configuration is fine for development but not for production in production you should unload the ssl certificate and send all traffic to http with a flag like requestheader set x-forwarded-proto https and add a valve into tomcat configuration change your apache configuration for this
what is happening here is that sslproxyengine is detecting a non valid ssl certificate so you need to explicitly tell him not to check anything

36212467
inline	inlining	inline-functions	inlining
an inline-functions should be as fast as a macro if it is indeed inline by the compiler
note that the inline keyword is not binding but just a hint to the compiler which may ignore it if inlining is not possible

36212912
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome s ui is not as elegant for presentations but is very accurate and provides better preview on android devices
safari s responsive design mode feature was working flawlessly until update in february

36213151
punctuation	words
if your question is about attaching the punctuation properly to the preceding words then no the nltk doesn t have any facilities for this
as for extracting the words out of the tagged sentence it is trivial to do with a comprehension as you have presumably done already to combine punctuation properly form a string and post-process it using a regexp

36213485
backgrounding	multitasking
in my opinion good candidates for concurrency are long running tasks involving one of wait operations mentioned above otherwise you don t see much gain.programs which need some backgrounding tasks are also good candidates for concurrency
concurrency has not to be confused with multitasking of cpu when you run different programs on same cpu at the same time

36217019
jython	pypy
jython is a python implementation to run python programs on jvm and is used to provide integration with java libraries or python scripting to java programs etc
python modules implemented as cpython extensions like pandas are not necessarily compatible with all python implementations famous implementations other than cpython are jython pypy and ironpython if you really have to use jython and pandas together and you could not find another way to solve the issue then i suggest using them in different processes

36217019
jython	pypy	cpython	pypy	cpython	ironpython
python modules implemented as cpython extensions like pandas are not necessarily compatible with all python implementations famous implementations other than cpython are jython pypy and ironpython if you really have to use jython and pandas together and you could not find another way to solve the issue then i suggest using them in different processes
a java process is your jython application running on jvm either is java code calling jython libraries or a python code that possibly requires integration with some java libraries and another cpython process runs to provide operations required from pandas

google-chrome	safari
disable authentication of ip camera if the camera does not have that option on the admin panel just add an user without a password with any username like none then we can setup like this without password my google-chrome no longer throws the user name password

36220763
xslt	schematron
this is an advantage over dtd for example which cannot be parsed as xml and allows for some very practical benefits xslt can parse an xml schema to generate documentation or transform one xml schema to another related xml schema
schematron can parse an xml schema to check for conformance to sector or other organization guidelines policy

36222272
fftw	gsl
you can have a look at this speed performance benchmark from fftw which suggests that gsl is about 3-4 times slower than fftw 3
note that this benchmark hasn t been done with g++ and there doesn t seem to be another readily available benchmark for the gcc compilers from fftw s site which includes gsl and quite likely on a machine with different than yours so your own results may vary

36222272
fftw	gsl
note that this benchmark hasn t been done with g++ and there doesn t seem to be another readily available benchmark for the gcc compilers from fftw s site which includes gsl and quite likely on a machine with different than yours so your own results may vary
on the accuracy front this accuracy benchmark from fftw suggests that they have similar accuracy for most case with fftw being slightly more accurate but that gsl tend to exhibit accuracy degradation for real data and larger transform sizes

36222389
google-chrome	safari

imperative	declarative
some goals ... compute a write a . almost every line in the above is problematic for the following reasons solve is imperative
this does not make sense in a declarative languague like prolog because you can use predicates in several directions

36223965
uilabel	uitextview
something like this with appropriately rounded off corners triangle alternatively use uitextview instead if you want to assign padding adding space padding to a uilabel
i would actually not be subclassing uilabel for this and make your own tooltip class composed of the outer view and the internal label with auto layout constraints

36224570
azure	hdinsight
azure batch doesn t support joining virtual networks so your adf dotnet activity cannot have a fixed ip range. however azure batch supports certificate management for vm nodes so if the web endpoint you are calling can be protected by a client certificate while opening traffic to all public ip addresses then you can choose to use the certificate based authentication in adf dotnet activity
on the other hand adf dotnet activity can also be run on hdinsight clusters and i believe hdinsight supports virtual network

36227428
bash	zsh
kind of like this except i guess the idea here is that the name of var is stored in another variable you can do an end-run around bash s usual job control situation by using process substitution
so instead of this normal pipeline which would work in ksh or zsh but not in bash unless you set lastpipe you would use this command which is equivalent apart from how the shell handles the job with process substitution read varname isn t run in a pipeline so bash doesn t fork to run it

bufferedreader	ioexception
here are the exceptions thrown by files#readalllines path charset it actually uses a try-with-ressources instantiating a bufferedreader with the path as parameter
if the file does not exist an ioexception is than thrown by it within the constructor

you cannot look up views until after setcontentview ... is called in oncreate ... when things are properly initialized

36229178
bash	zsh
etan reisner s helpful answer explains the problem and offers a single-line solution based on an ansi c-quoted string which is appropriate given that you originally tagged your question bash
ed morton s helpful answer shows you how to bypass your problem altogether with a different approach that is both simpler and more efficient. however it sounds like your shell is actually something different - presumably ksh88 an older version of the korn shell that is the default sh on aix 6.1 - in which such strings are not supported 1 ansi c-quoted strings were introduced in ksh93 and are also supported not only in bash but in zsh as well

ssl	https
to download the html for you have to lookup the ip for www.google.com then connect to that ip on port 443 the default https port then negotiate an ssl tls encryption session and then finally send an http get request for the document
it is not wise to implement ssl tls encryption by hand

36239310
octal	decimal
hence the value too great for base as octal digits only go from 0 to 7
the solution is to tell your script that the variables sunrisehr sunrisemin etc are decimal and not octal

36240893
swift	objective-c
you will find a lot of interesting info on that if you search for swift callback c in this forum or google
the problem is that c++ types such as superpoweredadvancedaudioplayer cannot be exposed to objective-c or swift but only to objective-c++

cdr	cons
tail cdr tail cdr lst your procedure looks more like the functional kind since it s not actually mutating anything but it would work if you kept the result you got back and fixed the fact that it s not extending the list but adding the element to the tail as a dotted list
lst list e cons car lst add-to-end cdr lst e of course adding to front is much cheaper and is done with plain old cons

google-chrome	firefox
firefox edge since at least 2017 it appears that google-chrome is either 1 reverting back to the min-width 0 min-height 0 defaults or 2 automatically applying the 0 defaults in certain situations based on a mystery algorithm
this could be what they call an intervention . as a result many people are seeing their layout especially desired scrollbars work as expected in google-chrome but not in firefox edge

36248085
swift	objective-c
at this point you should learn swift instead of objective-c because that s the direction that apple is going
you may need to read some objective-c code but once you ve got the basics of swift down it s not hard to read objective-c

36252007
realloc	calloc
to add quoting the c11 standard chapter 7.22.3.3 ... if the argument does not match a pointer earlier returned by a memory management function or if the space has been deallocated by a call to free or realloc the behavior is undefined
so the s++ modifies the original pointer which is not the same anymore which was returned by calloc and passing the same to free invokes ub

36253007
profiling	debugging
hence in such a scenario if you need to have extensions in profiling or have a profiling to change add an extension you could use the following trick have an harmless extension as default extension of your build where harmless means whatever library which could be part of your build classpath and essentially not affect it at all have properties defining the gav coordinates g roupid a rtifactid v ersion of this extension have a profiling which overrides these properties with the desired useful extension as an example given the following sample pom the default build without the customize-extension profiling activated would use the default defined properties and as such add junit as build extension this is harmless although it may create conflicts with another junit version of your build so make sure you use the same version of use an even more harmless library for that
you can check maven will pick it up by running a really first build phase just to check information in our case and enable the debugging flag mvn initialize -x and checking as part of the build log now let s use our trick let s add change a build extension via profiling mvn initialize -x -pcustomize-extension and as part of our build log we would have bingo

ssl	https
the attacker doesn t know the credentials since they were transmitted by ssl
still isn t there a better solution there is - use https everywhere cloudflare for examples makes it dead easy to put ssl in front of your customer s domains

36255712
bash	tcsh
it doesn t require bash and it ll even work in tcsh
and of course to do this in sed is easy enough too if you really want to do this in bash with an array you might construct something like this note that readarray requires bash version 4

36258566
rtp	rtcp	rtp	rtsp
implementing rtp rtsp and rtcp correctly is complex and a lot of work
should you have requirements that openrtsp doesn t meet you can use the live555 libraries to for rtsp rtp rtcp and write some minimal code to do something with the received video

36258781
listview	gridview
based on your code we can see that checkbox is the child of the listview as following so it will mean that one listviewitem will have only one checkbox in this way we can not bind a linkedlist iscompleted to the checkbox we can only bind a single value for every checkbox
besides the linkedlist or others collections can only be used for the itemscontrol such as listview listbox gridview and so on

36259626
debian	linux	ubuntu	linux
there are usually several available docker storage drivers available on most oses aufs available and default in ubuntu boot2docker and also available in debian testing - while afaik it was historically the first fs driver in docker aufs is not part of mainline linux kernel so it is not widely adopted
overlayfs - mainline linux kernel closest alternative to aufs device mapper - the slowest but the most portable docker storage driver etc.

36264400
stateless	stateful
i ran in to exactly the same problem using serviceproxy with a stateless service
i have a stateful services that works well but the stateless was receiving as allan t mentions above you also need to use the third constructor overload for serviceproxy.create instead of use ...simply do not specify the partition

36266049
glfw	lwjgl
they don t necessarily have a relationship to each other except for the fact that glfw has to load some specific opengl functions to ensure that it can set up framebuffers correctly and take input from opengl and also behave correctly when interfaced with various opengl extensions but other than that the two are essentially independent
and glfw is not for using alone you still should just use the lwjgl library to have access to the opengl functions to create graphics

36266049
glfw	lwjgl
and glfw is not for using alone you still should just use the lwjgl library to have access to the opengl functions to create graphics
and it seems there is a relation between lwjgl3 and glfw but what has it to do with each other

36266049
glfw	lwjgl
ostensibly this is what java s awt api is supposed to be but again awt and swing have performance problems glfw does not
lwjgl is a wrapper for glfw but also a wrapper for the broader opengl api including functions you d normally have to manually load in c c++ typically through what s called glew or the opengl extension wrangler

36267878
csv	tsv
if csv ssv tsv is suitable for you -- use your preferred library to produce it i can recommend apache commons-csv
but take into account that ms excel requires bom for utf-8 and utf-16 csv to understand that file isn t in one-byte encoding like cp-1252 etc

36272005
udp	tcp
the server app can open two listening sockets one for tcp and one for udp ipv4 only or multicast ipv4 or ipv6
ipv6 does not support udp broadcasts so you have to use multicast instead

36277963
build.gradle	gradlew
you can create a new project and copy the build.gradle
usually this file contains generic info like android gradlew pluging and the repos to be used in the modules the .gradle folder is not a problem

36278352
swt	swing
i suggest using swing instead of swt
swing is already included in java-libs but swt not

36278427
awt	swing
there several things missing very important - you should not update ui in other than the awt eventdispatcher threads
using swing it even may lead to deadlocks

36278454
boost	allocator
the you can use intrusive smart pointer boost intrusive_ptr which uses this machinery and thus doesn t need to allocate another separate counter
this is faster in terms of allocator but requires to inject the counter to the controlled class definition

36288769
gdi	direct2d
the vast majority of these are not compatible with uwp because uwp does not support classic win32 windowing wm_ messages or gdi gdi+
for uwp apps you can use xaml with c++ or c# code-behind directx direct2d and or direct3d with c++ or c# via 3rd party assemblies like sharpdx or html5 with javascript

36291102
textview	imageview
fixing this still won t solve your problem because you have the other two imageview textview hanging around
i m not seeing any apparent need to have multiple imageview textview so rather than setting visibility on everything the more accepted approach would be it would be better to have your colors defined in resources but i ll save that for another discussion

36291136
implements	extends
what you really want is the implements keyword so see for the list of functions you need to implements
you cannot extends an interface

36291722
build.gradle	gradlew
i also got the same problem while trying to add the following library to my project i discovered that the library had this in its build.gradle file the case was my project s targetsdkversion was 22 and the library i tried to use requires appcompat for sdk version 23
trying to fix it i discovered that gradlew doesn t let you use the appcompat-v7 23.1.1 if your targetsdkversion or compilesdkversion are not 23

36294766
implements	extends
however adding implements bar will enforce the compiler to check the baz class implements the bar interface throwing a compile time error on baz if it doesn t
extends a typescript interface via the extends keyword implement the interface the following way note the implements bar part is optional

36295821
theano	keras	theano	lasagne
i had a lot of experience with both mxnet and theano via lasagne and keras benchmarking is always biased so i will not comment on that except to note that all the frameworks are very fast
here are several things that should help you decide theano compared to mxnet is like assembly compared to python

36295821
theano	keras	theano	lasagne
here are several things that should help you decide theano compared to mxnet is like assembly compared to python
theano has low-level primitives to build machine learning models and on itself does not define any layers or optimizers and you would usually use it with some deep-learning library such as lasagne or keras while mxnet is higher level

36295821
theano	keras	theano	lasagne
theano has low-level primitives to build machine learning models and on itself does not define any layers or optimizers and you would usually use it with some deep-learning library such as lasagne or keras while mxnet is higher level
so fare comparison would be mxnet vs keras not mxnet vs theano

36295821
theano	keras
so fare comparison would be mxnet vs keras not mxnet vs theano
mxnet is a more recent library and certain things in it are not as polished yet and there s way fewer resources online than for theano

36295821
theano	keras	theano	lasagne
mxnet is a more recent library and certain things in it are not as polished yet and there s way fewer resources online than for theano
theano and therefore lasagne and keras compile models when they run them for the first time into c++ and cuda which is very slow

36300237
bower	npm
i m not certain- too much of the bower process is still kind of magic to me and needs unpacking
i installed angular using npm instead of bower when i started using bower

36300387
retrofit	okhttp
compile com.squareup.okhttp3 okhttp 3.1.2 compile com.squareup.retrofit2 retrofit 2.0.0
as said in this issue there is two possibilities okhttp has a bug where we re attempting to recover when we shouldn t be because we ve exhausted all of the available routes

36300499
ssl	https
but otherwise there is also a way by which you can ignore the error warning - this would also make your code vulnerable to mitm attacks so best this is to fix your ssl on server set your nsurlconnection delegate as self and add below code for nsurlsession check this answer nsurlsession delegate update above code will be vulnerable to mitm attacks please check this ssl pinning for nsurlsession for a secured way
the ssl certificate used by your server is invalid or your server is not https at all

36300499

the ssl certificate used by your server is invalid or your server is not https at all
please try connecting by using http instead of https ps i am not able to open this link in my browser but this could have been a placeholder so please try this

36301456
multiplying	multiplication	multiplying	division
let s try to understand it more left bit-shift and right bit-shift now when the number represented is of integer type then shifting the binary representation of a number by 1 to the left will be equivalent to multiplying it by 2 given that there is no overflow for the given data type while shifting integer number to the right will be equivalent as dividing it by 2 and then rounding it down some use and link to multiplication and division since bit-shifting operation is typically less costly than multiplication to speed things up you will see in some program people use left bit-shift operation as a replacement of multiplication when they mean to multiplying it by an integer number of power of 2 that is 2 4 8 16 etc or use right bit-shift operation as a replacement of division and rounding down to divide it with an integer number of power of 2 that is 2 4 8 16 etc concluding remarks note that only if you operate with number with power of 2 all the multiplication and divisions above can be replaced by left bit-shift or right bit-shift
in your example 66 and -10 are not integer number which of power of 2 thus you cannot hack the multiplication division with binary-shifting operation

36301456
division	multiplication
in your example 66 and -10 are not integer number which of power of 2 thus you cannot hack the multiplication division with binary-shifting operation
in general use bit-shift operation if you mean for bit-shifting as bit-shifting has many other uses than just hacking for multiplication division with integer number of power of 2

36306318
udp	mtu
however this will only apply to udp traffic so unless you are specifically having issues with that it is best to be left alone
according to the openvpn manpage there isn t a straight mtu option though

36306318
udp	tcp
however there is an mssfix announce to tcp sessions running over the tunnel that they should limit their send packets sizes such that after openvpn has encapsulated them the resulting udp packets size that openvpn sends to its peer will not exceed max bytes. the max parameter is interpreted in the same way as the --link-mtu parameter the udp packets size after encapsulation overhead has been added in but not including the udp header itself
the --mssfix option only makes sense when you are using the udp protocol for openvpn peer-to-peer communication --proto udp

36307997
prepare	execute
when you insert it into the document it s immediately prepare when a script element that is not marked as being parser-inserted experiences one of the events listed in the following list the user agent must synchronously prepare the script element the script element gets inserted into a document at the time the node is inserted according to the dom after any other script elements inserted at the same time that are earlier in the document in tree order
at step 15 of the prepare a script algorithm since the script doesn t have a src attribute and has not been flagged as parser inserted your case would be the last one otherwise the user agent must immediately execute the script block even if other scripts are already executing

36311078
clang	llvm
for example if you have the clang version that identifies itself as apple llvm version 7.0.2 clang-700.1.81 the output of strings will have this value llvm 3.7.0svn this doesn t appear to work with version apple llvm version 7.3.0 clang-703.0.29
if you use the strings command on the compiler you might get the llvm version

36312021
inline	constexpr
another advantage is that it makes it hard for the compiler to not inline the result
with a constexpr value the compiler can easily forget that it is a true constant

36315244
udp	tcp
the dds interoperability specification requires udp ip and multicast for anonymous discovery not tcp ip
tcp can be used but there is no specification yet allowing the different vendors to implement it however they want

36315698
daemons	systemd
supervisor is a daemons that supervises processes be they python programs or any other
it is something you should usually install systemd wide imo and not in a virtualenv

36316442
selecteditem	selectedindex
what you want to do is this note since this is in the selection changed event selecteditem shouldn t ever return null but it doesn t really hurt to make sure
the problem is in this line here selectedindex will return a number not the item itself

36316562
rpm	yum
you can either install the rpm with yum or find a package to fulfill the dependency probably find or findutils and install it
rpm on its own isn t capable of installing dependencies normally this would be handled by yum

swift	objective-c
it does not report swift throws
the following creates a swift throw and is not reported by ga the following does create an objective-c exception and is reported by ga some useful information here.

swift	objective-c
the following creates a swift throw and is not reported by ga the following does create an objective-c exception and is reported by ga some useful information here.
how should i use nssetuncaughtexceptionhandler in swift we can force an objective-c exception from within swift by using the following command from within a catch

36317272
udp	tcp
i suppose this is one of the reasons for the misconception that udp is slower than tcp
that is not the case udp can be as fast as the network allows

36317272
udp	tcp
that is not the case udp can be as fast as the network allows
as i said before there are protocols such as utp or quic implemented over udp which achieve performance similar to tcp

36319263
ienumerable	iqueryable
you have to use ienumerable in case of stored procedures to work
this is because a stored procedure output result set is not of the type iqueryable

36322688
mongodb	bson
the mongodb shell does not have this strict typing and as such both allows the creation and reading of the data
nor is mongodb itself strictly typed so as far as the engine is concerned it s just bson type 5 and does not look at it further

36323038
ubuntu	linux
if you want to install xcode in ubuntu that is impossible as already pointed out by deepak xcode is not available on linux at this time and i don t expected it to be in the foreseeable future
however if you want to install swift on ubuntu and play with it from the command line that is quite easy to do

afaik currently apple provides this software only for 64-bit ubuntu 14.04 or ubuntu 15.10 make sure you download the correct version
another thing to note is that swift on linux is not as usable as it is on mac os x

36324388
leaflet	openlayers
you will need to do a similar url template dynamic adjustment for leaflet
unfortunately leaflet does not expose a similar geturl option as openlayers

36325578
inline	constexpr
the problem you re running into is that class member function definitions even inline ones are not parsed until after the entire class definition has been parsed
therefore when the compiler sees at that point count has been declared but not yet defined and a constexpr function that has not been defined cannot be used in a constant expression -- so you get the error you re seeing

36326159
queue	fifo
in fact - kafka topics are not queue in the computer science manner
queue means fifo - this is not what you get in kafka in the topic level

36331056
mongodb	bson
traversing keys can only really be done in javascript evaluation from a mongodb standpoint
since javascript evaluation requires interpreter cost in launching and translating data from bson to a workable javascript format and not to mention the actual cost of evaluating the coded expressions themselves that is not an ideal approach

36331056
mongodb	bson
and the only mechanism in which mongodb can use a javascript expression to alter the output document is by using mapreduce so again this is super horrible and you would be using this aggregation method for nothing more than document manipulation in this case even after you did that to just avoid naming paths the output of mapreduce cannot be a cursor
so this limits you to either the size of a bson document in response or actually outputting to a collection instead

36332870
interpolation	splines
yo can use any interpolation polynomial
my favorite is this bullet #3 proper implementation of cubic splines interpolation so here it is hope i did not some silly index mistake while replacing pi with a 2+i 2d bi-cubic extrapolation this is just separating the problem into set of 1d cubic extrapolations

36335399
implements	extends
i am not sure just casted an eye on the code. however you can extends override the logout method of guard and don t call the refreshremembertoken method or extends override refreshremembertoken method and just return true from refreshremembertoken if you don t want to extends guard you can also create a customised user provider which will implements illuminate contracts auth userprovider
in the interface you must implements illuminate contracts auth userprovider there are two method signatures you should bypass after bypassing

36336059
aggregate-functions	sum
the problem is that mysql does really dumb things when an aggregate-functions is introduced or a group by is included but not all of the fields are in an aggregate-functions or your group by
you are asking it to group by num but none of the other columns in your select are included in the group by nor are they being aggregated with a function sum max min avg etc.. in any other rdbms this query wouldn t run and would throw an error but mysql just carries on

36338215
required	placeholder
this is important because the existence of an empty net46 folder means that the package supports .net framework 4.6 but does not required any assemblies dlls in order to run on that version of .net. this is most likely because the implementation of the package is in the gac
from this link they are placeholder files to denote an empty directory

36338472
direct3d	directx
i m not sure why you are using legacy direct3d 9 instead of directx 11
in any case the naming scheme between direct3d 9 era d3dfmt and the modern dxgi_format is flipped so it can be a bit confusing

36341702
tostring	string.format
indexes start at 0. if the object to be inserted is not a string its tostring method is called to convert it to one before inserting it in the result string
from string.format method the 0 in the format string is a format item

36342311
swift	objective-c
edit swift 4
as i couldn t find any serious email regex example for objective-c i am putting here this one this is based on a regex by michael rushton it is used by php s filter_var function and it seems to be good enough according to this comparison

36342418
oncreate	findviewbyid	oncreate	setcontentview
and then assign it in oncreate
you cannot use findviewbyid until after you call setcontentview ... in oncreate

36342744
hex	binary
in the demo code i ve posted below the solutionbystevelwithpadding shows how to easily generate zero-padding for both decimal and hex output
it also shows one technique to do zero-padding for binary representations - which isn t as simple as for decimal or hex no 04b format - sigh.

36351208
ssl	https
note everything works fine if not involved with https ssl self-signed pages
we think that codeception prioritize port 4444 and disregarding any option indicated in my phantomjs thats why in fails to visit https self-signed pages

36351771
java.util.calendar	java.util.date
why not use java.util.calendar java.util.date instead
it works easy like this import java.util.calendar

36352309
kerberos	ldap
apparently if ldap backend is bdb kerberos is automatically called don t know exactly how why
however when i change it to ldif there aren t any calls to kerberos and everything works as expected

36352309
kerberos	ldap
however when i change it to ldif there aren t any calls to kerberos and everything works as expected
the steps i performed are as follows using apache directory studio ldap browser i exported my dit to a ldif file

36357016
namenode	hdfs
you can try lowering the threshold for triggering safe mode by temporarily setting the following options to low values dfs.safemode.threshold.pct dfs.namenode.safemode.threshold-pct also the namenode might not go back to safe mode immediately after leaving
in my case i was able to clean up stuff by chaining the hdfs dfsadmin -safemode leave and hdfs dfs -rm commands together sudo su hdfs hdfs dfsadmin -safemode leave

36357841
ssl	https
it s not well explained into tutorial but when you create and publish a service in azure it is created as as shocased into tutorial but it will not work as your service must run in https. i so used to create a free ssl certificate then turned on ssl into my azure service so everything started working
i solved the problem. it was related to https

36360930
spaces	linefeed
note since a selection of text will not usually start with a newline character the above code merely adds the four characters to the beginning of the selection and the op s original code handles the four spaces for each new line as they do have the preceding newline character which is then replaced by the newline and four spaces
try adding the four spaces to the beginning of the string to be pasted and do not select the linefeed or carriage return character s at the end of the previous line in your selection

36362790
union	distinct
without seeing your data it s impossible to say and with a query this big it s probably not worth trying to debug the exact problem but it s easy for this to happen if you can have duplicates which would be easy to get especially if you re using union where some condition could match both parts
for instance suppose you have data like this then if you run this query you ll get four result rows however if you select distinct you ll only see three once you start to group by and sum those non-distinct values will both get included that sum is the sum of all four terms not the three distinct ones

36362818
daemons	systemd
there are multiple questions in your list first can i access glusterfs when my systemd is not connected to it if you setup a glusterfs daemons brick on your systemd mount this local daemons through gluster how you would usually do that and add a replication target also you can access your brick through gluster as if it was not on your local systemd
the data will then be synchronized with the replication target once you re-connect your systemd to the network

36368145
swift	objective-c
if you are going to use swift you need to make sure the mach-o type is set as dynamic library so that it will become a dynamic linked framework
for static linked framework you ll need to set the mach-o type as static library but you cannot use swift in the converted static linked framework only objective-c objective-c++ c++ c etc

36369710
realloc	malloc
in that case the parser uses the standard library realloc to allocate or reallocate the stack not the malloc function provided to parseralloc and parserfree frees the stack with the standard library free not the function passed as an argument
the malloc argument to parseralloc is not stored anywhere because the lemon-generated parser never allocates memory

36369710
realloc	malloc
alternatively you could use a function with the standard realloc interface realloc null sz is equivalent to malloc sz and realloc p 0 is equivalent to free p as long as p is not null
see man realloc for details

36371834
implements	extends
the key is that tservereventdispatch implements a custom queryinterface whereas teventobject does not
once i d spotted that it was straightforward to extends teventobject to do likewise and voila

36374394
swift	objective-c
swift is not preprocessed and does not use macros
this option disables nsassert nsparameterassert and similar macros commonly used in objective-c

36374630
comparator	comparable
here is code snippet for treemap.put from java-8 so first it checks whether comparator is provided if yes treemap uses compare method to compare keys otherwise it uses comparator method of comparable for comparison
treemap uses comparator method of comparable not equals method from object when it tries to put an element into map

36374630
comparator	comparable
treemap uses comparator method of comparable not equals method from object when it tries to put an element into map
since your comparator method implementation returns 0 for all person objects there can only be one element in treemap

36375951
keystore	jks
the first bks is a keystore that will work with the keytool in the same fashion as the sun jks keystore
the keystore is resistent to tampering but not inspection

36378131
implements	extends
for example if you have an interface you may decide to write a concrete implementation like this this works fine but if you later decide you want to extends duck you won t be able to write this the reason you can t do this is that you can t implements the same generic interface with two different type parameters - since duck already implements it is not possible for mallardduck to implements
so make sure that if you use this pattern you think very carefully to begin with how you intend to implements the interface

36378322
realloc	memmove
do not use the pointer you put into realloc after the call - only use the returned pointer
you also do not need to copy memmove the contents of the object shall remain unchanged up to the lesser of the new and old sizes

36378997
vbscript	vba
also that is a feature for excel and has nothing to do with basic vbscript vba........
all other programs work in the correct way and it would get lots of trouble if vba would not

36383285
swift	objective-c
objective-c over swift for the code dealing with movement of data you might choose objective-c over swift warren moore recommendation
performance of swift in these special situations still isn t up to scratch

36386530
octal	binary
in python 2 however the leading zero signifies that the number is an octal number base eight so 04 or 03 would mean 4 and 3 in octal respectively but 08 would be invalid as it is not a valid octal number
in python 3 the syntax for octals changed to this 0o10 0o4 as well as allowing other bases such as binary and hexadecimal using the 0b or 0x prefixes. as for your other question a token in python is the way the python interpreter splits up your code into chunks so that it can understand it see here

36386938
implements	extends
also the sorting should be done by key not value because k must implements comparable
in order to use the compareto method you need to indicate that k extends comparable

36389100
sudo	passwd
sudo is necessary in mysql workbench select under choose standard tcp ip under parameters set host localhost port 3306 although i don t think it matters goto advanced others enter click test connection it should as for your username and passwd success
ok i got it working and believe it might be useful for others too i couldn t get it working over the tcp connection but i figured out how to use the socket method running without fuse couple of things here the folder cloudsql has to already exists sudo mkdir cloudsql don t mistype that folder name really don t don t specify the tcp port after instances or it will use a tcp connection instead

36393329
noexcept	throw
if a noexcept function does throw terminate is called thereby enforcing the promise not to throw at run time
specifying that a function won t throw promises the callers of the non-throwing function that they will never need to deal with exceptions

36393658
sudo	passwd
here s a sample script that demonstrates the first technique if not invoked as root the script reinvokes itself with sudo -s passing all arguments through as-is
unless previously authenticated and still within the timeout period sudo will prompt for an administrator passwd

36393748
addition	multiplication
to add two fixed point numbers of predefined width i inlined integer addition with carry-out in my code the fixed point doesn t move anyway
to multiply two fixed point numbers i used a simple shift-and-add function with extended 32-bit fixed point even though that isn t the fastest multiplication approach in order to save even more code

36397139
google-chrome	firefox
edit it s working in firefox but it doesn t work with google-chrome see related bug reports 10877 and the open issues 2 provide a script to the user which executes javaws an example for demonstration application link taken from oracle tutorial running a java web start application javaws this will open a simple java application
edit for the fearless there is a hacky solution for google-chrome

36397453
junit	testng
be careful testng is not junit
junit beforetest is translated by beforemethod in testng world

36408731
comparator	comparable
code snippet you can also use comparetoignorecase method as follows alternatively you can use the second method collections.sort where you do not mention explicitly the comparator while invoking sort on the collection
this would be possible as the bean class implements the comparable interface

36408978
oncreate	onstart
onrestoreinstancestate guarantees you receive a non-null bundle object also in the lifecycle of activity it s called after onstart but oncreate you should always check if the bundle object is null or not to determine the configuration change and as you know it s called before onstart so it s all up to you and depends on your needs
onrestoreinstancestate this method is called after onstart when the activity is being re-initialized from a previously saved state given here in savedinstancestate

36411009
firefox	safari
note that the goal of the fake before selector is to be fake so be sure to change it to something else if you actually have an element with the id excludeie8 interestingly enough in modern browsers firefox 45-52 gc 49-57 edge 25 13 a bad selector eats the entire selector set dabblet demo
it seems that the last windows version of safari and lte ie 7 lol doesn t have this behavior while still understanding before

36412186
set	bag
dr i do not see explicit reason for your trouble apart you should very probably replace bag by set in your mappings
details there is a strange usage of bag it should be set normally in your case

36412186
set	bag
details there is a strange usage of bag it should be set normally in your case
a bag has a very special semantic i would not be surprised if using it as you do causes nhibernate to touch your roles at each personrole change

36413722
multiplying	subtract
it confirms that multiplying and exponentiation are the operations and it gives rise to helpers like square
what i am not clear about is why modulararithmetic is providing add subtract and friends but arriving at unexpected results

36413722
multiplying	subtract
it could well be that its effectively accumulating the results and waiting to be reduced with a multiplying or exponentiate but i don t see any comments in the source code
edit 2 the reason modulararithmetic appears to produce incorrect results for add subtract and friends is the class is meant to be fast for specific problems and it does not perform a full reduction using the euclidean extended algorithm

36413726
daemons	systemd
you ll need to run the actually command with sudo sudo docker-compose -p docker -f my-compose.yml up -d docker runs as root on your linux systemd so all the interactions with the running daemons need to be as root
you can run the commands as a user but you re not interacting with the running systemd

36414221
innodb	myisam
with some storage engines innodb the primary key is the cluster key of the table
with other storage engines myisam the table is stored as a heap and the primary key is essentially the same as declaring not null constraints and adding a unique index

36414834
n-gram	words
this helps us to provide strings as n-gram to classifier
besides just tokenizing it also provide other functionalities like removing stopwords weighting words with tfidf output words count rather than just indicating words is present or not pruning rate stemming lowercase conversion of words etc

36415051
bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
bin bash
you could think about it like this there are many human languages french japanese english hindi etc there are many different shell languages sh csh tcsh zsh bash etc think of sh and bash as languages not commands

36415051
bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
you could think about it like this there are many human languages french japanese english hindi etc there are many different shell languages sh csh tcsh zsh bash etc think of sh and bash as languages not commands
the errors you are getting is because your computer is expecting you to talk to it in sh but actually you are talking to it in bash

mp3	wav
java doesn t support mp3 files mp3 is a container for audio which most be encoded to use
quote from developer.com java sound supports a wide variety of file types including aiff au and wav

36419563
super	implements
the hierarchy of lens and why they compose so well is beyond the confines of this little textbox but suffice it to say that they re super mega useful
use the foldlof helper in control.lens.fold to implements your walk function not so bad

36421597
implements	extends
you could implements a python module in c++ and then load that into the python interpreter the python interpreter hosts the c++ code
this is not entirely trivial see extends python with c or c++ but avoids all the problems associated with process control which the previous idea implies

36424562
spaces	linefeed
any other spaces around this string are included in the output
you want to use a different version of split listing each character so that any of those characters can be used to split the string this will treat one or more of space tab linefeed or carriage return as a split and will not include any of them in the strings it returns

36427472
client-side	server-side
since you can t put the api key in client-side code you ll have to run it on a server
this is a quite common scenario for using server-side code within a firebase architecture the code needs access to some information that common clients cannot be trusted with

36429333
jlist	jtable
the simplest way to display a list of items is not to use a jtextarea but rather either a jlist if you re just displaying a single column of information such as the menu item s name or a jtable if you want to display a table of data with multiple columns
steps for the simple way the jlist create a object fill it with menuitem s using its additem ... method just as you fill your arraylist above

36429935
linefeed	delimiter
if it s not always a fixed length you may have to make a repeating node that s one character long but not the record terminator presumably cr linefeed or something of the like
if the whitespace itself is the delimiter you might be able to do something with the ignore_trailing_delimiter on the record

36439855
ssl	https
you ll need to purchase a ssl cert from your domain name provider and then find the option in the elasticbeanstalk web configuration to upload and use a certificate i think the option may be in the load balancer section
from the following component of the error redirect uri must be an https ssl uri it seems you are using a nonsecure http not https endpoint for the uri

36439855
ssl	https
from the following component of the error redirect uri must be an https ssl uri it seems you are using a nonsecure http not https endpoint for the uri
for some platforms like heroku https support is automatically enabled so placing https in the uri should suffice

36441075
retrofit	okhttp
of course we usually use picasso to load image but sometimes we really need use retrofit to load a special image like fetch a captcha image you need add some header for request get some value from header of response of course you can also use picasso + okhttp but in a project you have already use retrofit to handle most of net requests so here introduce how to implement by retrofit 2.0.0 i have already implemented in my project
the key point is that you need use okhttp3.responsebody to receive response else retrofit will parse the response data as json not binary data

36441111

for example if you decide on swift you should only use objective-c for libraries that are not available in swift
no there are no downsides to using objective-c code in your swift project

36444116
oncreate	setcontentview
seems less buggy with my code while going back to a previously used activity oncreate is not called only onresume so it might help if you move the following lines to there. drawview new drawview this
setcontentview drawview

36445823
ubuntu	centos
a typical base image could be one with ubuntu
the snippet you share in your question would fit well in an ubuntu image with apt-get but not in a centos image

36446147
oncreate	findviewbyid	oncreate	setcontentview
it s too early for findviewbyid before oncreate your activity does not yet have a window that findviewbyid needs internally
before setcontentview that you should be calling in oncreate there are no views to be found either

36451756
qthread	qobject
also pay attention that qthread itself is nothing more nothing less then a wrapper of your real thread and stays as an object in a thread where you created it
keep long story short you shouldn t instantiate anything you going to use in your new thread in the constructor as every object instantiated there will get an affinity of the thread where your qthread object is created common practice is either not to subclass qthread at all just use qobject and movetothread and then connect some slot like init to qthread started signal so you can do all initialisation inside the init which will run inside a new thread or if for whatever reasons you need qthread subclassing instantiate everything in run

36456667
spaces	delimiter
it is impossible to pass a string literal value of hello world as a batch parameter for two reasons spaces cannot be escaped with regard to parameter tokenization
parameters are always delimiter by unquoted token delimiter even if they are preceded by the escape character

36456932
bash	subshell
process substitution bash runs the command in a subshell
however if the shell is bash the situation is not quite that restricted so under some circumstances the above constructions will still work with db2

36456932
bash	subshell
however if the shell is bash the situation is not quite that restricted so under some circumstances the above constructions will still work with db2
in pipelines and command substitution bash will optimize away the subshell if the command to be run in the subshell is simple enough

36456932
bash	subshell
roughly speaking it must be a simple command without redirects. so for example if some bash process p executes cmd1 | cmd2 then both commands have p as their parent because they are both simple commands
similarly with however if a pipelined command or a substituted command is not simple then a subshell is required

36456932
bash	subshell
in particular in bash will not optimize away the command-substitution subshell because cmd1 | cmd2 is not a simple command
so it will create a subshell to execute the pipeline

36458005
union	distinct
columns that are formed by using the set operators union union all crossjoin except and intersect amount to a computation and are also not updatable
the columns being modified are not affected by group by having or distinct clauses

36465200
swift	objective-c
without the generics and nullability annotations someone might have lazily written the interface as such which is irritating because in swift that quite inconveniently ends up with the following signature but with the generics and nullability annotations added to the objective-c code as such we end up with a much easier to digest swift signature it s clear that this is a dictionary with string keys and arrays of strings as values
but objective-c annotations are not strictly enforced in objective-c code

36465200
swift	objective-c
and those generics annotations aren t strictly enforced until we bridge out to the swift side of things
so in the process of bridging by means of applying these objective-c generics annotations swift calls through the method mentioned in your question this is how the nsdictionary from objective-c is converted to the swift dictionary

36467016
required	placeholder
that gives you the required result
the string.remove will accept two parameters first one denotes the start index and the second one will be the number of characters so if you want to perform this remove operation you need to do like this but this is not necessary here another better option is formatting your output message using placeholder

36467769
entity-relationship	diagram
visual paradigm doesn t really do entity-relationship diagram it just abuses entity-relationship terminology in its schema designer
dia is a tool that supports both entity-relationship diagram and multivalued attributes

36470812
http	spdy
independent caching is usually more valuable though and http 2 spdy will render the cost of additional requests moot. it can been distributed as a single file in lieu of hosting on a real url but that s irrelevant on the www
it doesn t require an additional http request

36471645
single-quotes	double-quotes
this applies also for single-quotes meaning you must escape single-quotes that are inside strings that use single-quotes as the opening and closing quotes
note you do not need to escape double-quotes that are inside single-quotes and single-quotes that are inside double-quotes

36472046
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	centos
there are various distros available such as ubuntu debian alpine if you want a lightweight image centos etc
the base image doesn t have to match the distro of your host so you can use ubuntu for your images even though you have red hat running on your host you can find the official images here

36472452
swift	objective-c
mdcswipedirection is unfortunately defined in objective-c as an ns_enum and not as ns_options it is therefore imported to swift as a simple enum and not as an optionsettype therefore you have to juggle with rawvalue for conversions note that the forced unwrap cannot fail see for example how to determine if undocumented value for ns_enum with swift 1.2 .
swift 1.2 does now allow the creation of enumeration variables with arbitrary raw values of the underlying integer type if the enumeration is imported from an ns_enum definition

36474148
bower	npm
to get webpack working with bower packages you can set a custom name path using config.resolve.alias this can come in handy in quite a few situations outside of bower too - for example if you need to use a library that isn t currently distributed through a package manager you can just add it to your project folder and use an alias to make it available to your code
personally i d usually recommend installing everything through npm - most frontend dependencies are on there these days

36474760
serializable	deserialization
serializable started deserialization started class d constructor called
new name added so you can see here constructor of e and d are not called at the time of serializable but it is called while you are creating object e

36474760
serializable	deserialization
new name added so you can see here constructor of e and d are not called at the time of serializable but it is called while you are creating object e
while deserialization of your object its constructors doesn t called but default constructor of its parent will be called

36476068
bash	zsh
in bash braces are needed to delimit the subscript also the subscript for the third element is 2
in zsh you usually do not need to quote parameter expansions in order to handle values with white spaces correctly

36479807
mp4	h.264
firstly - mp4 is not a video codec but a container
so the question is the rtsp server really streaming mp4 which i doubt but it might or maybe you have confused mp4 with h.264

36479807
mp4	h.264
so if you really already have mp4 payload you can simply unpack it from the rtsp stream and forward to the browser
if you have h.264 you will have to perform muxing of the raw h.264 video stream into an mp4 container together with the audio i am not sure if g711 is supported by browsers i doubt it so audio might need to be transcoded

36479807
mp4	h.264
if you have h.264 you will have to perform muxing of the raw h.264 video stream into an mp4 container together with the audio i am not sure if g711 is supported by browsers i doubt it so audio might need to be transcoded
the free option is to setup ffmpeg to transcode rtsp to fragmented mp4 there are lots of examples for this just google or if you are looking for a commercial product our company has just released an video surveillance product that can offer html5 compatible live streaming from rtsp cameras

36482359
http.sys	httplistener
here are the web hosting options currently available for asp.net on service fabric the weblistener host in asp.net core 1 is based on httplistener which uses http.sys so that will work
kestrel in asp.net core 1 is not based on http.sys and to my knowledge does not support port sharing so that won t work

36484073
strcpy	strdup
strcpy as already proposed by multiple comments hence this being a community wiki it s not truthfully my answer is correct for the use case given
also consider switching your array result to a pointer and using strdup to avoid having to make an assumption about string length at the cost of being responsible for a later free

36484696
google-chrome	firefox
the mediarecorder bits should work in google-chrome as well but unfortunately screensharing is still not fully standardized and works differently and requires an extension in google-chrome
here s how to record the screen in firefox update try it in this fiddle warning sharing your browser window on the web involves security risk

36485579
strcpy	strncpy
change this to this by using strcpy instead of the assignment operator this would work in c++ not in c
of course alternative functions exist such as strncpy and memcpy

36489287
pandas	pytables
you can look at swmr though not directly supported by pandas
pytables docs here and here point to solutions

i m not sure exactly what your use case is but here is a quick example of how an enum defined in objective-c can be used in a swift class which can in turn be used in objective-c
here is the objective-c header oclib.h here is the corresponding objective-c .m file oclib.m and here is the swift file the bridging header just has #import oclib.h you have probably seen this documentation already but if not here it is please provide more details about your specific situation if this doesn t answer your question

swift	objective-c
here is the objective-c header oclib.h here is the corresponding objective-c .m file oclib.m and here is the swift file the bridging header just has #import oclib.h you have probably seen this documentation already but if not here it is please provide more details about your specific situation if this doesn t answer your question
here is the output i get from the example an interesting situation arises if a data type defined in swift is used in the signature of an objective-c function that needs to be called from swift

ssl	https
in case it still does not show i am afraid that your only option left would be to provide the ssl to your hosting company so they install it for you from whm
you should be able to install the ssl certificate from your cpanel - ssl tls - install and manage ssl for your site https if you do not have this option in your cpanel you can try changing your cpanel theme from the switch theme menu and try again

36497528
queue	fifo
no there is nothing like and there could not be nor it s technically impossible but is just not reasonable due to nature of queue in principal otherwise it s just going to be a db table
the advantage and limitations of queue is that they use fifo firs-in-first out - not strictly sometimes with some extensions like delay parameters for a task

36497528
queue	fifo
the advantage and limitations of queue is that they use fifo firs-in-first out - not strictly sometimes with some extensions like delay parameters for a task
but anyway tasks scheduler dispatcher coordinator does not need to care about deleting tasks from the middle of the queue and is concentrated on work with limited number of tasks in the head of queue

36498238
content-length	content-type
also the content_length is 0 that s because all the data is being used as the key part of a key value pair thus there is no value and no value has a content-length of 0
nevertheless the server should not be receiving the header for the raw request i get as you can clearly see the content-type header is multipart form-data

36498564
shadowing	named
in this case f# allows variable shadowing and you can hide variable of existing named
this can be inside a function or even just a do block this is a bit confusing because variable shadowing only works inside local scopes but not at the top level

36498778
move	drag
see issue 201716 buttons in move dialog not working
see idea-146691 drag and drop to move file dialog frozen - escape exits for details and consider using a jdk outside the problematic range

36499752
cdr	cons
thus a chain of pairs where the last cdr is not matches this
append is a procedure that uses cons to make a list with all the elements of the argument lists left to right

36504429
kombu	celery
i solved the problem in my project by following this workflow to keep only the essential requirements-to-freeze.txt where i list celery but not its dependencies like kombu
then it s enough to upgrade the essential packages and then re-freeze the full list of dependencies with the working kombu version

36505148
prepare	execute
decide if prepare statement is worth for performance reasons
if you have simple sql query which is execute only few times it will not help sometime it will even slow down the execution a bit

36506382
build.gradle	gradlew
a few things apply the kotlin-android plugin to your library module build.gradle see the docs apply plugin kotlin-android as it stands now you re not even telling gradlew to compile kotlin files
your buildscript block should probably be at the top-level build.gradle rather than the module build.gradle

36506436
strcpy	strncpy
the length limitation for strncpy should be based on the target size not the source length that s the point of using it over strcpy which uses only the source length
in your code the length parameter is from the source array which defeats the purpose of using strncpy

36509805
sudo	passwd
1 root root 40 apr 8 19 52 usr bin blinkscript and then having a line toward the bottom of your sudoers file of the form user1 all nopasswd usr bin blinkscript if i as user1 do blinkscript i get permission denied if i as user1 do sudo blinkscript i get hello world without being prompted for a passwd note that i do not have to explicitly do usr bin blinkscript but that also works if i as user2 who doesn t have any sudo privs do sudo blinkscript i get prompted for a passwd and then put on the bad boy list also note that i used permissions of 700 to clearly show the permissions
doing something like 755 would also be fine and the point would be that if your script tried to touch the sys files it would work when run with sudo and not without

36512451
client-side	server-side
short answer nodeinterface is only used by graphql when the client-side usually browser requests for a piece of graphql data that is already in its possession from initial fetch to be re-fetched
re-fetch is performed under any of these circumstances a different same react component on the same web page requests for additional pieces of data at a later stage and those data are not available in the initial data fetched the code in react component executes this.props.relay.forcefetch which usually happens if programmer believes that the data on the server-side may have changed due to other external the code in react component executes this.props.relay.setvariable ... when the user performs an action such as changing the number of items to show picture size etc. that requires a variation of the initially fetched data

36515302
operands	scalar
end note the value computations of the operands of an operator are sequenced before the value computation of the result of the operator
if a side effect on a scalar object is unsequenced relative to either another side effect on the same scalar object or a value computation using the value of the same scalar object and they are not potentially concurrent 1.10 the behavior is undefined

36516353
swift	objective-c
i found a way around this when i was looking to solve a similar problem - that kvo can t set the value of a pure swift protocol field
the protocol has to be marked objective-c which caused too much pain in my code base. the workaround is to look up the ivar using the objective c runtime get the field offset and set the value using a pointer. this code works in a playground in swift 2.2 notes this is probably pretty fragile you really shouldn t use this

but maybe it could live in a thoroughly tested and updated reflection library until swift gets a proper reflection api

36519147
rsa	dsa
try and use rsa instead
you cannot encrypt with the dsa algorithm or dsa key 1.2.840.10040.4.1 is dsa

36519990
google-chrome	firefox
you can test the following in a browser console i m using a modern browser here - google-chrome the value of undefined doesn t change in the above example
this is because emphasis mine in modern browsers javascript 1.8.5 firefox 4+ undefined is a non-configurable non-writable property per the ecmascript 5 specification

36523298
google-chrome	firefox
the webdriver spec is element-focussed and doesn t define any method to send keys to the window the screen to browser google-chrome - only to elements
use of the selenium actions class for cmd - r works on my mac in firefox 45 but only when run in the foreground - and seemingly not at all in google-chrome

36525761
erlang	elixir
it is generally a bad idea to use yes | with anything using elixir erlang even more so with long running tasks - with short running ones you have a chance at completing them before you run out of memory but it s still not a great idea
the problem is the yes | part. the erlang vm behaves differently from regular programs when it comes to the stdin and input

36531464
base	fractions
def div_by_a_or_b a b number return not number a or not number b then we divide out all the fives then all the twos and check if the number is 1 i made this a bit more polymorphic so you can change this around if you want to change the base
all you need is the factors of that base for instance in base 14 you check 2 and 7 instead of 2 and 5 now all thats left to do is find out what we do in the case of non-terminating repeating fractions

36531464
base	fractions
all you need is the factors of that base for instance in base 14 you check 2 and 7 instead of 2 and 5 now all thats left to do is find out what we do in the case of non-terminating repeating fractions
now this is super number theory filled so i ll leave you with the algorithm and let you decide if you want to find out more on mathforum.org or wolfram alpha now that we can easily tell if a fractions will terminate and if not what will be the length of its cycle of repeating digits

36534339
punctuation	words
you can have words boundaries that aren t whitespace punctuation etc. which is when you need to use b
if you re only matching words that are delimited by whitespace then you can just use s

36535191
google-chrome	firefox
however in google-chrome it doesn t
i noticed that when you put this in the console in firefox it comes up with nan new timetill date.now 2016-04-15 20 00 00 cdt true

sqoop	hadoop
i solved it. my sqoop version was not compatible with the hadoop version
i configured the sqoop again by following the steps-6 to 8 of the below link

36540796
swift	objective-c
case 1 lets say your project is developed in objective-c and now you are developing new features using swift in it in this case you have to have bridgingheader as you need access of your objective-c classes in swift code
case 2 if your project is developed in swift then there is no need to have bridging header as well if its in only objective-c and you are not planning to move it in swift then also you don t need it

36540796
swift	objective-c
case 2 if your project is developed in swift then there is no need to have bridging header as well if its in only objective-c and you are not planning to move it in swift then also you don t need it
read more about using swift with cocoa and objective-c in apple documentation

36540811
swift	objective-c
if you re working with the objective-c bridging header make sure the objective-c bridging header swift_objc_bridging_header build setting under swift compiler - code generation is set to a path to the bridging header file relative to your project for example myapp myapp-bridging-header.h
xcode uses your product module name product_module_name not your target name target_name when naming the objective-c bridging header and the generated header for your swift code

36540811
swift	objective-c
if you use your own objective-c types in your swift code make sure to import the objective-c headers for those types before importing the swift generated header into the objective-c .m file you want to use your swift code from
swift declarations marked with the private modifier do not appear in the generated header

36540811
swift	objective-c
swift declarations marked with the private modifier do not appear in the generated header
private declarations are not exposed to objective-c unless they are explicitly marked with ibaction iboutlet or objective-c as well

36542758
rsa	aes
the proper way to implement this would be to generate a symmetric aes key encrypt the actual data with aes with cbc ctr gcm eax and then encrypt the single key with rsa
there is no standard to apply rsa to multiple blocks so it is not recommended to implement this

36546010
opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
if you can live with only targeting google-chrome firefox or opera you can use compound indexes
if it must work on safari indexeddbshim edge or ie you cannot use compound indexes today

36546240
backgrounding	multitasking
2 silent push notification which works only when your app is in backgrounding minimized state
once your app is killed swipe up from multitasking even silent push notification cannot wake up your app

36549078
ssl	https
hostname verification isn t part of ssl
it is part of https

36555643
firefox	safari
for urls it probably doesn t we can use hypens in browsers that support them at the moment firefox safari edge and ie 10+
also note that in firefox hypens don t work if you have word-brake property so unless you have fixed-width container you must choose between hypens on ff or legacy support

36559839
super	self
a very good explanation of how super works is brilliantly given by raymond hettinger in a pycon 2015 talk available here and a related article . i will attempt a short answer and if it is not sufficient i and hopefully the community will expand on it. the answer has two key pieces python s super needs to have an object on which the method being overridden is called so it is explicitly passed with self
this is not the only possible implementation and in fact in python 3 it is no longer required that you pass the self instance

36566294
implements	extends
basically create a class which implements list and delegates all of its method calls to another list instance other than clear aside from the advantage that you aren t now restricted to having an arraylist that you cannot clear you could reuse it for a linkedlist the real advantage in doing this is that in order to prevent clear from working you also have to prevent lists returned by list.sublist from having clear called on them
if you have prevented clear by extends arraylist you would need to then create another class which prevents clear on the sublist also

36568467
prepare	execute
you do not have to enclose a by single quotes in the query you cannot use prepare statements to bind a table name to a variable so you must use simple string concatenation to assemble such query
obviously the assembled query can be execute using a prepare statement but there is not too much point doing so unless you have other parameters in your query

36569177
ecdsa	rsa
and would be more so for dsa or ecdsa if you wanted to use those preferably only with java 8+ which supports dsa sizes over 1024 consistent with 186-3 and current good practice
not needed now but fyi or anyone else puttygen imports either the formats used by openssh always until recently and still by default which are the original aka legacy formats defined by openssl before it implemented pkcs#8 -- for rsa this is pkcs#1 which is equivalent to part of pkcs#8

36569906
google-chrome	safari
it doesn t work on ios-safari google-chrome even
safari is not supporting service workers right now but it should work in google-chrome 42 although you should consider to update your browser

36571178
super	extends
check the documentation source code for the super class you are extends
the super keyword is not deprecated

36572626
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome s error correction is fixing the issue for you but the issue remains
the problem is not only in firefox

36573178
ionic	angular
so in your config file you can do something like as i said i m not familiar with ionic so i m sorry if that s not what you were looking for
i m not familiar with ionic at all but i hope i can help you. first of all in files you use angular

36573178
ionic	angular
i m not familiar with ionic at all but i hope i can help you. first of all in files you use angular
on the top of file you need to import angular import angular from angular

36585184
udp	tcp
you are telling getaddrinfo that you are going to be using a udp sock_dgram socket not a tcp sock_stream socket
so the output addrinfo contains information for creating a udp socket when calling socket

36585184
udp	tcp
you are then calling connect on a udp socket
in udp connect does not actually create a physical connection like it does for tcp

36587339
swift	objective-c
if you have two libraries one that is in swift and one that is in objective - c choose the one that will offer more functionality in your app
if they offer the same functionality i d just go with the swift library - my reasoning if the objective-c library isn t widely used and there aren t many tutorials on how to convert the objective - c code into swift it can be very time consuming to figure it out on your own

36587339
swift	objective-c
if they offer the same functionality i d just go with the swift library - my reasoning if the objective-c library isn t widely used and there aren t many tutorials on how to convert the objective - c code into swift it can be very time consuming to figure it out on your own
if you use a swift library the code is already formatted in the correct language saving you time and potentially money depending on if this is a hobby for you or not

36591709
swift	objective-c
swift enums can t be used in objective-c header files taken from the answer here
in mixed objective-c - swift projects the best way to have enums work in both types of classes will be to define the enum in an objective-c header and not in a swift class

36596532
ilist	icollection
ilist well it does all and more and would be a nice fit if it where not for it doing stuff that s untranslatable to sql
so in the middle we have icollection

36601708
implements	extends
on your homework class you were saying any concrete class read not abstract extends this class should implements this method but on the concrete class you again are trying to implements the same method using the abstract keyword just with a different signature which is wrong
either remove the abstract keyword and change the signature or implements the abstract method keep in mind though that you will have to implements all the abstract methods you defined in homework unless you make mymath abstract as well

36604174
express	node.js
it won t magically make server-side javascript frameworks like express or the ace editor work solely in the browser however
the short answer is that the ace editor was built to run in node.js not rails so there s no simple way to do this

36604764
udp	tcp
udp does not have connections and thus you cannot easily deduce whether or not the other end had closed the socket
if you need connections you must use tcp

36604764
udp	tcp	icmp	udp	icmp	tcp
in any case you cannot deduce between any of icmp towards sender being filtered by firewall udp towards receiver being filtered by firewall udp being delivered successfully to the receiver so i d consider the possible signalling of udp errors a nice addition but not something to rely on
tcp is very much analogous to a phone call whereas udp is more like mailboxes

36607976
mp3	ogg	mp3	wav
not sure about django however in plain python world if you want to convert any format to mp3 pydub has quick and easy way
it can be installed using pip install pydub supported formats are ogg flv mp4 wma acc wav mp3 and documentation on pydub can be found here here is a demo code that converts from wav to mp3 or raw to mp3

36608258
ssl	https
that s part of https not ssl and it happens after the ssl handshake is complete
once this process is completed browser makes a https request as required and browser encrypts it using encryption algorithm mentioned in the cipher suite returned in server hello

36610359
grepl	substr
use grep or grepl but be aware of whether or not you want to use regular expressions
by default grep and related take a regular expression to match not a literal substr

36610696
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
here s a solution that does work in at least the latest versions of google-chrome firefox and edge note trying to use this solution to copy an empty string or a string that is only whitespace will not work
update this solution also works in safari

36613637
bash	zsh
a nul will work differently when used in a command substitution. this code should assign a value to the variable and then print it and it does but with different results in different shells ### several shells just ignore remove ### a nul in the value of the expanded command. bin dash 61 62 63 64 bin sh 61 62 63 64 bin b43sh 61 62 63 64 bin bash 61 62 63 64 bin lksh 61 62 63 64 bin mksh 61 62 63 64 ### ksh trims the the value. bin ksh 61 62 bin ksh93 61 62 ### zsh sets the var to actually contain the nul value. bin zsh 61 62 00 63 64 bin zsh4 61 62 00 63 64 it is of special mention that bash version 4.4 warns about the fact bin b44sh warning command substitution ignored null byte in input 61 62 63 64 in command substitution the zero byte is silently ignored by the shell
it is very important to understand that that does not happen in zsh

36615216
swift	objective-c
the next best thing if you must return an nsmutablearray from a swift array of tuples might be returning an array of 2 element arrays
since swift types like tuple or struct have no equivalent in objective-c they can not be cast to or referenced as anyobject which nsarray and nsmutablearray constrain their element types to

36615793
crossover	mutation
the goal of crossover is to take two or more in some cases solutions and combine them to create a solution that has some properties of both optimally the best of both
the goal of mutation is to create new genetic material that was not previously present in the population by doing a small random change

36616044
stateless	stateful
it s not the coincidence it s how stream api is currently implemented in oraclejdk openjdk stateless operations like filter map peek and flatmap are fused together into single operation which performs the steps sequentially in single thread
however introducing some stateful operation might change the things

36616768
selecteditem	selectedindex
then in your save method in your viewmodel you can simply increase the selectedindex by 1 remember to check if the index is not the last if you want to keep that selecteditem than you can do something similar like
at first i would suggest using selectedindex instead of selecteditem

36617428
swift	objective-c
a swift implementation by john coates appears here but he wrongly called it pastel although not including the required light-blue to achieve that effect
my objective-c version for john s git with mixing of light blue is here edit i have improved the algorithm making the colors brighter by mixing also white into the computation by adding 1 to the light blue and diving by 3 instead of 2

36620667
swift	objective-c
don t use selectors - they re not a swift standard
use nullability to convert to optionals closures and blocks may have the same syntax but there s a slight difference watch out for that swift closures and objective-c blocks are compatible so you can pass swift closures to objective-c methods that expect blocks

36621476
content-length	content-type
post http 1.1 user-agent fiddler host localhost 5076 content-type application json content-length 7 alice when a parameter has frombody web api uses the content-type header to select a formatter
in this example the content-type is application json and the request body is a raw json string not a json object

36627158
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
throwable s are checked exceptions except if they re also error s which are unchecked-exception and then there s the exception s which are also throwable s and are the main type of checked exception except there s one exception to that too which is that if they are also runtimeexception s because that s the other kind of unchecked-exception
well just like the name implies they re exceptions like all exception s and they happen at run-time like all exceptions actually except that runtimeexception s are exceptional compared to other run-time exception s because they aren t supposed to happen except when you make some silly error although runtimeexception s are never error s so they re for things that are exceptionally erroneous but which aren t actually error s

36628319
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
as such you can never guarantee that a particular runtimeexception is not thrown by a method - maybe it s not thrown directly by the method you called but it could be thrown by a method that calls now or in future implementations
unchecked-exception are not really intended to be caught since they are supposed to indicate unrecoverable errors like programming errors

36628530
jar	war
the answer from aribeiro is the right answer a jar packaged by the build-tool maven is in the lib-directory of the war and conflicts with the wildfly-classloader
additional here is a generic solution for the following issue you ve got a jboss 7 as or a wildfly as you work with eclipse jboss tools you deploy an ear or a war lib-folder is packed by build-tool like maven there occurs an error like this examplepackage.excampleclass cannot be cast to examplepackage.excampleclass mostly it happens when you leave the java ee-spec and use jboss wildfly-specific modules ironjacamar jsf-impl and so on

36630318
jspm	npm
you have to install it using jspm not npm
like this jspm install moment

36631117
onchange	onblur
one way is to create your own confirmdialog like and then use onchange event to open the confirmdialog edit i made a typo and a mistake on my answer
the typo was actually using inside you are right selectbooleancheckbox isnt confirmable. the mistake was that doesn t fires onclick but only onblur onchange and onfocus

36635682
bash	subshell
the difference between let i++ and is that the former is evaluated by the bash itself while the latter is evaluated by a subshell which then exits and therefore has no effect
the subshell doesn t call clone this is an explicit optimization

36636354
jspm	npm
this is expected at the moment because the typescript compiler doesn t know how to find jspm packages
vscode relies on the typescript compiler and the compiler only knows to look for modules through npm packages look inside node_modules - that s what moduleresolution node does

36636354
jspm	npm
it doesn t seem ideal though as you ll have to manually maintain this list every time your jspm dependency changes
an alternative is to install angular 2 via npm in addition to jspm npm install angular2 --save or --save-dev but that duplicates the dependency and also require manual maintenance when they change

36636892
ssl	https
this ensures that browsers recognize your ssl over https as valid
this is not necessary if you re not using https at all

36638201
atof	strtod
problem 2 you are not performing error handling with atof
i would suggest to use strtod

36638724
debian	linux
the same applies for a sql docker container when you create a windows docker container your dockerfile starts with something like from windowsservercore while when you create a linux container your dockerfile will start with from debian jessie or from busybox or such
it depends what you mean by running on windows if it is in windows 7 8 10 or in windows server 2016 it is possible with windows 7 8 10 as it is in fact a linux vm it is not possible with windows server 2016 you will need a windows server 2016 to launch a windows container and a linux server to launch a linux container

36640131
domcontentloaded	onreadystatechange
finally some browsers - namely firefox - don t currently emit a domcontentloaded event from iframes so for a fallback you could add a load listener on the iframe s contentwindow property or the iframe itself
adding the onreadystatechange attribute to an iframe tag as shown in the original question doesn t seem to do anything

36641196
apache	nginx
your web server apache nginx should be pointed to a public directory
corrent url with correct settings will be but not if you re using apache please read this

36643371
dictionary	map
do not constrain the type of x and just instantiate x with the proper type manualy you can wrap your object in a function then create an object of foo if you want to have mixed type fields in the same type fields of t and map t you can modify a bit the constructor this will allow you to create foo as while mapping x to float32 and the last and probably the most viable one first define the dictionary and wrap your type in both types now wrap the construction of a foo object into a function foo function creates objects of type foo where the first parameter specifies the type t of foo and the type v is dynamically inferred from the types dictionary
note in both the above methods if t is not defined in the types dictionary the get function returns t and thus x is mapped to t

36643849
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
even without it background images worked on ie 9+ edge google-chrome and firefox
only safari of the tested browsers did not show background images

36644501
noexcept	throw
a sample of this implementation is found here these exception specifications are consistent the c++ proposal and gsl implementations i ve redacted most of the motivation for the noexcept more substantial detail is found in the c++ proposal the usual raii semantics of the destructor hence the scope exit function is applicable
it will not throw this is also consistent with the c++11 specification on the default exception specification for a destructor

36648685
stateless	stateful
this does not depend on stateful stateless mode
the only difference with stateful mode is that those dynamic actions won t be remembered in jsf state so they can t be restored in the postback

36652318
memcpy	memmove
this will leave four chars at the end which you can use to append stuff but not more than you have removed of course before 0 x 0 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 0 | | +-------+ +-------+ | | after 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 7 0 | | +--+---- new you can write a loop for this but there are also two functions in the standard lib for this memcpy which requires the buffers not to overlap and memmove which can handle overlapping buffer
you need memmove

36653820
httpclient	okhttp
apache httpclient is deprecated and removed as of android 6.0 so you should use something else such as android s built in httpurlconnection classes or a library like okhttp or volley which is what i d recommend
however you can still add the legacy old apache httpclient to your project as a library by adding org.apache.http.legacy to your build.gradle like this i would not recommend doing this since it is no longer supported and i d recommend using a different http client instead as mentioned above

36656329
splinter	selenium
the test above would look something like so when using splinter
from the looks of it div.category-detail li a cannot be found because that page has been opened in a new window while selenium is looking for it in the original window torrents.eu

36656816
jar	war
the jar serializer-2.7.1.jar was part of my war file as i created the war using grails war command and i am not sure where it was being used.my app is running fine after the removal of jar so it seems the grails framework is also not using this jar internally anywhere
for the benefit of others it seems the op s answer is embedded in the question i found a similar issue on which suggested to remove xalan serializer-2.7.1.jar from the package and it indeed works fine after removing this jar from the application war

36658604
bower	npm
you should not use bower anymore
use ember browserify to import things installed with npm

36664531
vsts	tfs
if this limitation is lifted in vsts we will get it for free in tfs
i have not checked but do not think it is possible to day. while you can go to iis and enable anonymous tfs is designed in a way that each call to the server is tied to user previously authenticated

36664771
awt	swing
you re not creating an awt frame window and have no need of this
create a class that extends jpanel and draw in its paintcomponent method as the swing painting tutorials link now added show you

36664917
g++	gcc
to answer on the osx side first of all recall that on osx g++ is actually an alias to clang++ and the current apple s version of clang does not support openmp
nonetheless using eigen3.3-beta-1 and default clang++ i get on a macbookpro 2.6ghz then to get support for multithreading you need a recent clang of gcc compiler for instance using homebrew or macport

36669334
swift	objective-c
we re actually using a lot of c++ internally since raw performance is very important and objective-c and for many things also swift are not yet fast enough for certain tasks
we did invest a lot of time in adopting the latest objective-c features such as nullability and generics next to declarations such as noescape for block-based api to make our sdk great to consume from within swift

36669718
spaces	delimiter
the documentation of scanner says the default whitespace delimiter used by a scanner is as recognized by character.iswhitespace and the linked documentation of character.iswhitespace says determines if the specified character is white spaces according to java
a character is a java whitespace character if and only if it satisfies one of the following criteria it is a unicode spaces character space_separator line_separator or paragraph_separator but is not also a non-breaking spaces u00a0 u2007 u202f

36671263
onchange	onblur
if you want to validate the field every time it loses the focus even if the text did not change you can set onblur instead of onchange
you can set the onchange event of the textbox to call this function validatessn will be called when the textbox loses the focus but only if the text was modified

36672793
build.gradle	gradlew
change the allprojects of your project level build gradlew to this and remove the jitpack url from app build.gradle and sync your project
url is supposed to go in project level build.gradle not in module level

36673027
swift	objective-c
the trouble most likely is that by default if unspecified swift s bool translates into objective-c s bool which is a non-class
objective-c wouldn t be able to distinguish between the three possible cases if your return type is bool

36674443
innodb	myisam	tokudb	myisam
this applies to innodb and tokudb storage engines
for myisam which isn t transactional engine the trigger might error out but it won t cause a rollback because it isn t supported by that storage engine

36676886
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
if your pc is apple mac like me you can create case-sensitive disk
the question is similar to strange behaviour of git mysterious changes cannot be undone you need a case-insensitive filesystem

36679731
swift	objective-c
there is pubnub swift for ios sdk 4.x as well
pubnub and background connectivity staying connected in the background an continuing to receive realtime messages via subscribe is not a function of the pubnub sdk and it does not matter if you are using pubnub ios 3.x sdk please don t it has eol ed or pubnub objective-c for ios 4.x sdk please start using this or migrate to it asap

36680625
concave	convex
triangles in any form are safe though there s no way for a triangle to be concave or not coplanar
polygons and quads are pretty much useless because your typical rasterizer software or gpu can deal only with convex coplanar primitives

36681852
jar	war
if so do not use the src main webapp directory if your application will be packaged as a jar
although this directory is a common standard it will only work with war packaging and it will be silently ignored by most build tools if you generate a jar

36681852
jar	war
although this directory is a common standard it will only work with war packaging and it will be silently ignored by most build tools if you generate a jar
i am assuming when you put this on your server it is a war file so the above does not matter

36685693
dictionary	map
on the other hand when the dictionary is implemented with a balanced tree the operations are a bit slower o logn but they can be enumerated in sorted way by the key
for example c# dictionary implementation is unsorted and a c++ map is sorted based on a red-black tree given the above you cannot have the data sorted however you want in the dictionary what you can do is save the dictionary as a list array and then sort by whichever comparator you want

36685693
dictionary	map
for example c# dictionary implementation is unsorted and a c++ map is sorted based on a red-black tree given the above you cannot have the data sorted however you want in the dictionary what you can do is save the dictionary as a list array and then sort by whichever comparator you want
here is an example of a dictionary and a custom comparer where you can get the values in the dictionary sorted by the logic in the custom comparer you can also use a sorteddictionary as clockwork-muse suggests and pass a similar customcomparer as in the above example

36687187
udp	tcp
the only way to determine these situations is to build a protocol on top of udp to handle these situations though if you are not careful you will be better off just using tcp
note setsotimeout is a timeout on blocking reads for tcp

36688174
swift	objective-c
unfortunately the documentation pretty explicitly states that this pattern is not allowed to avoid cyclical references don t import swift code into an objective-c header .h file
instead you can forward declare a swift class or protocol to reference it in an objective-c interface

36689163
swift	objective-c
as eendje mentioned the swift way of doing this is to use reduce
is not exposed to objective-c because objective-c can t handle non-class-type optionals

36694838
stateless	stateful
update also applicationscoped is not an ejb annotation class servidorserviceimp needs to be an ejb bean so it should be annotated with stateless or perhaps stateful and remove the applicationscoped
it reads like a stateless ejb bean so there is no need to make it application scoped

36695202
swift	objective-c
the action argument for uitapgesturerecognizer is an objective-c selector but swift extensions to classes aren t objective-c
so i changed the protocol to an objective-c protocol but that was a problem because my protocol included some swift optionals and it also introduced new crashes when i tried to implement the protocol in my vc

36697425
swift	objective-c
first note when you mentioned -ofast that s for objective-c not swift
the flag for swift is just -o

36699959
avro	thrift
which is why specificdatumreader doesn t work for me and honestly why i use avro in the first place instead of something like thrift
update the normal way to do avro is to store the schema in the file with the records

36700120
apache	nginx
share them through php is bad idea. nginx apache can do it very fast not using ram php read full image in ram . also nginx apache can cache this image
you can write some rules for folder web image workflow in your server nginx or apache

36703397
express	node.js
dr error handling logic such as mail to admin and logging should be encapsulated in a dedicated and centralized object that all end-points express middleware cron jobs unit-testing call when an error comes in
otherwise not handling errors within a single place will lead to code duplication and probably to errors that are handled improperly code example - a typical error flow blog quote sometimes lower levels can t do anything useful except propagate the error to their caller from the blog joyent ranked 1 for the keywords node.js error handling you may end up handling the same error at several levels of the stack

36704374
swift	objective-c
your controls of camera could be like this please pay attentions that for not showing to user retake and use photo buttons you need to set allowsediting to false and actually the same for swift 2.2+
you can easily inherit uiimagepickercontroller objective-c then override viewdidload and customize ui to your needs by creating uiview object and set it to self.cameraoverlayview

36704803
noexcept	throw
there is technically no requirement for the base class constructor to be declared noexcept but it must not throw when called by a derived constructor that is declared noexcept
so yes you do need to consider whether the base class constructor may throw exceptions or otherwise

36705033
swift	objective-c
it s a modified cleaner version of my old one now that i understand how xcode links in my swift sub-frameworks better problem that makes distribution compilation a bit ugly since swift standard libraries aren t bundled on the device like objective-c nor are they guaranteed to be stable between versions yet stable binary interface promised in swift 3 we have to make sure the entire project is compiled against the same version of swift
that means the guy using your closed-source framework has to be using the same version of swift in their xcode for their project as you did for compiling the library even if he s not using swift in his code because ultimately it s his version of swift that gets bundled into the app and your sdk runs against

36707810
bash	subshell
use input redirection instead of a pipeline or in more complex cases process substitution to ensure that your while loop doesn t run in a subshell in the simple case of reading lines from a file you can read directly into an array in this example bash 4.x earlier versions
this is a basic bash pitfall all segments of a pipeline execute in subshell by default which means that whatever variables they create will go out of scope when these subshell terminate the current shell won t see them

36707840
icmp	udp
if i try to send a ping icmp echo request or make a tcp connection to your instance i would get request timed out or connection timed out if i were not allowed by your security group
but with udp the sender has no way to detect whether the packets are forwarded or discarded

36709608
concave	angle
here are 3 vertices so it works also for concave polygons but not for self-intesecting ones they are not simple
if you contour is closed z-command and it is simple polygon then sum of interior angle s is where n is the number of vertices

36709832
onclick	onchange
first off you shouldn t use onclick for a radio button or a select element
use onchange instead which means you won t need to call btw your code is very wet

36712132
inline	inlining
moving some methods from your class implementation file into the header file with the inline keyword to avoid linking issues might be a solution
if the code of a fuction is located in a separate translation unit that is not in a header of the entry-point you are calling then no inlining may occur

36715214
google-chrome	firefox
noscreen renotify silent sound and sticky options no support note that silent option is available from google-chrome 43
taking a look at the browser compatibility table on mdn the silent option is still not available in firefox

36726405
google-chrome	safari
the op is not using the context menu in google-chrome and does not have the search google for.... option
the search with google entry is provided by safari and won t work with another browser to my knowledge

36726960
build.gradle	gradlew
what i ended up doing is adding following in library ui ui build.gradle in your case where buildflavor1 and buildflavor2 - are build variants used in your app
i think the problem was because gradlew is not aware of possible configurations when resolving dependencies so he cannot properly pick the library for every build flavor

36727834
realloc	malloc
it is not so efficient to use realloc everytime you need to add one new item instead allocate a bunch of items but set the ones you are not using to null then keep track of how many are left once they run out allocate another bunch
you have several problems here first your id_len nowhere do you check if by copying to name you surpass the id_len so instead of use you allocate but you should not cast return value of malloc realloc search on web for explanation it has been described ad nauseum when using realloc you should first check the return value it may fail

36727834
realloc	malloc
you have several problems here first your id_len nowhere do you check if by copying to name you surpass the id_len so instead of use you allocate but you should not cast return value of malloc realloc search on web for explanation it has been described ad nauseum when using realloc you should first check the return value it may fail
the memory realloc returns is partly uninitialized old pointers remain but new ones are uninitialized

36729342
factors	mean
question 2 kafka provides a replication factors for reliability
if you mean replicated on the same machine then no that would be dubious at best as it couldn t withstand a simple server crash

36730950
g++	gcc
i ran g++ with -fdump-ipa-inline to get more information about why functions are or are not inlined
for the testcase with main function and three objects created i got this error code is set in gcc gcc ipa-inline.c then i discovered that the smallest change to make g++ inline these functions is to add a declaration int main __attribute__ hot

36733114
comparator	comparable
since a now implements the comparable interface you ll need to define a comparator method on a
your issue is that a is not comparable

36733772
pyenv	virtualenv
the problem with perlbrew and plenv is that they seem to be replacements for pyenv not virtualenv
as noted here pyenv is for managing python versions virtualenv is for managing per-project module versions

36735141
factors	matrix
so although the contrasts for missing factors levels are dropped in terms of estimating the coefficients those factors levels still appear in the model matrix
this means that the model matrix has more columns than the length of est1.qbar the vector of estimated coefficients so matrix multiplication is not going to work

36738703
onkeyup	onkeydown
i stopped trying to solve my problem a while ago but from what i remember part of it was that my code was using onkeypressed function but this is not called when those keys are pressed neither is onkeyup btw
so i had to use onkeydown function instead to detect when the pressed of those specific keys

36738915
jar	war
the most common cause for this is that the war file mistakenly contains an servlet api jar file or even a java ee jar file in web-inf lib
you should make sure that the war s web-inf lib does not contain any libraries which are already provided by the target runtime itself in your case jetty

36741228
xmltype	clob
the error is because you re trying to concatenate the xmltype variable but the concatenation operator only allows strings char varchar2 or clob
while you could extract the clob value and include that enclosed in quotes it isn t a great idea

36741839
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
the reason why your solution works in google-chrome and firefox is that they support the download attribute - safari doesn t yet
i did a quick research - i looks like safari does not support what you are trying to achieve

36743970
punctuation	words
if you have punctuation inside the string splitting with a space might not be enough
use the words boundary b it matches both the leading and trailing words boundaries that is it will match an empty space right between words and non-word characters and also at the start end of the string if followed preceded with a words character

36755548
ansible	puppet
ansible has conditionals that you can apply to tasks
however when doesn t map directly to puppet s unless as it operates on ansible variables not shell commands

36755606
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
sudo add-apt-repository ppa dhor myway sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install graphicsmagick sudo apt-get install imagemagick
probably graphicsmagick imagemagick is not installed correctly download graphicsmagick or download imagemagick if your are using ubuntu these commands are useful

36755974
scipy	sympy
it seems sympy functions are not compatible with scipy integrate
one needs to use sympy integrate

36756211
super	implements
but if the constraint without actually attempting to load the class does not forbid to read the contents of the class file you could do the following for the edge cases get a inputstream for the class file contents via class.getresourceasstream parse the beginning of the class file and read the super class name from the constant pool
as commented by shmosel implements the logic of class.getsimplename

36757793
hex	binary
if you want to write a binary file by hand you obviously need a hex editor
i ve written classfiles directly in a hex editor before and it is a very annoying and error prone process and it is not really feasible for anything more complicated than hello world

36757793
hex	binary
i ve written classfiles directly in a hex editor before and it is a very annoying and error prone process and it is not really feasible for anything more complicated than hello world
luckily i ve written an assembler which allows you to write bytecode in a human friendly textual form and assemble it to binary classfiles

36758500
punctuation	words
you didn t include any punctuation but if you wanted the regex to not break on apostrophes you could change this to something like instead
if you wanted to do this with a regex this would work how this works b is a words boundary

36760539
inline	inlining
this probably not a big deal for code-size in real code since tiny functions are should be static inline and arg-handling insns are a small part of bigger functions
inter-procedural optimization can remove overhead between calls when the compiler can see both definitions even without inlining

36762614
boost	allocator
the following code uses a substring range to parse the number without performing any dynamic allocator the output tested on os x with boost 1.60 738934883 the lexical cast library has some great features for conversion to and from strings though it isn t as well known as some of the others for some reason
boost does actually support this using the lexical cast library

36770058
bash	subshell
as an extension however any or all commands in a pipeline may be executed in the current environment so without the extension which bash uses for things like lastpipe and i thought for the first element in a pipeline as well but apparently not or at least not always it looks like you can assume there will be a subshell for each part of the pipeline but the exception means you can t quite count on that
in 2.12 shell execution environment you find this quote a subshell environment shall be created as a duplicate of the shell environment except that signal traps that are not being ignored shall be set to the default action

36774578
lisp	scheme
in common lisp it is legal to take the car and cdr of aka nil car is and similarly for cdr
this is not the case in scheme

36775475
atom-editor	sublimetext
first please keep in mind that neither sublimetext nor atom-editor are ides they are code editors and as such will not have all the bells and whistles that an ide like dreamweaver will have built in
at least with sublimetext and as far as i know with atom-editor as well the file tree view on the left only displays local files or those on mapped network drives

36775520
azure	hdinsight
here are the options for big data services in azure azure data lake analytics currently has only u-sql jobs and not spark
azure hdinsight supports spark jobs

36778795
erlang	elixir
although erlang knowledge shouldn t be necessary to use elixir such omissions are a common mistake when people document software that is derived as elixir is from erlang
from page 2 basic types of the getting started documentation note functions in elixir are identified by name and by number of arguments arity

36779703
innodb	tokudb
engine innodb will create you an xtradb table
tokudb is not at all supported on homebrew mac os x in any way and likely will not even compile

36781918
androidviewclient	adb
uiautomator tests must be run from adb so you won t get rid of it. then you still need your computer to run the tests so it would not be a big difference to run androidviewclient culebra generated tests on the device when you still need adb to run the other tests
having said that perhaps there s a way using sl4a although i haven t tried it. as androidviewclient culebra tests are entirely in python and they depend on very few modules perhaps there s a chance

36782285
opera	firefox	firefox	safari
tested on both firefox and google-chrome but should work on safari and opera too
gm_notification is not yet supported in greasemonkey firefox

36783421
vbo	normals
i also can t tell if you want interleaved vertex data in a single vbo or not
what you currently have packs all of the vertex positions in first then all of the texture coordinates and finally all of the normals

36784468
swift	objective-c
i faced this compilation error in xcode version 7.3 7d175 swift project
the following is the scenario declared objective-c protocol in swift class in another class that implements this protocol one of the non-optional methods is not implemented implementing the method solved the problem for me

36785794
postgresql	mysql
i m not sure about your postgresql query
your question title is mysql - how to get data.

36785850
google-chrome	firefox
in my case i was using google-chrome
i tested it firefox and the animations did not stop

36786830
libstdc++	libc++
it was accepted through libstdc++ 4.6 however i do not have version numbers for libc++
c++14 gains the desired specializations but they are not implemented as of libstdc++ 5

36789426
realloc	malloc
here s is automatic storage and realloc is meant to reallocate the dynamic allocated memory by calling malloc or other allocatin functions
so you cannot call realloc on s calling it would results ub so crash is no surprise

36792349
inline	inlining
okay let s make the arguments variable by reading them from input the function is still inline
there s just no sense in not inlining the method

36792401
dictionary	map
suppose the json snippet you posted is a chunk of jsonarray in following format all you need to do is where yourdata variable is data downloaded from network casted to nsdata format 2 create outlets to these three labels in your custom tableviewcell 3 for each cell set these labels inside func tableview tableview uitableview cellforrowatindexpath indexpath nsindexpath method as follows 4 i suppose you will need more cells than just one then store many dictionary in array and access each element like this
since the question is very broad and doesn t specify what exactly is the problem here the general steps are 1 map your json to dictionary nsdictionary

36793290
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i think that you should put that uinavigationcontroller in front of the uiviewcontroller that holds your uitableview
the back button is not being shown because in the current uinavigationcontroller there is only the cell detail screen so it has nothing to go back to

36795591
rpm	yum
the rpm itself now does not support transaction
it is left for tools built on top of rpm yum and dnf

36800879
uilabel	uibutton
this was solved by adding uilabel to the stack view instead of buttons
using the same constraints this view hierarchy with the uilabel scrolls but the uibutton does not

36800879
uilabel	uibutton
using the same constraints this view hierarchy with the uilabel scrolls but the uibutton does not
i m confused by this issue as the uibutton do seem to have an intrinsiccontentsize used by the stack view

36801304
dictionary	map
if ordering does not matter create a dictionary of integer to integer
java calls this a map

36801574
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i appreciate this isn t really an answer but it s a bit too detailed for a comment the list of options only renders at all on google-chrome opera and android anyway
in firefox it s just a colour-wheel and in internet explorer safari edge ios windows phone and opera mini it s a horribly non-user-friendly textbox into which the user has to type the hex codes with no default options provided

36801710
addition	multiplication
the only reason that the loop has to execute at all is that repeated floating-point addition is not exactly equivalent to multiplication
if all the local variables are changed to integers where repeated addition is exactly equivalent to multiplication the loop is eliminated entirely which translates roughly back into julia as that s a little redundant since the body could be simplified to which could in turn be changed to just 28n since we don t care about negative values of n but it s still much faster than executing a loop

36809266
awt	swing
java awt hasn t been discontinued so it s unlikely that swing will be discontinued
if companies have existing swing projects it s usually not worthwhile financially to convert them to javafx

36811920
spaces	delimiter
str.split is a special case and any whitespace is supported not just spaces but tabs newlines formfeeds etc.
that s because splitting on arbitrary whitespace is a very common operation it has been folded into the generic str.split delimiter functionality

36812685
primes	modulus
note that you need to keep this precomputed array in its full integer precision as you do not know during precomputation which primes you will be using. the precomputation code is and then for each case you compute
one simple 2 speed up can come from changing the code to this only does one modulus operation per iteration

36812922
sse	avx
this notion of warp is very similar to the simd instructions of cpus that have sse 2 or 4 entries or avx 4 or 8 entries capability
the avx operations will also operate on a group of values and different lanes of this vector unit may not do different operations at the same time

36813828
strdup	malloc
additionally as others have observed it is worse than pointless to malloc memory for and then overwrite the resulting pointer with the result of strdup
not only do you then allocate more memory than you need but you also leak the memory obtained via the malloc

36814478
onclicklistener	onitemclicklistener
you must register onclicklistener on view in getview method
with custom adapter onitemclicklistener does not work

36822529
nsstring	nsobject
then the values 1 and 2.88 were converted to nsnumber and a to nsstring so that they can be stored in that array because int s string s and double s are not nsobjects
nsnumber and nsstring are subclasses of nsobject

36823113
google-chrome	firefox
properties that are unable to be animated are ignored in these rules with the exception of animation-timing-function the above extract would imply that the behavior in firefox is correct whereas the one in google-chrome isn t but as boltclock points out in this answer the spec s editor s draft has been updated and the updated text seems to imply that google-chrome s behavior is the correct one
maybe firefox will change the behavior someday but since this spec has not reached maturity it may take time

36823250
opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
you are using webkit only features such as -webkit-background-clip text and this is why it is going to work only on google-chrome safari and opera
unfortunately it doesn t look like there is a similar feature for ie or firefox

36823706
prepare	execute
use prepare statements or pdo with prepare statements
also make sure that this conditional statement does fire up if your submit button does not hold the submit name attribute and all other post arrays then nothing in there will execute

36823908
ubuntu	linux
my ubuntu installation on this notebook does not have caja
some linux distributions might have something different to serve this role whatever xfce uses

36824045
factors	mean
to understand it better introduce fake measurements which slightly differ from the real ones for instance this way now your output might look like not exactly as i introduced some randomness indeed you still give glm one intercept and 89 factors df to choose but you ask it to fit 180 values 1 intercept and 179 df what you should do _ unless you ask the dentists to do 90 extra measurements is to choose a simpler model
i suppose you are not interested in evaluating dentists but only techniques methods alloys and temperatures so write and the result will be this tells you the simpler model so much more about your numbers mean square 53238.539 than the error it does not explain _ mean square 13695.006 that it is extremely improbable less than 0.01 probable that this is by chance

36828896
bash	subshell
with that out of the way here s the bash code that shows the proper form of the conditional generally consider using shellcheck.net to find syntax problems in your shell code
in your specific case as you point out in a comment shellcheck.net wouldn t have helped however ... as a conditional passed to if is valid in principle for executing a command whose exit code to test although enclosing in ... is typically not needed for that because all that does is run the command in a subshell

36829398
profiling	debugging
anyway here i show you steps to port the todorest-project to uwp unloading ios and droid project will make this easier uninstall all nuget packages from portable and winphone81 project change portable class profiling to profile111 uncheck wp8 silverlight as target now you can reinstall xamarin.forms and newtonsoft.json on portable project uninstall was necessary to change profiling - which was necessary because it raised some errors here remove app.config from winphone81 project add a project.json file to winphone81 project and put in following content save everything and close winphone81 project in file explorer go to folder and edit package.appxmanifest exchange package tag by following remove .
and add following instead edit todorest.winphone81.csproj in first replace by this change projecttypeguids to on every propertygroup with replace windows_phone_app in defineconstants by windows_uap save reload project in visual studio edit mainpage.xaml and change to and forms namespace to using xamarin.forms.platform.uwp from .winrt here i had to restart vs2015 for any reason as it did not notice the project.json start project and debugging

translation	localization
for content translation in wordpress you can chose between two qtranslate free plugin wpml commercial plugin each one has its strengths and weaknesses comparison comparing wpml to free and paid alternatives
you can t translate content of posts or pages with something based on .po .mo files because it is only for theme or plugin localization but not for multi language content

36831524
ionic	angular
you may use a decent mobile framework like ionic and use ng-click it automatically solves the problem for you because it includes ngtouch
if you prefer not to use a big framework like angular you may use zepto.js and use to listen for tap events

if swift 3.0 toolchain is not installed on your ubuntu download extract and export it into path you won t be able to build perfect out of the box from master branch so i have made modifications to it so that the build process can be simplified to single make . depending on your swift 3.0 snapshot do the following for march 25 snapshot git clone for april 12 snapshot git clone -b swift.3.0-april and let s build it and finally you can launch either perfectserverhttp or perfectserverfcgi server variation sudo . perfectserverhttp
you cannot build in xcode for linux however you can just develop in xcode and then build sources on ubuntu

36837915
division	multiplication
if your application domain can give you useful bounds like that will not overflow then you can use the identity where signifies integer division as long as u is non-negative and d is positive otherwise you might run afoul of the leeway allowed for the semantics of operator
in any case you may have to separate out the signs of the operands and use unsigned operations in order to find more useful mechanisms that you can exploit - or to circumvent sabotage by the compiler like the saturating multiplication that you mentioned

36846096
hex	binary
if it is a hex encoding of the blowfish key then getbytes is entirely wrong since you need to hex decode it rather than the code page conversion you re currently doing
secretkeyspec needs a because a key is a binary value and cannot be stored a plain text

36850525
swift	objective-c
unfortunately this isn t something you can do in swift
in objective-c you could do tricks like this and the compiler would ignore anything that wasn t valid inside the macros that weren t excluded

36851642
union	distinct
you should use union all instead of union or as you proposed split the query
and you could rewrite your code still create the index please since union has a built-in distinct though i am not sure if you are aware of that you might want to use select distinct a._doc_id .

36851894
aggregate-functions	sum
msg 8120 level 16 state 1 line 4 column p.unitprice is invalid in the select list because it is not contained in either an aggregate-functions or the group by clause. when you want to select data that is not in your group by clause you need to use an aggregate-functions a function that transforms the collection of values that apply to a single record into a single value
in this case you should look into the sum function

36852430
swift	objective-c
now when you say iskindofclass or conformstoprotocol you re not in the swift world any more
you re talking to cocoa with objective-c

36854536
set	bag
using a set lets you efficiently check if an element exists in your collection but comes at the cost of preventing duplicate elements
a bag data structure generally permits duplicates so using a set as a backing data structure may not be acceptable for your use case

36857362
png	ico
png and jpg always work for me no matter the name
also make sure that your ico file is converted correctly and that you have not just renamed it to an ico file

36857514
google-chrome	firefox
unlike firefox and others google-chrome considers the head to be closed as soon as it encounters a div span or whatever other body -related markup
and since the link markups appear after google-chrome supposes they are in the body where they are not supposed to be

36860479
multiplying	multiplication
if y were an uint64_t you can split the original number to most-significant 32 bits shifted right by 32 and the least-significant 32 bits multiplying this by
then you do not right-shift the most-significant bits by 8 after the multiplication but left-shift by 24

36861688
profiling	debugging
this means for debugging your code you need to set debugging provisional profiling for debugging not adhoc type provisional profiling
i am replying on the basis of native app this can happen if you set adhoc provisional profiling to the debugging option in build settings of project

36863701
super	extends
if you used super you could put your objects there but you couldn t get them out but i suspect that the wildcard is completely unnecessary
according to the pecs rule your authorities collection is a producer of elements since it uses extends

36865661
implements	extends
now jax-rs and its annotation remove all the boilerplate you had to implements otherwise
as dmitry already answered summaserver uses jax-rs where the endpoint doesn t have to extends javax.servlet.http.httpservlet

36867241
inline	inlining
i fully agree with niels that the string parameters should not be inline in order to prevent sql injection
but i checked it with datanucleus 4.1.9 and derby db and to my surprise the log shows inlining for strings too

36868181
client-side	server-side
google charts is all client-side so there s nothing about pythonanywhere that would prevent it from working
however it s possible that your server-side code is behaving differently and returning values that your javascript isn t handling properly

36869709
fgets	getline
with fgets once you read a too-long line however you identify it you ll have to keep reading that line and discarding it until you reach a new line
in other words you have a need to track state which isn t needed if you use getline since it gives you the entire line and tells you how long it is you might want to strip any trailing newline characters from each line before copying the line to the array

36870968
tensorflow	cudnn
if it doesn t you can always disable the use of cudnn by setting the tf_use_cudnn environment variable to 0 before running tensorflow
cudnn is used to speedup a few tensorflow operations such as the convolution

36870968
tensorflow	cudnn
therefore tensorflow won t attempt to call cudnn when training this model
i m not sure that tensorflow will automatically fallback to a slower convolution algorithm when cudnn isn t available

36871498
super	extends
the good thing is that you don t have to call super if you don t want to - you still can return arbitrary objects from your es6 class constructors
in this case we d do but we can do even better and abstract this thing out of smth admittedly this creates an additional level of indirection in the inheritance chain but that s not necessarily a bad thing you can extends it instead of the native function

36871769
.htaccess	httpd.conf
in the section of your virtual host configuration file or in the main httpd.conf configuration file you must have something similar to the example below enabling overrides there are other ways to test if .htaccess is enabled if you do not have access to your site s configuration files
please refer to the .htaccess tutorial found on the apache software foundation website for additional information

36873172
super	extends
we could do this in a helper base class however this does does not become available until after the initial super call so it s a bit tricky
working example example requires modern browser or node --harmony . basically the base function classfunction extends will wrap the function constructor call with a custom function which is similar to .bind but allows binding later on the first call

36874433
namenode	hdfs
and eventually you format it using hdfs namenode -format
from that point on dfs does not refer to your own filesystem but the hdfs filesystem

36875097
onclick	onchange
as supravat s answer you need to pass this.value in the onclick function and you get the selected value in javascript
onchange is not working for radio button but it works for checkbox or select

36875756
hive	hdfs
you can start with this approach and build optimized structures for slow popular queries later 3 hive is slow it s outdated by impala and spark sql
choice is not easy sometimes we use rule of thumb impala is good for queries without joins if all your data stored in hdfs hive spark has bigger latency but joins are reliable it supports more data sources and has rich non-sql processing capabilities like mllib and graphx 4 keep it simple store you raw data master dataset de-duplicated and partitioned we use time-based partitions

36877280
swift	objective-c
swift is certainly not the only recently designed language to go for this design for instance rust and go also in their own ways also require explicitly describing the error paths in your code
in objective-c the unchecked exception feature exists but is largely used only for communicating programmer errors with the notable exception of a few key cocoa classes such as nsfilehandle which tends to catch people out

36877280
swift	objective-c
technically you do have the ability to raise objective-c exceptions in swift with the use of nsexception name somename reason somereason userinfo nil .raise as is explained in this excellent answer to this question arguably a duplicate of your question
you really shouldn t raise nsexceptions though not least because you have no objective-c exception catching language feature available to you in swift

36877280
swift	objective-c
you really shouldn t raise nsexceptions though not least because you have no objective-c exception catching language feature available to you in swift
apple s error handling in swift 2.0 document explains the rationale clearly

36879024
pthreads	fork
the original pthreads standard left the behavior of setting sigchld to sig_ign unspecified
note that even though the default disposition of sigchld is ignore explicitly setting the disposition to sig_ign results in different treatment of zombie process children. for the two case in the op the 1st code keeps fork in the parent no matter it succeeds or not and the resulted children will exit immediately since the return value will be 0

36897300
ionic	angular
i have been a little verbose in explaining exactly how i did it because i know that like me there are lots of developers still getting a grip in ionic 2 and angular 2 it costs tons of hours to learn a platform and with issues like this you can literally spend days trying to figure out things i hope this solution work for you and btw i know that it may be obsolete by now since ionic 2 beta 6 was just released my advise is for you to test both solutions first the one in the forum and if that one doesn t work this one worked for me and i hope it may make things work for you as well
in the official ionic 2 forum i found that you should inject it into the app itself then import it in the page to use it

36897300
ionic	angular
in the official ionic 2 forum i found that you should inject it into the app itself then import it in the page to use it
this is because ionic doesn t use the same process as angular 2 for bootstrapping your app and the app decorator doesn t provide the ability to create singleton services that are automatically available to all pages and components in your application

36899447
strcpy	strncpy
if you use strcpy and the target array isn t big enough you get undefined behavior
with strncpy or strncat you get defined behavior the value is quietly truncated

36904085
equals	gethashcode
and when you override the right equals method you should in good practice implement gethashcode and use gethashcode to determine if the objects are truly equals
in your case you won t have an issue not overriding gethashcode as you are basing eqaulity on two integers being the same in another copy of the intvector2 and you can t really compute an integer hash code for that as x and y are both integers

36911111
email	dkim
try send email from know host in gmail checks dkim posted by and spf signed by record in dns server to email host
if email host don t have a dkim record email may be not supplied

36913003
hive	hdfs	namenode	hdfs
when you add jar from hdfs you use the following statement add jar hdfs namenode user hive warehouse abc.jar
you are not notifying that you are adding the jar from hdfs

36918045
profiling	benchmarking
we can get rid of the call to descendants like this now if you profiling this you ll find some marginal performance boost with the more complex solutions
here s the results of a fairly basic benchmarking i put together first column is without compiler optimizations second column is with compiler optimizations method mean o- mean o+ first 0.1468333 0.1414340 elementat 0.1452045 0.1419018 no linq 0.1334992 0.1259622 while loop 0.0895821 0.0693819 however saving a few processor cycles usually isn t your biggest concern in enterprise-level applications

36918108
google-chrome	safari
do verify if this is indeed the issue first by testing it on google-chrome
from this feature is not supported in ie 9 and below it is partially supported in the following browsers safari -- partial support refers to lack of notice when form with required fields is attempted to be submitted

36918108
opera	safari
partial support in opera mini refers to only supporting the css pseudo classes
in short safari won t block submission even if required fields are not filled.you will need to use javascript to get this feature in safari

36919107
super	self	super	implements
you can always find out which child-class called the method with self.__class__ or self.__class__.__name__ resolving it is quite simple replace your super -calls with super bar self .__init__ in python3 to avoid these mostly unnecessary hardcoding of classes in super it s also possible to use super .__init__ that will always call the method on the next parent class that implements it
there are really seldom cases where the parent class of your current class is not the next parent class resolved by the super call

36923397
bash	subshell
from man bash each command in a pipeline is executed as a separate process in a subshell
since variables aren t transferred to the subshell p3 isn t accessible there

36923403
coalesce	nvl
the coalesce takes the login date first and falls back to the create date if that is null or you could use nvl instead of course
you could also do first and order by desc - the result is the same if there are no nulls anyway and it looks like there shouldn t be but last feels more intuitive when you want the latest date i think. demo using your data in a cte with list_users user_id login_id create_date login_date as select 101 test1 date 2016-04-24 null from dual union all select 102 test1 date 2016-04-24 date 2016-04-29 from dual union all select 103 test2 date 2016-04-25 null from dual union all select 104 test2 date 2016-04-26 null from dual union all select 105 test3 date 2016-04-27 date 2016-04-28 from dual union all select 106 test3 date 2016-04-27 date 2016-04-29 from dual union all select 107 test4 date 2016-04-28 date 2016-04-29 from dual select min user_id keep dense_rank last order by coalesce login_date create_date as user_id login_id from list_users group by login_id order by user_id

36925380
coalesce	isnull
rather than check if segement and assess_year are not null and not in separate statements you can combine them into an if segement and assess_year are text type values otherwise you will have to use coalesce ... to accomplish the same thing
isnull ... can be replaced with coalesce ... if preferred

36927911
wildfly	jboss
for eap 7 it will be wildfly 10.x as ozoli wrote
jboss eap 7 not sure about wildfly 10 has a feature which takes your old standalone.xml and converts it to the new configuration - namespaces subsystems

36930710
express	node.js
npm install -g express npm install -g express-generator
if still its not working re-install the node.js and start express install process again

36932984
apache	nginx
apache config refers to a separate virtualhost not shown here nginx config php7.1 - old answer - i know you made it work but i came across this post when i had this problem myself and after solving it wanted to share my solution
i m not using laravel but have a php backend on an apache server

36933260
build.gradle	gradlew
the only solution that comes to mind is to get a difference of tasks after the plugin is applied build.gradle this will print tasks that were added by idea plugin idea tasks cleanidea cleanideamodule cleanideaproject cleanideaworkspace idea ideamodule ideaproject ideaworkspace you can play a bit with this code and build an acceptable solution
i m afraid it is not possible because of the nature how gradlew plugins are applied

36938444
daemons	systemd
for more discussion on that matter see make daemons start up with linux option 4 best you said no cron but it really is the best option
in particular it would consume no systemd resources for the 6 days 23 hours and 59 minutes when it does not need to running

36939725
profiler	gprof
you could also choose a profiler that is able to work with parallel programs instead
this article says one problem with gprof under certain kernels such as linux is that it doesn t behave correctly with multithreaded applications

36943645
bower	npm
remove all installed versions of cordova and ionic sudo npm uninstall -g ionic cordova bower critically clean the npm cache npm cache clean install from scratch sudo npm install bower cordova ionic -g note do not install nodejs version from ubuntu 14.04 lts repository because is outdated
cleaning the npm cache helped in my case

36946031
junit	jmockit
short answer you cannot easily fix this because jmockit has a faulty junit dependency
to fix it you need to fix jmockit first

36946031
junit	jmockit
through com.android.support.test runner because one of its dependencies is the junit library which is the proper way to add junit support
a normal fix would be to exclude one of the following exclude the junit dependency for jmockit this doesn t work because junit is not defined as a proper dependency

36946031
junit	jmockit
a normal fix would be to exclude one of the following exclude the junit dependency for jmockit this doesn t work because junit is not defined as a proper dependency
junit merely pasted in the class file in its own project

36946031
junit	jmockit
exclude the junit dependency for com.android.support.test runner we can do this but this will cut out all the other classes from the junit library that jmockit did not put in their project
this will effectively break any other junit code you use

36946135
clang	llvm
you can do this with the cuda support of clang 3.8
first compile your cuda code to emit llvm example on windows with cuda 7.5 installed then use the generated ll to build the callgraph with opt opt.exe main.ll -analyze -dot-callgraph note that opt is not part of the default binary distribution you may need to build it yourself i had a 3.7.1 build and it has been able to manage the ll from 3.8

36951761
aggregate-functions	sum
in your select you have an aggregate-functions sum and a set of column name the error tell you that you have not specified the correct list of column name in group by clause
could be you should add more columns name in group by probably related to the profile_details opportunity_conditions table you have also opportunity.id opportunity_conditions.money opportunity.mantaghe why the if you need sum you must add sum to all column sum opportunity.id sum opportunity_conditions.money sum opportunity.mantaghe otherwise if thes are normal columns you should use the normal sintax without opportunity.id opportunity_conditions.money opportunity.mantaghe i have tried to rewrite a possible query with group by on the essential column name i hope group by opportunity

36952693
realloc	malloc
you need to malloc and copy the buffer for each line it goes without saying that you should be null -checking the value returned by realloc before assigning it back to words
the problem is not the realloc but what you assign to pointers that you allocated the buffer is the same pointer all the time so you end up with the last string read into the buffer

36954493
uicollectionview	uipageviewcontroller
a customized uicollectionview is probably the best starting point for what you want
a uipageviewcontroller will not do what you want

36954858
union	distinct
the union part is a replacement for distict
mysql seems to translate distinct into a group by statement which doesn t perform well

36958462
udp	tcp
not knowing much about c# and sslstream but udp is a datagram protocol and it does not guarantee that packet delivery order and even can cause duplicate delivery
tcp instead is a stream protocol which guaranteed delivery etc

36958462
udp	tcp
tls works only on top of a protocol like tcp and not on top of udp
for udp you would need to use dtls instead

36959102
strcpy	malloc
the key step you seem to want to perform in the loop inside is you can accomplish the same thing with a malloc initialize strcpy sequence but that s a bit silly when stdrup is ready-made for the same task
do not forget to check its return value however or in your original code the return value of malloc in case memory allocation fails

36962247
floating-point	fractions
you are performing int divisions to try to compute floating-point quotients for comparison and this will give you many false positives
really it s questionable to use floating-point at all because most fractions are not exactly representable as double s

36963051
swift	objective-c
and selector method works fine in earlier versions of swift the compiler would not help you in this situation so your code would compile
but you would have crashed when the message arrived and objective-c couldn t find the method

36963753
keras	tensorflow
if you need to deploy and distribute this easily you can look into self-contained python installations like anaconda but your best bet may be to avoid keras and use the c++ interface to caffe or tensorflow
i wouldn t recommend tensorflow since using it from c++ isn t standard

36968043
multiplication	modulo
also when adding the digits the maximum sum of 2 digits alone is 18 meaning a max outgoing carry of 1 even with an incoming carry of 1 the maximum sum is 19 so still a max carry of 1 the outgoing carry is independent of the incoming carry except when the sum of the 2 digits is exactly 9 adding them up in the text below all variables represent a single digit and adjacency of variables simply means adjacent digits not multiplication
the operator denotes the sum modulo 10

36969048
apache	nginx
you could do apache setenv db_pass dbpassword123 in your vhost nginx fastcgi_param db_pass dbpassword123 example apache vhost and fetch the variable db_pass in laravel with
linux system variables cannot be access through php apache

36970414
ecj	javac
the reason behind ecj emitting more detailed line information is to enable a better debugging experience where it s easier to step into a method call on the second line of the complex expression
ecj doesn t have an option to emit simpler line information nor does javac have the opposite option

36972377
express	koa
this code is similar to using passport with express as that s all passport needs to manage authentication through a session
disclaimer i m not familiar with koa but i am with express and passport. i ve looked through the link you provided and here s how they use koa-generic-session with passport

36973936
queue	fifo
you will need a queue for this but you will need to extend it
the default c# queue is fifo exactly the semantic you want but does not subscribe to limits the way your code currently handles them

36975144
uiview	subviews
you have probably declared the uiview iboutlet as weak var in slidelefttransitionfromview calling view.removefromsuperview removes the view from view heirarchy and am pretty sure your view gets deallocated since it is a weak var and not part of the layout anymore
therefore you dont see it when you try to add it again as subviews later on

36977459
udp	tcp
aside and i am a game developer and understand the need to use udp udp is not a good choice here instead of tcp
udp is good for small real-time data not large one-off data

36980527
matplotlib	colormap
for your example this would lead to figure result of course you can use any other matplotlib color
since setting a single color is not yet implemented you can simply create your own colormap with only one color

36988041
swift	objective-c
realm files are very platform independent so if you simply rewrote the objective-c model classes in swift as long as the model properties and types were exactly the same it should still simply work
as i understand it realm swift isn t exclusive for pure swift projects but if you do use it in an ios app you can t make any calls to it from any objective-c code

36988041
swift	objective-c
as i understand it realm swift isn t exclusive for pure swift projects but if you do use it in an ios app you can t make any calls to it from any objective-c code
so if you plan to move all of your realm code to swift then it should be okay

36988166
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
since composer packages aren t case-sensitive hyphens or dash are used as an alternative to camelcace notation note that package names are case-insensitive but it s encouraged to use a dash - as separator instead of camelcased names
source class names can t contain hyphens but are case-sensitive

36993467
udp	tcp
udp does not guarantee that your packets will land where they were sent
tcp will at least try its best to do that

36994314
clang	llvm
i think you can check for it using #if defined __clang__ # if __has_feature cxx_atomic # define clang_cxx11_atomics 1 # endif #endif then in your code i can only say i think because cxx_atomic is not documented at clang language extensions
however it shows up on a search of the llvm site cxx_atomic site llvm.org

36997278
boost	stl
to be sure you don t get locked with windows make sure at least it s not exhaustive you don t use any win32 api prefer cross plateforme libraries like boost for instance for network file system access... you don t use 3rd party libraries only available for windows don t use cstring or anyother microsoft class
prefer stl

37008802
daemons	systemd
that is not a good reason to close stdout and stderr if you are writing a daemons according to
you should let a daemons manager such as daemons tools runit s6 nosh openrc and systemd handle the redirection

37009159
persistent	transient
if you have persistent key material option 1 needs more eeprom but you have a significant time boost because you call init only once when key material is generated or imported
therefore option 2 is not desirable if you have transient key material option 1 needs more eeprom and time boost is almost non-existent because you need to call init anyway

37010735
bower	npm
in order to add client-side modules to your ionic angularjs app you should use bower and not npm
npm should only be used to install modules that are part of the development build deployment processes

37010802
opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
opera probably matches chrome-behaviour not tested safari has basic wheel-events and supports the proprietary yet kinda great gestureevents original answer as of april 2016 the pinch-zoom gesture is supported in very different ways in different browsers google-chrome sends mousewheel -events with mozilla is discussing matching chrome-behaviour in modern safari 9.1 gesture-events can be used and edge is unlikely to handle it at all
update may 2017 google-chrome has implemented the new wheel-event

37011654
express	node.js
express is not needed in my opinion
if you are just going to use websockets and and no routing besides loading the actual application then i d say just use the native http client in node.js and make everything go through socket.io

37013568
uicollectionview	uitableview
each reuse will simply change the values being displayed and reload the associated uicollectionview s and uitableview s
horizontal uicollectionview as the root each uicollectionviewcell contains a detail uiviewcontroller each detail uiviewcontroller contains a uitableview uitableview contains the pull to refresh each uitableviewcell is a different section of the detail screen image gallery tabs overview each image gallery uitableviewcell contains a uicollectionview each uicollectionviewcell contains each image this biggest performance related issue will be to make sure that all of the above view hierarchy is only constructed once not in each cell reuse

37015763
theano	lasagne
you should be able to install theano just fine even without a nvidia card
theano doesn t explicitly require a gpu to be present although some lasagne layers do and falls back to using numpy if one isn t present

37017433
queue	fifo
while the queue itself is fifo you can t predict the sequence in which those other events such as inspecting the dequeued items will occur
the items will be dequeued fifo but you may or may not be able to observe what comes out of the queue in that order

37017433
queue	fifo
the items will be dequeued fifo but you may or may not be able to observe what comes out of the queue in that order
the different threads may not perform that inspection or output in exactly the same order in which they removed items from the queue

37017433
queue	fifo
the different threads may not perform that inspection or output in exactly the same order in which they removed items from the queue
in other words it s going to happen fifo but it may or may not always look like it

37017532
persistent	transient
other fields can be declared explicitly as transient using either the java transient modifier which also affects serialization or the jpa transient annotation which only affects persistent the above entity class contains only transient non persistent entity fields with no real content to be stored in the database
add transient annotation transient fields transient entity fields are fields that do not participate in persistent and their values are never stored in the database similar to transient fields in java that do not participate in serialization

37017532
persistent	transient
add transient annotation transient fields transient entity fields are fields that do not participate in persistent and their values are never stored in the database similar to transient fields in java that do not participate in serialization
static and final entity fields are always considered to be transient

37019065
bufferedreader	bufferedwriter	bufferedreader	filewriter
other things you can consider depending on the need generally not recommended enable autoflush when creating bufferedreader it will be useful in cases like when writing to sockets and you expect a real time communication
not generally useful when writing to files. bw new bufferedwriter filewriter true autoflush

37022487
ioexception	filewriter
throws ioexception if the named file exists but is a directory rather than a regular file does not exist but cannot be created or cannot be opened for any other reason
from the documentation it is clear it does not gives exception for the wrong file name supplied to filewriter it rather creates new file if it is not present

37022491
sctp	udp
you won t see sctp because it is encapsulated under dtls udp
but sctp isn t used to init the connection

37024003
build.gradle	gradlew
you could use android plugin version 2.1.0 in your build.gradle you need to install gradlew 2.13 on your machine
android plugin 2.0.0 and upper does not work with gradlew version below 2.9 included

37027139
uiview	subviews
firstly you cannot add an uiviewcontroller as a subviews the method expects a uiview and you are adding a uiviewcontroller
secondly adding subviews was used in ios 4 and earlier now you add a view controller as rootviewcontroller

37029614
swift	objective-c
the pure objective-c classes contain the prefix the pure swift classes do not
depending on the language of your project you will use either the objective-c or the swift implementation of realm

ssl	https
to use https first set up a cert reference in applicationmanifest.xml then set up an endpointbindindpolicy in the servicemanifestimport section of application manifest and finally reference the cert in your endpoint config in servicemanifest.xml you can use the same cert to secure your cluster and provide ssl to users but i would recommend a different cert so that you re not handing out your server cert to clients for cluster authentication
edit one could also use azure application gateway which supports ssl offloading

queue	fifo
the specification clearly says channels act as fifo queue
if the values coming out of the channel are not fifo then this is a bug in the channel implementation

37033390
client-side	server-side
the blog post cited only argues that a specific web application scenario involving a combination of client-side mvvm as implementend by knockout.js with server-side mvvm doesn t work well with jsf
it doesn t say anything about server-side mvvm

knitr	latex
rstudio version 0.99.896 knitr version 1.12.3
given the almost identical error message i tried following scoa s suggestion but putting that line in the yaml header did not change the error so for whatever reason knitr wasn t looking there to determine the latex engine

37034377
knitr	latex
given the almost identical error message i tried following scoa s suggestion but putting that line in the yaml header did not change the error so for whatever reason knitr wasn t looking there to determine the latex engine
however next to the knit pdf button in the control bar is a settings menu that allows you to specify the latex ending in the advanced pane

lisp	scheme
common lisp is a lisp2 and it that means there are different namespaces for identifiers in operator position and identifiers in other positions
this cannot be done in scheme since with square square both of the square identifiers point to the exact same object

37040567
opennlp	stanford-nlp
i found it easier to get off the ground with opennlp especially working from clojure as i do but ended up using freeling because it has more tools and of course access to many more languages
i m assuming that by shallow parser you mean a phrasal chunker as described here stanford-nlp does not offer a shallow parser and a dependency parser is not a that

37042551
google-chrome	firefox
you are getting this error because you had not installed the google-chrome driver for selenium on your machine
selenium by default provides the driver for firefox so when you use the webdriver for firefox it won t rise any error

37042965
tostring	string.format
please also note the tostring calls on all those parameters are surplus default call anyway
that is so totally not a string.format issue that it is not funny

37043176
ssl	https
your question is light on details but here are the two likely guesses if you want your ssl server to work by default when users type then your server needs to be running on port 443 not port 80
that s the default port number reserved for https connections and is the port number that the browser will try if the user just enters a url

37054078
ubuntu	linux
i suspect this is because the binary was compiled on ubuntu not on amazon linux
i also setup amazon linux that aws lambda based on red hat actually runs on

37054723
division	multiplication
in particular if you look at the source code for long_lshift in the case of a small but positive left shift a 2-digit integer object is always created if only to have its length truncated to 1 later my comments in integer division you didn t ask about the worse performance of integer floor division compared to right shifts because that fit your and my expectations
but dividing a small positive number by another small positive number is not as optimized as small multiplication either

37060291
ubuntu	linux
couple of years ago i was hoping to use windows sourcetree on a git repo on my local dev server ubuntu vm instance on my local system over a samba map but it was not to be
i still use the vm for the dev server as i find it terribly frustrating to work in windows with environments that weren t designed to run in it not to mention that the production environment is always linux

37060545
ssl	https
1 install https in wildfly or 2 tunnel via ssh into the remote machine and proxy your browser through it go to the admin console and turn off the ssl requirement realm settings - login - require ssl
this works because ssl is not required for local connections

37060611
pthreads	fork
this will work on a pthreads system using fork semantics for multiprocessing but not on a windows system that uses spawn semantics
fork semantics map the same memory into parent and child copy-on-write so if it s changed in one the data stays the same in the other

37068320
serializable	deserialization
connectionhandler is not serializable because it contains references to socket and serversocket which are not serializable
you would have to write your own serialization and deserialization methods to make it serializable

37074732
ssl	https
this is not an error at all it s information message regarding jmeter created a self-signed ssl certificate
due to security reasons jmeter prints some information regarding the certificate so you could decide whether to accept it or not when you ll open a page over https protocol in browser

37078032
onresume	onpause
if you want to check the connection right after resuming your app then call isonline in your activity s onresume method and show the alert message if the network is not available
also make sure to hide your alert message when activity goes to onpause via dialog.dismiss

37078751
super	extends	super	implements
you ll also need to add a super call to your constructor and use to define myfunction you re currently defining it as an instance member
the issue is more apparent if you remove things that might not be relevant to the error the problem is that you re using implements instead of extends

37080344
subtraction	addition
on that theme though note that the c bit for addition is the nb bit for subtraction logical not borrow therefore a subtraction which doesn t underflow will also set it and there s a real easy way to set the flags with a subtraction guaranteed not to underflow cmp r0 r0 but trickery aside if you want the flags in a specific state it s probably best to put the appropriate value there directly by the proper means msr cpsr_f #0x20000000
c is set to 1 if the addition produced a carry.

37082991
tlistview	tlistbox
your only other options i believe are to either instantiate a tswitch for each item and render it using the same method as above very sloppy i do not recommend figure out how to implement the drawing of the standard tswitch using styles again using the same method as above which is probably the best option for performance and visual adaption resort to a tlistbox instead depending on how you intend to use the list which would be very heavy on a large number of items i went a little more in-depth about the differences between a tlistview and a tlistbox in firemonkey in a separate question answer
you first have to keep in mind the whole design of the tlistview control

37083201
cpython	ironpython
a simple example taken from the documentation which shows you how to release and temporarily re-enable the gil using a different interpreter cpython has a gi while jython and ironpython do not
be careful as numerous c-libraries for high-performance computing may not work with ironpython or jython scipy flirted with ironpython support but dropped it long ago and it will not work on a modern python version

37084005
client-side	server-side
the client-side html code doesn t know about the db state change so that s why you are polling every second
if instead you want the server-side php code to tell you when the db state changes you need to use some form of websockets

37084871
hex	binary
the reason hex is seen quite a bit in code is simply that it allows the common 8-bit width of bytes to be represented with exactly and just 2 hex digits which is reasonably concise and not too hard for humans to get used to
it s easy enough to mentally convert back to binary while not losing track of which digits you re looking at the way you can with a 32-bit or 64-bit value in binary

37085792
arp	udp
you should also see though an arp request - see above - issued by the said dhcp client sta to check that the ip that it has just been offered by the dhcp server is indeed free because that s what the dhcp protocol mandate 1 if correctly implemented
another not so common but not so rare either traffic that you may see are the one that are inherently broadcast icmpv6 neighbour solicitations advertisement from sta running a modern os with dual ip stack dropbox lan discovery protocol and oh this can be quite noisy from regular pc sta upnp ssdp that s udp multicast on port 1900 ...and probably many more depending on the applications running in the sta or ap of course such as dhcp

37086246
cloudant	couchdb
you re probably better off sticking with cloudant until couchdb 2.0 is released rather than attempting to run it in production
no it s not possible to compile couchdb 1.6 with mango dreyfus and closeau because of changes made in the code base to support them

37087333
build.gradle	gradlew
please take a look at my build.gradle file edit the problem is with annotation please do one of these solutions delete runwith androidjunit4.class change runwith androidjunit4.class with runwith junit4.class it seems that there s no more androidjunit4.class in test packages
you may not have something in your gradlew dependencies

37088315
ssl	https
precaution-1 for more cautions for https and tomcat users in most cases urls running over http work fine but not when using https over ssl
this usually results in unicode non-ascii characters in an https url appear incorrect in the url and the served page contains numerous errors this occurs when the flag is not defined in the https connector definition in conf server.xml of the apache tomcat application server running jira

37088773
uiview	subviews
even though you create uiview and assign frame property it may not work
just create footer wrapper view using constructor uiview frame _ then if you are using xib file for footerview create view from xib and add as subviews to wrapper view

37088930
theano	keras	theano	lasagne
and using keras or lasagne is way simpler to develop nns then pure theano which was just side research project in montreal to support development of pylearn
they are built on top this does not mean theano cannot be used for the same purpose

37089321
wildfly	jboss
change to or simply replace 127.0.0.1 with your private ip configure from command line running the server from command line another alternative is running it directly from command line. by default jboss wildfly binding to localhost if you want change this you can execute standalone.sh -b 0.0.0.0 listen on all ip addresses of the machine if multihomed or if you want to listen on your ip standalone.sh -b your_private_ip ref wildfly - interfaces and ports wildfly - command line parameters
configure from eclipse if you want to set the ip from eclipse you should follow these steps changing the ip in the file standalone.xml doesn t work from eclipse because of the -b option which is set see more below... this are the steps to configure it on eclipse click on your wildfly server click on open launch configuration uncheck the always update arguments related to the runtime and then change your -b option with your_private_ip if you remove the option -b localhost you could configure it directly from the standalone.xml file see the section below for configuring it or simply instead of the 2

setcontentview	findviewbyid
inflates a new screen which is not at screen until you put it explicitly even adding it to a container part of the current view hierarchy or replacing the current content calling again setcontentview
accordingly to the layout you posted activity_search_actvity.xml i assume contains already a listview so get rid of the inflater and simply use findviewbyid to retrive the object part of the layout you set with setcontentview r.layout.activity_search_actvity

inline	inlining	inline-functions	inlining
from c++14 standard draft n3690 7.1.2 a function declaration 8.3.5 9.3 11.3 with an inline specifier declares an inline-functions
the inline specifier indicates to the implementation that inline substitution of the function body at the point of call is to be preferred to the usual function call mechanism. an implementation is not required to perform this inline substitution at the point of call ... formatting mine. there are compiler-specific options and attributes to enable disable inlining for all functions and do other related stuff

37093666
memcpy	malloc
you provided the content of payload to memcpy instead of it s address therefore the warning you get at compilation
you probably meant something like also there is a comment in your code stating that you are unsure whether you should use malloc or not

37094040
factors	matrix
for your model you can check what the fixed effect model matrix looks like by all your variables are factors so x will be binary
though model.matrix applies contrasts for each factors and their interaction it is still possible that x does not end up with full column rank as a column may be a linear combination of some others which can either be precise or numerically close

37095764
prepare	execute
original answer for improved performance call prepare and bindparam functions one time before entering the loop
it s not necessary to call prepare on the same sql statement multiple times. if we were using bindvalue instead of bindparam we would need to do the bindvalue immediately before the execute each time

37096301
lisp	prolog
for instance while 1 is very easily solved through the definition of a predicate examples are in common lisp defun is-gimnosperms y and is-plants y is-with_seeds y and it is relatively easy to write a generator 2 for instance to produce all gimnosperms you could write defun all-gimnosperms loop for y in all-plants when is-with-seeds y collect y given the following facts and rules defun all-plants oak cypress pine ginkgo ... defun all-with-seeds ginkgo ... defun is-with-seeds y member y all-with-seeds but in general it is much more complex to implement a general solver for a certain problem this is not in your example since the rule has only one parameter
actually the only reasonable approach to solve this problem is to define a general unifier and use that to implement a prolog interpreter

37097327
ubuntu	debian
you have installed libc++-dev on ubuntu 16.04 in the correct expectation that it ought to let you build with clang++ using libc++ and its headers for your standard library
it ought to but in the presence of or later standard it doesn t because of debian bug #808086 which you have run into

multiplying	multiplication	multiplying	division
you will get different answers when multiplying by a reciprocal versus dividing but in practice it typically does not matter and the performance gain is worthwhile
at most the error will be 1 ulp for reciprocal multiplication versus ½ ulp for division

37098035
boost	allocator
a couple of additional observations boost object_pool does not provide the allocator interface the standard library specifies for interoperability with containers
you might want to use boost pool_allocator instead i ve played with it a bit and doesn t seem to improve speed though but your mileage may vary

37098059
strcpy	strdup
strcpy tabb indexb taba indexa doesn t work at all program gets crashed possibly because is not initialized and contain null or invalid pointer
solution br allocate memory to tabb statically using a 2d array as or dynamically as or using strdup

37100530
jax-ws	jax-rs
for example you could use the jax-ws ri although your experience is not likely to be too much different than cxf axis
different web service technology rather than using soap you could use a restful framework like jax-rs

build.gradle	gradlew
in them as it appears you need to do you can do the following in your build.gradle file take a look at this section of the gradlew documentation for more information
edit if you d like to dynamically set up some of these properties as mentioned in a comment below you can create a properties.gradle file the name isn t important and require it in your build.gradle script

one has been added recently for postgresql but mysql is still lagging behind
alternative that does not involve mysql is to use redis

37110920
client-side	server-side
i m not sure if this is the complete answer you are looking for but it should help employee.query ... is not a promise itself but you can access the raw http promise like this resource is just a wrapper around http. and if you don t mind me saying so the idea of filtering your resources on the client-side the second you retrieve them does sound as if it works against the idea with api-resources to begin with
requesting a subset of employees sure sounds like an api-feature and should probably be implemented on the server-side

37110988
dictionary	map
notice how sum gave you 0 when there were no values in the dictionary just the 1 element as a label 1234 0
i m not sure about functions that can flatten dictionaries in such custom way but you can avoid the loops by using map given your dictionary you can flatten it into label sum

37110988
dictionary	map
i m not sure about functions that can flatten dictionary in such custom way but you can avoid the loops by using map given your dictionary you can flatten it into label sum
label sum... in one line which gives you map applies a function to all elements of an array in this case the values iterator for your dictionary

google-chrome	safari
mobile google-chrome seems to want to adapt this too although it is not sure if they will follow through
unfortunately this is intentional this is a well know issue at least in safari mobile which is intentional as it prevents other problems

g++	gcc
g++ -o3 -fdump-tree-all
if you take a look at .115t.cunroll you can see that the code is initially transformed into something like and the compiler with actual numbers can prove that each call to sqrt doesn t have side effects .125t.vrp2 if the number of iterations is large gcc doesn t perform loop unrolling unless forced with something like isn t smart enough to determine that a call to sqrt i doesn t have side effects but a small help is enough std sqrt std abs i

mp4	h.264
for those who find this question today still because they re trying to play m4v their software player won t let them and they need it converted to a real format and google sent them to this question m4v is not just mp4 with drm but can also be a pure video stream without any playback metadata
this may be the case when you use certain digital cameras you render video through adobe s media encoder with certain h.264 presets and other similar video-generating processes

37123725
multiplying	multiplication
result is of size d x m second part is again sum of n elements each being a matrix of m x m thus in total o nm 2 finally we compute product of d x m and m x m which is o dm 2 and again results in d x m matrix sigma 2new 1 nd sum ||xn-x|| 2 - 2e zn wnew xn-x + tr e zn zn wnew wnew again we sum n times this time 3 element sum - first part is just a norm thus we compute it in o d linear in size of vectors second term is multiplication of 1 x m m x d and d x 1 resulting in complexity of o md per each of iterations thus in total o nmd and last part is again about multiplying three matrices of sizes m x m m x d d x m thus leading to o m 3d n but you just need the trace and you can precompute wnew wnew thus this part is just trace of mxm times mxm matrices leading to o m 2 n in total you get o m 3 + o nmd + o m 2d + o m 2n and i suppose there is an assumption that m d n thus o nmd
let us go one by one e zn m -1 w xn - x m -1 can be precomputed thus you do not pay o m 3 everytime you need this kind of value but rather a single o m 3 cost at the end despite that it is multiplication of matrices of sizes mxm mxd dx1 which is o m 2d result is of size mx1 e zn zn sigma 2 m -1 + e zn e zn sigma 2 m -1 is just multiplication by constant thus linear in size of matrix o m 2 second operation is outer product of mx1 and 1xm vectors thus result is mxm again and takes o m 2 too result is m x m matrix wnew sum xn-x e zn sum e zn zn first part is n times repeated sum operation of multiplying dx1 matrix by 1xm thus complexity is o ndm

37128526
arp	icmp
depending on do you know the ip address of the pi there are two cases the pi has ip address and are known to your program you can just send any data to it an icmp ping packet the networking stack will send out arp requests for the address and when the pi respond with its mac address you can get it from the arp table which can be viewed by the command arp -n
the pi s ip is not known then you send a broadcast packet through the connected interface eth0 in this case for example ping -b -i eth0 255.255.255.255 the pi will also respond with its mac address and you can get it from the local arp table

37130968
google-chrome	firefox
since you already downloaded the webdriver please specify the path in the method call of google-chrome .like this hope it helps
this is because selenium by default provide the driver for firefox but not for google-chrome

37130968
google-chrome	firefox
this is because selenium by default provide the driver for firefox but not for google-chrome
if you look at the method calls firefox can be called with 0 arguments

37137341
pdfbox	itext
source code excerpts are from pdfbox 2.0.0 but at first glance do not seem to have been changed in 2.0.1 or the development trunk
using itext rups i can see that the dictionary keys are encoded with iso-8859-1 while pdfbox assumes they are unicode i guess

37141528
mtu	icmp
the problem was due to a unfavorable automatically choosen mtu mtu discovery that lead to fragmentation
as the page did not allow fragmentation the connection failed icmp can t fragment - type 3 code 4

37142060
ssl	https
google configured ssl certificate for appspot.com only for 3rd level domains for as per doc google does not issue ssl certificates for double-wildcard domains hosted at appspot.com
therefore with https you must use the string -dot- instead of . to separate subdomains as shown in the examples below

37149509
hex	binary
pipes on the other hand handle binary just fine. if you need to handle binary data in the shell do something like convert it to hex before storing it then back to binary for use
the problem is that the digest is in binary and specifically it contains a zero byte while the shell passes c-strings to its commands such as echo as arguments and those cannot contain zero bytes null characters

37149823
email	dkim
i couldn t work out how to enable authentication using the gmail api so i opted for using the google apps script function mailapp.sendemail instead as that does send authenticated email
i tried to do the same thing and asked a similar question and reached the conclusion that the problem is that inbox ignores structured data unless the email is authenticated using dkim to mitigate against spam

37152038
swift	objective-c
looking at mp4v2 documentation here is the definition of the macro to check for invalid handle #define mp4_invalid_file_handle mp4filehandle null the reason it cannot be used in swift is because it involves a null
in fact if you define something like #define my_null null in your objective-c ++ code and try to use it in swift swift will suggest that you use nil instead

37152255
uitapgesturerecognizer	uicontrol
using uiview and uitapgesturerecognizer instead of uicontrol when you click on rightcalloutaccessoryview only didclickgesturerecognizer will be called but your calloutaccessorycontroltapped cannot be invoked anyone
2.if you have a uicontrol as rightcalloutaccessoryview you can tap directly on mkannotationview.otherwise mkannotationview cannot be tapped

37153090
persistent	transient
this is happening due to below reason you have defined a association in your entity which is not yet persistent in the database and before persistent this association you are trying to flush the session.for example you have a collection association which has collection of transient instances so you have to persistent this collection first before flushing
for resolving this issue you have 2 options either manually persistent the collection in your code by calling session.save method

37154340
udp	tcp
coap is primarily used over udp so connections cannot be persisted so it would not really achieve the same goal
coap can also be used over tcp draft currently in progress which would then help if the initial problem was nat for example

37156336
swift	objective-c
for instance with realm swift you would write your model as
you re mixing types from the realm swift api object and realm objective-c api rlmarray in a way that s not supported

37157764
move	drag
in order to move a ui-sortable table row down i had to create a table with three rows then run this code in a cucumber step this would swap the first with the second row
my interpretation is that capybara does not drag far enough so i gave it a target beyond my actual target

37164447
hash-collision	key
basic premise is - true and 1 have same hashes and are equal to each other - that s why they cannot be separate key in hash table technically inequal object with same hashes may - but hash-collision decreases performance
now let s consider a bytecode this prints 0 load_const 0 true 3 load_const 1 yes 6 load_const 2 1 9 load_const 3 no 12 build_map 2 15 store_name 0 dic 18 load_const 4 none 21 return_value basically what happens is that dict literal is tokenized to key and values and they are pushed to stack

37165718
inline-functions	inlining
some particular implementations do things a little smarter so can actually inline-functions even in circumstances where they are not visible to the compiler
for example in a basic compile all the source files then link toolchain a smart linker may realise that a function is small and only called a few times and elect to in effect inline it even if the points where inlining occurs were not visible to the compiler because the statements that called the functions were in separate compilation units the function itself is in another compilation unit so the compiler would not do inlining

37165798
apache	nginx
if you are deploying with apache and mod_wsgi then restarting apache should work
if you are deploying with nginx or another server as a reverse proxy then restarting it will not work

37166418
ssl	https
as cloudfare states the http error response code 526 occurs when cloudflare is unable to successfully validate the ssl certificate on the origin web server and the cloudflare ssl configuration on the website is set to full ssl strict
in other words the cdn you ve setup in front of your server tries to reach your server through https however your ssl certificate is invalid maybe expiered or root ca not trusted by cloudfare cdn

37167431
multiplying	multiplication
why you need more than one thread if you add a debug message before waiting for multiplication you will see that the output may be made ec before multiplication result executing addone ... as you can see call to multiplying 2 2 just constructs a future containing a prescription of your computation but doesn t necessarily execute anything
here is how you can hit a deadlock first await.result mult duration.inf triggers the multiplying method and blocks the main thread

37170423
entity-relationship	diagram
your second diagram is commonly called an entity-relationship diagram
it doesn t distinguish entities from relationships rather the applications that produce these diagram tend to confuse tables with entities and relationships with foreign key constraints

37170886
serializable	deserialization
and since driveinfo is defined entirely by the name of the drive that s all that it s custom serializable code stores into the serializable stream
since you just want to dump the properties of driveinfo and do not care about deserialization you can disable use of iserializable by setting

37171507
factors	matrix
you could do i think two things went wrong with your method first apply converts the data frame to a matrix which doesn t store values as factors see here for more on this
also in a matrix every value has to be of the same mode character numeric etc.

37171564
spaces	delimiter
turning my comments into an answer first - taking the question why you need those quotes aside - i could reproduce your problem and found several possible solutions adding spaces at the begin and end of your cached variable using escaped double quotes instead of single quotes using your set .
cache ... example by setting policy cmp0053 switch introduced with cmake 3.1 but when setting this in the code i could also just do the quoting issue seems only to be a problem when called from command line then - if i do assume you may not need the quotes - you could pass the paths as a list a semicolon separated cmake list is expanded to parameters again with spaces as delimiter when used in a command with would give something like i also tried to add the verbatim option because all arguments to the commands will be escaped properly for the build tool so that the invoked command receives each argument unchanged

google-chrome	firefox
see google-chrome safari how to open the same window from different tabs or windows
in my experience this works perfectly and just like you re trying to do it with firefox and ie but not with google-chrome or safari

37175104
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in my experience this works perfectly and just like you re trying to do it with firefox and ie but not with google-chrome or safari
firefox and ie seem to use domain-specific namespaces for target names while google-chrome and safari seem to use browser tab-specific namespaces for target names so in these two browsers urlwindow as seen from tab a is different from urlwindow as seen from tab b

37175294
memcpy	memmove
memmove differs from memcpy in that the memory regions in memmove may overlap and it s therefore conceptually slightly less efficient
memcpy has the constraint that the two memory regions must not overlap

37175387
mathml	mathjax
one thing to note the nativemml output is browser-specific in the sense that mathjax will try to work around deficiencies in the mathml support of the various browsers
for example firefox doesn t support so mathjax will use alternative less meaningful markup when there are labeled equations

37175410
rsa	aes
normally one does not directly encrypt a message with rsa instead they encrypt an aes key or other symmetric key with rsa and use the aes key to encrypt the message
if your messages are really short you could use rsa directly but it won t work for long messages

37178062
translation	localization
if you want to globally disable all automatic field translation you can copy the values from fluent.data_include to fluent.data_exclude
a field type in this list will not be include for localization even if in fluent.data_include

division	multiplication
it s not the case with the modulo which generally implies far more operations computing the remainder of the integer division
afaik it is generally longer than a multiplication

matlab	simulink
tuning block parameters at every time step in a simulation simulink signal viewing using event listeners and a matlab ui obviously you need to change the simulation end time to inf or some large number
the short answer is you can t easily do that that s not how simulink works

37182154
matlab	simulink
the matlab workspace is read accessed at the beginning of the simulation and passed to the simulink engine and even if the values in the workspace change before the simulation is finished this is not taken into account by the simulink model running
there are ways to work around this but if you are a novice to matlab simulink be aware that these are fairly advanced techniques and i would advise to familiarise yourself with simulink first

37183206
symfony	silex
silex as example or symfony microframework and completely unsubscribe from dependency injection layer
symfony dependency injection so symfony not requirements for define all classes as services

37183598
aggregate-functions	sum
and by default sum function returns na if any of the input values are na then we do na.omit which throws away the rows with the sum as na which makes the aggregate-functions not to return aggregated sums for any months containing missing days
the code creates the data.frame with some mock data and does the aggregation by year and month with na.action na.pass if any month has a na value for precipitation na.pass ensures the sum function gets the na value too

37184294
udp	tcp
but udp is an unreliable protocol can loose data while websockets which uses tcp is not
this means that the messages are probably lost by a processes which reads or writes the udp data

37185665
inline	inlining
control transfers to the function it is executed and when it returns control passes back to the instruction following the call the compiler did inline the call and the body of the function code is present and execution simply continues into and through it
in the second case you wouldn t consider the inlining to have happened at runtime - it still happened at compile time when the code was generated

37191335
onresume	onpause
onactivityresult is being called on main thread but you can t access views from it for some reason probably views are not recreated at that point . so you should set flag that onactivityresult was called and than call your code in onresume
presenter has a reference to view only between onresume onpause

37191698
spaces	linefeed
50 does not allow two images to be side by side because the small spaces between the images which take the horizontal over 100
if the css removed the right and left margins and the images did not have the actual linefeed they might render two side by side

37192041
hive	hdfs
as an example if you create an external table called table_test in hive using hive-ql and link the table to file file then deleting table_test from hive will not delete file from hdfs
external table files are accessible to anyone who has access to hdfs file structure and therefore security needs to be managed at the hdfs file folder level

37192776
client-side	server-side
just put them directly in the client-side code like you would for any other string literal extension string.join | new filehelper .validfileextensions
the quotes are client-side not server-side

37194445
noexcept	throw
if you want to make what method to be trully noexcept then you have two choices copy content of stream to str variable inside copy constructor
then you will not be able to call what method to obtain exception message before you throw

37195297
bufferedreader	printwriter
read your data consistently using one bufferedreader
do not use printwriter unless you re actually printing something for someone to read through a pipe or tail

37199197
udp	tftp
udp puts the source and destination ports in the udp header and ip puts the source and destination addresses in the ip header
tftp doesn t specify what s in the ip header but that doesn t mean there s nothing in there

37201025
hex	binary
i could run this code on this processor i have chosen bare metal and could for example wrap it with this bootstrap .globl _start _start mov sp #0x8000 bl fun b . assemble and link and i get this for example i can convert that into a binary image that could be loaded into ram or flash depending for that processor and run 0000000 d902 e3a0 0000 eb00 fffe eaff 0001 e080 0000010 ff1e e12f 0000014 not using basic not using visual studio not running windows i can write this program compile and run it yes an exe from an exe and it produces the same binary file shown in a hexdump here 0000000 d902 e3a0 0000 eb00 fffe eaff 0001 e080 0000010 ff1e e12f 0000014 i could also just take a hex editor and just type those bytes in
and not use a language to create this binary file

37205099
google-chrome	safari
see for example input type email value in google-chrome with accented characters wrong here s an example of it happening without angular - try this in google-chrome so the short answer is no there s no way of stopping this via angular - and currently there doesn t appear to be a way to tell google-chrome not to do it either
it turns out it s not angular that s doing it it s google-chrome safari does not have the same behaviour haven t tested other browsers

37209427
queue	fifo
if you are asking about tasks submitted to different queue where the queue have the same qos value then the order of execution is not defined beyond tasks being executed in fifo order within their own queue
from the gcd reference concurrent tasks are dequeued in fifo order but run concurrently and can finish in any order

37209427
queue	fifo
so tasks submitted to a particular queue will be dequeued in fifo order
tasks submitted to a gcd queue do not have a priority relative to one another only the queue has a quality of service qos value

37210472
spaces	delimiter
filenames can include spaces and even control characters
spaces are default delimiter for shell expansion in bash and as a result of that from the question is not recommended at all

37210472
spaces	delimiter
spaces are default delimiter for shell expansion in bash and as a result of that from the question is not recommended at all
if find gets a filename with spaces the file.txt you will get 2 separated strings for processing if you process x in a loop

37210472
spaces	delimiter
if find gets a filename with spaces the file.txt you will get 2 separated strings for processing if you process x in a loop
you can improve this by changing delimiter bash ifs variable to r n but filenames can include control characters - so this is not a completely safe method

37211666
jar	war
if you are using embedded tomcat spring boot doesn t support using jsps in an executable jar with tomcat it should work if you use war packaging an executable war will work and will also be deployable to a standard container not limited to but including tomcat
an executable jar will not work because of a hard coded file pattern in tomcat

37213413
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
using kvo monitor the hidden property of the uinavigationbar so that we can 1 hide show our main uinavigationbar and 2 reset the top constraint i ended up with something like this the animations might need a little tweaking and it is hacky but it s better than not having this possibility. it should be possible to adapt this strategy to other scenarios without the uinavigationcontroller note if you have a crash when implementing the container view for the qlpreviewcontroller from a storyboard subclass the qlpreviewcontroller and implement the initializer
by mixing a bit out of the existing answers comments i was able to get this working for my use case i needed to display files inside a uinavigationcontroller and keep the ability of hiding showing the uinavigationbar when the file content is tapped based on the answer from lukas gross and the comment from nacross here s what i ended up doing add a subclass of qlpreviewcontroller as a child view controller

37216784
bash	subshell
one means to avoid this is to export the deactivate function in the shell that sources the activate script like so my output from the above follows pre-existing interpreter python is usr bin python virtualenv interpreter python is users chaduffy test.venv bin python deactivated-in-subshell interpreter python is usr bin python deactivated-in-child-shell w o export bash deactivate command not found deactivated-in-child-shell w export python is usr bin python assuming you ve fixed that let s run once more through using a subshell to scope deactivation to make it temporary
venv-dir activate this-runs-in-venv # minor performance optimization exec the last item in the subshell to balance out # ...the performance cost of creating that subshell in the first place. deactivate

37218250
rvm	bundler
as noted in source #1 below in order to fully utilize rvm i needed to run bash with bin bash --login
to achieve this i appended it to the bash on ubuntu on windows shortcut s target field like this now i can rvm use ruby-2.3.1 --default gem install rails and rails new banana however when bundler tries to run there is an error update 2016-06-03 the cat dev fd 63 no such file or directory error is reported to be fixed in an upcoming windows insider release 4 but this doesn t seem to be fatal

37218250
rvm	bundler
to achieve this i appended it to the bash on ubuntu on windows shortcut s target field like this now i can rvm use ruby-2.3.1 --default gem install rails and rails new banana however when bundler tries to run there is an error update 2016-06-03 the cat dev fd 63 no such file or directory error is reported to be fixed in an upcoming windows insider release 4 but this doesn t seem to be fatal
as a temporary workaround for the bundler error issuing chmod -r +t .bundle cache appears to do the trick and now you have a working rails installation 5

37218294
multiplying	multiplication
you calculate power n - 1 and power n - 2 and multiplying them but this does not take time
these values are computed separately and then multiplied taking t n - 1 + t n - 2 time assuming constant-time multiplication

37220435
google-chrome	firefox
the code does not run on ie or google-chrome cause they don t have a built in localhost feature
firefox does

37221078
ucma	ucwa
as such ucma is not available for skype for business online office 365
ucwa is a restful web api that acts on behalf of a single skype for business user

37221110
ucma	ucwa
ucma is not available for skype for business online for the reasons explained in this question and answer
ucwa is now available for skype for business online

37225583
bash	subshell
when you run bash directly just runs a.out in background as running binary a.out doesn t need a separate shell process
when you run bash must first fork and create a subshell as you can have series of commands inside and then the newly forked subshell runs a.out in a separate process

37225583
bash	subshell
when you run bash must first fork and create a subshell as you can have series of commands inside and then the newly forked subshell runs a.out in a separate process
so it is not that bash is creating 2 subshell for this

37226402
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
unchecked-exception are the sub classes of runtimeexception those exceptions don t need to be added explicitly in your method constructor description calling code doesn t have to manage it explicitly with a try catch block or by throwing it
checked exceptions are the sub classes of exception but not the sub classes of runtimeexception those exceptions need to be added explicitly in your method constructor description calling code have to manage it explicitly with a try catch block or by throwing it

37226402
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
checked exceptions are the sub classes of exception but not the sub classes of runtimeexception those exceptions need to be added explicitly in your method constructor description calling code have to manage it explicitly with a try catch block or by throwing it
depending of your need you will chose one of the two possibilities if you want to enforce calling code to manage it use checked exceptions otherwise use unchecked-exception

37226601
scipy	sympy
download install scipy from scientific python ubuntu debian sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy python-matplotlib ipython ipython-notebook python-pandas python-sympy python-nose fedora sudo yum install numpy scipy python-matplotlib ipython python-pandas sympy python-nose windows unofficial windows binaries for python extension packages scipy source
this happens when scipy is not installed

37228171
gson	jackson
or wrap gson calls to extract your person value replace gson.tojson person with gson.tojsontree person .getasjsonobject .get person .tostring
gson doesn t provide such mechanics note that it s not a principal constraint jackson provides it via jsonunwrapped annotation or serializationfeature.unwrap_root_value on mapper

37229251
bash	subshell
you can simply group the while loop and the echo statement together so they are both contained within the same subshell alternately you can structure your code to not need a pipe use processsubstitution also see the bash manual for details - man bash | less + process substitution
bash runs all commands of a pipeline in separate subshell s

37229815
hive	hdfs
you could use hive since impala shares the same metastore this should not be a problem
i assume that in the definition of the talbe status_logs the location is set as hdfs status_logs

37232517
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
string comparison with is case-sensitive
if you want to perform a case-insensitive comparison you can use strcasecmp notice that strcasecmp doesn t return a boolean it returns a number that indicates whether the first string is less than equal to or greater than the second

37237257
exponent	modulo
for the exponent and the modulo of those sizes i estimate based on timing experiments that brute force would have taken several months
since a duplicate of this question was asked under the python tag here is a python implementation of baby step giant step which as markbeyers points out is a reasonable approach as long as the modulo isn t too large in the above implementation an explicit n can be passed to fish for a small exponent even if p is cryptographically large

37237257
exponent	modulo
since a duplicate of this question was asked under the python tag here is a python implementation of baby step giant step which as markbeyers points out is a reasonable approach as long as the modulo isn t too large in the above implementation an explicit n can be passed to fish for a small exponent even if p is cryptographically large
it will find the exponent as long as the exponent is smaller than

37240393
viewdidload	viewwillappear
remember that viewdidload fires only once during the life cycle of a view controller and in your case it is in the navigation stack which means it has been already used for that view controller and now when you press back button it does not work again
please add the code in the viewwillappear and it should solve the problem you are facing

37245833
lisp	scheme
common lisp does not have internal define like scheme does which is by the way syntactic sugar for letrec or
the common lisp equivalent of letrec is labels so you can use this defun make-cell let local-name labels local-add-name name setf local-name name me message ecase message add-name # local-add-name name local-name # me this works as you d expect as tested on sbcl here s the letrec version of your code define make-cell let local-name #f letrec local-add-name lambda name set

37246435
subtract	addition
call the subtract method and return the result if options subtract
if the caller specified subtraction and did not specify addition then this line will be executed and the method will return here

37248675
mediacodec	mediarecorder
if you want to receive packets from some other source that the system itself doesn t support you ll want to use mediacodec without mediaextractor
likewise if you want to record something else than the camera or write the output somewhere else than to a file that mediarecorder supports you ll want to use mediacodec directly instead of mediarecorder

37252637
operands	scalar
the value computations of the operands of an operator are sequenced before the value computation of the result of the operator
if a side effect on a scalar object is unsequenced relative to either another side effect on the same scalar object or a value computation using the value of the same scalar object and they are not potentially concurrent the behavior is undefined and also 5.2.2 function call .

37253509
memcached	apc
i d suggest using memcached especially if you re concerned about performance
whilst you are correct that apc u is a lot faster than memcache you re not taking into the account that by the time you re worrying about these metrics you will be running across multiple servers and apc u cannot be shared across nodes

37253509
memcached	apc
whilst you are correct that apc u is a lot faster than memcached you re not taking into the account that by the time you re worrying about these metrics you will be running across multiple servers and apc u cannot be shared across nodes
you can use a single memcached instance or cluster to serve as many application servers as you want

37256297
factors	mean
this means that in your assoc cases you should do a list.map you may want to factors this function out and give it a name
i m not clear on what you mean by bugs but assoc doesn t take a it takes a

37257120
ssl	https
your asp.net app doesn t have to be aware of ssl certificate nor you have to change anything in the code
but you should add routing rules to redirect all http requests to https endpoint with asp.net routing in web.config or in iis if you have access but since its shared hosting then no i guess

37258522
jar	war
the reason that you can not run a guide with run on server is because of spring-boot adheres to the slogan of make jar not war
the guide sample code are not things you deploy on a server i.e war but are standalone java apps jar which contain their own embedded servlet container if they need one

37261315
union	distinct
you can use union all with a select statement that will only return a row when no rows are found within the given range
if you don t care about performance or your resulting set is rather small you can skip the not exists condition and let uionn distinct eliminate the duplicate

37261938
google-chrome	firefox
you can use nginx user agent maps to detect and redirect non-sni clients ie and google-chrome browsers on xp
just put this to the site configuration file outside server block the first map checks for winhdows nt 5.1 in user agent string windows xp but because firefox does not rely on xp s ssl implementation and has its own lib with sni support we should better whitelist this browser even on xp and that is what the second map does

37263216
rar	zip
due to the licensing creating rar archives is not directly supported however it is not impossible
zip - probably the most known compression format

37265231
noexcept	throw
i think what you want is noexcept
nothrow is a constant used to pass to operator new to indicate that new should not throw an exception on error

37265310
google-chrome	firefox
if you need to test for multiple file uploads have that particular instance load the google-chrome driver with then you re going to want to pass it a string that looks something like this
currently there doesn t seem to be a workaround for firefox

37267992
union	distinct
difference the difference between union and union all is that union will omit duplicate records whereas union all will include duplicate records
union result set is sorted in ascending order whereas union all result set is not sorted union performs a distinct on its result set so it will eliminate any duplicate rows

37267992
union	distinct
union result set is sorted in ascending order whereas union all result set is not sorted union performs a distinct on its result set so it will eliminate any duplicate rows
whereas union all won t remove duplicates and therefore it is faster than union

37268489
uiview	subviews
i had this happen when i had a uiview linked into a storyboard and connected iboutlet like but later on i made the uiview into a custom class but forgot to change the class name of this iboutlet defined above
its a strange error because if the custom view has no subviews it doesnt complain but as soon as there are subviews it shows the error stated in the question but on one of the subviews and not the outer uiview where the problem actually exists

37269066
implements	extends
when you declare that your class with implements runnable classue either you have to implements run method or declare your class as abstract when your class extends thread with below statement class code extends thread the thread class has already implements run method and hence you are not getting compilation error
you can remove implements runnable from below statement which is redundant

37269159
wordpress	joomla
this is not possible by default in joomla like wordpress
back-end and front-end are separated in joomla

37269559
ssl	https
the error i got was that http get bundler fetcher certificatefailureerror could not verify the ssl certificate for . there is a chance you are experiencing a man-in-the-middle attack but most likely your system doesn t have the ca certificates needed for verification
for information about openssl certificates to connect without using ssl edit your gemfile sources and change https to http

37269559
ssl	https
for information about openssl certificates to connect without using ssl edit your gemfile sources and change https to http
it seems like it s an ssl issue where rubygems.org might not have uptodate ssl or something

37272472
stateless	stateful
they are stateful and they break the rest stateless constraint keep reading for more details hence it s not rest
the stateless constraint according to roy t

37277264
implements	extends
other common iterable methods are also implements such as .remove .insert .append extends
the list can also be modified using slices sort and reverse methods are not implements

37281795
sudo	passwd
here is the error i am getting because sudo is not installed you can use winrm if you login with ssh via vagrant ssh
passwd is passw0rd

37282524
ubuntu	linux
it is different on linux including ubuntu
linux doesn t have universal binary support for multiple targets in a single executable

37283431
vsto	add-in
note that although you say this is a vsto project the code you show us is not vsto
you re starting up a new instance of the word.application but the vsto add-in would be running in-process

37284289
allocator	stl
i personally belive a better solution would be to make allocator template template arguments and allow container to get a concrete type - but at the time of stl design template template parameters were still not widely supported
welcome to the wonderful world of allocator

37285552
google-chrome	firefox
method did not work in just google-chrome
it was working in ie and firefox

37288224
firefox	safari
however this will only log the user out of the safari browser once they have logged into the firefox browser and then they try to go back to safari
if you need the safari browser to logout immediately as soon as the user logs into a different browser you can simply add an ajax polling function that will trigger the middleware even when the user is not actively using the site and this way the safari browser will logout as soon as the user logs into firefox etc

37288796
division	subtract
edit if the modulo thing was not clear i ll try to explain in more detail this counts the number of big coins in a few steps find the number of coins that won t make big coins basecoins 10000 this returns the remainder of division eg which is how many coins won t make big coins however we wan t however many will so.
subtract them from the total basecoins - basecoins 10000 of course whatever is here will be divisible by 10 000 or a whole number of big coins leading to the final step convert those base coins to big coins basecoins - basecoins 10000 10000 because there are 10 000 basecoins in a bigcoin

37289048
uitapgesturerecognizer	uitextview
in the uitapgesturerecognizer s selector you can add the logic codes to handle the process
you can check the length of the textview s text to determine the uitextview was edited or not

37293246
queue	fifo
you should probably use the standard queue instead of priorityqueue
queues typically but do not necessarily order elements in a fifo fifo manner

37293303
g++	gcc
but it works with g++
following pupper s advice i adapted my code to the below it still doesn t compile with the gcc on my system giving b.cpp .text+0x134 undefined reference to std cout .

37296833
inline	inlining
they inline small functions or even large static functions that are only called once
as harold points out overdoing it with inlining can cause cache misses too because it inflates your code size so much that not all of your hot code fits in cache

37297782
serializable	deserialization
so to solve your problem look at gson documentation where you can see you can serializable the collection with gson without doing anything specific tojson collection would write out the desired output
however deserialization with fromjson json collection.class will not work since gson has no way of knowing how to map the input to the types

37299397
express	node.js
express routes can be pattern-based so you can define a route for a whole directory then return the specific file that was requested simple static html server in node
this all leads on however to node.js not being a great choice for serving lots of static content

37301463
google-chrome	firefox
still on google-chrome its not working
after getting my own key on google api and reformatting the code like below i am able to get it working on ie and firefox

37301743
filewriter	bufferedwriter
filewriter is not buffered so writing to it writes immeditately to disk
bufferedwriter writes first to a buffer in memory

37303872
profiling	debugging
other installations might not provide the profiling button
you can profile your script by hitting the profile button it is to the right of the run debugging and run with coverage buttons among the output you will find the name of the script itself and the time needed to run it

37304663
swift	objective-c
swift bool is bridged to objective-c nsnumber
if you don t want to rely on implicit casting and you should not as it will go away in swift 3 cast it yourself by saying mybool as nsnumber

37305206
swift	objective-c
the only thing i would say about this is once you re back in your swift logic you should always convert an back to a meaningful array type through type casting or unpacking it into a more appropriate data structure
you shouldn t sacrifice type safety in swift just because objective-c lacks in that regard

37305206
swift	objective-c
you shouldn t sacrifice type safety in swift just because objective-c lacks in that regard
anyobject is pretty much as vague as any in pure swift

37305618
profiling	debugging
moreover i would add spark.python.profile.dump to your list of configuration so you can see a profiling for your spark job execution which can help you more with understanding the case and to tune your cluster more to your needs
disclaimer this answer isn t based on debugging but more on observations and the documentation apache spark provides i don t believe that this is a bug to begin with

37307270
factors	matrix
in this case we have to drop this factors variable and use a prediction formula returnshipment size + color + price + salutation + state + age + deliverytime however the standard predict routine can not take your customized prediction formula
there are commonly two solutions extract model matrix and model coefficients from testreg and manually predict model terms we want by matrix-vector multiplication

37308841
innodb	myisam
i guess when you first started you used myisam and now you are using innodb
innodb just doesn t store this information

37309467
stateless	stateful
then you could use the stateless function component instead
the way you ve written this component is not stateless the user is state so you shouldn t be using a stateless functional component you should be using a stateful component class here it is working in codepen

37309467
stateless	stateful
the way you ve written this component is not stateless the user is state so you shouldn t be using a stateless functional component you should be using a stateful component class here it is working in codepen
of course you don t have to make this component stateful

37311229
spaces	delimiter
values verifies the values section contains a comma delimiter list of values which are only strings not enclosed in quotes like 123 strings enclosed in single quotes like red allow white spaces to surround any delimiting comma allow quoted strings to contain commas like this value has a comma notes if the regex does not match your string then there is a problem with your source string i recommend using the following flags for this case insenstive
examples live example in this example i m using the multi line global and ignore white spaces options

37316145
g++	gcc
gcc is the gnu c compiler you should use g++ to compile your program
g++ main.cpp -o main enums in c++03 are not scoped so you can t use enums like enumtype enumvalue

37316744
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome accepts input as the event type but it does not work in firefox 46
in order to get it working in firefox too you need to use the event type change

37324214
g++	gcc
as of gcc 5.1 g++ is not abi-compatible with clang++
some bug reports clang++ no longer abi-compatible with g++ and add support for gcc s attribute abi_tag needed for compatibility with gcc 5 s libstdc++

37324406
super	self
that way b.p wouldn t have to use super .p at all and simply just reuse these helper methods
just call a.p self directly this is not what super was designed to support

37324406
super	self
just call a.p self directly this is not what super was designed to support
note that you have to pass in self manually as a.p is an unbound method

37325406
bcolz	pytables
bcolz and blaze offer similar capabilities although not as seamlessly
if these are not an option h5py and pytables allow you to store data sets to files incrementally rather than having to keep the whole thing in memory at once

37325880
apache	nginx
even if i prefer to separate all apps services with docker in this case i found it simplest to put apache php wordpress in one container
the next thing i need to do is to separate mysql from the stack to put all databases on one server but it s not the discussion here p for your question what i would do is one stack per wordpress with container apache php container mysql and another stack with nginx proxy and let s encrypt for all your wordpress on the server

37327149
qthread	qobject
just because your qobject is called qthread doesn t make it any different
the fix is simple don t override qthread s run and don t add functionality to qthread

37328335
ansible	puppet
i ll try to make an answer even though you have chances that you question will get closed as primarily opinion both docker and vagrant could do the job for you - using one or the other is matter of preference but lets say if you deploy on production on container go for docker if you re alone in your team and only uses it for development go for docker if you want to reflect a production infrastructure go for vagrant if you go for docker the most simple will be to start with a tomcat docker image you have almost all flavor of java tomcat version so you should be good to go if you go for vagrant its not as simple as first you need to select an os on which you will run and then provision the installation of the software should be os agnostic when using chef puppet ansible tools so it gives you more freedom to select your tool but with freedom comes choice
so first select the os you want to run a select a valid box then select which provisioning tool will make the install can be that straight shell instructions is sufficient for you else look for available puppet chef ansible module recipie playbook is available to build your stack

centos	linux
multi-platform c++ code example to fetch just the computer name this is what worked for my win7 and centos machines
regarding denis s answer note that getenv hostname for linux may not always work because the environment variables may not be exported to the program

37332145
google-chrome	firefox
you can turn off audio processing using constraints use https fiddle for google-chrome google-chrome apparently turns off all audio processing when echocancellation false is specified
firefox doesn t do that yet so include autogaincontrol false and noisesuppression false as well for now recent additions to the spec that rely on adapter.js here except in firefox nightly

37333320
sudo	passwd
the only ugly approach which comes to my mind is to parse the result of stderr to determine the error reason note however that this approach is not upgrade-safe and moreover language-dependent if a patch to sudo changes the text which is shown to the user in case of a wrong passwd or the user logs on in a different language this coding will not be able to handle this properly
based on the man page of sudo 8 there is no easy way for evaluating the exact error reasons for a failure exit value upon successful execution of a program the exit status from sudo will simply be the exit status of the program that was executed

37337494
caanimation	calayer
not only cgpath is opaque but also caanimation doesn t support any updates or notifications for ongoing animations after started but before finished
the only entities involved are animation itself and calayer -s it is applied to

37337499
selecteditem	selectedindex
i am used to the selecteditem being set to an actual item and not the container of that item
it also seems more natural just to use selectedindex since you already have the index

37339583
vb.net	vb6
in vb.net declaring variable as new just initializes it at first but doesn t re-initailize it after setting it to nothing
in vb6 if you declare some object as new then vb internally places hidden code to check object presence and optionally instantiate object before every use of that object

37340157
equals	compareto
you can find the reason for this suggestion in the compareto javadoc returns a negative integer zero or a positive integer as this object is less than equals to or greater than the specified object
sonar is suggesting to check the result of compareto against 0 not if it returns directly 1 -1

37340465
translation	localization
i do not use xliff exported files to manage my translation so i cannot give you an answer using this
however you may be able to solve your problem of finding missing localization using localization.strings files

37341907
quicksort	mergesort
it is good to avoid deep call stack and such cases can occur on quicksort if the data is already sorted but it will never happen with a mergesort
there is a slight misunderstanding here abstract in-place merge is not a mergesort it is the routine used to merge two arrays together

37342314
scheme	racket
the software also has several non standard languages in its own racket language family that has much in common with scheme but is not scheme
alex has made an excellent answer for that language so i though i d add information about scheme since you write you re learning scheme which is not the same as learning racket when it comes some corner cases including eval

37342314
scheme	racket
alex has made an excellent answer for that language so i though i d add information about scheme since you write you re learning scheme which is not the same as learning racket when it comes some corner cases including eval
eval is a procedure which has had breaking changes between the different scheme reports since it became mandatory in r5rs

move	drag
if user doesn t immediately release the button and instead move the mouse around the circle will automatically adjust it s radius based on user movements with cursor
after the user releases the mouse he can drag the map around and also circle stays editable for adjustments

37347893
implements	extends
the reason is that spring creates a proxy for your class to implements the cache functionality
however it uses by default the jdk proxy when the bean implements an interface and the jdk proxy then also implements the interface but does not extends the bean class

37350176
draggable	droppable
i have an unreliable solution that may help you figure something out - use the droppable tolerance pointer option demonstrated with a draggable height of 40px and droppable height of 20px
this isn t reliable though as you would always need to grab the draggable at the very bottom or very top of the element - but this might help you find a way or rethink your approach

37352840
required	placeholder
this code is wrong when you are calling a method you supply an argument value you do not supply a type describing the required parameters
you want to say this an editor placeholder is a solid rounded rectangle with text in it inserted through code completion

37356189
clang	llvm
build 5658 llvm build 2336.11.00 br the code slightly modified compiles and runs on osx 10.7.x. br br br in a newer version of osx 10.10.x gcc seems aliased to clang

37357470
swift	objective-c
so for example let s assume the param is optional the closure is required and the result and error were optional you might define it like so and if that was the case your swift code would call it like so or again just let the compiler infer the types for you but this time they d be inferred as optionals that are not implicitly unwrapped
given that your closure doesn t specify nullability qualifiers where they almost certainly are optional one can safely assume that your objective-c api has not been audited for nullability

37359657
octal	binary
integers prefixed with 0 are treated as octal not binary
prefix with 0b or 0b to indicate binary like 0b00010

37360099
build.gradle	gradlew
in react.gradle it creates offline bundle gradlew task for each build variant and make it execute before gradlew process resources but it enables the bundle task in some special conditions the code is while the config object is the react object actually as its definition is and the targetname definition is so if we define a proper react property in app build.gradle we can enable the offline bundle task
for example if we want to enable the offline bundle in release build type but not in debug build type we can define the react as then execute gradlew assemblerelease in command line gradlew will execute the bundle task and the js bundle will be included in final apk

37360120
stateless	stateful
a service which implements a protocol that is stateless in relation with both sides taken together might not appear stateless on each side because the other side can carry a state
to properly answer the question we need the concept of a stateless protocol used to manage external stateful resources

37363048
gprof	perf
gprof doesn t know about functions it doesn t have debug info access to i.e the standard library
if you want to get accurate elapsed time and still get a callgraph you can use perf

37363630
voip	sip
there are 2 things about this negotiation of a socket that might be unexpected it can be any ip address and port combination not just one that is on the voip device itself
so you might have for instance a voip server that negotiates a socket on another host that is not part of the sip dialog and which might be behind a nat the negotation is done at the osi application layer layer 7 so it is normally untouched by the nat process which operates at layers 3 and 4 how to diagnose missing audio due to nat if you re able to get packet captures ideally on both wan and lan ports so you can see your voip device s traffic before and after nat you can see the problem in action just look for the packets containing sdp payloads if you re doing sip on udp 5060 just filter for that port and you will see invite requests and 200 ok responses that contain sdp payloads

37363630
voip	sip
so you might have for instance a voip server that negotiates a socket on another host that is not part of the sip dialog and which might be behind a nat the negotation is done at the osi application layer layer 7 so it is normally untouched by the nat process which operates at layers 3 and 4 how to diagnose missing audio due to nat if you re able to get packet captures ideally on both wan and lan ports so you can see your voip device s traffic before and after nat you can see the problem in action just look for the packets containing sdp payloads if you re doing sip on udp 5060 just filter for that port and you will see invite requests and 200 ok responses that contain sdp payloads
drill down to the c connection information and m media description lines which should look something like the following if you re seeing something like this going out your wan port it means your voip device is requesting to be sent audio on 192.168.1.114 6094

37364894
gam	mgcv
a model frame is formed from the data argument passed to fitting routine like lm glm and mgcv gam
it is a data frame with the same number of rows as data but dropping all variables not referenced by formula adding many attributes the most important of which is envrionement most model fitting routines like lm glm and mgcv gam will keep the model frame in their fitted object by default

37365488
trie	tree
you should try some string data structures for this problem trie is a good option
first sort phone number with length decreasing and insert the number one by one if some number does not create new tree nodes it means we find a prefix and returns false otherwise returns true

37365709
google-chrome	firefox
update in google-chrome and safari the height of non flex children are not recognized in percentages
however firefox and ie recognize and scale the children based on percentage heights

37368669
isotope	masonry
you haven t loaded isotope.js anyway. masonry does not filter items only isotope
pick one to use and use the code for it your loading imagesloaded.js after masonry.js but you are calling the imagesloaded function before masonry in your code

37369719
google-chrome	safari
from this page messages | works mail | works whatsapp | works slack | works if it s set to open safari not in-app browser uses sfsafariviewcontroller safari | works conditionally google-chrome | works conditionally google | works conditionally gmail | if google-chrome installed opens link in google-chrome not universal link
else works conditionally inbox | if google-chrome installed opens link in google-chrome not universal link

37370669
udp	tcp
but since the reliability is implemented at the tcp level this does not matter tcp over ip over udp vpn is still a reliable protocol
tcp is a protocol on top of ip

37375166
cdr	cons
you ve already forced the cdr n at that point
now next is not a function it s a stream -- a cons pair of its current number and its stream-tail

37375605
ssl	https
indeed when you are enabling jelastic ssl means you can t use public ip shared resolvers processing all requests to your server but between resolver and your server requests are not https
so with redirect you tried to set up your server redirected incoming http requests to https and sent it back to resolver as result you ve got a loop redirect

37376073
move	drag
my own anecdotal experience having used an interface where items could only be move up or down one item at a time in a long list was that it was a total pain and when drag-and-drop was finally implemented it was a breath of fresh air
i also have conducted a usability test task 1 in this pdf where a simple label of drag to add a new ... it was a duplication interface not a reordering interface on top of some pill-shaped elements with a grabby hand cursor and change of color on hover was quickly discovered by 8 out of 8 users without any prompting

37377096
implements	extends
so when coding you work with primitive types but the jvm works with the wrapper of the primitive types which implements java.lang.object
there are other types which do not extends java.lang.object

37382854
serializable	deserialization
no it is all serializable because the base class a is serializable
in deserialization class d flow any no parameter constructor not need and all hierarchy deserialized

37384861
theano	lasagne
get_grad doesn t need to be passed the value of the weights because they re stored as a theano shared variable
i m not aware of any lasagne function to evaluate the gradient but you can get it yourself with simple theano function

37384861
theano	lasagne
i m not aware of any lasagne function to evaluate the gradient but you can get it yourself with simple theano function
say we have the following theano variables inputs inputs to the network targets target outputs of the network loss value of the loss function defined as a function of network outputs and targets l_hid recurrent layer of the network type lasagne.layers.recurrentlayer say we re interested in the gradient of the loss function w.r.t

37385274
queue	fifo
things like touch event handling drawing updates of the screen appear in that queue too
you must therefore never pause that thread the only way to do things later is to enqueue it for later the queue is not a simple fifo queue it supports delays and such now your timer schedules the task runnable to run after a set delay

37385274
queue	fifo
you must therefore never pause that thread the only way to do things later is to enqueue it for later the queue is not a simple fifo queue it supports delays and such now your timer schedules the task runnable to run after a set delay
since the code that calls handler.postdelayed is necessarily already inside such a runnable itself it needs to be done before the queue can take and run task

37389350
prng	random
as pointed by tom brunberg 1 random is not cryptographically-secure prng thus using it to generate random as in unpredictable pin-codes is rather improper idea
2 your loop is both slow and even less secure by calling random many times in a row you cause its statistics to accumulate decreasing the randomness . and it is potentially indefinite

37390381
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome a server 500 error shows up in the console as an error even if you don t handle it
i m not sure how firefox handles a server 500 error

37390969
google-chrome	firefox
so this code is working on firefox ie and getting it running on google-chrome as well you need to add the line so for this example it would finally be
i just had the same issue that the google google-chrome was not fireing my submit event when the button got disabled via jquery

37391905
factors	mean
to check this one thing to mention the specified function can return na s itself like in the following toy example so in general na doesn t mean that a factors combination is absent
if you run tapply with a specified function not null say sum like in help you ll see that the result is a 2-dimensional array with na in one cell it means that one combination of factors namely 1 b is absent

37392626
build.gradle	gradlew
in that situation it is probably better to edit your app module s build.gradle file to move compilesdkversion from 22 the imported value to 23 than it would be to install the sdk for level 22 but either approach should work
throughout this entire process when something does not build properly and you make a change to try to address it you might want to try build rebuild project and or tools android sync project with gradlew files and or file invalidate caches restart to make sure that your changes have been fully incorporated

37393547
required	placeholder
it does required you to change the way you ve set up your placeholder since for now there isn t a way to color partial parts of the placeholder attribute
what you basicly do is create an effect of a placeholder without it actually being one

37393711
serializable	deserialization
on the other hand jsonmanagedreference and jsonbackreference are designed to handle this two-way linkage between fields one for parent role the other for child role respectively for avoiding the problem linkage is handled such that the property annotated with jsonmanagedreference annotation is handled normally serializable normally no special handling for deserialization and the property annotated with jsonbackreference annotation is not serializable
and during deserialization its value is set to instance that has the managed forward link

37397231
equals	compareto
the api docs for treeset contain this important information note that the ordering maintained by a set whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if it is to correctly implement the set interface
... this is so because the set interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a treeset instance performs all element comparisons using its compareto or compare method so two elements that are deemed equal by this method are from the standpoint of the set equal

37407133
octal	decimal
to avoid getting a following decimal digit interpreted as part of the octal sequence it is common practice to pad an octal escape sequence with leading zeroes
as opposed to octal integer constants though a leading zero is not required

37408603
serializable	deserialization
if an existing object is used the resulting deserialized object is not guaranteed to duplicate the original state of the serializable object
the properties that contained default values during serialization will not be reset back to their defaults during deserialization

37411435
comparator	comparable
you can solve the problem by supplying your own comparator via sorted-map-by that does the required type checking
it would seem reasonable that keys to a sorted-map should be comparable in some way which is not the case with 1 and type this is the cause of your exception

37414109
uiview	subviews
instead of using a uitableviewcontroller you should probably use a regular uiviewcontroller and then add a uitableview and your custom uiview as subviews
uitableviewcontrollers aren t very flexible when it comes to adding subviews

37417172
eventlet	gevent
with eventlet you can efficiently spawn hundreds or thousands of green threads
however note that gevent or eventlet is not always better than prefork often depends on what type of task you need to execute like explained in this part of the doc celery supports eventlet as an alternative execution pool implementation

37419340
opcache	apc
and that is not included in opcache and doctrine needs key-value storage for caching
therefore you have a few solutions to choose apcu - which replaced apc in newer versions but i think it s not so commonly used anymore

37423399
keystore	jks
the keystore for each authenticated party always the server and here the client also because you specified needclientauth must have the private key and certificate s not merely the certificate s
there are two ways to do this convert the openssl generated privatekey plus the related certs to pkcs#12 and then either convert the pkcs#12 to jks or just use the pkcs#12 in java jce can handle it and recent versions of java8 even if you specify jks

37424910
build.gradle	gradlew
a possible working build.gradle file depends on your android studio s gradlew plugin version etc
i just assume now you copied your build.gradle file from a working project of yours would be if you did this it probably will not find the opencv library dependency red lines under opencv classes methods and in imports and you have to go in android studio to file | project structure | image-matcher-master | dependencies | + and there you add your opencv library as file dependency ...if it is a jar...otherwise if opencv in your download folder is the source...you load this in android studio as well and choose module dependency

37425695
lisp	scheme
scheme was originally interpreted under a predecessor to cl and in the first reports they more or less just made a lisp with lexical closure and one namespace and not much more
it looked more like cl than scheme but was a lisp1 so the empty list rules cannot be about lisp1 vs lisp2 since scheme was a lisp1 from the first report that didn t require quoting and has nil as a false value

37427111
fgets	atoi
the storage is not complete but with my changes you can read to structs and specify the size of the loop todo save a list of structs so that you actually can print a list of structs that you have specified. test see also this question about fgets fgets how to read int
you can use fgets to read strings and cast the string to digits with atoi

37428300
antialiasing	transparent
made the text visible though the antialiasing was like something out of the 1980s with a messed up palette but then i got spuriously transparent parts of windows always the same parts cleanly composited so not like a driver bug
noticing that glxgears was also displaying with a neat transparent background when it s opaque black on other systems i found a thoughtful and informative bug report against compton rgba windows are always transparent #179

37431659
client-side	server-side
1 server-side validation without modelstate.addmodelerror controller.cs view.cshtml 2 client-side validation with vanilla js using id to identify required elements
since the question doesn t mention which server-side or client-side validation were preferred to use there are 2 approaches

37431911
ienumerable	ilist
it is because the ireadonlycollection which implements ienumerable does not necessarily implement indexing which often required when you want to numerically order a list
indexof is from ilist

37433487
noexcept	throw
deprecates noexcept is an improved version of throw which is deprecated in c++11
unlike throw noexcept will not call std unexpected and may or may not unwind the stack which potentially allows the compiler to implement noexcept without the runtime overhead of throw

37433519
noexcept	throw
unlike throw noexcept will not call std unexpected and may or may not unwind the stack which potentially allows the compiler to implement noexcept without the runtime overhead of throw
yes they both could be used for declaring functions including lambdas which don t throw any exceptions but dynamic exception specification has been deprecated in c++11

37434812
express	node.js
this also works with the free community and express for desktop editions
windows vista 7 only requires .net framework 4.5.1 install python 2.7 v3.x.x is not supported and run npm config set python python2.7 or see below for further instructions on specifying the proper python version and path. launch cmd npm config set msvs_version 2015 if the above steps didn t work for you please visit microsoft s node.js guidelines for windows for additional tips

37435866
set	bag
why cannot you set the attribute in the recipe from the data bag and use as expected
normally i would set a default value in the attributes default.rb for the very same value just in case the data bag does not exist at runtime

37436188
voip	sip
media will be handled by rtpproxy or rtpengine freeswitch is a softswitch or softpbx freeswitch is not just for sip it can bridge different voip protocols and telecom hardwares its a pbx system so it can also have features like call transfers cdr did routing lcr ivr conference etc it also takes care of media media transcodings its not mandatory to use opensips with freeswitch both serves different purpose
opensips scales higher as it meant to act only on sip signalling compare to freeswitch

37440019
listview	gridview
listview items focus behaviour focusable edittext inside listview android force edittext to remove focus
in that case android cannot handle the click event of gridview

37443417
swift	objective-c
one difference i ve found is that conforming a protocol to nsobjectprotocol will load objective-c symbol information into your compiled swift binary
see the generated assembly below when declaring the protocol objective-c these symbols aren t loaded and i think this work is transferred to the swift module s objective-c header

37445310
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
bluebird supports internet explorer 7 and up firefox google-chrome safari edge and node 0.8+
the following are also maintained but not tested regularly firefox extensions google-chrome extensions edge extensions react native electron mobile safari mobile google-chrome mobile google-chrome on ios android browesr rhino and a bunch of other environments

37445913
google-chrome	firefox
reason for different behaviour in google-chrome when an element has its display property set to none it can not be in focused state which i believe is a more predictable and uniform behavior
but in firefox even when the element has its display property set to none it is some how retaining the focus

37449493
backtracking	greedy
it works because it forces the to do its backtracking but also keeps a from quitting immediately since the next token is can be matched immediately
regex101 tested works here in pcre javascript and python javascript example jsfiddle the combination of the two strategies in the question doesn t work because the form is too greedy it skips over the capture group

37450907
ssl	socks
therefore such a proxy can setup any type of socket which can have an ssl handshake which can then be used for https transfer
if your proxy is socks it will not care what kind of socket is connecting through it

37450907
ssl	https
whether after the socks handshake an ssl handshake https is started it is not a socks proxy problem it will just pass through
several http proxies on the other hand expect http headers to guide them such a http proxy will not allow https since it needs to read the headers

37451994
ssl	https
no node express does not need to handle ssl - you can have a separate service for node express and have nginx act as a reverse proxy and do ssl offloading
under this configuration browsers will first hit your nginx web server over https nginx will handle the ssl decryption and forward the decrypted http request to your node process

37451994
ssl	https
under this configuration browsers will first hit your nginx web server over https nginx will handle the ssl decryption and forward the decrypted http request to your node process
your node process doesn t have to know https is happening at all

37453884
serializable	deserialization
serializable objects are not text and should not be saved in .txt files
serializable objects stored in file are not readable they aren t meant to be readable other than via deserialization

37453884
serializable	deserialization
serializable objects stored in file are not readable they aren t meant to be readable other than via deserialization
the problem is that when i store serializable object in a .txt file it s not in readable form and contain some random symbols and letters

37457984
swift	objective-c
you get the flexibility and type safety of being able to use an array of cgrects in swift and you also get the interoperability with objective-c
this is not an nsarray this is a swift array of nsarray objects i.e an array within an array

37457984
swift	objective-c
however i would generally advise against doing this depends on your exact use case as it adds a wrapper that swift itself doesn t need as well as reducing type safety
if you need to interact with this array in swift before sending it off to an objective-c api then i would instead create an array of cgrects directly as bhushan suggests

37463874
client-side	server-side
in your code when your react app goes from to index or any other routes defined using react-router it does not request express server for anything rather everything is done over client-side browser
that s why even if you had a route defined as test for reactjs it would not call server-side for anything

37466931
rspec	capybara
1 when using capybara you use visit and page when using plain rails integration tests which rspec request specs are a wrapper around you use get and response - you can t mix and match those like using visit and response together
also in capybara most drivers don t provide access to things like request response codes and whether or not the page was redirected since it s designed to test from a users perspective which implies replying only on things that appear in the browser

37467945
linefeed	delimiter
if you are worried about whether you need to generate linefeed or crlf for the end of line you can control that with the option on the file statement
if you just have one column then the delimiter doesn t matter

37468130
google-chrome	firefox
you ll be happy to know that adapter.js now supports the facingmode constraint on google-chrome for android use https fiddle for google-chrome the syntax means the constraint is required and things fail if the user doesn t have the right camera
if you leave it out then the constraint is optional though firefox for android will let users override the choice in the camera chooser in the permission prompt in that case

37468904
vsto	add-in
sheehan did not elaborate on whether vsto add-in would specifically work with later versions of project centennial but he did indicate that compatibility with software that leverages other desktop technologies is definitely on the project centennial road map
you cannot add vsto desktop applications to the windows store but may be able to do so soon

37469933
gradle	ivy
gradle will then check for updates every 24 hours but this can be configured using the resolutionstrategy dsl
i found the answer here since snapshots are a maven concept they aren t treated as anything special in an ivy repository

37470352
clang	llvm
on linux with rust 1.9 clang -dynamic-linker usr local lib rustlib x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu lib libstd-d16b8f0e.so hello.ll -o hello
it isn t obvious since the llvm documentation is very obscure but clang will compile both llvm ir files .ll and bitcode files .bc and link with your system libraries

37470779
spaces	delimiter
forces the field separator to be a single spaces so that it knows there is an empty field between two single spaces
the default behavior would be to allow multiple spaces to be a single delimiter which is not what you want according to the question

37472607
decimal	ieee
although floating-point numbers are inexact and often do not use base 10 internally they can in fact precisely save and recover a decimal representation
for instance an ieee 754 64 bit representation has enough precision to preserve 15 decimal digits

37473318
uptime	reboot
the very fact that you have only 1 instance running and trying to guarantee that instance is stable means it is a single point of failure as you cannot guarantee uptime
servers reboot apps panic connections drop

37478781
firefox	safari
finally keyframes not supported in an inline or scoped stylesheet in firefox bug 830056
but you have an alternate fiddle example it works on modern browsers chrome firefox safari ie10+

37479331
tortoisegit	svn
below question 2 based on lazy barger hints i came up with the following flow tortoisegit clone with only a selection of the trunk revision 12345 corresponding to the creation of the tunk .git config file edited by hand to add the desired branches the following shall be added in the svn-remote part tortoisegit svn fetch to pull out the branches the last command might take a while because it starts searching from revision 1
perform tortoisegit switch checkout to change the branch note to perform the command equivalent to svn update i use git svn rebase and select the correct upstream corresponding to the remote branch and not the trunk which is selected by default

37483906
implements	extends
fragments are implements observer class and your activity has the role of subject as illustrate in above figure
i hope this could help you to implements your code in a very nice way. some tutorial can be find in the following links edit in the given situation fragment are in correct definition with this design pattern so i do not change their code public class onefragment extends fragment implements onreceivelistener you need to have references to the fragments in the activity as observer

there are two different forms of execute in postgres the execute of the procedural pl pgsql language described here the execute of a prepare statement as an independant sql statement not tied to a procedural language described here it s the first one that fits your purpose dynamic sql not the second one
i suspect you were led to prepare statements by finding about execute and following the wrong trail

37487106
prepare	execute
i suspect you were led to prepare statements by finding about execute and following the wrong trail
prepare statements are not useful in your context

37489040
mayavi	matplotlib
should you increase it too much let s say 80 and the problem becomes obvious other option is for you to follow the recommendation of matplotlib faq itself and check mayavi
notice however that mayavi still does not support python 3

37493606
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
this of course would be done in the viewdidappear method
you cannot perform segues in the viewwillappear method

37494881
swift	objective-c
one of the key benefits of swift is that takes type-safety more seriously than objective-c so we generally wouldn t use nsobject or anyobject unless we absolutely had to
your objective-c method declaration is using a method signature style without named parameters which we generally don t use anymore

37494881
swift	objective-c
but if you really wanted to implement a swift method without named parameters it would be something like you could then call that from swift as obj.get_answer_dict dictionary1 dictionary2 or from objective-c having said that i d heartily encourage you to use more conventional method naming conventions eg
and you d call that as the swift equivalent would be which would be called obj.retrieveanswerwithdictionary1 somedictionary dictionary2 someotherdictionary note not only are the parameters named but i use camelcase naming convention and no underscores

37496398
inline	inlining
at this stage the inlining process is also performed and this means that suitable functions can be inline even if the compiler couldn t see that function during compilation
this allows inlining in from anywhere but requires a different setup for the linker options

37497099
equals	compareto
returns false equals checks if two objects are the same or not and returns a boolean
compareto from interface comparable returns an integer

37497099
equals	compareto
it checks which of the two objects is less than equals to or greater than the other
not all objects can be logically ordered so a compareto method doesn t always make sense

37497587
google-chrome	firefox
in fact you can test here and see that firefox doesn t reload the page at all whereas google-chrome does but only the first time
i tried your google-chrome extension and managed to replicate this behaviour

37500229
super	self
so you must first initialize the variable then call super
the confusion is the usage of self which is not needed at all since the frame is passed in the parameter

37502273
queue	fifo
the short-term scheduler to select another process from the ready queue to run next
the storage structure for the ready queue and the algorithm used to select the next process are not necessarily a fifo queue

37504173
hive	hdfs
i hit this issue last week and was able to find a workaround here s the story i can see the table in hive if i created the table without partitionby but hive can t understand the table schema schema is empty... if i do this solution the problem is that the datasource table created through dataframe api partitionby+saveastable is not compatible with hive. see this link
by setting spark.sql.hive.convertmetastoreparquet to false as suggested in the doc spark only puts data onto hdfs but won t create table on hive

37512150
stateless	stateful
in general though it s not specified explicitly the generate method is designed to work with a stateless supplier
stateful supplier will work correctly with sequential stream only

37514646
swift	objective-c
structs are much like classes in swift in that they can have data and methods and extensions
objective-c does not require that each class be defined in its own .h .m pair but it is fairly typical objective-c style to do so

37517589
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
note i was able to achieve the above functionality in google-chrome only as at this stage mozilla firefox provided limited support
whereas safari has not provided webrtc support so it was out of the picture from the beginning

37518868
hive	hdfs
you can find out the reason why hive uses rdbms in the paper hive a warehousing solution over a map-reduce framework
it describes as following the storage system for the metastore should be optimized for online transactions with random accesses and updates. a file system like hdfs is not suited since it is optimized for sequential scans and not for random access

37519688
profiling	instrumentation
if your program is not interactive then you should set up the arguments and environment in the choose target dialog so that when instrumentation runs it it does what you want to profiling
if so you can start it normally in terminal and then attach instrumentation to the already-running process

37521232
pyenv	virtualenv
i have created a 2.7.11 virtualenv using pyenv and installed python2-pygame with pacman
with my virtualenv activated i couldn t import pygame from python

37522535
dbcontext	objectcontext
this solution uses the dbcontext native way of retrieving the tracked entities
the accepted solution here is better for above ef4 than the objectcontext suggestion - we ran into issues with for instance the in memory db we used in the test context not working well with the above solution getting detached state for some modified entries in inheritance scenarios

37526138
antialiasing	transparent
antialiasing text absolutely must be drawn on top of a solid-color background
it cannot be drawn on a transparent background

37526832
union	distinct
select distinct in oracle 10 requires a union and this is not supported for clob
you will have to use alternatives to distinct

37527480
bower	npm
error code 1 - help 1 but going up a little bit it showed error bower econflict unable to find suitable version for angular this means that bower was been executed but it couldn t choose between some available angular versions. to fix that i have gone to zeppeling-root-folder zeppelin-web and executed . bower install at the end of bower install it asked me to choose between one of the available angular versions which i choose 1.5.0 after it just run a npm install node-gyp latest
i was getting the same problem here and this answer is just a guide for those who are getting the same error the maven output was similar to yours error failed to execute goal com.github.eirslett frontend-maven-plugin 0.0.25 bower bower install on project zeppelin-web failed to run task bower --allow-root install failed

37527982
express	node.js
one more thing while a lot of existing express middleware likely isn t compatible with foxx because of node-specific dependencies and async logic arangodb 3 will bring a new version of foxx with support for middleware using a functionally express-compatible api
you can use arangodb foxx as the sole backend of your application however it is important to keep the limitations of foxx compared to a general purpose js environment like node.js in mind when doing this

37528045
inline	constexpr	constexpr	inline-functions
in the draft i examined the rule about inline is in 7.1.2 dcl.fct.spec part 3 the inline specifier shall not appear on a block scope function declaration but nothing similar appears about constexpr
replacing the constexpr functions with inline-functions retains the exact same problem it is okay with the global declaration 1 but not with the function-scope declaration 2. since constexpr implies inline this seems like the cause

37528045
inline	constexpr	constexpr	inline-functions
replacing the constexpr functions with inline-functions retains the exact same problem it is okay with the global declaration 1 but not with the function-scope declaration 2. since constexpr implies inline this seems like the cause
in this case with declaration 2 gcc complains warning inline specifier invalid for function f declared out of global scope and warning inline-functions int f used but never defined . it fails to link undefined reference to f

37529730
google-chrome	safari
looks like google-chrome doesn t interpret your data-method post
google-chrome started get safari started post try to do this with a button_to which enables you to bypass these limitations

37530762
oncreate	findviewbyid
based on the code shown i do not think it is possible for onbeaconserviceconnect to be called before the oncreate method so the line must have been executed
one explanation is that findviewbyid r.id.range

37538691
filewriter	printwriter
which means filewriter focuses on character-wise output and you cannot define the character encoding
whereas printwriter focuses on formatted text output and you can specify the character encoding

37544789
noexcept	throw
despite the good answer from keenyt it s worth to say that can throw even though the constructors of std unique_ptr are noexcept
actually whether the above mentioned statement throw or not mostly depends on the constructors of the type t involved

37547444
super	implements
it s super easy to use and very flexible
i m not sure how you re asking to implements this but take a look at marked

37552304
prng	random
the seed has no other purpose than to give the prng a starting point
it is purely arbitrary and will not influence the distribution of the random numbers

37555012
stateless	stateful
now to answer your actual question serviceproxy doesn t have an option to connect to a specific instance of a deployed stateless service
you have the following options primary replica connect to the primary replica of a stateful service partition

37559790
google-chrome	firefox
use keydown because google-chrome does not fire the keypress event for known keyboard shortcuts
some spec d properties such as key are only partly functional in firefox

37560349
implements	extends
seekbar extends absseekbar implements onseekbarchangelistener
seekbar extends absseekbar absseekbar doesn t have a method named onprogressrefresh yet you are using the override annotation

37560374
ionic	angular
since ionic is built on top of angular 2 it will be lagging a bit behind
if you want to go into production now with an ionic 2 app i suppose it s not recommended using it

37560374
ionic	angular
if you want to go into production now with an ionic 2 app i suppose it s not recommended using it
since angular 2 is in rc we might expect that they will release in the near future and with that ionic 2 will be some time behind that

37562493
implements	extends
classes simultaneously related by both inheritance and enclosure are problematical however the original innerclasses whitepaper did not adequately address the issue nor did the pre-1.3 compilers implements a consistent policy
in jls 2nd edition the rule against cyclic inheritance has been extended to prohibit a class or interface from depending on itself directly or indirectly. a type depends not only on types that it extends or implements but also on types that serve as qualifiers within the names of those types

37562971
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
here s a modification of his second solution that works in edge ie opera firefox google-chrome ios safari and mobile equivalents that i could test update 1 removed requestanimationframe portion as i agree it s not necessary update 2 response to andrew s 2nd jun 2016 updated answer thanks andrew - that appears to work in every browser i could find win desktop ie google-chrome opera firefox
android google-chrome opera and firefox ios safari

37564678
serializable	deserialization
regarding your second point the docs seem to say that from 2.0 on missing fields are excluded from serializable output
to force none on load you can use the missing parameter missing default deserialization value for the field if the field is not found in the input data

37566539
hive	hdfs
i think execution of your hive query results huge output and its not being redirected to somewhere
i suggest the output of your select query should go into somewhere in hdfs for that you need to redirect the output of your select query to some external internal hive tables

37569099
caanimation	calayer
a caanimation object is supposed to be reused from time to time and that s why i don t like to give it a certain key since it s not unique
what makes it unique is the association with a calayer with addanimation forkey

37570356
swift	objective-c
swift code put this in a file say call it utilities.swift call it like this and because i can t keep describing code in commends i m putting a modified version of your gameviewcontroller class viewdidload method below which incorporates the logic for not including the adds whenever that view is loaded in the future
first off i m not proficient with swift but if you don t know objective-c i can try to convert this for you it ll just take me a little more time

37576994
viewmodel	caliburn
i assume timespanviewmodel is a property you have on your viewmodel which has an and the viewmodel is exporting itself
even if this might not solve the issue it is the right thing to do and caliburn will make sure it s bound correctly

37579424
octal	decimal
switching to datacontractjsonserializer or javascriptserializer are also options if you do not need the full functionality of json.net since both will silently parse an integer with a leading zero in base 10. my speculation is that newtonsoft added this functionality to handle numbers formatted in the javascript syntax for integer literals integers integers can be expressed in decimal base 10 hexadecimal base 16 octal base 8 and binary base 2
decimal integer literal consists of a sequence of digits without a leading 0 zero

37580973
gridview	checkboxlist
ie gridview binds to a datasource but within the gridview there is a column with a checkboxlist and its own datasource
using eval yourcolumn tries to bind to the main datasource of the gridview and not the checkboxlist

37584923
bit-shift	xor
operands you can bit-shift and perform logic operations such as and or not xor on these values directly in assembler language you would fetch the value from a pointer address and load it into a registry then perform these operations on that registry
so what happens is this the means bit-shift to the left

37585058
jar	war
however if a persistence unit of the same name is defined by an ejb-jar war or application jar file within the ear the persistence unit of that name defined at ear level will not be visible to the components defined by that ejb-jar war or application jar file unless the persistence unit reference uses the persistence unit name # syntax to specify a path name to disambiguate the reference
when the # syntax is used the path name is relative to the referencing application component jar file

37585207
google-chrome	firefox
i m not sure if there s a corresponding cors message in firefox like in google-chrome but there might be
i wasted a bunch of time wondering why a page wasn t working one day while troubleshooting a similar technology content security policy csp only to find that i had the relevant firefox messages hidden. you shouldn t need to mess with the crossorigin property attribute unless you set crossorigin use-credentials javascript or crossorigin use-credentials html somewhere but you probably didn t do that because that part of the html spec isn t finalized yet and it would almost certainly cause your content to break after doing so since credentials would be required at that point

37586713
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
the default behavior works well when both your primary and secondary view controllers are uinavigationcontroller but not in other cases
in your app your primary is a uitabbarcontroller and after you launch detail once the secondary is also a uitabbarcontroller

37587106
bower	npm
the way cls-bluebird is used in request-promise confuses bower in thinking that it s a regular dependency so it tries to include it in the generated bundle
but because dev dependencies aren t normally installed during npm install package it s missing and you get an error about a missing module

37589536
nstextview	nstextstorage
when you set in a nstextview this text view creates a nstextfinder internally and forwards the search replace commands to it
unfortunately nstextview does not seem to handle correctly the changes you make programmatically to its associated nstextstorage which causes the crashes you mention

37602614
intersect	contains
where clause doesn t filter the rows axis it filters the dimension members on the axes that intersect with the members specified in the where clause
reference having said that you have to specify tuples or set of members in the where clause example where strtomember year strtomember converts a ssrs text parameter year contains value to a valid mdx member

37603183
client-side	server-side
i assume that you have a validationsummary control similar to this if any of your validators has client-side validation enabled the default value it will prevent the postback when the client validation fails so that server-side validation will not be performed
in your current code the regularexpressionvalidator has client-side validation enabled not explicitly disabled in fact

37603183
client-side	server-side
in your current code the regularexpressionvalidator has client-side validation enabled not explicitly disabled in fact
if it fails the server-side validation for the required fields is not performed and the other error messages are not displayed

37604371
bash	zsh
edit after some tries i just found out that this works with bash however i could not make to work
i know you asked about bash but i am amazed that this works with zsh #

37604371
bash	zsh
i know you asked about bash but i am amazed that this works with zsh #
usr bin env zsh cat 3-lines.txt | read -d 4 my_var my_other_var my_third_var unfortunately this doesn t work with bash at least the versions i tried

37604371
bash	zsh
usr bin env zsh cat 3-lines.txt | read -d 4 my_var my_other_var my_third_var unfortunately this doesn t work with bash at least the versions i tried
the magic here is the -d 4 this doesn t work in bash that sets the line delimiter to be the eot character which will be found at the end of your cat

37605050
direct3d	directx
if you aren t already an expert in direct3d 11 graphics programming i d recommend waiting on directx 12
take a look at directx tool kit and it s tutorials or look at frank s earlier books as a starting place

37609830
junit	testng	junit	mockito
but testng creates only one object and thus the state in fields is shared between to test s for mockito you need to init mocks before every test method so that the state is not shared between two test s in testng for junit it works out of box because 2nd test has its own fields and its own mocks
there is a difference in the behaviour of these frameworks junit creates a new instance of class for every of its test methods

37610830
portrait	landscape
the problem is you are not specify a min width for landscape phones and portrait tablets
so at 767px and less xss2 is hidden anyway even in portrait phones and smaller case

37611094
mathml	mathjax
unfortunately they differ in bugs so here s one mathml sample for each
the following works well in wiris but not mathjax the next one works roughly ok with mathjax with the mml3 extension use but not wiris

37611335
implements	extends
so if you plan to implements datetimeinterface with your own implementation this will not work however you can create your own interface and adapt the native datetime classes
or you can extends the native datetime variants which will then implements the datetimeinterface obviously details why you cannot implements your own classes implementing datetimeinterface tl

37621468
tvos	ios
not by running a libpcap-based program on ios because darwin by default makes the bpf devices openable only by root so on os x ios tvos only a process running with root privileges can use libpcap to capture network traffic
without jailbreaking you can t run a program as root on ios or tvos

37623150
ienumerable	ilist
things like returns null because a isn t a you can read more in this questions convert list derivedclass to list baseclass cannot convert from list derivedclass to list baseclass you can solve your problem calling cast extension that is available for ienumerable this extension project the enumerable to a new casting each element to the specified generic type however if you classes have a common class or interface and as is co-variant you try something like this
linq extensions are available for generic enumerables ilist is basically a ienumerable so the extensions will no be available for a ilist

37631186
dictionary	map
snapshot.value isn t a user it s a dictionary here s a couple of options - there are many
then within the user class map the snapshot.values to the user properties or oh and don t forget that by using .value your snapshot may return multiple child nodes so those will need to be iterated over in your case it s just one user so it s fine they way you have it

37632625
factors	mean
in practice the deciding factors for most people will be the fact that mongodb allows ad-hoc querying with a sql like syntax while couchdb doesn t you ve got to create map reduce views which turns some people off even though creating these views is rapid application development friendly - they have nothing to do with stored procedures
to address points raised in the accepted answer couchdb has a great versionning system but it doesn t mean that it is only suited or more suited for places where versionning is important

37632637
inline	inlining
it isn t wrong to inline the method by hand it just isn t necessary
inlining small methods is one of the standard optimizations performed by the jitter

37633313
implements	extends
since you are extends jdialog you can implements 0 or more interfaces but you cannot extends another class
if your interface has two methods then your class can have public class customdialog extends jdialog implements customdialoginterface as long as customdialog has the methods doa and dob

37639409
build.gradle	gradlew
you can then alter the build.gradle file for your module so that the library is only included as a debug dependency debugcompile com.example.yourlibrary please note that if you re planning on doing anything more complicated dagger is a very useful library as it allows you to inject different dependencies depending on what flavor you are building
you can use a combination of proguard and sourcesets to ensure that libraries aren t compiled into your release application and gradlew properties to apply plugins conditionally

37639708
firefox	safari
a ligature is a combination of two or more letters joined as a single glyph root cause this issue with missing characters is due to ligature support provided by these modern browsers - let me explain how 1.the tool while converting - it converts characters to glyphs using poppler for rendering - now these browser when they come across characters like tt tf ti firefox fi consider them to be ligature and searches for glyphs corresponding to tt and not t t 2.since they do not have their corresponding glyphs - they just skip the characters and renders the rest - so we fount the characters missing could be solved by disabling turning-off the ligature in these browsers - embedding the css in the generating content for more details please refer prevent ligatures in safari mavericks ios7 via css please correct me if i am wrong
the above issue occurs only in - webkit web browsers like chrome and safari - which provides support for ligatures - whereas browser like firefox does not

37645556
ssl	https
browsers has build in list of trusted ca now since in your case it is server-server communication so you need to make sure that the consuming service s ssl certificate is present in your server s keystore else your server will not be able to trust that certificate and hence ssl connection will not establish
if you want to consume a https web service from your spring application then you will need to make sure that the service s ssl certificate is present in your application web server s key store

37646525
opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
all browsers support or chrome.runtime.oninstalled or browser.runtime.oninstalled so the right way is to start scripts in your extension with this code and then use browser for example browser.runtime.oninstalled i m sorry about my english edit google-chrome and opera support google-chrome and not browser
firefox support google-chrome and browser

37647229
punctuation	words
the anagram doesn t contain any punctuation or letter case of the original words s
now you want to find all true solutions where you use up all characters of the anagram and decode it into words s from the dictionary

37648206
virtualenv	conda
i finally resorted to using conda to set up an environment rather than virtualenv
apparently virtualenv is not compatible with anaconda

37648314
sudo	passwd
install sudo on the remote server if not already installed
then configure it to allow ubuntu user to execute service nginx reload command as root without passwd prompt

37649330
client-side	server-side
note but remember that by using this approach you can validate multiple validation groups on client-side only
this does not automatically also validate multiple groups on server-side

37649937
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox network configuration make sure use this proxy server for all protocols box is checked no proxy for input field is empty if it doesn t help you can try out the following add the next line to user.properties file log_level.jmeter.protocol.http.proxy restart jmeter to pick the property up look for anything suspicious in jmeter.log file if nothing help you can consider an alternative way of recording a jmeter test - jmeter google-chrome extension
a couple of assumptions your site uses https transport and firefox isn t configured to record https traffic your site is running on your local machine and firefox is configured to not to use proxy for local addresses

37650095
postgresql	mysql
as a regular user of postgresql i assure you that this is not reason enough to switch to postgreql from mysql
if you look at the bigger picture and all other factors definitely postgresql is better but don t let this issue be the deciding factor

37651392
backgrounding	multitasking
applicationwillsuspend method doesn t exist natively but in the appdelegate.m you can play with applicationwillresignactive and applicationwillresignactive these methods will be called when the user hits the home button and the app will go to the backgrounding here you can keep your connection live but you should read the apple documentation regarding backgrounding tasks because your connection cannot be live forever if the app remains in the backgrounding
there are other ways to keep your app up to date like update on push notification etc and this method will be called when the app will get terminated closed completely from multitasking

37651787
ionic	angular
i am using ionic to build mobile apps and i don t think that angular is must
ionic is not just couple of angular directives it has tools built around it too

37651787
ionic	angular
ionic is not just couple of angular directives it has tools built around it too
css and javascript are separated so in theory you should be able to use something else in place of angular and still be able to use ionic tools

37653177
.htaccess	httpd.conf
i would also check to see whether there is a block of configuration in either your httpd.conf or the virtual hosts configuration that is similar as it is possible that this is catching some directories and not others and that your .htaccess is not doing what is expected
as a further check i would try removing or temporarily renaming .htaccess to htaccess-removed or something similar to confirm that the url request headers are no longer being included using the curl or other approaches to validating the cors headers

37658164
ubuntu	debian
1 i learnt this trick when trying to pip install matplotlib on ubuntu
as a general solution to install python packages with binary dependencies 1 on debian ubuntu sudo apt-get build-dep python-ldap # installs system dependencies but not the package itself pew workon my_virtualenv # enter your virtualenv pip install python-ldap you ll have to check the name of your python package on ubuntu versus pypi

37659788
udp	tcp
i won t go on a speech about how you should use tcp before udp and only use udp when absolutely necessary
for your problem the fact is that udp doesn t have any connection

firefox	safari
as of 2016-06-06 nexthopprotocol is only available in firefox s resourcetiming implementation
it is not available in their navigationtiming or in either navigationtiming nor resourcetiming for chrome ff and safari

namenode	hdfs
allow me to add the following namenode does not directly read or write data
client your java program using direct access to hdfs interacts with namenode to update hdfs namespace and retrieve block locations for reading writing

37663266
super	extends	super	self
there is an alternative using super that does not require to explicitly reference the base class name
base class a in b accessing the property getter of the parent class a as others have already answered it s super b self .prop or in python 3 super .prop this returns the value returned by the getter of the property not the getter itself but it s sufficient to extends the getter

37663266
super	extends	super	self
base class a in b accessing the property getter of the parent class a as others have already answered it s super b self .prop or in python 3 super .prop this returns the value returned by the getter of the property not the getter itself but it s sufficient to extends the getter
in b accessing the property setter of the parent class a the best recommendation i ve seen so far is the following a.prop.fset self value i believe this one is better super b self.__class__ .prop.fset self value in this example both options are equivalent but using super has the advantage of being independent from the base classes of b

37663266
super	extends
in b accessing the property setter of the parent class a the best recommendation i ve seen so far is the following a.prop.fset self value i believe this one is better super b self.__class__ .prop.fset self value in this example both options are equivalent but using super has the advantage of being independent from the base classes of b
if b were to inherit from a c class also extends the property you would not have to update b s code

37667712
serializable	deserialization
static fields are part of the object initialization and are not part of the serializable form as they can should be reconstructed at the receiving side in a remoting operation
note that it could work if the object is smart enough to rebuild its contents on deserialization

37669538
comparator	comparable
as a rule python implements its own sorting functions entirely in terms of __lt__ it doesn t use any of the other rich comparator operators not even __eq__ so it s a good idea to design your own algorithm the same way so anything sorted can handle you can handle the same way
as noted in the comments comparable isn t a state of being it s only meaningful as a descriptor for a pair of types

37672907
build.gradle	gradlew
i think in that android project embedded was a custom configuration defined in a build.gradle file so you can use embedded com.eyeverify evserviceinterface 2.6.1-release aar
the keyword embedded doesn t exist in gradlew syntax

37674350
build.gradle	gradlew
at the command line cd to the folder where the build.gradle script is stored and run or if this works ok but the eclipse build still fails than you will know that the problem lies somewhere in your eclipse config
if building the project with gradlew from the command line does not work then there is an underlying problem with you project or gradlew setup

37675190

lxml	beautifulsoup
documentation recommends that you install and use lxml for speed
beautifulsoup html lxml if you re using a version of python 2 earlier than 2.7.3 or a version of python 3 earlier than 3.2.2 it s essential that you install lxml or html5lib python s built-in html parser is just not very good in older versions

apache	nginx
i merged all the variables i could find on the official documentation in this list a page with such a list of log-usable variables would be much appreciated in nginx documentation just like what apache uwsgi or gunicorn documentation have
going through nginx documentation it is indeed unclear what variables can be used in the log format directive or not

rdf	owl
rdf have no way of referring to positions in triples so you cannot use a property between two predicates
what is certainly meant by the op is can we use owl sameas between two properties

37682124
rdf	owl
the issue is that there is something quantumdesque about rdf graphs the meaning of an rdf graph is a superposition of meanings and you only know the observable meaning when you apply some reasoning according to some formal semantics
rdf 1.1 semantics defines multiple semantics so-called entailment regimes but none of them gives a specific meaning to owl sameas so applying rdf s reasoning wouldn t bring anything useful

37682124
rdf	owl
rdf 1.1 semantics defines multiple semantics so-called entailment regimes but none of them gives a specific meaning to owl sameas so applying rdf s reasoning wouldn t bring anything useful
consequently if such is the observed meaning of the graph owl sameas between properties is useless

37682124
rdf	owl
the direct semantics does not apply to rdf graphs it applies to ontologies in the functional-style syntax of the owl 2 structural specification
in order to interpret an rdf graph according to the direct semantics one has first to map the graph to an owl 2 ontology in the functional syntax

37682535
swift	objective-c
note also that for nsobject subclasses you should override isequal instead of implementing compare nsobject subclass in swift hash vs hashvalue isequal vs
your is like all swift operators a top-level function and top-level functions are not exported to objective-c see swift type compatibility in interacting with objective-c apis

37687141
sudo	passwd
using sudo requires that you input your passwd when you run a command
by running sudo with exec you aren t providing the passwd to sudo and cannot run the command with root level privileges

37687141
sudo	passwd
by running sudo with exec you aren t providing the passwd to sudo and cannot run the command with root level privileges
ubuntu.se provides a way to pass the passwd to sudo in a single command but the result is a little messy when implemented with php because the passwd prompt will be sent to stdout when the call is made but that can be silenced by sending the output to dev null

37687506
ng-app	ng-controller
br first you missed the ng-app tag
second you missed the ng-controller tag. and the problem with fiddle is that you need to load angular by clicking in javascript and selecting the framework from there and not including it as an external resource

37687578
decimal	ieee
so don t worry about precision if you do not use a specific machine atypic architectures or very very old computers or high precision decimal 64bits double
the default ones will always follow the same standard ieee 754

37688969
daemons	systemd
this will cause jenkins to assume that your daemons is not spawned by the jenkins build
i tried the following in a build step execute windows batch command command relative path depending on manage jenkins configure systemd advanced.

37691604
build.gradle	gradlew
i was able to get past the methodtype not found error by adding my java home s runtime jar to gradlew s bootclasspath in the project s build.gradle file
however the app would not deploy to a device or emulator because the app transformclasseswithprejackpackagedlibrariesfordebug gradlew task fails

37698178
prepare	execute
all you can do is to create the appropriate sql command by string concatenation and issue it using a prepare statement
the only catch with prepare statements is that they are not execute in the context of your function

37699535
sudo	passwd
but when you have crontab sudo as root and run the php script it works
i have thought of a possible solution that doesn t require storing the root passwd in a text file on the system

37707736
backgrounding	multitasking
when a message is being received in appdelegate this way the app is being launched in the backgrounding even if it doesn t show up in the multitasking screen
but since i wasn t explicitly asking ios for backgrounding time my code in didreceivemessage wasn t always being fully executed

37708068
swift	objective-c
swift version 3.0-dev llvm 8fcf602916 clang cf0a734990 swift 000d413a62 on linux does not reproduce this behavior with or without foundation imported try it online
this behavior is due to the playground runtime bridging to objective-c cocoa apis behind-the-scenes

37708460
onresume	onpause
the reason for this is that you must not call enableforegrounddispatch before onresume and you are required to call disableforegrounddispatch at latest in onpause
in fact it does not make sense to use enableforegrounddispatch disableforegrounddispatch anywhere other than in onresume onpause

37713789
virtualenv	conda
conda create --name datasci jupyter install the latest version of rodeo open rodeo and set the python path to your fresh anaconda virtualenv
in my case anaconda envs datasci bin python if you re not sure what path to set open terminal activate your virtualenv source activate datasci run which python more details in the rodeo docs

37715833
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and other browsers are more forgiving if there are # s in the datauri but firefox isn t
this is not a bug in firefox

37716922
backgrounding	multitasking
this is covered by clause 2.16 of the app store review guidelines 2.16 multitasking apps may only use backgrounding services for their intended purposes voip audio playback location task completion local notifications etc
the external-accessory backgrounding mode is for mfi accessories not ble accessories

37717138
dataframe	multi-index
for your first dataframe you run unequal groupings or unequal index lengths coercing a series return which in the combine processing does not adequately yield a data frame
since a data frame cannot combine different length series it instead yields a multi-index series

37718627
spaces	delimiter
spaces is the delimiter for command line arguments
you ll be better off not using spaces in your directory and file names if possible

37719353
ssl	https
here you are a simple tutorial if you want a green bar i suggest buy an ssl certificate instead of generating one tomcat tag in web.xml is not needed
to force https disable the http connector usually on port 8080

37720126
equals	compareto
while you are in it i suggest to remember some key facts about compareto methods compareto must be in consistent with equals method if two objects are equals via equals there compareto must return zero otherwise if those objects are stored in sortedset or sortedmap they will not behave properly
compareto must throw nullpointerexception if current object get compared to null object as opposed to equals which return false on such scenario

37723835
ssl	https
use following address instead google does not issue ssl certificates for double-wildcard domains hosted at appspot.com
therefore with https you must use the string -dot- instead of . to separate subdomains as shown in the examples below

37728255
setinterval	settimeout
although setinterval can be used here
the while loop will not wait for settimeout to complete

37729213
postgresql	mysql
the example will be identical with the mysql one but you ll have to use the proper url for postgresql instead and reference the jdbc driver which will depend on which postgresql jdbc driver you use
jdbc postgresql localhost test this is a configuration option in solr and isn t related to .net or other external dependencies

37733617
subtraction	modulo	addition	modulo	multiplication	modulo
that applies especially to shifts but addition subtraction and even multiplication also make sense on bitvectors and combine usefully with the usual bitwise operations
the algebraic structure you get when allowing wrapping z 2 k z is fairly nice perhaps not as nice as modulo a prime but that would interact badly with the bitvector interpretation and it doesn t match typical hardware and well known so it s not like anything particularly unexpected or weird will happen it s not like a wrapped result is a uselessly arbitrary result

37733867
equals	gethashcode
if gethashcode returns a value that doesn t end up putting two objects into the same bucket of the hash table it ll assume that they re not equals and will never try to call equals on them
you will find as you try to figure out a correct implementation for gethashcode that there s a fundamental problem with how you re trying to group your objects

37735654
cifs	smb
cifs in many linux distros currently do not have encryption support which azure file storage requires in cross-region smb traffic
quoting the note at note the linux smb client doesn t yet support encryption so mounting a file share from linux still requires that the client be in the same azure region as the file share

37736463
rspec	capybara
thoughtbot has a great blog post on waiting for ajax which you can read here though it is based on rspec and it looks like you are using testunit
it works great for situations when capybara doesn t quite wait long enough but doesn t add unnecessarily long timeouts

37737192
content-length	content-type
post http 1.1 user-agent fiddler host localhost 5076 content-type application json content-length 7 alice when a parameter has frombody web api uses the content-type header to select a formatter
in this example the content-type is application json and the request body is a raw json string not a json object

37737510
quicksort	mergesort
in-place merge sort and quicksort should take around the same space because they are both in-place
for mergesort in-place means o log n extra space from keeping the relevant indices of the array of length n not the strictest o 1 meaning of in-place

37739934
swift	objective-c
this seems to be an issue with swift
if you try this code in objective-c the compiler gives an error expression is not assignable

37740461
rvm	bundler
2.in case you have homebrew installed try brew install ruby 3.if the above solutions don t work the case could be that you are not sourcing rvm correctly because you are not in a login shell therefore run source .rvm scripts rvm and then you can execute bundle install
4.last thing is as you are already using rvm might be the case that rvm was not selected as default so run rvm use 2.1.1 --default and then run bundle install 5.also you can try before installing bundler

37748154
super	implements
now off course that assuming we have a magical calculateroutes function is not a serious assumption though it s not a super hard task to implements this function in an optimized manner meaning actually send the server only routes that we did not calculate before etc
but this is just logic and not the state of the application thus as long as you keep the contract defined by the store and reducers you are free to implements it any way you d like

37749220
firefox	safari
a ligature is a combination of two or more letters joined as a single glyph root cause this issue with missing characters is due to ligature support provided by these modern browsers - let me explain how 1.the tool while converting - it converts characters to glyphs using poppler for rendering - now these browser when they come across characters like tt tf ti firefox fi consider them to be ligature and searches for glyphs corresponding to tt and not t t 2.since they do not have their corresponding glyphs - they just skip the characters and renders the rest - so we fount the characters missing could be solved by disabling turning-off the ligature in these browsers - embedding the css in the generating content for more details please refer prevent ligatures in safari mavericks ios7 via css please correct me if i am wrong
the above issue occurs only in - webkit web browsers like chrome and safari - which provides support for ligatures - whereas browser like firefox does not

37749870
ubuntu	linux
the source of the answer was taken from permission issue with emacs for non-root user ubuntu 11.10
i had the same issue recently on 4.4.0-22-generic gnu linux ubuntu 16.04 lts and for me the only thing that worked is you might get chown cannot read directory home my_user .emacs.d permission denied then simply do sudo chown -r topenmind .emacs.d it worked like a charm for me

37752309
union	distinct
the type of an expression that can never produce a value is the empty union type a union of zero types of which no values are instances
this is distinct from the type of nothing since nothing is a normal but uninteresting value so it cannot be an instance of

37752591
innodb	myisam
innodb supports transactions
myisam the legacy mysql engine doesn t

37754930
stateless	stateful
stateless session beans are intended to be used to encapsulate other ejb services transactions security scheduling etc. so member variables should only be used to cache state that can be used regardless of the client caching references to datasource usertransaction etc. not to store state
the expected results are stateful - stateful session beans have timeouts so you should never inject a stateful session bean into a long-lived object such as a servlet

37755902
sudo	passwd
you re asking for trouble another way is to make use of sudo if you modify your exec in php to run exec sudo ... and enable your web-user to run the scripts without a passwd prompt it could work
bare in mind it s not recommended to give www-data sudo access rather do something like this and change your php script to have the following that way at least your entire web service isn t given root access via the default username

37757496
pandas	dask
essentially dask can do pandas operations out-of-core so you can work with datasets that don t fit into memory
the dask.dataframe api is a subset of the pandas api so there shouldn t be much of a learning curve

37757496
pandas	dask
the dask.dataframe api is a subset of the pandas api so there shouldn t be much of a learning curve
see the dask dataframe overview page for some additional dataframe specific details

37758123
boost	stl
boost is big library
if you need boost you do not need stl

37758123
boost	stl
if you need boost you do not need stl
if stl is enough for your needs then you can use just stl

37759406
subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication
by restricting addition and subtraction to arrays of the same type name we can essentially do what you re trying to achieve
this assumes that you really want a vector space in this case we only need to define addition between vector elements but not multiplication although that is also easy to implement in the same way

37759406
division	multiplication
by leaving multiplication division alone these will work as expected for scalars and two objects like this shouldn t be multiplied by each other
if you want to go beyond a linear space you should define __mul__ __rmul__ __truediv__ __rtruediv__ similarly the latter assume python 3 or from __future__ import division

37763098
inline	constexpr	constexpr	inline-functions
rules for static values initialization are speaking only about constexpr not inline-functions
constexpr implies inline but inline doesn t imply constexpr

37763098
inline	constexpr
constexpr implies inline but inline doesn t imply constexpr
just pick any of rules for function to be constexpr below and let your function break it

37763098
inline	constexpr
a constexpr specifier used in a function declaration implies inline
a constexpr function must satisfy the following requirements it must not be virtual its return type must be literaltype each of its parameters must be literaltype there exists at least one argument value such that an invocation of the function could be an evaluated subexpression of a core constant expression for constexpr function templates at least one specialization must satisfy this requirement for constructors use in a constant initializer is sufficient since c++14 the function body must be either deleted or defaulted or contain only the following null statements static_assert declarations typedef declarations and alias declarations that do not define classes or enumerations using declarations using directives exactly one return statement

37763490
swift	objective-c
to make things not too easy i decided to use swift rather than objective-c in which existing tutorials were available
converting the calls wasn t that bad and i even found almost-ready example of creating mtaudioprocessingtap in swift 2

37763490
swift	objective-c
however using c apis that extensively use pointers case in point vdsp with swift gets cumbersome rather quickly at least comparing to how it s done with objective-c
this was also an issue when i initially wrote mtaudioprocessingtaps in swift i couldn t pass audiotapcontext around without failures in objective-c getting the context is as easy as and all the unsafemutablepointers made me think swift isn t the right tool for the job

37763490
swift	objective-c
this was also an issue when i initially wrote mtaudioprocessingtaps in swift i couldn t pass audiotapcontext around without failures in objective-c getting the context is as easy as and all the unsafemutablepointers made me think swift isn t the right tool for the job
so for the processing class i ditched swift and refactored it in objective-c

37763767
swift	objective-c
unlike objective-c which is a proper superset of c swift has been built as an entirely new language
swift cannot compile c code because the syntax is not compatible

37765704
elasticsearch	kibana
as cloud foundry currently supports only publishing http and https endpoints you cannot use swisscom s provided instance for that but must deploy your own instance and configure this to use your published elasticsearch endpoint
the elk stack has three components elasticsearch - storage index logstash - receive and process log messages like syslog json text kibana - web ui to search and visualize like written by fydor you cannot reach elk s service endpoints from the outside

37765857
swift	objective-c
implement these delegate methods only in objective-c not in swift
the problem is that this objective-c declaration is illegal the illegality is that mkmapviewdelegate already declares a method called mapview viewforannotation but with a different first parameter type

37767878
freebsd	linux
for example on a unix that supports ip_dontfrag such as freebsd one could use unix.setsockoptint and dig the relevant constant value
on linux there is not ip_dontfrag as you discovered from the question you linked

37768283
required	placeholder
unfortunately this required javascript which defeats the whole purpose of this post
i ve also noticed that your placeholder text doesn t really work properly since the text search is still there

37768507
vim	atom-editor	emacs	atom-editor
if the above command doesn t work you may need to set an editor replace vim with any command line editor you re comfortable with emacs nano etc
you can get it to work with gui editors like atom-editor but you may need to pass in additional arguments to force the process to wait until you close the window

37771738
super	self
a simplified example to demonstrate super takes a class and moves one to the right in the method resolution order
so super c self .__init__ calls b.__init__ which should be obvious but super b self .__init__ in this context calls a.__init__ and not object.__init__ which probably is less obvious

37771738
super	self
so super c self .__init__ calls b.__init__ which should be obvious but super b self .__init__ in this context calls a.__init__ and not object.__init__ which probably is less obvious
this is because in the above code example c has the following method resolution order to put it in pictures the left if what you might expect the right is what s actually happening mental model actual model c c | | b b a | | | a | object object so if b doesn t call it s super this results in a s __init__ not being called after calling super c self .__init__

37778442
ubuntu	debian
the problem is that some ubuntu and others distro come with the google cloud sdk installed through the local package manager but it doesn t contain everything
kubectl for example is missing as seen with this command gcloud components list when you try to add the needed component for kubernetes with gcloud components install kubectl you end up with this error error gcloud.components.update the component manager is disabled for this installation it is a known issue on the google cloud sdk issue tracker issue 336 kubectl not installed by google-cloud-sdk debian package and not installable unfortunately it provides a poor experience for first timer testing kubernetes as it s hard to find a quick and clean step by step solution

37778785
dictionary	map
because here the key is type of the object instead of isinstance check if more than one user-defined types map to a single builtin type keyerror will arise if the type is not in the dictionary
so you have to explicitly add every user-defined type to the switch dictionary

37784722
mp3	ogg
you have several options change encoding format from ogg to mp3 in your virtual dj software
keep in mind that firefox will not be able to play mp3 streams on some platforms using html5 audio tag due to licensing limitations

37786942
postgresql	mysql
this is because postgresql is the only database engine that returns the identifiers of all inserted rows and not just the first or the last one
that means that if you are using mysql you should do samplemodel.query .insert data

37788307
mathml	mathjax
so you end up with a race when you set a low timeout the jquery part runs first and replaces the not yet mathjax-processed mathml in the page
then mathjax comes in and renders what it finds in the dom

37788488
noexcept	throw
end note emphasis mine so really it doesn t matter whether you destructor itself has noexcept false or not
it s forbidden to throw in this case final word

37793921
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
nonetheless this doesn t explain why everything is smooth in firefox and safari but not in google-chrome
i filed a report to google-chrome and hope they will answer here but there is no guarantee

37798238
udp	tftp
if you mean the trivial file transfer protocol then it s based on udp which is connection-less so there s really no way to check the status of a connection that doesn t exist
tftp is basically a request-response type of protocol so the only way to check a connection is to send a request and see if you get a response within a certain amount of time

37799766
move	drag
i thought maybe because i had my file was in a group nested in the xcode project that this was the cause so i move the video file to the root of my xcode project still no luck this was my code originally this was the name of my file testvid1.mp4 renaming the video file to testvid1.mp4 fixed my issue so at least the oftype string argument is case sensitive
after following neelam verma s answer or dawid s answer which has the same end result as neelam verma s answer difference being that dawid s answer starts with the drag and drop of the file into the xcode project and neelam verma s answer starts with a file already a part of the xcode project i still could not get nsbundle.mainbundle .pathforresource file-title oftype type to find my video file

37800985
sudo	passwd
you now have to remove the passwd restriction for sudo for the gitlab-runner user
start the sudo editor with now add the following to the bottom of the file do not do this for gitlab runners that can be executed by untrusted users

37801512
swt	swing
although i ve not tried them there are some examples in the swt org jfree experimental directory included in the distribution
a concrete implementatoin of createpartcontrol creates the swt controls for this workbench part. you re creating an applicationframe a subclass of jframe which is a swing top-level container

37801868
bash	subshell
for an overview of the scenarios in which a subshell is created in bash see this answer of mine which however doesn t cover the optimizing-away scenarios
1 in bash v4.2+ you can set option lastpipe off by default in order to make the last pipeline segment run in the current shell instead of a subshell

37812213
swift	objective-c
whereas this cannot be true in singleton although swift likes to optimizes
static dispatch are 4 times faster than dynamic dispatch as far as objective-c runtime is used

37814165
express	node.js
you need to download the typescript community stubs for express express-serve-static-core and serve-static modules to get express methods resolved press download... choose needed modules from the list
res.render is an express framework method it s not a part of node.js core

37818131
sudo	passwd
sudo doesn t run a shell by default but can be made to run one with either of the following options -s non-login shell -i login shell as for what shell is used man states for -s applies analogously to -i
emphasis mine run the shell specified by the shell environment variable if it is set or the shell specified by the invoking user s passwd database entry

37820917
pthreads	fork
on the other hand pthreads does not explicitly forbid the process in which a c program runs to execute fork or any other function prior to the commencement of the defined c semantics
in the sense that what is not forbidden is allowed pthreads does allow it

37820995
dbcontext	objectcontext
you need to use dbcontext not dbcontext a dbcontext instance represents a combination of the unit of work and repository patterns such that it can be used to query from a database and group together changes that will then be written back to the store as a unit
dbcontext is conceptually similar to objectcontext

37821288
jspm	npm
i will quote my answer from this issue everything seems to work more often if you login to npm using npm login . i can now run jspm install
jspm needs some cli messages warning users about rate limiting on users who are not logged in to npmjs

37821288
jspm	npm
jspm needs some cli messages warning users about rate limiting on users who are not logged in to npmjs
login to npm and you will receive less 500 errors

37828294
g++	gcc
you would be better off making your rules a little more targeted such as untested but should be close all data data main.o libdb_manager.so gcc -o data main.o -ldb_manager main.o main.c gcc -o main.o main.c libdb_manager.so db_manager.cpp g++ -c -wall -werror -fpic -o db_manager.o db_manager.cpp g++ -shared -o libdb_manager.so db_manager.o that way if you make a small change to one part like main.c it doesn t have to go and compile link everything in your build tree
gcc -o data main.c not sure why you have this line in your makefile since it will compile main.c without reference to the previously created library and hence cause an undefined-symbol error such as the one you re seeing

37831411
namenode	hdfs
with ha high availability cluster if you are setting up ha cluster then you may not need to use secondary namenode because standby namenode keep its state synchronized with the active namenode
the hdfs namenode high availability feature enables you to run redundant namenodes in the same cluster in an active passive configuration with a hot standby.both namenode require the same type of hardware configuration.in ha hadoop cluster active namenode reads and write metadata information in separate journalnode

37834260
equals	compareto
it should be mentioned since you stated to have a ordering which is not consistent with equals that the treeset will also not be fully compliant with the set contract as stated in its documentation note that the ordering maintained by a set whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if it is to correctly implement the set interface
this is so because the set interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a treeset instance performs all element comparisons using its compareto or compare method so two elements that are deemed equal by this method are from the standpoint of the set equal

37836808
required	placeholder
templating address object all i have done is extract out the templating into a function like so then change the template signature in you column to something like this this way we just pass in the object to the function and any changes required can be performed in the function note useful if you are using this in a lot of places within your code
it also performs a simple check to see if the item exists and if it doesn t then it puts a placeholder piece of text in its place

37838929
boost	allocator
you can look to boost circular_buffer as an alternative
given the vector you mention you could also look to wrap that with the cache interface you desire but changing the allocator is not the correct route

37840057
move	drag
i need to be able to resize my text area and the resize operation should move the other divs out of the way instead of letting them on top of the current text area.
this already works when i drag the area to the bottom down but not to the right

37841193
csv	tsv
in order to make it work you would pipe the above through sed to get valid csv and proper column names like this sed with these regular expressions will create an intermediate representation looking like that _from _to sourceport targetport 192.168.84.3 192.189.42.52 5868 1214 the generated edges will look like that
you could combine the tsv importer if it wouldn t fail converting the ips fixed in arangodb 3.0 so you need a bit more conversion logic to get valid csv

37842985
serializable	deserialization
another gotcha with this pattern is that if you need to serializable your type with a serializable that does not support this pattern you may want to manually suppress output of this property during serializable and probably will need to manually set it during deserialization
since each serializable may have its own custom mechanism for suppressing properties or no mechanism at all

37843777
client-side	server-side
server-side code client-side code
defining a variable on your server doesn t mean that it will be also accessible on the client-side

37844738
r-tree	quadtree
just because r-tree can be twice fast than a quadtree when perfectly implemented
the speed difference between a quadtree and a r-tree is not relevant

37845122
allocator	stl
whether you re using malloc free or standard library containers the issue is with dynamic allocator
first stl is not new

37846629
stateless	stateful
there is a caveat that we are currently working through the web host for stateless uses kestrel which presents some difficulties for stateful services where multiple replicas share the same process because kestrel doesn t have the same port-sharing capabilities that http.sys-based hosts do
we re working on a solution that makes it easier to use kestrel for stateful but in the meantime you can always use the weblistener host which is the http.sys-based host

37850266
jar	manifest.mf
turns out spigot doesn t recognize any jar files other than spigot plugins on execution
shading would ve solved my issue but instead i did this which also works created a file called manifest.mf within my project directory

37851081
google-chrome	firefox
on google-chrome it will work without appending and removing child
when you want to direct download any image or pdf file from browser instead on opening it in new tab then in javascript you should set value to download attribute of create dynamic link for new google-chrome update some time event is not working. for that following code will be use appending child and removing child is useful for firefox internet explorer browser only

37852348
glassfish	weblogic
oracle does not actively support glassfish they want everyone to migrate to weblogic so there s more googling for you on any of less encountered bugs
it s a fork of glassfish and they maintain it actively

37853065
bower	npm
i found a great tutorial about it but lost it due to private browsing i suggested to include the commands you need in the scripts section of your package.json like this before you scream nooo what the hell the full path is missing consider this. when you run a command from the scripts with npm run bower npm includes the .bin folder of your path so that the binaries can be found. magic at its finest i hope i could help some people who stumble across the same problem
okay i found out that npm does not work that way

optional step only perform in bower not working install node dependencies install node.js from make sure you check the option add path to environment variables while installing. open command prompt
install bower npm install -g bower install grunt-cli npm install -g grunt-cli install yeoman npm install -g yo extra step for angular fanboys install yeoman angular generator npm install -g generator-angular you can do all the above steps expect installing node in one command as well

super	implements
now this isn t super efficient but it should work
depending on your angular version and the surrounding code you could implements a component which gets the question and the answer instead of a reference which would remove the need for a watcher

37860708
strtol	atoi
conversion from a string to integer long may be done using strtol which is defined in stdlib.h
there s also an atoi function which is easier to use but that doesn t provide any way of checking that the conversion was successful

37862614
serializable	deserialization
your deserialized function is a copy of your serializable function and it should not be
here is what the two should look like of course you can t use this deserialization function without changing your serialization function to store the user.id or some unique identifier instead of trying to store the whole user

37866392
draggable	droppable
as far as i know you cannot know where was the draggable object from before being dropped in a droppable area
a solution i used is to store the position of an item each time you drop it in a droppable area

37866750
ssl	https
the leaflet cdn doesn t support ssl yet
you can use something not requiring https like playground-leaflet which is just a fork of jsbin with leaflet libraries easily selectable

37869493
firefox	safari
this seems to work in firefox i would not recomend doing it in that way. the most supported way should be add stop-color as an attribute add a class or id to the stop element and add a stop-color with css
interesting that safari does not support this

37870627
jar	war
i will suggest to use mvn clean install instead as it will rebuild your project and put the jar into your local maven repository so all other projects can use your locally build jar
as you already using maven why not use it to build your war files as well

37872521
swift	objective-c
unfortunately it is not possible to use a c++ class in swift directly see you cannot import c++ code directly into swift
instead create an objective-c or c wrapper for c++ code

37874651
google-chrome	firefox
i only recently realized that google-chrome had changed the behavior of onbeforeunload
i found a workaround that works for the main browsers tested in google-chrome firefox and ie the jsfiddle for some reason doesn t work in firefox but my website does

37875731
sudo	passwd
if you don t have a root passwd you can setup one using sudo passwd and fire commands
if u have not given passwd for root and you are trying to fire command on spark or haddop like . sbin stop-all.sh or . sbin start-all.sh

37877603
implements	extends
from what i understand and how i approach interface is like a specification contract any class that implements a interface class have to implements all the methods defined in the abstract class except default methods introduced in java 8 whereas i define a class abstract when i know the implementation required for some methods of the class and some methods i still do not know what will be the implementation we might know the function signature but not the implementation
i do this so that later in the part of development when i know how these methods are to be implemented i can just extends this abstract class and implements these methods

37880656
mvp	presenter
my 5 cents about mvp some things are just not avoidable in view part like starting and listening to some services example google maps or places
when doing something like that i try to leave as little logic in view and notify presenter of any interaction even if not useful at that moment and then returning the action that is needed to view

37882702
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
the ssc install documentation will contain instructions on migrating your ssc database from case-insensitive to case-sensitive
starting with fortify 4.30 or possibly 4.40 ssc started enforcing that database collation be case-sensitive before this time it was stated it should be but was not enforced

37884470
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
the exception catch block is not unreachable because exception also includes all unchecked-exception exceptions which extend runtimeexception which is a subclass of exception
the difference between checked and unchecked-exception is that for the former a method is required to either catch and handle the exception or declare that it might throw the exception with a throws clause

37886823
shadowing	named
update if there was a named shadowing at the point of imports - then the order of imports would make a difference which is something you are not used to in a lazily evaluated language where usually the order of execution of pure functions is arbitrary even though the imports are done at compile time as tikhonjelvis pointed out
the proper way to do this would either be a qualified import or an import with hiding import qualified control.applicative as ca import text.parsec or if you don t want to use qualified shadowing would not work because both imports live in the same namespace and therefore ghc cannot infer the correct choice of function the one you meant

37891405
symfony	silex
i believe you re missing the fact that you re not using silex but rather bootstrapped symfony components which look pretty similar if not the same as potencier s blog posts on how to build your framework
what you can do is refactor your code by removing most of the stuff you have pasted here because that is already part of silex and then as marc suggested register the form service provider as well as the twig one which you said you have already added via composer

37892527
ssl	https
unlike google facebook api needs a valid ssl certificate
so if your website isn t https then according to facebook you are still in development mode

37894662
vbo	vao
basically this object will remember the vbo can be multiple and how does it going to be used from glvertexattribpointer this only needed to be set once
when you re not using vao each time you unbind and bind the vbo you need to set the attribute again

37894662
vbo	vao
when you re not using vao each time you unbind and bind the vbo you need to set the attribute again
by using vao you only need to bind the vao as simple as calling glbindvertexarray gluint vaoid

37896696
decimal	ieee
conversion of a binary floating-point number to an integer or decimal format when overflow infinity or nan precludes a faithful representation in that format and this cannot otherwise be signaled 8
when the operands are unordered 5.7 table 4 point 5 from ieee 754 every operation involving a signaling nan or invalid operation 7.1 shall if no trap occurs and if a floating-point result is to be delivered deliver a quiet nan as its result

37899296
super	self
first off swift initializers want all properties of self to be set up properly to have a value before calling a super initializer
second off you mustn t use self before the super.init -call because otherwise the properties that you would set in the super constructor are not yet set meaning whoever receives the non-finished self -instance can not be sure about the state of self

37901247
build.gradle	gradlew
if that does not help consider editing your question and posting the entire build.gradle file rather than the subset
i m not using groovy at all in this app gradlew is based on groovy

37902808
avcapturesession	avassetexportsession	avassetwriter	avassetexportsession
if from the camera with avcapturesession etc progressively write the frames to file using avassetwriter avassetwriterinput if you re expecting the writing to file to be interrupted for some reason consider setting the avassetwriter s moviefragmentinterval property to something small
it s not clear where your video is coming from but exportasync makes it sound like you re using avassetexportsession with an existing file or composition

37903333
swift	objective-c
if you don t want to do anything questionable using objective-c s dynamic capabilities or adding your own touch handlers etc. and do this purely in swift unfortunately this is not possible
any time you see #selector in swift the compiler is calling objc_msgsend under the hood

37903333
swift	objective-c
any time you see #selector in swift the compiler is calling objc_msgsend under the hood
swift doesn t support objective-c s dynamicism

37903333
swift	objective-c
swift doesn t support objective-c s dynamicism
for better or for worse this means that in order to swap out the usage of this selector with a block you d probably need to perform some black magic to make it work and you d have to use objective-c constructs to do that

37905019
jar	manifest.mf
do not try adding the plug-in jar to the java build path or anything like that
if the jar you want to use is not an eclipse plug-in you must should include it as part of the plug-in and list the jar in the bundle-classpath in the manifest.mf

37905019
jar	manifest.mf
if the jar you want to use is not an eclipse plug-in you must should include it as part of the plug-in and list the jar in the bundle-classpath in the manifest.mf
if you cannot do this you can reference an external jar in the bundle-classpath using something like

37905126
move	drag
or perhaps something that jumps but doesn t move
you could just drag the correct behaviour onto the game object

37911382
prepare	execute
and did not prepare inside the loop
just execute in the loop

37912393
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
your options are to call it in viewdidappear though users will see the first screen before the transition or perform that check before displaying the login screen
viewwillappear is called when the view is not in the view hierarchy yet which is a requirement for performing a segue

37913456
swift	objective-c
swift simply doesn t have the runtime capabilities to do it
a couple of things to think about in my opinion designing ios code objective-c or swift is no different to designing code in java

37914132
implements	extends
one possible way and i m not 100 sure that this is acceptable to do or not but is to create your own model for the jtabbedpane a model which implements singleselectionmodel check the singleselectionmodel api that overrides the setselectedindex int index method the method that i m pretty sure swing uses when it wants to tell the jtabbedpane to change tabs
if you create a class that extends from the defaultsingleselectionmodel a concrete class that implements the above interface and override this method you could make method calls before the super s method is called and thus make gui calls before the tab changes

37914132
super	implements	implements	extends
if you create a class that extends from the defaultsingleselectionmodel a concrete class that implements the above interface and override this method you could make method calls before the super s method is called and thus make gui calls before the tab changes
for example your setselectedindex method could look like this and using your code above could be implements like note that i use a boolean field activated to activate the behavior change so that it doesn t fire on gui creation

37914767
super	self
python s super function makes this not too difficult to set up
you often will need a common base for the classes involved in the inheritance to stop the inheritance chain class commonbase def amethod self print commonbase # don t call super here we re the end of the inheritance chain class base1 commonbase def amethod self print base1 super .amethod class base2 commonbase def amethod self print base2 super .amethod class derived base1 base2 def amethod self print derived super .amethod now calling derived .amethod will print derived base1 base2 and finally commonbase

37914767
super	self
you often will need a common base for the classes involved in the inheritance to stop the inheritance chain class commonbase def amethod self print commonbase # don t call super here we re the end of the inheritance chain class base1 commonbase def amethod self print base1 super .amethod class base2 commonbase def amethod self print base2 super .amethod class derived base1 base2 def amethod self print derived super .amethod now calling derived .amethod will print derived base1 base2 and finally commonbase
the trick is that super passes each call on to the the next class in the mro of self even if that s not the in the current class s inheritance hierarchy

37914767
super	self
the trick is that super passes each call on to the the next class in the mro of self even if that s not the in the current class s inheritance hierarchy
so base1.amethod ends up calling base2.amethod via super since they re being run on an instance of derived

37916505
spaces	delimiter
but once you specify an alternate delimiter using usedelimiter then white spaces characters don t demarcate tokens any more
in fact your first trial can be modified to prove that white spaces characters are not delimiter any more.

37922680
dictionary	map
the graph implementation needs to store those nodes but also associate them with other data such as edges think of an adjacency dictionary
we would need a map since we have to be able to iterate over all nodes as well that s what networkx.github.io does in python and my js port of it and even if we didn t need to iterate over the nodes we probably wouldn t want them to be garbage collected if there are no other references to them since that would silently destroy the graph

37925665
equals	compareto	comparator	comparable
a treeset uses only the comparator to determine if two elements are equals note that the ordering maintained by a set whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if it is to correctly implement the set interface
see comparable or comparator for a precise definition of consistent with equals. this is so because the set interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a treeset instance performs all element comparisons using its compareto or compare method so two elements that are deemed equals by this method are from the standpoint of the set equals

37926017
mvp	presenter
if you ve implemented mvp fully your view will implement an interface and your presenter will use that interface to return data to the view
if you are testing your mvp application you will want not just your presenter to function correctly but also the interface the view uses to communicate with the presenter

37926017
mvp	presenter
if you are testing your mvp application you will want not just your presenter to function correctly but also the interface the view uses to communicate with the presenter
so your test class should implement the view s interface invoke methods of the presenter and store responses from the presenter from the local methods that override the interface

37928191
swift	objective-c
i forgot that the native version of realm swift isn t available on ios 7 and you d need to use the swift-bridged objective-c version
the equivalent code would be to clarify the filter method is only available in realm swift and its equivalent method in objective-c is objectswhere

37930554
serializable	deserialization
in managed languages like java and c# the language includes enough rtti for an external class to be able to enumerate the public fields on an object in order to perform the serializable
as other answers have mentioned c++ does not have nearly the sort of built-in serializable deserialization capabilities that java or other managed languages have

37931080
google-chrome	firefox
this jsfiddle should work for users on google-chrome windows desktop version however when i tried to use the same fiddle on edge and ie11 i found that it would create the undesired letter-box effect due to the image cover zooming too far out
html css i am not sure if this works for firefox so perhaps if you have firefox you can try it on my jsfiddle

37932915
spaces	delimiter
you are absolutely right to enclose paths in between quotation marks in order to avoid trouble with white-spaces. but instead of removing and leading and trailing spaces which are also contained within the i would try to not produce them rather than to eliminate them later
the leading space comes from the middle for f loop the filtered sc qc command produces output lines like binary_path_name c windows system32 spoolsv.exe binary_path_name c program files ipod bin ipodservice.exe with your option the part after the delimiter holds a leading space. to overcome this add the space as another delimiter but make sure it is the very last character in the option string

37934114
inline	inlining
so the benefit of inlining is very small because the benefit of inlining is mostly as a granddaddy optimization that enables lots of other optimizations to work and often eliminates a large part of the cost of the inline function
because the function is so small with zero prologue and epilogue and because can t easily optimize between ant and dec because they are called in different basic blocks inlining doesn t help very much

37934781
prepare	execute
parameters are in the query does not prepare the query with the parameters added
so when i set bypassprepare to true again and did not worry with parsing the query and just execute the task it worked with new execute permissions on the query

37936915
bower	npm	client-side	server-side
using npm for managing client-side libraries is a good choice as opposed to bower or nuget you re thinking in the right direction split server-side asp.net core and client-side angular 2 ember react projects into separate folders otherwise your asp.net project may have lots of noise - unit tests for the client-side code node_modules folder build artefacts etc.
front-end developers working in the same team with you will thank you for that restore npm modules at the solution level similarly how you restore packages via nuget - not into the project s folder this way you can have unit and integration tests in a separate folder as well as opposed to having client-side javascript tests inside your asp.net core project

37947232
virtualenv	conda
using the docker env instruction it is possible to add the virtualenv path persistently to path
although this does not solve the selected environment listed under conda env list

37948338
spaces	delimiter
notice that now the column names do not include spaces u ... is python2 s way of representing of a unicode string
as umax points out in a now deleted answer alternatively you could use this avoids using regex pattern for the delimiter

37954495
wildfly	jboss
moving to wildfly 8 is a bigger change and i wouldn t expect it to work out of the box unless the vendor supports wf eap 7
i also noticed that jboss 7.2.0 is in maven central but not released on their web page

37954670
jpql	hql
in this case your jpql isn t valid
jpql requires select the reason it works is that hql hibernate query language supports leaving off the select so it doesn t complain when you leave it off your jpql

37956079
ssl	https
if there is the http status code 301 moved permanently then the endpoint you are trying to reach is not ssl tls-enabled
so change the host from https to http and you will be done

37956402
hive	hdfs
spark only uses the metastore from hive and doesn t use hive as a processing engine to retrieve the data
so when you create the df using your sql query its really just asking hive s metastore where is the data and whats the format of the data spark takes that information and will run process against the underlying data on the hdfs

37956402
hive	hdfs
so when you create the df using your sql query its really just asking hive s metastore where is the data and whats the format of the data spark takes that information and will run process against the underlying data on the hdfs
so spark is executing the query not hive

37957289
backtracking	greedy
it will match and do not backtracking afterwards 0 or more times matching the most amount possible step 7
matches the b and the atomic group drops all backtracking positions step 8 as a human reading your string it easy to look forward and see that the last character in your source string is a c but the regular expression engine sees the greedy which forces the engine to continue testing characters

37957371
sudo	passwd
in your command line example you switch to gitlab-psql using sudo
there are two ways to fix this assign a passwd to the gitlab-psql postgres user not the system user

37957626
swift	objective-c
there is no automatic converter from swift to objective-c
some swift constructs cannot be represented directly in objective-c

37958617
ienumerable	icollection
you can use an icollection to add remove items you can try casting your ienumerable to an icollection as list implements icollection
ienumerable s can only been enumerated you cannot add remove an item from it

37958963
quicksort	heapsort
that s because all elements will match the pivot so after the pivoting step which separates the array into three parts the left and right parts will be empty and the quicksort will terminate immediately
heapsort doesn t have this property it always runs in o n log n

37962287
mdpi	hdpi
a 6.3 inch screens with that particular resolution would be hdpi 9.4 inch would be mdpi 4.7 in would be xhdpi etc
xhdpi mdpi and so on are not sizes

37964690
vsts	tfs
according to your description with a free account microsoft account .i m wondering if you are using vsts
tfs on-premises will use the domain account to login in tfs not microsoft account

37965050
erlang	elixir
just to preface - i have only used elixir in production and not erlang
i would honestly recommend elixir

37965050
erlang	elixir
erlang since elixir is built on top of erlang and compiles down to erlang and the beam vm you have access to every erlang module and package
so if you are worried about using elixir and missing out on all of the features of erlang you shouldn t be

37965050
erlang	elixir
so if you are worried about using elixir and missing out on all of the features of erlang you shouldn t be
elixir even has it s own implementations of most of the bigger erlang otp features such as genserver genevent etc

37965229
erlang	elixir
in elixir erlang_module.erlang_function args in erlang elixir.elixirmodule elixir_function args
you shouldn t stumble on anything you can do in one that you can t in the other since you can freely call elixir code from erlang and vice-versa

37965954
implements	extends
of course g can not expect it to be either d or c as it might be a completely unknown type implements a and b
that said there is no way in java to express that a return type extends two types other than declaring a concrete type extends both

37966575
jar	war
the war file must include only the needed jar files not including any api or implementation already provided by the jee server
but we want to retain the possibility to generate an executable war or jar file as provided by default by boot for testing purposes

37968148
build.gradle	gradlew
not 100 sure it they exist and if you would want those remove from ios build.gradle these area already defined in you main build.gradle
the problem is in your gradlew files

37972081
lxml	libxml2
a little bit of oop in order to validate more than one file there is no need to create an xmlschema object every time therefore validator.py now we can validate all files in the directory as follows main.py for more options read here validation with lxml
an example of a simple validator in python3 using the popular library lxml installation lxml pip install lxml if you get an error like could not find function xmlcheckversion in library libxml2

37977286
google-chrome	firefox
in the meantime please use google-chrome or internet explorer or microsoft edge where this problem is not present
thanks this is a know issue with authoring blade on firefox browser

37982900
google-chrome	safari
i can t reproduce in the plunker with google-chrome you could try to explicitly invoke change detection my suspicion is that can t be properly patched on all browsers and if the callback runs outside angulars zone it doesn t get notified and doesn t run change detection
this might also solve it and would be the better option if it solves it as well - hard to tell without being able to reproduce - i have no safari around

37983896
boost	stl
anyway all of the containers in boost.container and multi_index_container can be placed in shared memory with boost.interprocess but if this is the only non-standard feature you look for i guess you probably want to stick with boost container set or similar
boost.container is not a single class but rather a collection of containers with various interfaces though all of them based on stl conventions and internal data structures so a feature comparison with boost.multiindex s multi_index_container really depends on what particular container you re interested in

37985112
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
if it does a nullpointerexception is not an appropriate exception to throw because conventionally it is reserved for indicating bugs
you probably want to throw a custom exception derived from illegalargumentexception if you want an unchecked exception or ioexception if you want a checked exception

37986133
google-chrome	firefox
i still get this problem with my version 51.0.2704.103 m among the comments of the google-chrome ticket you can find some workaround hints which might work in some environments but not in general
what you can do as a workaround you can suggest other browsers for your customers firefox internet explorer to work with jnlp applications

37990068
realloc	malloc
the clang debugger gives a very clear error description malloc error for object 0x7fff6fbb16d6 pointer being realloc d was not allocated set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug both of your arrays are initialized as string literals
further on your function tries to modify a string literal by reallocing it which is wrong by c standard because you can t reallocate what you haven t allocated and then copying the members of the second string literal to the object you intended to modify by misusing realloc on a string literal

37991414
momentjs	datejs
method 1 if you don t have problem in using other library then this could work for you using momentjs moment .add days 1 .format l
method 2 using datejs this method uses external library and not the native date library. as my bootstrap-datetimepicker was using momentjs and native date library i preferred method 1

37993102
postgresql	mysql
practical examples of coupling in computing if somebody wants their output in a csv file rather than json etc. or if you want to switch from mysql to postgresql you should be able to make those changes extremely easily in your code without having to rewrite the entire class etc
in other words you do not want to tightly couple your application with a specific database implementation mysql or to a particular output csv files

37994079
profiling	benchmarking
with memory management objects also do seem to free earlier if i am reading the profiling correctly which might be one benefit in favour of objects
in firefox for this particular benchmarking it is a different story object set took 435 object update took 126 object get took 50 object delete took 2 map set took 63 map update took 59 map get took 33 map delete took 1 i should immediately point out that in this particular benchmarking deleting from objects in firefox is not causing any problems however in other benchmarking it has caused problems especially when there are many keys just as in chrome

37994079
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox for this particular benchmark it is a different story object set took 435 object update took 126 object get took 50 object delete took 2 map set took 63 map update took 59 map get took 33 map delete took 1 i should immediately point out that in this particular benchmark deleting from objects in firefox is not causing any problems however in other benchmarks it has caused problems especially when there are many keys just as in google-chrome
maps are clearly superior in firefox for large collections

37999076
apache	nginx
a .htaccess is for apache
it will not work on nginx

37999492
zlib	libpng
libpng depends upon zlib so you should upgrade zlib as well if it isn t current
yes libpng is the library for processing png files
