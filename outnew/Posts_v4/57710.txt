ubuntu	centos
it is the most common setup here some article to help you with nginx ignore ubuntu apt-get use centos yum install instead
ubuntu server is not much different from centos.

16004706
rdf	owl
note that this is not possible to do with rdf alone
rdfs data are queried using sparql. example of rdfs serialised in turtle owl the highest level of expressivity

16005096
email	dkim
just a hint you can use smth like they have a nice api for sending email it is free for small amount of email and can get you going pretty fast mostly the important thing is that you will reach the inbox everytime and you don t have to go through the nightmare called email setup
it s not the email library but your mx domain mainly the fact you are missing some things. you have to setup domainkeys dkim and spf in order for your email to be legit. and even after you setup these don t expect to go inbox it will be 50 50 chances for this to happen

email	dkim
it s not the email library but your mx domain mainly the fact you are missing some things. you have to setup domainkeys dkim and spf in order for your email to be legit. and even after you setup these don t expect to go inbox it will be 50 50 chances for this to happen
email is a real nightmare nowadays

16007343
equals	gethashcode
move safegethashcode out of your test class so you can use it as extension on string and other reference types as for implementation of i assume your issame is just incorrectly named method also strangely marked with override - there is no issame in any of .net classes especially not in object make sure to implement base equals as well see sample in iequatable.equals for implementation of both equals calls shortened sample note normally equals does not need to use gethashcode first
dictionary the main reason gethashcode exists always checks hash code itself before calling equals

16007797
ssl	https
most probably you should simply pass the password in plain text over ssl https
all communication in ssl https is encrypted so it s probably not a good idea to encrypt the password as well unless you need to ensure the web server technically the https terminator cannot see the password

16012244
udp	tcp
udp is stateless tcp isn t but tcp has many predefined properties that didn t suite nfs or rather that nfs wanted to govern the specifics
in particular when tcp is doing packet transfers it does govern timeouts etc

16012329
gridview	repeater
imagebuttons inside gridview especially within update panels were always a pain
re imagebuttons not working in ie10 dec 05 2012 04 38 pm|link i couldn t get any of the above example to work for me but i have an image button in a repeater within an update panel

16014710
client-side	server-side
correct creating the meta elements client-side will not work because those crawlers don t execute any client-side scripting code they just look at the html code they get
and the hash part of an url is only of client-side importance so it does not even get passed to the server when making an http request so generating those meta elements server-side based on the hash is also not possible

16016239
jboss	weblogic
i feel that the accepted answer may or may not work for every situation and of course the hook is that you will be stuck to a single jboss release of el without any of the support of continuing bug fixes in future patch releases of a proper 2.2 implementation
ultimately here is what worked for me on a weblogic 10.3.6 server

16020876
required	placeholder
your example is consistent with this usage since the first argument to dotimes which is an indexer is not needed but the binding is required by the form
i believe that underscore is used in clojure by convention as a placeholder for a required but unused argument

16022107
svg	vml
remember to use setattributens because of the svg namespace and make the gradient stop tags be children of the gradient not of defs
i still have to do the tweaks for vml stupid ie

16022869
google-chrome	firefox
please remember that not all browsers like google-chrome etc. accept the pure css3 and may need extra css code
this is a slightly modified code running on firefox linux

16027704
ssl	https
using packet capture software you will be able to view the initiation of the ssl connection and the exchange of encrypted packets but the content of those packets can only be extracted at the other end of the connection the server
if this were not the case then the https protocol as a whole would be broken as the whole point of it is to secure http communications from man-in-the-middle type attacks where in this case the mitm is the packet sniffer

16029860
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
you can push the same uiviewcontroller again in uinavigationcontroller stack
there is no issues with that. uinavigationcontroller make an stack of viewcontrollers so you can add as many objects as you require whether they are instances of same uiviewcontroller class or not

16033147
ubuntu	debian
the issue is twofold bash is not sh on debian ubuntu etc. so bashishms won t work when you execute your script with sh
debian uses dash for sh instead

16034546
sudo	passwd
there s no equivalent of sudo -s
you can t pipe a passwd into runas as it requests the passwd from the terminal not from stdin

16034841
sse	avx
in general you effectively just get two 128 bit sse operations in parallel which is useful for the majority of instructions which just operate in an element-wise fashion but not as useful as a proper 256 bit simd implementation
the underlying reason for this and various other avx limitations is that architecturally avx is little more than two sse execution units side by side - you will notice that virtually no avx instructions operate horizontally across the boundary between the two 128 bit halves of a vector which is particularly annoying in the case of vpalignr

16037188
floating-point	fractions
but it s inconceivable that there would be a serious programming language with floating-point that doesn t provide a more efficient way
it all depends what operations are available on floating-point values if you have floor and ceil then you can use one of those to get the integer part and subtraction to get the fractions part

16040650
express	node.js
ok if anyone like me needs a decent and simple example of implementing fine uploader with their node.js express app - i finally was able to get it working
turns out i was making everything far more difficult for myself than necessary and the fine uploader server example doesn t make it clear how easy this is now with newer versions of express this is with express 3.1.1

16040850
haskell	scheme
you can t really think of nested lists the same way in haskell as in scheme because they re not the same data structure
a haskell list is homogenous where as a lisp list is actually closer to a rose tree as pointed out by c.a.mccann below

16042034
vbscript	vba
adapt your vba procedure to vbscript and run the vbscript file as a scheduled task
without access installed on the machine where the scheduled task runs you will not be able to run the procedure stored in a vba module in your accdb file

16042379
jsf	seam
your localeresolver is being called as part of a separate servlet request that is not routed through the standard jsf servlet
when this happens seam interceptors are not triggered and bijection does not take place

16043033
jar	manifest.mf
edit ok i checked your jar file and found this manifest.mf had no classpath definition
it should contain a line like class-path dermalog.afis.drawing.compression.jar dermalog.afis.fingercode.jar dermalog.imaging.capturing.jar the dependency jars should not be packaged in the dependant jar

16044003
pbkdf2	md5
so we can use pbkdf2 with sha512 to gain a very significant advantage over the phpass algorithm mainly because sha512 is a harder algorithm with more computation than md5
this means that not only is pbkdf2 able to generate more computations in the same amount of time it s able to generate harder computations

16047523
isotope	packery
it does not have all of the same features as isotope but will most likely serve its purpose
i would also give packery a try

16049001
viewdidload	viewwillappear
make sure the call to populate that button title in the first vc is done in viewwillappear and not in viewdidload
when working with a navigation controller the viewdidload isn t called when popping back to an already loaded view

16049602
listview	gridview
what you need is listview s capability to add a header view but unfortunately gridview doesn t offer that functionality
what i have done in the past to solve this problem is to convert the gridview to a listview and then add the header to the listview

16050702
uiview	subviews
also any view-specific ui logic can be isolated into the individual uiview subviews
if you use this technique if you plan on animating the transition between these three subviews it s actually quite useful to not just put these three subviews on the top-level view of the scene in question

16054899
punctuation	words
you d need to use regular expressions and add b words boundary anchors around each words when matching the b boundary anchor matches at string start and end points and anywhere there is a transition between words and non-word characters so between a space and a letter or digit or between punctuation and a letter or digit
the re.escape function ensures that all regular expression metacharacters are escaped and we match on the literal contents of words and not accidentally interpret anything in there as an expression

16060405
addition	modulo
first define an interface for any operations you d need then create the calculator holder then you can define an operation for example addition and you would use it like with that point if you want to add any new behaviour or modify an existing one just create or edit a class
for example say you want a modulo then this solution allows your code to be a third-party library if you plan to reuse this code or give it away as a library the user wouldn t by any case modify your source code

16062090
lisp	scheme
whereas lists in lisp are created by linking cons cells and finding an element at any given index entails traversing all the elements before it in the list - hence o n complexity
as a side note - yes using vectors would be a faster alternative than using association lists of key value pairs as long as the keys are integers and the number of elements to be indexed is known beforehand a scheme vector can not grow its size after its creation

16063711
implements	extends
you can implements private members through closures but instance specific private members can only be accessed by functions that are not on the prototype
not implementing privates as closures would leak implementation and enable you or users extends your code to use members that are not part of your public api

16064599
centos	linux
i m not closely familiar with centos but google hints that it has a relatively low limit of 1024 given the lot of problems related to it in the search results
among the results you ll see a lot of questions answers as to how to increase it such as the following blog increase the number of file descriptors on centos and fedora linux raising the number of file descriptors for a regular user on centos fedora redhat is surprisingly difficult to learn how to do

16070326
multiplying	multiplication
notes this approach still uses the operator but not for actually multiplying x and y it is used to increase other sub-products by multiples of 10 many parts of this code could be simplified refactored but i specifically left them expanded to make the steps more obvious
my interpretation of the assignment is that the teacher would like the student to implement a recursive algorithm to perform grid method multiplication the kind we learn in elementary school

16071853
mongodb	bson
moped is not an odm -- it s a low-level mongodb driver
when you iterate users.find you get a collection of simple moped bson document objects which are a lot more like ruby hash objects than anything else

16074880
udp	tcp
the fragmentation and defragmentation happens in the network internet layer ip so the socket will never see the fragments but only receive entire and full udp tcp packets only full packets gets sent to the listening port
so no you do not need multiple receive to get a single packet but you should be aware that udp is not reliable so if one fragment gets lost in the network layer and in some cases if it arrives out of order you won t be able to get the packet

16077856
jar	war
commons pojos is a jar project web project is a war project which depends on commons pojos project
unless the dependency scope is not provided the jar will be packaged in the war

16084326
ctrlp	fuzzyfinder
the closest equivalent closest not exact to st2 s ctrl + p is a plugin called get ready ctrlp
there are other similar plugins like command-t or fuzzyfinder

16085053
textmate	sublimetext
the latest version of the textmate bundle is here i d welcome contributions
not certain why age is a problem when the highlighter works and has been tested to work with sublimetext

16085898
postgresql	mysql
additionally although i had not found anything mentioned in the web2py book about how to automatically generate a model from an existing database there is a way to quickly and easily create a database model from an existing postgresql database by using script available on github created by mariano reingart who based it on a script to generate schemas from dbs mysql created by alexandre andrade
the script is used to create a web2py db model from a postgresql database

16089258
jar	manifest.mf
per the release notes as of jdk 7u21 javascript code that calls code within a privileged applet is treated as mixed code and warning dialogs are raised if the signed jar files are not tagged with the trusted-library attribute
to fix this edit your manifest.mf file and add a line like this trusted-library true you should be very careful before doing this though

16089870
postgresql	mysql
all other dbms do not allow this except postgresql but that product has implemented the feature correctly and it does check if the other columns depend on the grouping columns
mysql does no check at all so it can give erroneous results in many cases

16094215
recvfrom	datagram
yes by supplying the msg_peek flag to the recvfrom call
this will leave the datagram intact and not remove it

16097849
qtableview	qtablewidget
since it s qtableview anyway you always have an option to substitute it with your own qtableview implementation with fancy delegates etc
i think in your scenario you you will use very limited amount of qtablewidget specialised functions so that shouldn t be any problems at all

16103867
jar	war
i have not come across any utility which can convert a jar project to a war project
you have following two options - simple open the pom.xml and change jar to war

16105354
scipy	sympy
first of all if it was not for the relative complexity of the expressions here scipy would have been definitely the better option over sympy
but the expression is rather complicated so we can first simplify it in sympy and only then feed it to scipy now given that you are not interested in symbolics and that the simplification was not that good it would be useless to continue using sympy instead of scipy but if you insist you can do it

16108818
cpython	ironpython
when i ran into this the problem turned out to be that i only had my cpython libs in the search path i had previously installed nltk in cpython and not the ironpython ones
in my c# code i now have something like when scratching my head over this exact issue i noticed i had accidentally entered 2.7.1 as my ironpython path ie

16109107
itext	razorpdf
i m pretty sure razorpdf uses a mighty old version of itext and my answer to this question explains why it shouldn t
i m the original developer of itext and i m also the one who once upon a time long ago wrote the dtd for the itext xml files

16111579
bash	zsh
the zsh man page doesn t explicitly describe this behaviour but the bash manpage does arguments if arguments remain after option processing and neither the -c nor the -s option has been supplied the first argument is assumed to be the name of a file containing shell commands
if bash is invoked in this fashion is set to the name of the file and the positional parame- ters are set to the remaining arguments

16113857
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
all runtimeexception nullpointerexception are unchecked-exception
since errors stackoverflowerror are also unchecked-exception not all unchecked-exception are runtimeexception

16118550
octal	decimal
characters in javascript are 16-bit entities so the octal escape 352 encodes character 234 decimal which obviously readily fits within the character s 16-bit range
side note octal escapes are not part of the main standard and are disallowed in strict mode

16118685
viewdidload	viewwillappear
therefore if you remove the observer in didreceivememorywarning viewdidload will not be called again
there are two relative simple alternatives that you can choose from add the observer in viewwillappear and remove it in viewwilldisappear

16119584
implements	extends
c# allows an explicit conversion from a class to an interface even if the class doesn t implements that interface because for all the compiler knows a reference to a certain type might actually the uncertainty is why it s an explicit rather than implicit conversion be an instance of a derived type that does implements the interface
extends your example suppose you have if you check section 6.2.4 of the c# specification you ll see that if you mark your myadder class as sealed the compiler will actually complain because then it will know for sure that no conversion is possible since no derived type could exist

16120070
opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
player just compare how it works in google-chrome and than check it out in firefox or opera first of all it doesn t show ... which signifies loading secondly once you click play on another player both songs keep playing where as in other browsers first song would pause so there would be only one song playing
firefox and opera don t support mp3 in their audio element so it gets replaced by a flash object

16120725
noexcept	throw
remember that any function in c++ can throw an exception unless it is declared as noexcept
so now not only you have to remember to delete when no exception is throw you will now also need to imagine all the paths the code could take and write appropriate try-catch blocks to manually delete your object

16121015
trie	tree
after positions of all the query words are found in suffix array or in the trie you have to sort them for suffix array only because they are already sorted in case of trie then find a set of positions that is closest to each other add smallest positions of all the query words to priority queue may be implemented as min-heap while the list of not-yet-processed positions for the top word in this priority queue is not empty substitute topmost queue entry with next position of the same word
every time some entry is added removed from priority queue add remove position of corresponding word s end to some ordered collection like binary search tree

16122343
junit	mockito
and of course your junit or testng tests will use the mockito api internally to mock dependencies
mockito is not a testing framework

16122386
uilabel	uitextview
as uitextview documentation says the uitextview class implements the behavior for a scrollable multiline text region so ideally you should not add uilabel objects to a uitextview
instead i would create a uilabel and a uitextview for each article you want to display if you want your users to scroll and read all the articles you can add all these subviews to a uiscrollview object finally you calculate the uiscrollview content size by adding all the heights of your subviews

16126681
comparator	comparable
the comparator interface is not used to create a class that can put itself in order
this is the comparable interface

16127058
super	implements
super.method usage implies method of the instance but implements before the current class super or super.super etc
so it appears that there is no difference between this and super when they are used to access methods which are not overridden in its subclass es and in case of variables when they are not shadowed in its subclass es

16127578
floating-point	fractions
if all bits of the exponent field are set to 1 and all bits of the fractions part are 0 then the floating-point number is infinity
if all bits of the exponent field are set to 1 and all bits of the fractions part are not equal to 0 then the floating point number is nan

16128787
opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
works in current google-chrome opera firefox and safari for windows
i guess it works on safari for mac too which is a few steps ahead of the windows version anyway but i am not going to test it right now

16129396
multiplying	division	multiplying	multiplication
to convert from 300dpi to 72dpi you need to multiplying by 72 300 not the other way round
do it in floating point or the multiplication first and division then as in x 72 300

16131438
opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
currently only google-chrome and opera support the new model and other browsers have partial support which means that they might be supporting an older version of the w3 specifications an older syntax or they just haven t gotten around to fully implementing the new or even the old model yet with whatever is available today i was able to put something together which works in google-chrome 26 safari 5.1.7 ie10 ie10 in ie9 mode and ie10 in ie8 mode
sadly my current firefox version 20 is not in that list

16132110
g++	gcc
on my debian sid x86-64 the below program in source file itsols.cc compiled with the command g++ -wall itsols.cc -o itsols displays a single lower-case l compiled with g++ -wall itsols.cc -o itsols both with gcc 4.7.2 and with gcc 4.8.0 and also with gcc 4.6.3 so i cannot reproduce what you claim and i believe you are probably wrong because when you read c++ reference material the operator on strings gives a result which is output using as a single char not a number
addenda even by taking your final example which is not correct c++ because main has a bad signature and gcc warns about that i am getting two a outputs and this using either gcc 4.6.3 or gc 4.7.2 or gcc 4.8.0

16136954
google-chrome	firefox
it is supported on ios safari google-chrome and some latest version of opera..
it s not yet adopted by ie and firefox that s it......what more one can ask than local db on browser which has relational db system...so u can query it easily and handle complex data....which is very tougher in key vale based systems

16137251
implements	extends
you also cannot implements other classes
you extends other classes

16139307
spaces	delimiter
sed -i s#expr1#expr2# so it could be sudo sed -i s#documentroot var www#documentroot var www mysite.com public_html# etc apache2 sites-available mysite.com also as your substitution-argument itself contains spaces you need to enclose them in single-quotes
it isn t necessary to use as the regex delimiter

16140070
daemons	systemd
this is used when your process doesn t create its own pid file and is used with --background --oknodo return 0 not 1 if no actions are taken by the daemons check whether the pid file has been created or not --exec make sure the processes are instances of this executable in your case daemons
it is a program to manage the start and stop of systemd level background processes daemons

16140810
octal	binary
decimal and octal are number bases this only matters when presenting a number or when inputing a number
the actual number is generally stored in binary in the computer s memory but this doesn t often matter to typical programs

16141942
d3.js	raphael
you could do the following then your hover event could be set up as follows if raphael does not give you access to write a class onto these svg objects then you could use d3.js to select them all and add a class to them
i ve found combining d3.js raphael and jquery to be really powerful

16142343
jar	manifest.mf
if it works in eclipse and not in the jar it mean that your manifest.mf is not correct
try to add the following line in the manifest and create the jar again manifest-version 1.0 class-path

16146839
noexcept	throw
the standard does not require this constructor or the move constructor to be noexcept
i assume that by move constructor for std vector with custom allocator you mean the allocator-extended move constructor this constructor the main reason is that if then the constructor must allocate more memory which could throw bad_alloc

16149258
calloc	malloc
the c way of doing this is if you want to initialise without junk data created from previous pointers use calloc this will initialise the buffer with character 0
the unsigned char in front of malloc is just to type cast it some compilers complain if this isn t done

16153579
sum	coalesce
i m not clear why i had to do a nested query but i couldn t get it to take it otherwise select id sum amount from select coalesce val1_id val2_id val3_id val4_id id coalesce val1_amount val2_amount val3_amount val4_amount amount from foo coalesced_data group by id
i did it using the coalesce function

16159698
express	node.js
here are some links for you to check out http basic authentication for backbone http basic authentication for express express authentication examples
while this is not ideal if the user and password are being sent with each request you simply need some middleware to perform authentication authorization in your node.js application

16164774
client-side	server-side
an example of a valid client-side domain is update watch out you cannot use in combination with client-side domains because this option converts your many2one field into a fake fields.selection whose options are statically evaluated server-side
in this case your client-side domain will be ignored and the list of available values will never change

16167484
opera	firefox	firefox	safari
this is very strange as it does not seem to have problems with c program files opera opera.exe or c program files safari safari.exe or c program files internet explorer iexplore.exe so all i can think of is that it does not like 2 folder names with spaces in them for some obsqure reason because it wont launch firefox from c program files mozilla firefox firefox.exe i assume it launches ie from a similiar folder named address as it is the default browser on this system
anyhow the solution for me was to change the eclipse preferences - general - web browser - firefox to use the 8.3 dos directory naming convension

16169173
daemons	systemd
now if your daemons is started as part of the systemd it may be hard to get the configuration to dump core plus you may not want other applications to leave core dumps all over the place
so then i d advice to stop the systemd daemons and start it again in your user space then you can allow it to dump core

16171060
implements	extends
the above pattern of implements runnable with an executorservice is better
if i understand your needs the right way to do this is to not extends thread but to implement runnable

16171060
implements	extends
it is just using it as a runnable since thread implements runnable and the thread-pool starts its own threads and will never call start on your simulatorthread
if you are extends thread then you need to call thread.start directly and not submit it to an executorservice

16171137
profiling	benchmarking
in other words you re probably measuring the measuring overhead of your profiling here
besides in a quick benchmarking i cannot back your claim

16171370
google-chrome	firefox
i added -3px to margin-top to force it to align back in google-chrome
not tested in firefox and others

16171497
exponent	addition
if that addition does not increase the significand to 2 10 set the exponent to zero and return the subnormal number or zero formed from the sign bit the zero exponent and the significand
if the significand did increase to 2 10 return the number formed from the sign bit an exponent field of one and a zero significand

16176510
implements	extends
this is similar to how data binding works in xaml c# in that you need to implements inotifypropertychanged
since the winrt object you ve created is sealed you cannot extends it to make it observable in the context that you re desiring as far as my understanding goes

16180383
addition	modulo
addition of a small fraction of time half the maximum accuracy of the times should fix this though in essence it is not really any different from what you are already doing contrast that with and when
the modulo division may produce some rounding errors which i found on my system

16182317
viewdidload	viewdidappear
this would mean that viewdidload is not called again and the _groups variable is therefore not updated
i would try putting your _groups code in viewdidappear followed by a reloaddata call on the tableview

16187578
multiplying	modulo
another generic approach would be to emulate built-in prngs by - generate 32 random2 and map it to a 32-bit integer get random number in range 0 1 by dividing it by max integer value simply multiplying this number by n 3 4...73 so on and floor to get desired output
using modulo is not recommended because it introduces bias

16188505
google-chrome	firefox
svg performance in firefox is slower than in webkit google-chrome and ie10
still performance in firefox is not bad

16188671
qtableview	qtreeview
afaik it s not possible to do that with qtableview or qtablewidget current implementations and you will have to implement your own class
if you can adapt to having the same column layout for both levels then keep reading what i wrote before taking another sight to your screenshot you can qtreeview is only a qtableview with some art for first column

16188860
.htaccess	httpd.conf
enable mod_rewrite and .htaccess through httpd.conf and then put this code in your .htaccess under document_root directory once you verify it to be working replace 302 temporary redirect with 301 permanent redirect
you re making 2 main mistakes rewrite rule matches only uri part and doesn t match query string rewrite rule in .htaccess doesn t match leading slash

16190356
force.com	salesforce
the html file links to a server hosted by salesforce and store this file for 30 days. as a solotion the email must not be sent through the force.com servers. that is all
this is due to the way salesforce sends attachments probably related to the size of the attachment

16191739
uiview	subviews
see iphone uiview - resize frame to fit subviews and having trouble getting uiview sizetofit to do anything meaningful
sizetofit doesn t work on uiview

16192727
vb.net	vb6
the semantics of the operator in vb.net are just a bit different from those of c# and the standard object.equals
the semantics are inherited from vb6 and cannot be changed for backward compatibility reasons

16192727
vb.net	vb6
further thoughts the reason it s not recommended is because there is no reason to call the method from vb.net just use
in c# there is no particular reason to invoke the vb6 semantics so the method doesn t make a lot of sense there either

16196475
g++	gcc
the g++ abi for c++98 code is backward compatible all the way back to gcc 3.4 so if you compile and link your final executable with gcc 4.8 you can link to objects and libraries built with anything from gcc 3.4 to 4.8 but no newer the c++11 abi is the same as the c++98 abi and the standard library types that are common to both c++98 and c++11 have the same definitions ignoring gcc 4.7.0 and gcc 4.7.1 which had abi incompatibilities in std pair and std list when using c++11 which have been fixed in 4.7.2 and later versions so you can link c++98 and c++11 code together unless the c++11 code was built with gcc 4.7.0 or 4.7.1 however some c++11 library types are not stable yet and change between releases because they were first shipped before the final c++11 standard and had to be changed to match the final rules
so it s not necessarily safe to mix c++11 code built with gcc 4.6 and c++11 code built with gcc 4.8 for your case where all the c++11 code is built with gcc 4.8 that will be ok

16197745
daemons	systemd
on a theoretical level you might want to explore using dbus with python and c. have a python daemons that reads your file then from c make a dbus call that returns x number of lines you can specify that in a dbus header
this way you can keep the python file open for as long as you d like and you wouldn t require the systemd call which would mean your program would be more secure

16203495
guava	lambdaj
1 stick with what you have we know this is ugly and it s definitely bug prone but it works out of curiosity i tried this instead but that got me a runtime exception java.lang.classcastexception cannot be cast to java.lang.string 2 use guava this is looking rather noisy but the function can be abstracted away at least which makes the call site cleaner note that lists.transform returns a transformed view of the original list
if you want a copy like lambdaj s extract returns making one is easy enough this is all much more verbose but it gives you generic type safety and you get to drop the dynamic proxy sorcery behind the scenes

16204067
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i noticed that this flicker did not occur with safari firefox or safari mobile but just google-chrome and stopped when i removed from ajax response content
in google-chrome you will see a flicker with the updatepanel if your ajax response contains image urls

16205126
bash	subshell
it s worth mentioning that the same effect could be achieved with command grouping like which is cheaper because it doesn t create another instance of bash
the parenthesis here create a subshell which is another instance of the interpreter to run the commands that are inside what is interesting is that the subshell acts as a single stdin stdout combo

16208318
realloc	malloc
specifically it can give you the wrong function signature for malloc realloc which if your int and type aren t compatible can lead to corrupted pointers
incorrect usage of realloc

16210333
client-side	server-side
because it ties the client-side library to a particular server-side technology for data persistence and secondly not many users have need for it
some server-side libraries dundas used to have this capability do provide this capability though not all features of the chart can be customized at client-side

16213195
innodb	myisam
another downside is that on delete cascade only works on innodb
it doesn t work on myisam

16213891
aggregate-functions	sum
there are likely a few aggregate-functions i m unfamiliar with that cater to the latter too
if needed additionally look into with statements and window functions for more complex queries some testing reveals that sum doesn t work with tsrange types

16216286
libjpeg	graphicsmagick
be aware that linux mint may come with a different libjpeg than jpeg 6b jpeg 8 or libjpeg turbo and it is best not to have duplicate libraries on the system
given that you are using linux mint the best solution for graphicsmagick to find libjpeg is to install the libjpeg development package libjpeg-dev re-run the graphicsmagick configure script rebuild and install

16219760
inline	constexpr
that is because constexpr functions are implicitly inline
per paragraph 7.1.5 2 of the c++11 standard a constexpr specifier used in the declaration of a function that is not a constructor declares that function to be a constexpr function

16223244
strcpy	malloc
you need to use strcpy to copy the buffer into the array element another issue is with your loop that calls malloc the sizeof parameters are not correct
you also don t need to cast the result of malloc

16223320
scipy	sympy
scipy numpy are fundamentally numerical packages and aren t really set up to do algebraic symbolic operations
you might be better served by looking at odes with sympy

16224292
vim	sublimetext	vim	textmate
to illustrate the different behaviors this is what happens when you try to concatenate two files with and this is what happens when you try to concatenate two files without the first behavior is somehow the expected behavior and the reason why vim and many if not most unix-y programs default to the terminator interpretation and to adding an character at the end of the last line
the picture below shows a simple file with created with nano it would be the same with vim and opened in eclipse textmate sublimetext vim xcode and textedit

16224957
prepare	execute
this problem would not arise if you would use prepare statements as you would have had a single string literal this would also remove the possibility of sql injections
this would also speed-up you program if you need to execute the same prepare statement several times the statement is already prepare and does not need to be parsed on the second+ invocation

16224957
prepare	execute
this would also speed-up you program if you need to execute the same prepare statement several times the statement is already prepare and does not need to be parsed on the second+ invocation
and finally in case you are still using the officially deprecated php mysql extension you must switch to mysqli and use its full benefits like prepare statements

16225596
ssl	https
in addition i ve put a field that allows us to determine if we should require ssl or not i m using it with the debug pre-processor
now this requiressl will do the following base on your requirements attribute value - ignore won t do nothing. - http will force redirection to http protocol. - https will force redirection to https protocol

16226101
strcpy	malloc
you should replace it with a strcpy instead
note that malloc does not initialize the buffer it allocates normally

16230931
division	modulo
all snippets left-arg right-arg quotient remainder truncated division floored division knuth euclidean division
in ansi c the sign of the result of the modulo is not defined for negative inputs

16232176
spaces	linefeed
the columns of the table will be aligned by the browser the reason tab isn t working for you is that normally in html all contiguous whitespace spaces tabs vertical tabs carriage returns linefeed etc. is treated as one spaces
if you really want to do this textually you ll need to use a monospaced font and then you have two options either use the non-breaking spaces character entity or use content using the css style white-space pre or one of its relatives

16232926
mongodb	bson
the actual checking is done inside mongodb and not mongoengine
the object sent to mongodb should be the same but this is where it gets tricky as with bson order is important and in python with dictionaries its not

16232926
mongodb	bson
the object sent to mongodb should be the same but this is where it gets tricky as with bson order is important and in python with dictionaries its not
when converting to send to mongodb mongoengine just passes a dictionary

16233417
implements	extends
multiple inheritance in java is usually done by implements multiple interfaces
you can not extends more than one class

16234450
ssl	https
in the response there could be a result instructing the client to reconnect to the server over ssl via a different port
using a single port for both http and https as you seem to expect is impossible and does not make sense

16236419
client-side	server-side
you cannot manipulate the actual value of file input fields on client-side due to security restrictions
your only option is to handle this on the server-side

16236645
xna	spritebatch
sharpdx toolkit is not a xna compatible api implementation and thus is not able to load xna content
it is a high level api for direct3d11 with some xna like interfaces features spritebatch basiceffect contentmanager...etc. but not binary compatible with xna

16237495
realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
the behavior is undefined if ptr does not match a pointer returned earlier by malloc calloc or realloc
also the behavior is undefined if the memory area referred to by ptr has already been deallocated that is free or realloc has already been called with ptr as the argument and no calls to malloc calloc or realloc resulted in a pointer equal to ptr afterwards

16237644
gmail	hotmail
for example gmail offers contextual gadgets used by xobni and other inbox apps outlook hotmail offers active views
the google+ integration you see is specific to gmail in general you will not be able to run javascript in gmail or other webmail providers due to security concerns

16241883
onclicklistener	onitemclicklistener
your problem is that you shouldn t be setting an onclicklistener for every item in your list
you should set an onitemclicklistener on your listview which will callback when items are pressed

16242371
profiling	instrumentation
profiling is a handy tool to watch how apps communicate with your database and debugging odd behaviour
it s not a long-term solution for performance instrumentation given that it puts a load on your server and the results require quite a bit of laborious processing and digestion to paint a clear picture for you

16245136
stateless	stateful
from a non-ejb technology specific standpoint stateless session beans are infrastructure code that obviously does not hold any state but passes objects that have state
state can beheld by your stateful session beans or domain pojos in other implementations outside an ejb

16248021
ubuntu	linux
here a nice video how to install glashfish in ubuntu + netbeans config note keep in mind both videos are a little old may some adjustments are necessary the videos are indirectly related
but my point is there isn t much info about amazon aws and java ee but there are a lot info about amazon aws and linux and linux and java ee

16249967
inline	inlining
i ve seen some functions not inline without any clear understanding from the context
i do not like either relying on inlining

16251616
udp	tcp
the function or thread that handles the client s request all it can do is sending one o more udp packet to the client to acknowledge the request but it cannot maintain a conversation with the client neither is able to determine if the client is down because there is no a permanent open connection
if you need a conversation between server and clients then you need to change to tcp sockets

16252214
profiling	debugging
the profiling tool allinea map does not provide any cuda instrumentation but can give you a good overview of how your application as a whole is behaving including time spent waiting for cuda kernels to finish
allinea ddt can handle debugging cuda applications in exactly this situation either via x-forwarding or via a remote mode

16252339
vim	notepad++
this is not something that most editors have but i do know that vim has something down this line but learning to use regular expressions is something you ll need to do before trying such features
on windows one of the best editors is notepad++ but whether it can handle extremely large files is a question

16252339
vim	gedit
if you are on linux eg ubuntu you may try gedit for ease of use with some plug-ins but to handle very large files you re better off with vim
however vim is not as easy to use in terms of keyboard short-cuts

16252339
vim	gedit
however vim is not as easy to use in terms of keyboard short-cuts
i often use gedit on ubuntu and windows but for files that are large eg 20mb it is almost impossible to use this

16253299
ssl	https
secure if this cookie can only be sent over https ssl set this value to true. set it to false and the cookie should work
i m guessing you re not running https for development

16257607
exponent	modulo
gmp_pow doesn t accept an exponent large than a long since the intermediate values will be larger than the addressable memory in your computer
you should use gmp_powm which automatically reduces the intermediate values to be less than the modulo value

16259621
dns	spf
they may be doing a reverse look-up and not finding your server s name in the mx record reverse look-up for dns
additionally they like things like spf records dkim and domain-keys

16260254
lisp	scheme
not a lisp form - numbers aren t symbols 2 as i just mentioned the operator first element of a list-that-is-a-lisp-form must be a symbol
a lisp-1 scheme allows any lisp form in the operator position but roots of lisp is discussing the original a lisp-2 and common lisp a lisp-2

16262853
setinterval	settimeout
also this answer doesn t require jquery which apparently the op isn t otherwise using. in javascript to call a function repeatedly you can either use setinterval which will call it repeatedly or settimeout which will call it once and have the function schedule the next call itself
in both cases you want to give setinterval settimeout a function reference

16266029
opera	google-chrome
html5 video doesn t work correctly you need to force to use flash player actually i can report that opera 36 37 chromium based is a way more stable with this hw accel hack
the problem is that google-chrome developers have disabled canvas hw accel for xp it calls direct3dcreate9ex from d3d9.dll which is directx 9l available only on vista+ but it is possible to wrap d3d9ex on windows xp via wined3d direct3d to opengl wrapper

16267545
realloc	memmove
unlike c++ where a cast of malloc is required c does not require you to cast the return value of malloc calloc realloc
when you insert in the middle of the array you need to implement this algorithm check if you have enough space for the element that you want to insert if you do not have enough space extend the array the way that you do when you add an element at the end move the data up by one position using memmove place the element at the position requested by the caller the only step that s different from inserting at the end is the third one where you move the content of your array up by one element

16269242
html5lib	beautifulsoup
if that doesn t work html5lib is your best bet as it s the most lenient but also the slowest
beautifulsoup supports a bunch of different html parsers

16270572
innodb	myisam
you can commit and rollback with innodb
myisam myisam supports table-level locking myisam designed for need of speed myisam does not support foreign keys hence we call mysql with myisam is dbms myisam stores its tables data and indexes in diskspace using separate three different files

16271964
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
one simple approach would be to create two sets - one using a case-insensitive string comparer and one using a case-sensitive one
it s not clear to me whether you want a culture-sensitive string or not or in which culture. after construction if the two sets has a different size count then there must be some elements which are equal by case-insensitive comparison but not equal by case-sensitive comparison

16274145
g++	gcc
first for linux gnu c compilers gcc is a c compiler whereas g++ is a c++ compiler
which means when you compile with gcc all your error messages are basically saying i don t know what all this strange syntax is. your school isn t using a linux server or gcc there may be a link to a c++ compiler

16275952
mathml	mathjax
additionally the previously mentioned mathjax can be used as a mathml shim in browsers that do not support mathml yet
the only concern with the mathjax shim is going to be that when you make it interactive it s going to interact differently with your code in browsers which do and do not support mathml but despite that i would personally advice mathml except if you re already bound into latex

16275952
mathml	mathjax
the only concern with the mathjax shim is going to be that when you make it interactive it s going to interact differently with your code in browsers which do and do not support mathml but despite that i would personally advice mathml except if you re already bound into latex
based on your update i am not sure whether that can be expressed in mathml or latex and i fear the only thing you could do is draw it on a canvas or set it up in a svg if you need the interactivity later on

16278730
move	drag
at least put small pause to be sure that mouse captured the object and can drag it tests could run very fast and browser may not react properly 3 mousemoveat locator coordstring - drag where you need 4 mouseupat locator coordstring - release your mouse button finishing drag and drop also you may add in the beginning of these steps setmousespeed pixels to make the mouse move slowly to be sure it can drag and in the end setmousespeed back to its default value default is 10 meaning that mouse step is 10 pexels
setting speed 3-5 pixels will make the mouse move slower

16279401
datamapper	activerecord
datamapper can be used as a replacement for activerecord in rails apps. also you ve included activemodel securepassword twice i d delete one of those
if rfm base does not extend activerecord then you won t be able to use the activerecord db query methods like find where etc

16284101
printwriter	bufferedwriter
for your purposes though omitting the bufferedwriter should be fine as you will most likely want an immediate flush to the output stream which printwriter does
it looks like your bufferedwriter cache was not being flushed the data was simply remaining in the buffer without being sent

16286562
factors	matrix
the fastest way to iterate over a matrix is in storage order doing it the wrong way round will increase the number of cache misses which if your matrix doesn t fit in l1 will dominate your computation time so read increase your computation time by a factors of cacheline elemsize probably 64 8 8
if your matrix fits into l1 cache this won t make a difference but a good compiler should be able to vectorise the loop which with avx enabled on a shiny new core i7 could give you a speedup of as much as 4 times

16286844
ioexception	filewriter
public filewriter string filename boolean append throws ioexception constructs a filewriter object given a file name with a boolean indicating whether or not to append the data written
use the true tells the filewriter to append the data and not overwrite

16288943
oncreate	setcontentview
so if the intention is to call showaspopup in the creating activity and not the created activity it s not obvious how to get the activity instance that is modifiable prior to oncreate being called
the problem being that you can t call things like requestwindowfeature after setcontentview is called example which is a problem since it is typically called in oncreate

16289049
punctuation	words
isn t gaining you much since punctuation is going to cause a words boundary unless it s followed by other punctuation
try this allows the whitespace preceding the words boundary which is between the space and e as guffa points out without including those spaces in the match group target

16290107
firefox	safari
firefox still doesn t have it enabled either
apple on the other hand has enabled support for it in safari on ios5 probably because request-response latency on mobile is a bigger problem

16290190
fileoutputstream	printwriter
you need to declare your fileoutputstream constructor using an append flag the append method may still be used or more convenient is println which will not require a newline character to be added w.println dateformat.format date
the autoflush flag in the printwriter constructor is not required provided close is called

16290343
equals	gethashcode
to start head to the class in question and type this public override bool equals object obj then public override int gethashcode lets say you have this simple class before the overrides it would now look like this now you could use distinct on ienumerable types containing the foo class like so
if distinct is not working it is possibly a problem with the particular classes gethashcode or equals override methods which are either not set up correctly or omitted entirely

16291339
octal	decimal
try this some browsers might assume that it is an octal number if the string starts with 0
however 10 is not required in modern browsers with new ecmascript standards because they will always be considered as decimal unless specified or starts with 0x hexadecimal

16295040
jtextfield	jlabel
edit put jlabel jtextfield to jpanel quite simple and without side effects change built in flowlayout for jpanel required to call revalidate and repaint in the case that text in jlabel is changed
i have a jtextfield which has predefined and not editable text

16300709
union	distinct
well you can modify your second query as follows select coltab2 from table2 where coltab2 not in select coltab1 from table1 or maybe you just want to select the union of the two tables which will omit duplicates by default select coltab1 from table1 union select coltab2 from table2 note that relying on union to omit duplicates between the two recordsets is not quite the same thing as any duplicates that exist within each recordset will also be omitted
if that is a concern one can select distinct .

16301299
allocator	stl
if your own allocator then ensures it allocates memory from the shared memory rather than the process own address space then things should work better
placing an stl map in any kind of shared memory between processes or tasks with separate address spaces cannot be done reliably without changes

16303637
apache	nginx
to get mydomain1 and mydomain2 unther the port 80 these is all about dns not apache
theres no way to run apache nginx and your node httpserver on the same port

16304038
client-side	server-side
the client-side validation is only to have a better usability of your website and not to overload your server with useless validation
the only way to be sure your fields are validated is to do the validation server-side

16304791
base	fractions
so while for the integral part you divide by base to move the more significant digits towards the decimal point for the fractions part you have to multiply by base to move the less significant digits towards the decimal
roughly of course unless base is a power of 2 you may get rounding errors so only so many digits are correct and the fractions part will never become zero unless due to rounding for odd bases so the loop condition cannot be

16305281
uiview	subviews
yes you can not present a viewcontroller from a uiview subclass
to solve this problem you can use your subviews s superview s viewcontroller class

16306950
emacs	aquamacs
this solution does not depend upon using aquamacs -- a generic flavor of emacs will suffice
as to an osx version of emacs snow leopard and mountain lion with package auctex-11.86 the following lines of code within tex.el affect viewing .pdf files line 1028 evince evince mode-io-correlate -p outpage o line 1119 output-pdf evince skim.app is widely considered to be the most appropriate .pdf viewer for osx .tex documents because of its ability to auto-update the display when it detects a change of the .pdf file and because of its ability to use inverse-search command + shift + left-click to jump back to the text editor at the precise point where the mouse was clicked

16307462
alloca	malloc
you may not need to actually call the libc alloca routine at all
finally note that malloc really isn t that slow

16308382
memcached	apc
if i have more than 2 servers i like to used memcached they are good on using memory to cache
however it is up to you not everyone like memcached and not everyone like apc

16308382
memcached	apc
however it is up to you not everyone like memcached and not everyone like apc
for caching whole web page i ran a lot of wordpress and i used apc memcache filecache on some cache plugins like w3total cache

16308453
udp	tcp
some applications like skype fall down to tcp when udp connection is assumed to be blocked
tcp establishes a connection before the actual data transmission takes place udp does not

16308453
udp	tcp
tcp establishes a connection before the actual data transmission takes place udp does not
in this way udp can provide faster delivery

16311267
uiview	subviews
cptlayer is a subclass of calayer so you can t just use the custom uiview as a core plot annotation
however you could insert your custom view as a sibling of the core plot hosting view not a subviews

16312664
daemons	systemd
network access rdbmss provide access to the database through a server daemons a specialized software program that listens for requests on a network and allows database clients to connect to and use the database
users do not need to be able to log in to the physical computer systemd to use the database providing convenience for the users and a layer of security for the database

16314668
flask	django
the problem using python 3 with any python web-framework at this point is that most of the python web-framework ecosystem be it django s ecosystem flask s pyramid s are not compatible with python 3
many of the most popular django apps do not claim to support python 3 so you will be out of luck if you want to use these apps to build your django website

16314668
apache	nginx
most people do not know how to tweak apache to run efficiently
nginx by default will give you high throughput and efficient worker cpu-memory consumption

16315884
google-chrome	firefox
to get it work on google-chrome and safari scroll to the bottom of this
my profile is not good enough to comment on jim b-g s answer but what worked for me was to add a handler for the loaded event on the richtextbox and inside that handler add however it only worked on ie and firefox

16316268
onresume	onpause
you would then read the data from your sharedpreferences in onresume to restore your state
i think it might be useful to read a little here and especially here here is a quoute note that it is important to save persistent data in onpause instead of onsaveinstancestate bundle because the latter is not part of the lifecycle callbacks so will not be called in every situation as described in its documentation. i also think this might be of interest i know that i have not really answered your question but it is not entierly clear what you want to achieve

16317668
daemons	systemd
it may not be necessary if you know that the daemons will never open a terminal device file
also on some systemd it may not be necessary even if the daemons does open a terminal device file since that behavior is implementation-defined

16319125
uiview	subviews
how to add tableview as subviews and in answer to the broader question of how to add the table view to a view with other stuff on it rather than doing the following in loadview you should instead be doing the following in loadview or if you are not building the view programmatically in loadview but rather using a nib or storyboard you can then just do the following in viewdidload regardless by making sure you have another a main uiview and your uitableview is a subviews you can therefore add other controls to that main view
view and view controller hierarchies looking further into your code sample i see that you re creating the controller grabbing its view adding that view as a subviews and then letting the controller fall out of scope

16322346
icmp	tcp
traditionally this refers to sending an icmp echo request which does not involve connection state but is also often not allowed to ordinary user ids such as your application will run under
you appear to be using a stateful tcp connection instead and may be running into difficulty in if your server is not tuned to be able to accept rapid reconnects

16322346
udp	tcp
your best solution though would probably be to switch from tcp which is ill suited to this task to udp which is probably a better match
udp does not have connection state and it s also unreliable in that no automatic retries are attempted

16325303
vb.net	vb6
- represents a 32-bit signed integer and the value of overflows the integer and becomes -1 hence when you call randomnumberlong function you are passing 0 to lowerbound and -1 to upperbound in order to fix this in vb.net use or to indicate long type literal
i am not sure how to fix this as quickly in vb6 as in vb.net from the example above

16325447
clang	llvm
so it is important to notice that if you are going to share your project with other developers using older versions of xcode specifically older versions of the clang llvm compiler you must synthesize your variables or the project will not compile in their machines or will fail at runtime
although you don t need to type that boilerplate code for non- dynamic properties since llvm 4.0 xcode 4.4+ it s a good thing to know that it is a compiler feature not part of the language objective c nor the runtime system

16329361
dictionary	map
self.matrix isn t an array it is a dictionary
this is comparable to a std map in c++

16330126
allocator	stl
allocator must be a class that satisfy the stl allocator requirement it cannot be a pointer
ignoring the allocator std list only take one type not two

16333760
cpython	pypy
i am not aware of any major django deployment that runs pypy instead of cpython
a better question is why you d want to switch to pypy for a django app especially as django has been extensively tested and deployed with cpython

16334782
svg	vml
raphaël does svg to vml conversion for you it understands native svg
it doesn t sound like learning vml is worth it in your case

16338687
google-chrome	firefox
if you select an image in google-chrome or in ie it works. in firefox it doesn t
i think the problem is that you can t add an image like you re supposed to. this problem is related to firefox at least in my case this is

16343133
uiview	calayer
well the docs of uiview class say the following properties of the uiview class are animatable property frame property bounds property center property transform property alpha property backgroundcolor property contentstretch so the color cannot be animated sorry
edit my answer concerned uiview animations but there are also calayer animations which are more flexible

16343542
ubuntu	linux
i am not sure but you can easily install something like virutal box with a free copy of ubuntu server and have this setup and working in an hour or so
long as you have some experience with command line in any type of linux system this should be easy

16345471
subtraction	multiplication
the subtraction did not introduce any error but rather exposed the error introduced in the earlier multiplication
benign cancellation occurs when subtracting exactly known quantities. if x and y have no rounding error then by theorem 2 if the subtraction is done with a guard digit the difference x-y has a very small relative error less than 2

16346132
punctuation	words
if you need it to match punctuation as part of words such as in. then w won t be adequate and you can use s anything but a space
if you want to make sure the words is preceded and followed by a space and not a period like is happening in your case then use lookaround

16350845
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication
this doesn t matter for addition and multiplication but it does for subtraction and division
for example the subtraction calculation should be rather than

16351221
bash	tcsh
you are reading bash sh documentation and using tcsh
tcsh doesn t have any way to redirect just stderr

16352084
client-side	server-side
to help you identify the server-side code model.getxml .childnodes.count and are server code which cannot be combined in your particular case with javascript code to help you identify the client-side code currently i suppose it would be printing as many times the count model.getxml.childnodes i .innertext model.getxml.childnodes i .innertext
you are mixing up the server-side code c# and client-side code javascript you should convert the values in json or xml and put in hidden field and process the value in the hidden field in for loop in javascript aka client-side

mdpi	hdpi
1 dip 1 pixel on a mdpi screens
there are loads of devices out there with different screens densities not just normal and retina so there are multiple dpi buckets a device s screens may fall into ldpi low dpi around 120 dpi mdpi medium dpi around 160 dpi hdpi high dpi around 240 dpi xhdpi xtra high dpi around 320 dpi note that these are buckets so a device with a 170 dpi screens will count as an mdpi device

16353711
haskell	ocaml
this makes it easy to see how the haskell functor class is just a particular version of the mathematical concept
in ocaml a functor is not a type it s a module

16360821
memcpy	strcpy
did you try memcpy image1 image2 sizeof image
edit alocate data for image2.data after that you have to strcpy image2.data image1.data if data is null terminated but if its not then use memcpy with the size of data

16362811
hmac	pbkdf2
the pwdtk.net library seems to be the only implementation i can find that does pbkdf2 hmac sha-512 and allows for salt and iterations
i have not been able to locate test vectors for pbkdf2 hmac sha-512 to test with

16364967
implements	extends
you could simply implements it like the following but i m not sure it s the best idea
moreover you can t guarantee that all implementations of the interface extends your abstract class

16369682
lisp	scheme
common lisp progn set a b values i m not sure of the equivalent in scheme
a lisp repl always prints some return value

16370063
google-chrome	firefox
it seems that in google-chrome when the html is it is necessary to call load before playing when the src is changed
your second audio doesn t preload so your function needs to be this then it seems that in firefox it is necessary to set when attaching an event to the canplay event like in the 3rd function

16371734
realloc	calloc	calloc	malloc
otherwise if the argument does not match a pointer earlier returned by the calloc malloc or realloc function or if the space has been deallocated by a call to free or realloc the behavior is undefined
the pointers passed to free must be a pointer returned by a previous call to malloc calloc or realloc

16372390
dataframe	multi-index
another way to achieve this instead of populating the dataframe dataframe is to add the multi-index to the original arrays df_a and df_b and then concatenate them see below
the reason dataframe does not get filled is because pandas does data alignment based on the index

16373660
super	implements
if you want to absorb the touch within your subclassed view then you should not call super touches method
however if you want to make the view capable of passing the touches to next responder then you can implements the super touches method

16378240
realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
providing a replacement malloc calloc realloc and free and getting your linker args in the right order so that the overrides take place this is what gcc recommends these days although i ve had situations where it was impossible to do and i had to use deprecated __malloc_hook -- again new and delete tend to be implemented in terms of these but not always
avoiding all the standard allocation methods operator new malloc etc in our code and using custom functions instead -- not very easy with existing codebase

16378254
ocaml	sml
and implementations of it exist sml nj aliceml moscowml but ocaml is not sml
however several industrial users of ocaml need agreement on the future directions of the language

16378370
sqldatasource	objectdatasource
sqldatasource is not good for custom paging
i have to add another pager part and like old asp page to manually write the code. but objectdatasource is much easy for this

16383423
oncreate	findviewbyid	oncreate	setcontentview
your were getting a nullpointerexception when using btn in oncreate
this is because findviewbyid looks for the view in the currently inflated layout which does not exist until setcontentview has been called

16385035
inline	inlining
once you compile code into a library it will not inline the function no matter what the function does
there is some whole program optimization schemes available in at least msvc and gcc probably other compilers too that produce a object file that is only part of the way to machine-code so that some of the information about what the source code wanted is available to the final code-generation linking stage to move code around perform inlining and such but this is only applicable when all source-files are available at the compile-time

16388203
udp	tcp
enet is good because it provides the benefits of both worlds - the reliability of tcp and the freedom and light weight of udp
there is nothing wrong with the fact that enet internally uses only udp and not tcp because enet is able to provide almost everything that tcp does and much more

16388203
udp	tcp
there is nothing wrong with the fact that enet internally uses only udp and not tcp because enet is able to provide almost everything that tcp does and much more
if you wish to have encryption you will have to add it yourself no matter if you chose tcp udp or enet

16388511
udp	tcp
if this were a tcp socket you could do socket.getinputstream .available but according to your post you are using udp
if so - then no a udp socket does not have the notion of available bytes -- because you aren t really connected to anything on the other side

16392141
spaces	delimiter
the spaces are trimmed from this final value by using normalize-space in the xsl value-of element
xslt itself takes care of a missing field2 or any field by returning the null string from substring-before if the delimiter string isn t found in the target string

16399509
pdfbox	itext	pdfbox	itextsharp
pdfbox meanwhile has become an apache project and is located here and the current version as of may 2013 is 1.8.1
and i m very sure that pdfbox nowerdays does support pdf object streams and cross reference streams which were new in pdf reference version 1.5 the version adobe acrobat 6 has been built for if that does not work you might want to try other pdf libraries itext or itextsharp in your case version 5.4.x if the agpl or alternatively buying a license is no problem for you

16399509
pdfbox	itext
and i m very sure that pdfbox nowerdays does support pdf object streams and cross reference streams which were new in pdf reference version 1.5 the version adobe acrobat 6 has been built for if that does not work you might want to try other pdf libraries itext or itextsharp in your case version 5.4.x if the agpl or alternatively buying a license is no problem for you
information on text parsing using itext sharp can be found in chapter15 marked content and parsing pdf of itext in action 2nd edition

16399826
nunit	mstest
you can then use nunit to run the tests outside vs or use tools like resharper to run those tests inside vs
actually mstest doesn t work with simple class library projects. you will have to create a unit test project and place your tests there

16402680
google-chrome	firefox
the of operator doesn t appear to be currently supported in google-chrome
it seems that only firefox versions 13 through 18 support it

16403869
html5lib	beautifulsoup
telling beautifulsoup to use html5lib will give you the result you want beautifulsoup markup html5lib you ll need to install html5lib of course
beautifulsoup 4 doesn t have quote_tags because it has no parser of its own it relies on external parsers

16409252
opera	firefox
it doesn t work in ie or opera
webkit is currently the only browser to support css filters while firefox supports svg filters on html

16410899
lxml	beautifulsoup
the html is probably broken in some weird way and python s html parser isn t great at understanding that sort of thing even with bs4 s help. also you don t need to change your code if you install lxml beautifulsoup will automatically pick up lxml and use it to parse the html instead
download and install lxml

16417268
sudo	passwd
only if you are in admin group then you don t need passwd but for all other even though you have access but you need to type the sudo passwd
in this case sudo doesn t have a tty to ask for the passwd and hence the error

16419709
macports	homebrew
perhaps you can use macports to install the python of your choice and then use the corresponding pip probably opt local bin pip to install the necessary python packages
if macports is something you re not using anymore i suggest to use homebrew instead

16421855
multiplying	multiplication
if that expression will indeed yield true and yes they really are multiplying true by a number
that s okay i wouldn t do it but it s allowed true will get automatically coerced into a number 1 because both sides of a are coerced to numbers before the multiplication

16422923
mp4	h.264
most of players expect h.264 in some container like mkv mp4 or flv and do not support playing of raw h.264 streams
for players using directshow filters like mpc-hc wmp it also needs raw h.264 annexb demuxer before decoder

16427324
multiplication	modulo
if you can t use a library that implements biginteger arithmetic you can roll a modular multiplication yourself by splitting the factors in low-order and high-order parts
if the modulo m is so large that overflows things get really fussy but if doesn t overflow it s bearable

16441235
floating-point	fractions
it s just that your interpretation what a number is and how it behaves is different from floating-point math
the usual problem not all exact decimal fractions can be represented exactly in binary

16442246
awt	swing
you can imagine that setting a backgroud color on an awt radio button might not be possible or using html on a label or tool tip
also swing can do skinning themes lookandfeels

16442246
awt	swing	swt	swing
now swt was a later initiative of ibm realized in eclipse for awt reloaded
not as customizable as swing but intended to be platform near

16444868
innodb	myisam
you need to use innodb tables for proper fk support if you do a show create table your_table you ll see the engine type being used at the end of the output
you re probably using myisam tables which do not support foreign keys

16447513
client-side	server-side
you could still do as much as possible on the client-side and through rest but if something is not possible client-side you still benefit from the server-side advantages of mvc
well you are still going to need an initial page which could be served by a server-side mvc engine

16448509
udp	tcp
in most situations udp isn t really a good idea
tcp is a really great alternative it s easy to use and it does garuantee all those things and there are many frameworks or c libraries out there that can help you a lot

16450850
punctuation	words
assuming the words you are searching for are not surrounded by punctuation or other words boundaries other than spaces blorgbeard s method is probably faster
you could define a regexp function yields note also that the regex bgoo b will match words boundaries that are not spaces

16451107
alloca	malloc
you may use alloca for stack allocations but this is significantly more advanced and not recommended
when you allocate space for the object using malloc or new it will always end up on the heap

16453349
equals	compareto
comment 1 whilst it s an issue for you to modify asoft s gangwar class it would be better if you could place above two methods of b into and then modify how gangwar constructs the set that way you can leave the two methods of a within class gang - leaving the class with it s true equals compareto from an object identity pov
comment 2 contradicting comments on asoft s bsoft s compareto methods from a theoretical pov if asoft s comment is not a typo then not only has asoft extended bsoft s interface but they ve changed the required behaviour of one of the methods

16458774
inline	inlining
in other words if the inline-functions is shared between translation units the compiler will not allow the inlining of methods with references to static variables and if it s local to a translation unit the compiler knows about every instantiation of the inline and it s easy to generate one and only one instance of the static
putting inline on a function should not change the semantics of the generated code

16459996
spaces	delimiter
-- assuming that you have user hadoop input graph_edges.csv in hdfs comes back as above with spaces
the problem is that hive does not allow you to specify the output delimiter - the solution is to create external table for output with delimiter specification and insert overwrite table instead of directory

16464396
implements	extends
the reason this is an expected behavior is because underlying you are using spring aop and spring aop essentially creates a dynamic proxy for you this proxy essentially implements the interface apoimappingmanager internally composes the apoimappingmanagerimpl and delegates calls to this composed class
so the proxy implements apoimappingmanager and does not extends apoimappingmanagerimpl and hence the error

16467846
inline	constexpr
you could avoid invoking the call operator on pi so that it is not odr-used by your program and the compiler can treat pi just like a value that can be inline thus not requiring a definition for that static data member alternatively you could keep invoking pi s call operator and provide a definition of your static data member at namespace scope and use the call operator of as in your original code per paragraph 9.4.2 3 of the c++11 standard if a non-volatile const static data member is of integral or enumeration type its declaration in the class definition can specify a brace-or-equal-initializer in which every initializer-clause that is an assignment-expression is a constant expression 5.19
a static data member of literal type can be declared in the class definition with the constexpr specifier

16471270
super	self
meanwhile if you do want room3 to be a class there are a lot of problems with your design first that super call is going to raise an exception because room.__init__ takes x y and desc parameters and you aren t passing them
you have to change it to super room3 self .__init__ x y desc

16474722
octal	binary
if you want only the last nine bits then and the number with octal 777 all bits set binary 111_111_111
-rw-rw-r-- corresponds to the binary numeral 110110100 the first - isn t a permission

16477421
serializable	deserialization
instances variables these variables are serializable so during deserialization we will get back the serializable state
static variables these variables are not serializable so during deserialization static variable value will loaded from the class. current value will be loaded. transient variables transient variables are not serializable so during deserialization those variables will be initialized with corresponding default values ex for objects null int 0

16477421
serializable	deserialization
static variables these variables are not serializable so during deserialization static variable value will loaded from the class. current value will be loaded. transient variables transient variables are not serializable so during deserialization those variables will be initialized with corresponding default values ex for objects null int 0
super class variables if super class also implemented serializable interface then those variables will be serializable otherwise it won t serialize the super class variables

16480301
apache	nginx
you can t see whether the client uses ssl or not because they are connected to load balancer not your apache server
luckily for us nginx sends some additional headers for us

16483246
division	addition	division	multiplication
division and remainder an issue that has been hinted at in the comments is that division and or the remainder operation can be expensive
it is not uncommon for division to take some tens of processor cycles in comparison to a single cycle for addition and multiplication

16483305
floating-point	fractions
9999999999999999 is treated internally in javascript as a floating-point number
it cannot be accurately represented in ieee 754 double precision as it would require 54 bits of precision the number of bits is log2 9999999999999999 53.150849512 and since fractions bits do not exist the result must be rouned up while ieee 754 provides only 53 bits 1 implict bit + 52 explicitly stored bits of the mantissa - one bit less

16483339
bash	subshell
this would allow easy parsing as bash will do it and validation
to validate it source it in a subshell so the main shell is not affected output names of variables that are set filtering out variables which were set before sourcing then compare them to the list of known configuration variable names

16483854
udp	tcp
see what is the largest safe udp packet size on the internet
tcp is a stream transport not a packet transport and you will never get a guaranteed packet size

16485770
super	self
because the super class save method doesn t return anything
it doesn t need to self is being saved there s no point returning something else and calling it obj

16486462
factors	matrix
the missing levels are because you are trying to view the factors variables as if they were continuous ones - strictly they should not be displayed as biplot arrows i guess
anyway just as in regression with dummy variables one of the levels of the factors cannot be included because it is linearly dependent on the dummy variables for the remaining levels in the model matrix

16490405
spaces	delimiter
first you assume anything not a spaces is an alphabetic character
secondly if two words are separated by just a newline your code won t pick that up since it only checks for words that are spaces delimiter

16490656
swt	swing
if you have the option of building an swt rcp application you could get this dialog for free along with a huge tasty menu of additional common high-level functionality
the window in eclipse is not a swing dialog at all

16490945
onresume	onpause
step 2 onresume start a new timer with the time remaining in the aforementioned variable of course silly only if not zero step 3 be happy
pausing is here step 1 onpause stop the timer and store time remaining in a variable

16490975
gridview	datalist
you should use a gridview if you re going to use the html table element
if you re not going to use a table then use a datalist

16491079
decimal	ieee
this gives you all of the advantages of decimal without the costs although it does open an obvious window to create new bugs by forgetting to shift 2 places somewhere
a float cannot be truncated or rounded to 2 decimal digits because there are many values with 2 decimal digits that just cannot be represented exactly as an ieee double

16491079
decimal	ieee
a float cannot be truncated or rounded to 2 decimal digits because there are many values with 2 decimal digits that just cannot be represented exactly as an ieee double
if you really want what you say you want you need to use a type with exact precision like decimal

16491388
layoutparams	viewgroup
...the inflater attempts to do two things inflate the xml layout using the supplied viewgroup to determine root layoutparams attach the inflated layout to the supplied viewgroup you don t want the second thing to happen because you are handing the view off to an alertdialog not attaching it to the current focus which is apparently a listview in your crash log
you also don t want the first thing to happen as written because the current focus won t be the parent of this inflated view so using it to figure out layoutparams is pointless as well

16492226
postgresql	mysql
the equivalent postgresql one is called random
your sql statement is not a postgres one activerecord statementinvalid postgresql error error function rand does not exist rand is a mysql function

16492908
setcontentview	findviewbyid
but this view object is not associated with current activity as we have not called setcontentview view
here view linearlayout 41e29740 next line - linearlayout ly1 linearlayout findviewbyid r.id.linearlayout again gets the view which is active for current activity

16493991
google-chrome	firefox
see this link for more detail html5 google-chrome checkvalidity onblur as you said in your comment below you have to use the function this.checkvalidity in an if clause in your onblur function before making the ajax call and dispay any errors yourself since in browsers other than firefox the native validation message ui isn t triggered unless the form is submitted
in firefox it should check the email for validity as you re typing by default native html5 behavior but to support all html5 browsers you ll need to manually call checkvalidity onblur and or onkeydown

16495477
implements	extends
when you implements runnable you can save a space for your class to extends any other class in future or now
java doesn t support multiple inheritance which means you can only extends one class in java so once you extended thread class you lost your chance and can not extends or inherit another class in java

16497309
addition	modulo	exponent	addition	exponent	modulo
in addition to the fact that finding the exact period of a modulo n is usually far more work than just computing a r mod n for some that makes it very doubtful whether it s worth even attempting to reduce the exponent further
generally when the modulo is not a prime the case when is analogous with n-1 replaced by λ n where λ is the carmichael function which yields the smallest exponent of the group of units of z n

16497402
allegro	sdl
sfml and sdl 2 let you set the opengl version allegro only lets you use opengl 3.0 or no version specified at the moment
of these allegro has the best documentation atm sdl 2 the worst sdl2 still isn t quite stable

16498487
actionscript	mxml
asc 2.0 is used to compile pure actionscript projects to be as specific as possible asc 2.0 aka a version of the falcon compiler is used to compile pure actionscript projects created with flash builder 4.7
falcon is used to compile mxml apps no it isn t

16499751
icmp	udp	icmp	tcp
the router may pass on normal traffic thus allowing your tcp-based http request to complete but it may silently drop udp to weird ports half open tcp to weird ports or icmp pings with low ttl leaving your local traceroute process waiting and then timing out on that stop
if a router along the way decides to not send the icmp time exceeded ttl reached en-route or destination unreachable message udp-packet reached final host but port closed proper behaviour though you will get a timeout at that point in the traceroute

16500624
hex	binary
you can represent them in binary but you can also represent them in decimal or hex you still have read the exact same values from the file
reading a file in binary determines the values you read not how you represent them

16501374
qthread	qobject
btw your scenario doesn t really require to extend qthread - so you are better off not doing it unless you really have to
that is why in this example i will use a normal qthread with a qobject based worker instead but the concept is the same if you subclass qthread the main ui .

16502606
vbscript	vba
there are 3 mistakes in your script dim sn as string as adrien lacroix already pointed out vbscript doesn t support typed variable declarations as vba does
change that line into this dim sn you want to assign the character f to the variable sn so you have to make the former an actual string by putting it between double quotes vbscript doesn t support variable expansion inside strings

16503330
fgets	realloc
because fgets will preserve the newline if there is one and a newline will exist if we ve read the whole line and we re not at the end of the file we ve read the whole line if there is a newline before the end of the string or we have reached end-of-file
if we have not read the whole line double the current allocated size of the buffer and realloc the buffer

16504648
ssl	https
and if any of those solutions did not work then you ve better purchase an ssl certificate to solve your problem
just try these configuration directives in your .htaccess file but please considered the flag with this link or try to use a robots.txt file if it can block or remove the pages in https on search engines

16505388
clang	llvm
if you are referring to clang as the c c++ objc frontend to llvm then there s no such api i know of - this is not the kind of thing a front-end is designed to do
llvm core which is a part of clang if you refer to it as a complete compiler can do these kinds of things but then there s no api to translate it back to the source language

16505616
client-side	server-side
each has its advantages and disadvantages loading html advantages you can do generation on the server-side thereby keeping the client-side code clean disadvantages the size of the packet you send over the wire will be bigger the request is very specific to that method alone and it will be difficult to reuse loading json advantages payload is as small as can be since you re not tying it to one implementation you can reuse the json for other purposes a mobile client for example disadvantages generation of html has to be done on the client-side
if you re doing this manually or with jquery this can be cumbersome and tends to grow the client-side script

16508678
floyd-warshall	dijkstra
using dynamic programming this can be efficiently solved for with the floyd-warshall algorithm which is designed specifically to find all possible shortest paths from s to t
floyd-warshall does have an improvement over dijkstra s when you want to handle negative edge weights dijkstra s won t handle negative weights however keep in mind that floyd-warshall s algorithm cannot deal with negative cycles

16509289
interpolation	splines
since mouse movement events don t always come fast enough linear interpolation isn t always enough
i experimented a little bit with the splines idea brought up by rocketmagnet

16510315
jax-ws	jax-rs
strictly speaking metro doesn t use jax-ws but includes already mentioned jax-ws reference implementation
jersey included jax-rs implementation and glassfish is not a web-service framework but an application server

16510866
serializable	deserialization
in fact for example in gson serializable deserialization is quite straightforward with a simple pojo just like this serializable deserialization i suggest you to take a look at gson documentation which is pretty clear and quite short once you read it you ll understand everything much better.
those libraries do not need to use files to operate so answering your question no file serializable is not mandatory

16511773
octal	binary
you will need to convert your constants to octal hexadecimal or decimal to use them in cuda
binary constants using the 0b prefix are a gcc extension and is not part of standard c99 or c++98 c++03

16514656
jqgrid	datatables
with jqgrid you will have to customize the theme
cons of using jsf - rich datatables is not very customizable and not that rich compared to jqgrid

16514656
jqgrid	datatables
cons of using jsf - rich datatables is not very customizable and not that rich compared to jqgrid
so if you have a complex ui and you realize that a particular ui feature is not supported via rich datatables you have no option but to use some other component or let go off that feature

16515680
strdup	malloc
you can use strdup
since it is using malloc internally do not forget to call free in the destructor

16516597
express	node.js
this did the trick also see node.js express app handle startup errors
the accepted solution did not work for me on nodejs 0.8.22 and express 3.1.0

16517580
factors	matrix
the factors and offset applied to zdfor each viewport encoded by n and f are set using gldepthrange so there you have it to become pixel perfect you must find a projection that s exactly the inverse of the composition of vertex clip coordinates to vertex normalized coordinates to vertex window coordinates
let w 1 then you can substitute normalized for clip vertex coordinates and hence since we re not interested in the z coordinate we can rewrite this slightly we have changed this into a homogenous matrix transformation where v_c is the vertex position after projection from eye space to clip space and where v is the viewport transformation matrix so we can rewrite this again as we re getting close

16518563
dictionary	map
edit some suggestions to improve your dictionary call function i ve made the function const since it doesn t modify anything and most impprtantly i use to avoid inserting extra entries into the map if the object isn t already there
and since i m adding the const you ll have to update the typedef another suggestion unless the factory functions need access dictionary make them static

16520885
uiview	subviews
the standard uitableviewcontroller is not capable of dealing with a uiview as view property that contains a table view and other views as siblings
plus it is not a good idea of adding more subviews to the table view with respect to its scrolling behaviour etc

16522742
ssl	https
spring security s x.509 authentication won t work if the ssl connection doesn t terminate at the servlet container
so if you have https between the client and apache and a non-ssl connection from apache to the servlet container then the client certificate won t normally be available

16523923
draggable	droppable
you ll probably then want to manually append your draggable on drop of a droppable element
here s an open bug on the issue - draggable appendto option doesn t work together with helper original

16524489
comparator	comparable
to compare age instead replace the comparator method with this
firstly you should type the comparable interface secondly you should use leading lowercase for your parameters variables public comparator contact contact thirdly prefer not using this

16525539
imperative	declarative
if you want to model three steps of an imperative algorithm you ll have to use three variable x x and x
the alloy language is declarative meaning that you write a specification of what has to happen in the end and not how to make it happen which is the imperative approach

16527055
udp	tcp
a custom protocol can be heavily optimized at the cost of maintanability and portability several languages have their own json interpreter while custom interpreters may need to be implemented or encapsuled adding layers to the process and thus lowering performance or requiring code conversion. if you couldn t care less if a packet or two are lost then udp may be a viable solution
less control than tcp means a lighter protocol but you re never sure that the data reached the other side unless you implement your own control

16528156
awt	swing
difficult to know the exact cause without seeing all of your code however i ve seen this happen if you schedule swing timers without a swing awt gui
the edt and shutdown threads get destroyed and re-created every time the timer fires if there is not a swing awt gui present

16528156
awt	swing
the edt and shutdown threads get destroyed and re-created every time the timer fires if there is not a swing awt gui present
you have tagged this question with javafx if you have an javafx gui you should not use the swing timer class or other swing threading utilities such as invokelater invokeandwait or swingworker

16533725
ssl	https
since most registrars don t allow you upload a ssl certificate to their redirection server browsers cannot establish the necessary secure connection to the server and therefore they never issue a http request
thus requests for https example.com fail

16534726
bash	zsh
either use bash or you ll need to port the lines in the dot files that are throwing errors so that they will work in zsh and if you do this you can fork or branch or suggest changes to paulirish so he can pick up these changes and make them available for other interested folks
zsh is not bash and when i launch zsh i see the same error that you do these paulirish dot files are meant to be used with bash

vsto	add-in
here is a great article on using vsto contrib that helps provide this functionality update enable your vsto log file by adding the following on your system environment variables name vsto_logalerts value 1 there might be an exception error that is why your add-in is not loading
you can check this source for more info on vsto logging and alerts but in essence you change two environment variable values depending on what you need to do displaying vsto alert prompts to display each error in a message box set the vsto_suppressdisplayalerts variable to 0 zero

16536668
cpython	pypy
in addition to everything that s been said here pypy is not nearly as rock solid as cpython in terms of bugs
with sympy we ve found at about a dozen bugs in pypy over the past couple of years both in released versions and in the nightlies

16539424
serializable	deserialization
imo it s a flaw in dart json library that stringify doesn t support additional callback to serializable types lacking the implementation of tojson
strangely enough parse function does support reviver argument to customize the deserialization process

16539424
serializable	deserialization
the promise of dart is that i would be able to use my types both on server and client but if i have to manually implement serializable deserialization for all my models then it is too awkward to be usable
it also doesn t help that datetime itself is not very flexible with formatting as there are no other methods besides tostring which returns the format useless for serializable

16543974
client-side	server-side
the cache of requirejs is not only client-side dependend
it s server-side dependent too

16544868
stateless	stateful
typical examples of stateless methods are factory methods binary operators .
of course static methods aren t always stateless though there are samples of static stateful methods

16547209
cobertura	jacoco
however note that a lot of people are moving away from cobertura because it doesn t seem to be very actively developed anymore
jacoco seems to be the new favorite coverage tool

16550052
freebsd	solaris
on platforms where the native make prefers a different makefile name you can do a variation on this on freebsd i have the above decoy in the bsdmakefile which is used in preference to makefile thus preventing the system make from mangling my build
afaict the aix or solaris make do not have an alternate name you could use in this way

16550403
email	dkim
first is impossible to be sure that an email will not be marked as spam the only way is that the person who receive the email add the sender address in a white list
spf and dkim are only to guarantee that the email comes from that domain or email but not to guarantee that it is not spam

16550403
email	dkim
spf and dkim are only to guarantee that the email comes from that domain or email but not to guarantee that it is not spam
the antispam system in outlook.com as many others check a lot of things for example the sender ip address how many email comes from that ip per hour the content of the email text links reputation etc

16552321
passenger	webrick
i inherited a set of about thirty hosts with a webrick puppet master where things were doing okay but when i started deploying new systems all of the puppet traffic caused by a fresh deployment including a couple of gigabyte files 1 was preventing other hosts from getting their updates so that s when i was forced to switch to passenger
in short you ll probably be okay with 30 nodes if you re not doing anything too intense with puppet but at that point you need to be monitoring the performance of at least your puppet master and preferably your clients update status too so you ll know when you start running beyond the capabilities of webrick

16556349
bash	zsh
if the above works you just have a path issue as i have never seen pidof as a bash builtin. if that doesn t work try the following this is probably not a simple as you want but it works for me where some_program is the name you would normally supply pidof
you may wish to which pidof in bash to determine the location of pidof and then try running zsh with the absolute path

16557956
implements	extends
java doesn t allow a class to provide multiple implementations for the same method signature from multiple different interfaces implements the same method multiple times with some form of qualification alias annotation to distinguish
see java overriding two interfaces clash of method names java - method name collision in interface implementation avoid use of inheritence extends or implements and instead use object composition see e.g

16561037
udp	tcp
the big traffic will be handled through the udp connections
as such it doesn t cause big performance issues if i unpack manipulate and repackage the messages that are being sent over tcp

16562453
equals	gethashcode
overriding gethashcode is required when you override equals otherwise hash-based containers might not work correctly
from the documentation of object.equals types that override equals must also override gethashcode

16562917
translation	localization
within our company we use different methods simply because the ideal solution does not exist yet. for desktop development we re using po files simply because the buttons are not scaled and therefore text will fit. for mobile development the translation of a string depends on the button size which could be different on landscape and portrait devices. so this complicates it a little because a po file can just have 1 translation of a certain word. so we selected xliff for this so we could assign unique id s to a string. this is not an easy task as well because there are no good solutions to convert .rc files to xliff files. because current tools convert all strings between which is of course unwanted behavior . so i wrote a converter for this task
however when thinking of localization then plural forms are very important so not having this is not a good localization solution. therefore i would say to go for po gettext

16564980
apache	nginx
show indexes is a configuration parameter of apache nginx
in production with nginx just add to the static serving part for dev environnement hedde s answer is indeed the good answer but the display may not be the exact same than the one offered by your http server

16567053
serializable	deserialization
when serializing put all members of the globals class in a dictionary and serializable it
upon deserialization you will know that you have a dictionary not a random mess of objects

16567933
ubuntu	debian
first off i wouldn t bet on being able to cross-compile for linux-arm or linux-x86 targets from a windows host so the rest of my advices are for your ubuntu box only
concerning ubuntu for arm on your beagleboard as long as it uses one of the debian armel armhf architectures then you can just install an emdebian cross-toolchain along with xapt

16570617
nsstring	nsobject
and to be honest i would create name_key etc. as static nsstring constants instead of macros
one more note since birdsighting inherits directly from nsobject which does not implement nscoding i use

16571233
sse	avx
the second part of the question is whether or not 128-bit arithmetic emulation in gcc benefits from sse avx instructions or registers
as implied in paulr s comments there isn t much in sse avx that s going to allow you to do 128-bit arithmetic more easily

16572041
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it s probably not really the regexp that s different but rather as you pointed out yourself firefox adds quotes around the url while safari and google-chrome does not
hence in firefox you get .jpg which is matched by your regexp but in safari and google-chrome you get .jpg which does not matched by your regexp

16573125
octal	decimal
the first is octal 010 octal is 8 in decimal
similarly 009 isn t a real number hence the error you re seeing there is no digit 9 in octal

16574717
3des	aes
but there are some strange points here 3des uses a 168 bit key if you want to use symmetric encryption you should probably use aes
3des isn t totally broken but it s pretty much for legacy use only

16576200
queue	fifo
the only dispatch queue used by nsoperationqueue to execute your code is the default priority global concurrent queue
there is no such thing there isn t a one-to-one correspondence of an nsoperationqueue and a dispatch_queue_t the queueing concepts in the two apis are very different nsoperationqueue does not have strict fifo queueing like gcd does

16576801
implements	extends
implements runnable on the primary class exposes it for abuse because the run method is public
a second improvement is to use to delegate your activity to an interface and this can be passed around like a function pointer whereas extends the class cannot

16577554
xlib	xcb
example for including xlib and calling xinitthreads example for linking of course don t forget to link the other files that may be necessary to your application
to all concerned fix jaydeep s problems xcb unknown request in queue while dequeuing xcb most likely this is a multi-threaded client and xinitthreads has not been called xcb aborting sorry about that

16579058
factors	mean
to give you an example most pdf readers give you an option to reopen the pdf files at the exact same page as well as the same zoom factors as it was on the last time you closed it
but that does not mean that it saves the page number and the zoom factors in the pdf itself

16582410
codeigniter	cakephp
from what i ve heard the future doesn t look that bright for codeigniter
see articles below codeigniter used to have a bigger community but many moved to different frameworks after ellislab the company behind it dropped support and no new features were added. - from and also i d go with cakephp but i m biased because i use cakephp

16582876
innodb	myisam
to not have this use myisam instead of innodb as storage engine
this is a problem in the innodb the storage engine of mysql

16583060
udp	tcp
couldn t work with udp because without framing the packets got dropped frames became incomplete rows out of sync
hence tcp using udp is a matter or changing that word in the commands

16584196
pthreads	fork
in case you are thinking of threads use pthreads incase you are looking for processes you need to use ipc mechanisms
fork doesnot create a thread it creates processes processess will have different address spaces altogether hence data wil not be shared even if it is global data

16590307
puma	unicorn
puma is a web server that really implements thread based concurrency but for achieve that you have to use a ruby version that implement thread concurrency to
if not you ll be forking processes again and i think that way you ll not gain anything with puma instead of unicorn

16592928
stateless	stateful
although not recommended a stateless ejb may of course hold some internal technical state which may enable it to get faster access to external stateless resources on instance reuse
see ejb lifecycle diagrams available on the web and in books. stateful session beans on the other hand ought to be used in a stateful manner that is they are intended to hold state over some time and spanning multiple client requests

16593505
equals	compareto
your best bet is to make your compareto method consistent with equals by comparing by both the f property as well as whatever other properties equals cares about
this is the expected behavior as per the treeset docs note that the ordering maintained by a set whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if it is to correctly implement the set interface

16593505
equals	compareto	comparator	comparable
this is the expected behavior as per the treeset docs note that the ordering maintained by a set whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if it is to correctly implement the set interface
see comparable or comparator for a precise definition of consistent with equals. this is so because the set interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a treeset instance performs all element comparisons using its compareto or compare method so two elements that are deemed equal by this method are from the standpoint of the set equal

16593675
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
from the nullpointerexception documentation where it talks about when the jvm will throw this but also says applications should throw instances of this class to indicate other illegal uses of the null object
you could use illegalargumentexception for the more general case of arguments that aren t valid for the constructor but nullpointerexception is exactly right for the case of an argument being null that ought not be

16593675
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
you could use illegalargumentexception for the more general case of arguments that aren t valid for the constructor but nullpointerexception is exactly right for the case of an argument being null that ought not be
illegalargumentexception does have the advantage though of being pretty darned clear about what s wrong

16594382
libstdc++	libc++
gcc s standard library implementation libstdc++ does not include the codecvt header or std wstring_convert yet
libc++ does include both of these as does visual studio s standard library implementation

16595578
nodevalue	innerhtml
if however you are outputting to text in an html context such as nodevalue or innertext you will have to use n and ensure that the container has the css white-space property set to something that doesn t condence whitespace such as pre-wrap
if you are outputting to html such as with innerhtml just use

16595620
prepare	execute
you are not actually executing the prepare statement
you have to execute it before you try to retrieve data

16595801
ubuntu	linux
recompile with -fpic usr local lib libx264.a could not read symbols bad value in my case this answer although partly specific to ubuntu shed more light on the underlying issue with respect to x86_64 systems in general i believe if you enable-shared on ffmpeg you have to do the same on x264 on x86_64 systems otherwise you ll have a pic shared ffmpeg and non-pic static x264. the fix was to ensure the x264 sources which i originally compiled using the --enable-static flag with configure which generated usr local lib libx264.a was re-compiled using the --enable-shared flag which generates the correct target of usr local lib libx264.so
i got a similar error while compiling ffmpeg on an x86_64 machine running oracle linux 6.3

16598478
build.gradle	gradlew
so if you have your own project which uses gradlew build system you need to manually modify build.gradle configuration file since android studio ui doesn t affect it
edit2 with androidstudio v0.1.1 release ui part responsible for modules dependencies has been eliminated so for now we need to update dependencies manually through build.gradle file

16598478
build.gradle	gradlew
edit2 with androidstudio v0.1.1 release ui part responsible for modules dependencies has been eliminated so for now we need to update dependencies manually through build.gradle file
ui for changing gradlew dependencies is going to be released in next releases edit3 for those who still tries to use this approach - please note that it is obsolete and doesn t work anymore here is what i did 1 i took maps project from the google play services samples and copied that to the separate directory

16598856
client-side	server-side
if so this is probably not the best technique since like all client-side security it can easily be bypassed
better would be to use a regular expression to strip out such links on the server-side after the post

16601544
email	dkim
the markup seems correct however as you are not a whitelisted sender yet you can only try it by sending email to yourself
all email with schema must also be signed with dkim or spf to prove that you are the actual sender

16601977
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
they said i was using the navigation controller incorrectly it needs to be a top level construct and you shouldn t put it in another uiviewcontroller
that said you can put them in a container view controller like uitabbarcontroller and uisplitviewcontroller

16604305
vbscript	vba
according to this answer on so it is not possible using vbscript alone
there are vba methods to zip and unzip using the windows built in compression as well which should give some insight as to how the system operates

16605171
tcpdf	fpdf
but tcpdf documentation is not that readable
you should make use of pdf creator libraries like fpdf tcpdf ezpdf all three are easy to learn in the order i ve put

16608475
dictionary	map
the only font present in that document which is used with hexadecimal encoding is f1 and its font dictionary does contain an appropriate tounicode map for reliable text extraction
unfortunately though podofo does not yet seem to have implemented properly using that map for parsing purposes

16609174
move	drag
that failing you can use example usage version 1 - jquery matching the html has been updated so that it is valid as correctly suggested by nnnnnn no duplicate ids with this the javascript can be simplified to match up the drag- id to the answer- id and using the position jquery method to move the drag elements to the correct places version 2 - array matching if you did want to stick to using the arrays to power this i would use an object literal and treat the numbers as string ids personally the modification to the code would be as follows the css i am using for these test case here s a fiddle
in your code if your drag element is positioned within the same offset parent and both are absolutely positioned it should be as simple as replacing with if it is not absolutely positioned then it is not quite the same as setting the offset jquery is clever enough to work out the correct relative positioning but animate does not use this same functionality

16610758
mongodb	bson
mongodb doesn t support xml document
all documents in mongodb are stored in bson format

16611339
google-chrome	firefox
the jsfiddle provided works in google-chrome
but it doesn t in firefox

16611833
ssl	https
using good cdns over https also mitigates much of the performance impact of ssl
one good reason is that page perfomance has a massive impact on sales there s lots of published studies and ssl has a big imact on performance - particularly if it s not tuned right

16614013
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
a uinavigationcontroller has it s very own navigationitem like any other uiviewcontroller that will only come into play if you push it onto the stack of another uinavigationcontroller
generally you aren t going to push one uinavigationcontroller onto another so manipulating self.navigationcontroller.navigationitem is pointless

16615977
super	extends
you cannot use the super statement in a static method
in actionscript classes can extends other base classes not marked as final

16617831
onresume	onpause
onresume the fragment is visible in the running activity onpause this is usually where you should commit any changes that should be persisted beyond the current user session because the user might not come back
conclusion so it is better to register the receiver only inside onresume and unregister inside onpause because oncreateview deals with view hierarchy only

16620973
lisp	scheme
in ansi common lisp the empty list atom is the same object as the symbol nil which evaluates to itself and also serves as boolean false
in scheme isn t a symbol and is distinct from the boolean false #f object

16623609
inline	inlining
it may avoid inlining a function marked inline even implicitly when inside class definition
it may also inline some functions not marked inline

16623773
quicksort	mergesort
the algorithm you implemented is a flawed quicksort without removing the so-called pivot element in your case m
the merge operation you do does not need to do any merging as in merge sort because the a call to mergesort left would already return a sorted left if you were to handle the pivot correctly

16624652
set	bag
the inverse is adding an item to a bag can be faster than using a set because uniqueness does not have to be enforced ayende one of the main contributors to nhibernate posted these a while back
you would want to use instead of i notice that you are mapping your collection currently as a bag

16624652
set	bag
because a set mandates that each item is in a collection only once it is very easy to remove an item using a single delete statement on that item s id
a bag does not mandate collection uniqueness so the only way for nhibernate to delete an item is to delete everything and then re-add every item that was not the deleted item

16625673
subtract	addition
sign extension not performed 100 2 00000100 2 unsigned 4 10 4 10 signed -4 10 4 10 sign extension performed 100 2 11111100 2 signed -4 10 -4 10 unsigned 4 10 252 10 001 2 00000001 2 signed and unsigned 1 10 1 10 overflow adding or subtract two numbers may give a result that is too big in an absolute sense to be correctly represented
addition of the same two binary sequences may cause overflow for signed numbers but not unsigned or vice versa

16628289
dictionary	map
as noted here a standard .net dictionary is the fastest you re going to get
the f# map structure is implemented as a binary tree and as such is not actually a dictionary

16628386
uptime	reboot
so i think the best approach is to xm shutdown check xm uptime the domain to see if it shutdown or until timeout and call xm destroy
i had issue with xm reboot it will not effect and cause subsequence xm shutdown has no effect too

16630916
flask	django
this mean the core of flask is very very simple
unlike django it will not make any technology decisions for you

16631811
udp	tcp
the one thing making it more complicated is that with udp you will not be able to enjoy the load balancer service that amazon offers as it currently only supports tcp-based protocols
so if you have one server you wish to put on the internet the procedure is probably same as what you d do with a tcp server set up a server and an elastic ip pointing to it and then have your clients connect to it by knowing the elastic ip you ve been allocated or by referring to that ip via a dns resolution

16634458
nunit	mstest
i d recommend switching to nunit if possible preferrably in combination with fluentassertions due to the not insignificant number of weird design decisions in mstest such as this behaviour the lack of easy-to-use parameterized tests and the fact that a test will get run even if throws an exception
check your bin directory - for some incomprehensible reason mstest copies all referenced assemblies to a new directory every time you run the tests

16635338
backtracking	greedy
note that with a greedy behaviour in your example you obtain the same result the first aaa is matched the regex engine take all the last characters and backtracking character by character until having the complete match
this is not a greedy lazy problem

16636821
rtp	rtsp	rtp	rtcp
as for the images you can use tidudpclient to send the rtp rtcp packets as needed
indy does not have any rtsp or rtp rtcp components so you will have to implement those protocols from scratch

16636821
rtsp	rtcp
indy does not have any rtsp or rtp rtcp components so you will have to implement those protocols from scratch
rtsp is a textual-based protocol so you can use tidcmdtcpserver though it may be better to derive from tid custom tcpserver and override its doexecute method to avoid duplicated code reading headers processing urls etc like tidhttpserver does

16641230
srp	ocp
first of all solid is not one principles it stands for 5 different principles srp single responsibility principles your class should have only one well-defined responsibility
ocp open-closed principles your class should be open for extension but closed for modification

16641773
profiling	debugging
you can have multiple provisioning profiling for an app the store provisioning profiling these don t have any devices associated with them an adhoc provisioning profiling and a debugging development provisioning profiling
just because you added your ipad to the development portal doesn t mean it s part of the provisioning profiling for your app

16646240
memcpy	strcpy
i recommend memcpy because strcpy and related function do not copy null character
i recommend to use memcpy for copying data. also if we assign a buffer to another as both array have same memory and any change in the arrary1 deflects in array2 too

16650428
prepare	execute
one thing to be aware of though are threading issues you will be calling the callbacks in your own thread so the callback implementor must be prepare to deal with that
the callback code must not assume it is execute on any particular thread

16651326
pthreads	fork
on pthreads systems multiprocessing works by using the fork syscall which clones the running process and all of its state including things like instances of complex classes such as pycurl.curl
windows does not have fork or anything like it so multiprocessing fires up a new python interpreter for each child process with a special stub function that listens to the parent process and recreates the state so that it looks much like it would had fork been used

16652942
opera	safari
opera safari and google-chrome love it
also i mentioned earlier that mobile safari doesn t work

16656024
bash	zsh
other platforms even unix-like may not have bash too using busybox and would rather not spend storage space on man pages
some users don t even have bash installed on capable systems and use zsh for interactive work and ash for scripts

16657694
implements	extends
if you need pattern matching define an extractor yourself implements unapply
first you should have trait operationplus extends operation trait operationminus extends operation second you cannot define a as case class since that automatically defines the apply method on the companion object where new a is called with arguments

16658411
sudo	passwd
once you do do this in a terminal sudo visudo add a line something like you may have to make a wrapping shell script as sudo doesn t support argument security if you want to use the service command instead of sudo etc init.d snmpd
i m almost sure that you will not be able to intercept the input for passwd as that would be a security issue

16658597
sum	coalesce
in particular sum of no rows returns null not zero as one might expect and array_agg returns null rather than an empty array when there are no input rows
the coalesce function can be used to substitute zero or an empty array for null when necessary

16659487
bash	zsh
since bash doesn t have a precmd i m not sure how to do this
i m not sure how to do this in bash but in zsh there s a hook that gets run before every command

16661220
postgresql	mysql
heroku itself only supports postgresql it s what they chose
it doesn t make business sense to have to deal with tuning and supporting other rdbms like mysql

16661629
uilabel	nsstring
this information coupled with that you know which line is crashing makes for an easy conclusion self.tvcontent is an nsstring where you were probably expecting a uilabel
you are trying to set the frame of an nsstring - something that doesn t exist

16661762
spaces	linefeed
when the output runs out of horizontal spaces what happens next is up to the terminal
i m not sure what terminal you re using but in your case it just wraps the cursor back to the first character on that line without a linefeed

16663941
awt	swing
please check the path also and read this old post this post states that you could register just a jre within eclipse because it is enough to run your program but again a jvm will allow for more operations. so if swing awt is advanced and dependent on jvm like in the older post in case of eclipse
i am not advance java user so not master in awt swing

16669504
google-chrome	firefox
i added below in my head tag and all was well put in meta tag i had to strip off tag stuff for this note so it would show up meta http-equiv x-ua-compatible content ie edge google-chrome 1 note what this does is always force latest ie rendering engine even in intranet google-chrome frame but remove this if you use the .htaccess
i was having similar problems with onchange working in firefox but not ie and sometime not google-chrome

16671117
implements	extends
see symfony api in the registered sessionbag - which implements attributebaginterface - you can get and set your key value s as desired
tip if you want to get the current user and you have a container aware controller container injected you can use if you are extends symfony s controller class in the standard-edition - the shorter way is or even shorter symfony 2.1.x alternative if your controller is not container aware define the controller as a service and inject security.context yaml vendor yourbundle controller successcontroller then in your action note you have to use the service in your routing aswell if you choose the controller-as-service variant

16676442
jar	war
few words of caution when using autodeploy make sure that the server is running while you are adding replacing deleting a jar war ear in the autodeploy folder
otherwise the server goes out of sync make sure the server is running in development mode otherwise the autodeploy folder changes are not seen by the server instance in case you are packaging your jar war ear in a windows system then deploying it to a weblogic server running in a unix environment the weblogic instance will fail to unpack autodeploy the file through the following exception java.util.zip.zipexception error opening file - filename.war message - error in opening zip file java.io.ioexception error in opening zip file with .

16676640
ubuntu	debian
the problem seemed to be that the drivers from brother is not 64bit compatible and i was using a 64bit version of ubuntu
i tried on debian first after learning from sampi that he got it to work on debian

16676964
realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
i ask because though type will still be it is mentioned in the source site that the argument should be pointer to a memory block previously allocated with malloc calloc or realloc
will it be ub here too as i read in free s description that for free yes if you pass an argument except null to realloc that was not obtained from a previous call to malloc calloc or realloc without having been free d since the behaviour is undefined

16680744
lisp	scheme
lisp has a way to have functions inlined or not to have them inlined and so basically you control with great precision what happens when a compiled module is re-loaded
by contrast until a recent revision of the scheme report the scheme language was completely silent on the topic of how a scheme program is broken into multiple files

16681271
subtract	addition
the information you re looking for can be found using it like so note that you need to subtract each new reading from the last reading for the cpu ticks counters - otherwise you ll be tracking the total number of ticks since system boot
when the counters overflow they are set to 0 and then the new value is added to them it s not just a blind addition overflow

16682967
innodb	myisam
if the fk foreign key table engine is using myisam and pk primary key table engine is using innodb
myisam does not support foreign key constraints

16683375
build.gradle	gradlew
if you are using a project created in studio or a project exported from adt to gradlew you will need to edit build.gradle to change dependencies. the ui in the project structure dialog only affect the dependencies in the ide but the will uses gradlew which will not have the dependencies setup
editing build.gradle will make studio reload it updating the dependencies in both places

16684009
clang	llvm
the author of that document you reference was simply being humorous clang doesn t actually provide extern bcpl things
you ll also notice that the current version of llvm is 3.2 with 3.3 not due until june this year

16686343
matlab	simulink
you will probably need to update your version release of matlab
you need to use hdl coder to generate vhdl code from a simulink model nb simulink model not matlab code

16691078
apache	nginx
be warned that in general php and apache are not meant for long-polling
i don t know how things are when you use nginx but few months ago i had to do some long-polling job on apache

16693909
ssl	https
you ll be able to view them in the browser extension but the browser will have to encrypt them to send them to the server via ssl so long as the post is actually posting to https not http you shouldn t then return the username password pair to the user but should then authenticate the user and then if it matches use something like forms authentication to generate a token that authenticates them for the current session
if you are posting those form variables over https ssl then the actual transmission will be encrypted

16694122
trie	tree
the total space used by a trie should be less than a hashset and it s quicker for string lookups
the main disadvantage is that it can be slower when used from a harddisk as it s loading a tree not a stored linearly structure like a hash

16695276
client-side	server-side
this property is very useful in the context of a distributed infrastructure to support on-the-fly application loads or client-side sharding or redis cluster
server-side lua scripts are not saved or stored by redis

16697152
sum	coalesce
an int cannot be null and you cast your result to an int the coalesce operator will return 0 if you get null from sum
select coalesce sum cena 0 from ksiazki because sum on an empty resultset will return null

16698631
ubuntu	linux
looks like you re running in ubuntu
in linux and windows versions vista and older codecs are not included by default

16701097
comparator	comparable
in java 5 the priorityqueue.remove method uses the comparator method while in java 6 it uses the equals method
from the javadoc for the comparator method in the comparable interface it is strongly recommended but not strictly required that x.compareto y 0 x.equals y

16701097
comparator	comparable
from the javadoc for the comparator method in the comparable interface it is strongly recommended but not strictly required that x.compareto y 0 x.equals y
generally speaking any class that implements the comparable interface and violates this condition should clearly indicate this fact

16702252
ienumerable	icollection
the reason the normal syntax for initialising the list works is that there is an add and ienumerable in dbfixture
autofixture doesn t have a story for that pattern directly after all it is compiler syntactic sugar and not particularly amenable to reflection or in line with any other conventions but you can use addmanyto as long as there is an icollection in play

16705888
vb.net	vb6
you shouldn t be using the old file number -based io in vb.net any more
that api still exists for the sole purpose of making it easier to port code to .net from vb6

16709029
google-chrome	firefox
it s the cas for internet explorer and now google-chrome they will automatically provide windows credentials when browsing a web site with windows authentication
firefox does not support this scheme so i often test authentication with this browser

16709389
entity-relationship	diagram
pre-requisite to get entity-relationship diagram entry in the context menu ultimate version seems not be available into the community version jpa facet onto the module uml plugin activated files other settings configure plugins
this plugin enables diagram then right clic onto the persistenceunit into the persistence tool windows i just add this comment into the official documentation comment awaiting moderation

16712406
associativity	operator-precedence
so you should call list . a if you want to use left associativity method then you should write list a ++ list but that s not always a good choice cause it has linear execution time
because of operator-precedence

16712600
express	node.js
you ll find some basic examples of integrating express with redis database in the express guide but in fact there are many databases and many web server frameworks for node so you need to make some research first which ones will satisfy your needs
as others mentioned ckeditor is not a standalone node.js s app but an addon for your existing page

16713648
serializable	deserialization
the problem is that you re trying to serializable a but tcp endpoint is not serializable
if you want to send only the ip address and port of the connection then you would have to extract them from the tcp endpoint or write your own serialization deserialization method

16720830
multiplying	subtract	multiplying	multiplication
if you have some binary floating-point values a and b that you know are very near decimal numerals with a few digits then multiplying those values by a power of ten subtract and dividing by the power of ten generally does not provide a better result than simply subtract the values directly
each of the multiplication and divisions often introduces some rounding error and these tend to make the final result less accurate than simply subtract a and b directly

16720979
quicksort	mergesort
there are numerous problems with this question starting with the fact that you ve implemented a very slow version of quicksort but asked a question about mergesort
mergesort is not typically implemented as a tail recursive algorithm

16721423
postgresql	mysql
in many modern dbms postgresql oracle sql-server db2 and many others the following will work just fine
it uses ctes and ranking function row_number which is part of the latest sql standard without cte only row_number tested in postgresql oracle sql-server in mysql and other dbms that do not have ranking functions one has to use either derived tables correlated subqueries or self-joins with group by

16724206
keystore	jks
jceks is another proprietary keystore format available from the sunjce provider in the jce java cryptography extension
if you re not using the jce then you would use jks keystore

16724206
keystore	jks
if you re not using the jce then you would use jks keystore
if however you have installed the jce and you are using jce functionality then your best bet is the jceks keystore

16724305
multiplying	multiplication
most modern high end processors can do multiplication in a couple of clockcycles for integer values and a dozen or so cycles for floating point multiplying
exponentiation is either done as a complex microcoded instructions that takes a few dozen or more cycles or as a series of multiplication and additions typically with alternating positive and negative numbers but not certainly

16724305
multiplication	exponent
whichever choice is used the whole calculation will be significantly longer than a simple multiplication
the pow function is useful when the exponent is either large or not an integer

16725487
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome i also get script error on line 0 when loading both the html and javascript from file
this doesn t happen in firefox

16725572
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
here s been my experience opera 12.15 on mac -- xml declaration safari 6.0 on mac -- no declaration google-chrome 26.0 on mac -- no declaration firefox 21.0 on mac -- no declaration not sure what ie does
another noteworthy observation is that there is seemingly no api that i have found to turn off the declaration in opera

16726860
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
come on put at least a system.err.println there - logging is the best practice here as suggested by baileys. unchecked-exception in java extend the runtimeexception class
throwing them will not demand a catch from their clients classes that extend runtimeexception won t require a throws declaration as well

16726886
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
runtimeexception and its subclasses are unchecked exceptions. unchecked-exception do not need to be declared in a method or constructor s throws clause if they can be thrown by the execution of the method or constructor and propagate outside the method or constructor boundary
in java there is two kinds of exceptions checked exceptions and unchecked-exception

16728148
qthread	qobject
you should call qthread quit for each of them on close event
generally you just know where you have created you objects and whether or not used qobject movetothread

16730096
innodb	myisam
in order for foreign keys to work all tables involved must have innodb engine
only one of your tables is innodb while others are myisam - and this will not work read more about this in mysql documentation

16732096
opcache	apc
in php 5.5 the bundled opcache extension replacing apc also optimizes the code so it should not only impact require performance but also the performance of the code itself
apc has an impact in cli mode in two cases the same file is included repeatedly either by the same script a file containing some data cache or by multiple processes you use apc_fetch always returns false if apc is disabled note that apc disables itself in cli by default

16732645
jtextfield	jtable
the posted answer regarding extending defaultcelleditor does work and i have used it except that on changing our application s look feel to nimbus the thicker default jtextfield border encroaches into the table cell making the text within unreadable
the reason is that the default table cell editor is jtable genericeditor not defaultcelleditor of which it is a direct subclass and the former has the following crucial line in gettablecelleditorcomponent jcomponent getcomponent .setborder new lineborder color.black

16732883
bluestacks	android-emulator
either test your app on an actual device or use an alternative android-emulator such as bluestacks or android-x86
another tip for using android-emulator is to not close if you ain t done testing your application

16733258
inline	inlining
it is theoretically possible to inline such a thing but only as part of some kind of profile-guided optimization system where repeated execution of the code is able to determine that certain function objects will always be used with certain contents and thus to inline them
but even that is if you want inlining for an arbitrary callable object you should use a template function not std function

16733431
leaflet	openlayers
instead of openlayers you can also give the more modern and easier to use leaflet library a try
you are actually asking a question about openlayers not openstreetmap the openlayers marker documentation provides an example for a custom marker icon

16734546
implements	extends
hence its not required to implements it here
each and every class extends java.lang.object in java if you are not extends one then implicitly object is considered

16735714
implements	extends
and these types do implements parallelizable so everything should be fine.
except type inference gets in the way your type parameter is only defined as so when receiving an it will gladly infer and then check the bounds failure array doesn t extends parallelizable

16737853
d3.js	raphael
personally i d rather be using d3.js but professionally that s not the reality of my situation
as a public sector consultant i ve found that learning raphael was a better investment for me since a lot of the time my clients use older versions of browsers

16742083
vb.net	vb6
in cases where either those approaches would be workable code should ported to the option strict on dialect of vb.net
some existing vb6 code however would not be amenable to either fix

16744054
apache-poi	docx4j
this assertion stands whether you were doing docx4j to binary doc hwpf or apache-poi s own xwpf to hwpf since apache-poi doesn t have a common interface across the two of them
so instead of using apache-poi for this i d use jodconverter to drive libreoffice or openoffice their docx features are a bit different to convert docx to legacy binary .doc

16744643
google-chrome	firefox
i don t know about a solution for google-chrome but yes this works just append the myselect id to the select element like so more about this here set width of dropdown element in html select dropdown options here is a jsfiddle to op this will not work in google-chrome however it does work in firefox and other browsers i have just tested it and it works o.k
the following css works in all of the main browsers except for google-chrome

16744966
implements	extends
1 cannot imagine why this isn t implements in any browser
first i d think that if you have the functionality for content already it should not be too hard to extends that but of course i don t really know to be honest

16745577
xslt	xquery
saxon-ce does not support xquery but by supporting xslt 2.0 it inherently supports xpath 2.0
xslt 2.0 and xquery 1.0 utilize xpath 2.0 which is what you are recognizing as xquery in the code above

16745577
xslt	xquery
xslt 2.0 and xquery 1.0 utilize xpath 2.0 which is what you are recognizing as xquery in the code above
the above code is xslt 2.0 not xquery

16745712
junit	testng
unlike other testing frameworks such as testng junit doesn t provide the ability to make your own report generator
testng however can be used to run junit tests and even produces a junit report in addition to its own reports

16747364
udp	tcp
now as to which protocol you should choose again very dependent if you plan for the two machines to be talking all the time tcp may be your best it will prevent you from atleast ensuring that packet s are not lost a luxury udp handles at protocol s higher in the stack
if you expect updates to be more spread apart you will want to avoid tcp simply because of the tcp handshake process of opening a connection which will require 3x the sum of delay s mentioned above where as udp will allow you to send the packet s write away and then wait for a response on the same socket ensuring the packet was received correctly if you don t get a responce within time x retry

16747438
udp	tcp
depending on the application needs ip offers different transport protocols udp is a don t care if a packet gets lost the transport protocol will do nothing to recover tcp is a full care until a given time limit if something gets lost a retransission will be asked
all this is managed at the tcp ip driver level so the application is not required to take care unless the problem last more than the timeout limit of a session

16747438
udp	tcp	udp	mtu
at the point that many isp don t fragment if it cannot go they just discard and let tcp to re-tune to a smaller mtu or to the application to shorten its udp packets
in other word if you don t care about performance just let tcp do do its job and the data will somehow find a way to flow by an intermediate fragmentation or by a and-to-end mtu negotiation

16747844
opera	firefox
opera and ie9 or below cannot do 3d transformations and the perspective property isn t supported very well
your implementation of the code works correctly for me when i use firefox ver 21.0

16751395
dictionary	map
i solved the problem by sending the pool workers dictionary which specified input and output filename strings
so it seems that the iterable that you supply to the function such as apply_async i used map and imap_unordered can contain a list of numbers or strings or even a detailed dictionary data structure as long as the values aren t objects

16755064
google-chrome	firefox
just tested it with a .net app and both google-chrome 27.0.1453.94 firefox set a put request
i can t re produce your claim on firefox 21.0 on windows when i go to google.com and press f12 firebug then run the following code i get response 405 method not allowed but more importantly

16758813
erd	diagram
a conceptual erd really pertains to data analysis and not database design
your diagram on the other hand is clearly a design document and not an analysis document

16760086
realloc	malloc
in this case in your code the memory is leaked since when realloc fails it does not free the original memory block you passed to it which is the reason why you never do but you always use an intermediate variable to check for null in order to avoid memory leaks
actually the standard does specify the implementation-defined behavior for all the memory allocation functions not just for malloc as i remembered

16760086
realloc	malloc	memcpy	realloc
so the behavior is implementation defined as desribed below more intuitively realloc is conceptually equivalent to to malloc + memcpy + free on the other pointer and malloc -ing a 0-byte chunk of memory returns either null either a unique pointer not to be used for storing anything you asked for 0 bytes but still to be free ed
so no don t use realloc like that it may work on some implementations namely linux but it s certainly not guaranteed

16762455
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
this is the sequence i see making the parent view controller the root view controller parent viewwillappear parent viewdidappear presenting the child view controller parent viewwilldisappear child viewwillappear child viewdidappear parent viewdiddisappear child presented dismissing the child view controller child viewwilldisappear parent viewwillappear parent viewdidappear child viewdiddisappear child dismissed so this seems internally consistent to me---the parent gets the disappearance calls when the child view controller is presented and the appearance calls when the child view controller is dismissed
and this is still consistent with the documented behavior of viewwillappear because i m not presenting the child view controller with a popover

16763005
equals	gethashcode
from the docs of if you implement equals you should also override the base class implementations of equals object and gethashcode so that their behavior is consistent with that of the method
your implementation of equals foo isn t consistent with either equals object or gethashcode

16763005
equals	gethashcode
your implementation of equals foo isn t consistent with either equals object or gethashcode
will still delegate to your gethashcode method - it will just use your equals t method in preference to your equals object method

16763883
opera	firefox
edit doesn t seem to work on opera though sadly
but it works fine on firefox

16767797
google-chrome	firefox
no google-chrome does not work with selenium ide
as selenium ide is a firefox plugin it works only with firefox

16771442
translation	localization
the context menu entry for this file contains links to lupdate and lrelease so i think you don t even need to bother with pro and pri files you wouldn t really use in vs anyway i checked that the .qm files produced by lrelease appear to contain all translation entries of the .ts files
try the menu entry of the qt plugin for vs qt add new translation file select project and language vs should then add a blank xxx.ts file to your project under localization files or some such

16774365
viewdidload	viewdidappear
simply put the code into viewdidlayoutsubviews method and not to viewdidload
the solution i found in the topic unable to set frame correctly before viewdidappear

16774440
metaphone	soundex
on php side you have levenshtein available which is quite decent to have similarity score you may use too soundex - calculate the soundex key of a string similar_text - calculate the similarity between two strings metaphone - calculate the metaphone key of a string check the manual to know how to use them
on mysql side you have soundex not really working good as i like. you may want to implement a mysql module to use levenshtein you ll need to compile in c either

16775175
multiplying	multiplication
or the same thing this still is way longer then a single multiplying instruction but your processor apparently doesn t have it anyway so this might be the next best thing
sometimes the multiplication can be compiled into a sequence of additions yes

16777746
division	addition
both compilers avoid the branch in both samples of code philipp s version with the arm compiler f proc cmp r1 #0 bne __aeabi_idivmod moveq r0 #0 bx lr philipp s version with gcc my code with the arm compiler f proc rsbs r2 r1 #1 movcc r2 #0 add r1 r1 r2 b __aeabi_idivmod my code with gcc all versions still need a branch to the division routine because this version of the arm doesn t have hardware for a division but the test for is fully implemented through predicated execution
inspired by some of the comments i got rid of the branch on my pentium and gcc compiler using the compiler basically recognizes that it can use a condition flag of the test in the addition

16778546
rar	zip
there are commercial products which support rar such as chilkat rar
the .net framework doesn t support .rar files and didn t have support for zip files until .net 4.5

16778792
jar	war
tomcat will not find the class if the poi jar isn t in the web-inf lib of your deployment
check your war or exploded deployment to see if it s there

16779824
ffmpeg	libav
libav is a fork of the ffmpeg project which supplies the avconv binary
they both develop independently but ffmpeg usually merges commits from libav not the other way round

16779824
ffmpeg	libav
they both develop independently but ffmpeg usually merges commits from libav not the other way round
some might say libav suffers from nih

16780420
cufft	fftw
cufft also supports batched plans which is another way to execute multiple transforms at once
you cannot call fftw methods from device code

16781658
cpython	pypy
using the source code from the answer above cpython 2.7 python concat.py inplace_add_concatenation 0.420897960663 str_join_concatenation 0.061793088913 ratio 6.81140833169 pypy 1.9 pypy concat.py inplace_add_concatenation 1.26573014259 str_join_concatenation 0.0392870903015 ratio 32.2174570038 even though pypy is famous for its speed-ups compared to cpython it is slower for the version
it was a deliberate desision not include the + optimization in the default version of pypy

16781699
ciimage	uiimage
you need a uiimageview with a uiimage attached to its image property and this uiimage you can create from the ciimage i believe
ciimage can not be added as subview because it is not a view uiview subclass

16782217
ciimage	uiimage
as the other post indicates a ciimage is not a view so it can t be added as one
ciimage is really only used for doing image processing to display the filtered image you ll need to convert it back to a uiimage

16782217
ciimage	uiimage
ciimage is really only used for doing image processing to display the filtered image you ll need to convert it back to a uiimage
to do this you need to get the output ciimage from the filter not the input image

16782217
ciimage	uiimage
then you ll need to convert the output ciimage to a cgimage and from there to a uiimage
this code accomplishes these things also remember that the uiimage will have to go into a uiimageview as it s not a view itself

16785278
spaces	delimiter
any string delimiter by white spaces will not be in argv 1
so white spaces should not be a delimiter there

16785278
spaces	delimiter
so white spaces should not be a delimiter there
you should have things like .- etc you are changing the input delimiter of strtok

16785740
innodb	myisam
no full text indexing is available for innodb
in innodb the count s when where group by or join is not used execute slower than in myisam because the row count is not stored internally

16785740
innodb	myisam
in innodb the count s when where group by or join is not used execute slower than in myisam because the row count is not stored internally
innodb stores both data and indexes in one file

16788372
libstdc++	libc++
i would use the native library for each os libstdc++ on gnu linux and libc++ on mac os x
libc++ is not 100 complete on gnu linux and there s no real advantage to using it when libstdc++ is more complete

16788372
libstdc++	libc++
libc++ is not 100 complete on gnu linux and there s no real advantage to using it when libstdc++ is more complete
also if you want to link to any other libraries written in c++ they will almost certainly have been built with libstdc++ so you ll need to link with that too to use them

16790180
octal	decimal
that means the equivalent to chmod 2770 test is os.chmod test 0o2770 you probably used os.chmod test 2770 which would be 5322 in octal which is consistent whit the bitmask you seem to get
os.chmod does exactly the same as the chmod utility but you need to remember that the argument to chmod is a string representing a bitmap in octal notation not decimal

16791595
jquery	scriptaculous
in jquery case is just an alias for jquery so all functionality is available without using . one solution if we need to use another javascript library alongside jquery we can return control of back to the other library with a call to like another solution is to reassign jquery object back to jquery library wrapping up our call inside a function that reassigns object
thus we make sure our code isn t messed with prototype scriptaculous etc

16795511
implements	extends
your class must extends abstractfixture and implements containerawareinterface for access usermanager service
if your class do not extends abstractfixture is not a fixture

16799534
profiling	debugging
the profiling detected this right away
i m not an sql-server expert by any means but i ve had to debugging a couple of situations like this as well

16800062
xmltype	clob
output though i think this is not very efficient and you might better convert the column to xmltype and the operate with it
clob is converted to xmltype using xmltype and xmltype is converted to clob using to_clob

16801104
redmine	trac
imo it s not necessary anymore to change to redmine
here s the current state of the art especially what is maintained and useful look also at the plugin recommendation site of trac

16801672
centos	linux
i ran into an issue similar to this trying to install a 32-bit websphere demo on a 64-bit centos system about a year ago
in my opinion and i am not sure if i am right or not if you are on a 64-bit system and try to install something that is strictly 32-bit such as a 32-bit jdk then you need to download and install the 32-bit elf libraries into your ubuntu linux system

16807916
super	self	super	implements
in -mutablecopywithzone super self still points to an instance object of the derived class
trouble is possible if the super method or super super method and so on does not implements the object creation in a proper way using the second approach you get an instance of the derived class with full memory for its ivars

16807916
super	implements
trouble is possible if the super method or super super method and so on does not implements the object creation in a proper way using the second approach you get an instance of the derived class with full memory for its ivars
conclusion implements it in this way if baseclass implements its -mutablecopywithzone properly

16808739
delphi	oxygene
oxygene doesn t attempt to be source compatible with delphi
what s more the runtime libraries used by the various oxygene flavours differ entirely from those used by delphi

16810355
awt	swing
using awt you have to implement a lot of things yourself while swing has them built in
for gui-intensive work awt feels very primitive to work with compared to swing. because swing implements gui functionality itself rather than relying on the host os it can offer a richer environment on all platforms java runs on. awt is more limited in supplying the same functionality on all platforms because not all platforms implement the same-looking controls in the same ways

16810355
awt	swing

swing components are called lightweight because they do not require a native os object to implement their functionality

16810703
equals	compareto	comparator	comparable
from the class treeset documentation note that the ordering maintained by a set whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if it is to correctly implement the set interface
see comparable or comparator for a precise definition of consistent with equals. this is so because the set interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a treeset instance performs all element comparisons using its compareto or compare method so two elements that are deemed equal by this method are from the standpoint of the set equal

postgresql	mysql
i m sorry that i m not familiar with postgresql
my solution is in mysql i hope it can help since if they mysql postgresql are same

16812513
heroku	engineyard
paying 35 mo doesn t buy me any support so i m stuck and there is no way forward with heroku
so my answer to this problem is to move the app to engineyard

16818094
implements	extends
you would implements the dosomething in your class c and that would be the method you are calling when invoking b.dosomething or a.dosomething
in the case of extends two claasses with two dosomething methods they could be having different implementations and you would not know which one is invoked

16818467
client-side	server-side
it s a server-side map not a client-side browser cookie
so it can only be updated by server-side code or a post to run server-side code

16819875
hash-collision	key
if there is a hash-collision or the word is already in hash table increment count else keep on adding new words into hash
if the file is not big enough you can store each word of the file in a hashtable which would store words as key and their count as values

16821459
google-chrome	firefox
this will not work in google-chrome
try in firefox or on localhost or on an online server

16822181
gradle	ivy
gradle currently doesn t offer its own repository format
that is you forego maven and ivy on the client side but you ll still use a maven or ivy repository

16822840
mongodb	bson
it does get serialized as bson and sent to the mongodb servers so it needs to be self-contained and not reference other javascript functions that won t be available locally
mapreduce runs within the mongodb instance

16825646
super	implements
the jit can then treat the object as having an actual type generating super fast code that avoids an expensive property lookup
it s implements differently in different javascript engines and nowadays it seems objects aren t backed by dictionary-like data structures

16831440
onresume	onpause
there is no guarantee that life-cycle methods after onpause will be called but you may be sure all methods before onresume will be if activity is created recreated
if only onresume is called activity was not destroyed stopped and its state wasn t lost so you don t have to restore it

16839060
awt	swing
this uses awt which is old and it paints on to the main frame - not the best way to make a swing ui
you can try this make the timer - sleep amount to less or more try 300 or 800 use a panel to draw on add the panel to the frame use swing use a jcomponent it double buffers automatically and a jframe for 2 and 3 you can keep original class to make frame jframe and a new class for the java.awt.panel or javax.swing.jcomponent which is added to the former

16841699
gradle	ivy
they will be mapped to ivy configurations when gradle generates an ivy.xml
gradle s configurations are heavily inspired from ivy not ant but they aren t fully equivalent to ivy s configurations and we d have to discuss what you mean by equivalent

division	addition
division gets really bad
interestingly the matrix addition is not much difference at all

opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
yoy must have a firefox google-chrome opera browser and it has to be updated
then try this if your browser is firefox and still not working go to about config and set add a boolean variable with a true value called media.navigator.enabled source p d i used this code in a greasemonkey script and it worked

16844198
serializable	deserialization
deserialization functions example of usage using wordarray threw me an error in cryptojs for some reason
i think the problem may be with function serializable - cryojs apparently attempts to serialize functions but it may not restore references correctly the scope is lost

16844661
bash	subshell
this is apparent from the bash source execute_command_internal in execute_cmd.c
when bash merely forks sets up a command and execves it it doesn t count it as a subshell

16846761
super	implements
i also have my own super light weight promises library promise
my library doesn t implements all the features i ve used in these examples but it could be made to work with minor adaptation

16847428
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
bazaar does not have a subrepository feature
correction apparently there s a bzr-externals plugin available at lp bzr-externals though it emulates the svn externals feature not git submodules or mercurial subrepos. however this can fairly easily be worked around if you do not want to switch version control systems

16851065
udp	tcp
why udp why not tcp
according to me i may be wrong udp is good only when the data is timesensitive like video stream

16851452
google-chrome	firefox
solved the problem was with firefox not in google-chrome
the whole text was using a font-weight bold style defined in a css but it seems that in firefox if we apply this style to a text that contains tags it counts bold double

16851845
udp	tcp
one of the main reasons why one would want to use udp is normally because in-order delivery and reliability are not needed or sometimes reliability is needed but not in-order delivery
in-order delivery is the main cause of tcp s latency during packet loss in absence of packet loss tcp is exactly as fast as udp so if this is needed there is no sane reason not to use tcp in the first place

16851845
udp	tcp
udp doesn t need a socket per client either
when using tcp you ll have no other choice but to use one socket per client but still multiplexing using a readiness notification system will give you much better performance and fewer opportunities for threading errors

16853235
uiview	subviews
i think your problem is the size of the very root uiview the superview of the uiview you talk about of your views
when a certain subviews is larger than its superview it will not receive touch events in this portions of it s frame that go outside of the superview frame

16853235
uiview	subviews
this method checks if a certain touch points inside the uiview frame then starts to check if a certain subviews can handle the touch event in the order they are positioned in the responder chain the view hierarchy in this case
so when the touch event is first received a certain uiview first hit tests itself and when the location of the touch is outside it s frame it does not check it s subviews

16853235
uiview	subviews
so when the touch event is first received a certain uiview first hit tests itself and when the location of the touch is outside it s frame it does not check it s subviews
so check very carefully all your views frames and if some root view it could be the view property of the uiviewcontroller you use is actually smaller than the subviews you touch

16853854
implements	extends
because jquery is not implements or declared as a class you can t create a sub-class that extends it in typescript
for example many declarations in typescript for third-party libraries follow an interface-var style like this this means you get type information and auto-completion for the library but you can t extends it

16856765
dictionary	map
try specifying to the framework that you modified the entity edit after seeing the updated code it looks like you are trying to save the dictionary objects directly to the database
it is not possible to map a dictionary to a database table with entity framework

16862181
config	ini
the list of places where you should set the character set and collation in your mysql config file are the set names may not be required in all circumstances - but it is safer on at only a small speed penalty
php ini file although you said you have set mb_internal_encoding in your bootstrap script it is much better to do this in the php ini file and also set all the recommended parameters helping browser to choose utf8 for forms you need to set accept-charset on your forms to be utf-8 to tell browsers to submit them as utf8

16863035
moq	typemock
create an interface imyserializable with the two methods serialize and deserialize and declare the customxmlserializer like this than the moq should not have a problem
or you can other library which uses il typemock

16865574
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication
so the subtraction in the latter operation sequence is likely to be exact or low-error depending on how much the values fluctuate
then the multiplication and the addition have the usual rounding errors and they are not particularly worrisome unless there are both positive and negative values which can lead to large relative errors when the average is near zero

16865574
addition	multiplication
then the multiplication and the addition have the usual rounding errors and they are not particularly worrisome unless there are both positive and negative values which can lead to large relative errors when the average is near zero
if a fused multiply-add operation is available see fma in then you can eliminate the error from the multiplication

16870228
datamapper	activerecord
what you want is a polymorphic association which sadly datamapper does not support
try looking into activerecord instead

16870734
udp	tcp
if you don t want to do that then you need to switch to udp or multicast instead both of which support single-send broadcasting
tcp does not have any broadcast capabilities

16870983
trie	tree
you only have the parts- that is where the trie is the best fit
so the idea with tries is that you can ignore branches of characters that are not in your dictionary while traversing the tree

16878362
associativity	operator-precedence
precedence and associativity of operators in k r table 2-1 pg 53 isn t as granular and complete as more recent table in stroustrup tc++pl sed sec 6.2 operator summary p120-121
c++ operator-precedence agnew s answer is excellent

16878397
pthreads	fork
since many apis in mac os x frameworks will cause the process to become multithreaded if you want the fork-child to be fully useable you must limit you operations in the parent process before fork to apis documented not to make a process multithreaded essentially only pthreads apis
both of these crashreports indicate that a multi-threaded process fork ed which greatly restricts the set of operations that are safe to execute in the child essentially you can only call execve et al along with a few other functions from the list of async-signal-safe functions this is documented in the caveats section of the fork 2 manpage as well as in the standard a process shall be created with a single thread

16878688
hex	binary
the second is treating it is a pointer which for printf amounts to printing it out as an unsigned hex number
those two numbers have the same binary representation in two s complement arithmetic although they are not numerically equal

16878939
daemons	systemd
so it s implemented in the kernel not through a userspace daemons on these systemd
it s a pretty broad question and it s going to depend what systemd you re using and what facility the applications are using

16880322
serializable	deserialization
serializable might be done on platform like windows by using sun or ms jvm and deserialization might be on different platform linux using zing jvm
but in case if serialversionuid is not specified by programmer then while doing serializable deserialization of any object java runtime uses its own algorithm to calculate it

16880322
serializable	deserialization
in such cases serialversionuid associated with serializable object will be different than the serialversionuid of class calculated at deserialzation environment
in turn deserialization will not be successful

16880534
google-chrome	safari
change the height as for why this happens in safari but not in google-chrome
i don t know for sure but i ve noticed google-chrome often accepts mistakes in css and converts them to look correct

16881150
prepare	execute
however i wouldn t say there is a real security risk involved if you don t do it like that as it is more the fact that you do a prepare statement that protects from sql injections than type verification
a simpler way to achieve this is by simply passing an array to the execute function instead of using bindparam like this you re not obligated to use a dictionary you can also do it just like you did with questionmarks and then put it in the same order in the array

16882090
rspec	capybara
ps in the code snippet there is some rspec as well
this is needed because cucumber or capybara by themselves cannot test something

16882172
stateless	stateful
session bean objects either can be stateless or can maintain conversational state across methods and transactions
a stateless session bean is an object that does not have an associated conversational state but may have instance state in stateful session bean the instance variables represent the state of unique client-bean sessions

16884821
junit	testng
a more typical way of testing something like that would be to start the server once for the whole test class i am not 100 sure about the junit syntax as i use testng but it should be something like that
junit will exit the test as soon as the junit thread is done whereas your main will wait for non daemon threads to terminate before exiting

16884846
swt	swing
on java you can also try swt the framework used to build eclipse
swing doesn t look as beautiful as native gui but it also has a killer excuse for it it looks ok on every java-supporting platform

16885751
apache	nginx
this is hard impossible to achieve for large number of connections because apache uses an individual process or thread for each connection
nginx and node scale really well apache does not

16886843
intersect	contains
quote from the opengl 3.3 spec section 3.5.1 rasterizing the line segment starting at pa and ending at pb produces those fragments f for which the segment starting at pa and ending on pb intersect rf except if pb is contains in rf diamond region centered on the fragment
with the effect that the endpoint is not rasterized at all if two neighboring lines of yours unfortunately run in opposite directions end in the same point and that endpoint is contains in said diamond around the pixel center

16889273
rdf	owl
i don t know of a standard way of doing this but one of the advantages of working in rdf is that you have a lot of flexibility in how you decide to do this
rdf per se cannot express negation there is no incredibly convenient way to say that a triple s p o does not hold but owl can

16889760
ubuntu	debian
in my case under ubuntu 12.04 sudo apt-get install python3-gi-cairo in a terminal did the trick getting me rid of the annoying couldn t find conversion for foreign struct cairo.context messages
it ll problably also work on other ubuntu versions maybe on debian as well.

16891216
comparator	comparable
you can however create the treemap with the constructor that takes a comparator instead and implement the comparator according to your ordering rules
as the error message says arraylist does not implement the comparable interface that is required by treemap to do the ordering of the elements in the map

16891227
comparator	comparable
the map is sorted according to the natural ordering of its keys or by a comparator provided at map creation time depending on which constructor is used
list does not implements comparable so you need to provide comparator i still can t figure out why are you using list

16891236
comparator	comparable
there s a treemap constructor which accepts a custom comparator and you can implement that with your custom logic
you need to use a comparator as the key of your tree map doesn t implement the comparable interface

16892502
vbscript	vba
vbscript s regex has the methods you are using in your posted code dim regexp as new regexp if you really want this in vba but you would have to change the methods called in your code refs microsoft beefs up vbscript with regular expressions regex match in vba
you haven t created a regex object only declared an object placeholder this is vbscript not vba

16893568
queue	fifo
but generally speaking it is not necessarily the case for other types of queue
the javadoc for queue states queue typically but do not necessarily order elements in a fifo fifo manner

16893568
queue	fifo
the javadoc for queue states queue typically but do not necessarily order elements in a fifo fifo manner
among the exceptions are priority queue which order elements according to a supplied comparator or the elements natural ordering and lifo queue or stacks which order the elements lifo last-in-first-out

16895991
implements	extends
i also need to implements a preferencefragment in android versions prior to honeycomb api level 11
as you already have i found unifiedpreference library but looking at the source code i see that the unifiedpreferencefragment extends the preferencefragment from the official android api thus not working for api level 11

16897011
mockito	scalamock
you can read more about using mockito with specs2 here
i believe the compiler errors you are seeing have to do with the fact that scalamock can not properly mock the printstream class

16897011
mockito	scalamock
if you changed your code to use a outputstream instead which is an interface and thus meets scalamock s restrictions you could do your overloaded method mocking like this personally i prefer mockito used within specs2 as it does not have these kinds of restrictions
an example of a class using printwriter and then a test spec for that class using mocking with mockito is as follows now this is a very trivial example using only post-test verifications with no pre-test stubbings because println has a unit return type but at least you can see that mockito does not suffer from the same restrictions as scalamock

16902252
aggregate-functions	sum
if you want the totals for each month then you should add the to the sum aggregate-functions
the error is because you do not have the column in an aggregate-functions or in the group by clause

16902813
gson	jackson
from my experience yes you can use google gson to stream json data this is an example how to do it readitemsarray function api model class before i use the streaming api from google gson i also got oom error because the json data i got is very big data many images and sounds in base64 encoding but with gson streaming i can overcome that error because it reads the data per token not all at once
and for jackson json library i think it also have streaming api and how to use it almost same with my implementation with google gson

16902895
scheme	rebol
in saphirion s builds the https scheme is not implemented in native code but rather transparently based on the default http scheme done by gabriele santilli
saphirion s r3 builds contain an implementation of a tls scheme also writen in rebol which can be used to write any tls-based secure protocol just at the rebol script level

16902904
bazaar	svn	bazaar	cvs
dvcses like git mercurial hg bazaar bazaar are probably the way to go
however they have one big drawback wrt cvs and svn most dvcs as of 2013 do not really support checkin and checkout

16903014
google-chrome	firefox
apparently google-chrome has a bug not a surprise - contenteditable is the most buggy feature in all browsers
your code works perfectly fine on firefox but for some reason element inserted into editable with inserthtml command cannot be dragged any more

16904012
super	implements
if you want to use generics you can use the corresponding class like integer but there is still one problem their super type number does not have an add method let alone a + operator or
so the only way i know is to implements your own numeric class hierarchy which supports an add method based on this you can implements at least a generic point to be used with i have modified your example the numerics and the points are immutable

16909805
google-chrome	firefox
but google-chrome is doing the right thing here because you are not calling setmilliseconds and google-chrome is respecting that
firefox gets weird and does the wrong thing but it just so happens to be what you want

16909805
google-chrome	firefox
actually to be fair ie works the same way so google-chrome webkit is the odd one out
the ecmascript specification is not clear on who s right firefox ie seem to be right but talk for ecmascript 6 indicate they may special case new date date

16909990
super	implements
the problem is that you don t have actually have a stuff method on the class so methodsignatureforselector will return nil - it looks like you discovered that and so implements your own version but that fails on the super call and so ends up returning the signature of forwardinvocation - which is not what you want
to get around this you either need to direct the methodsignatureforselector to a class which has the selector or use a protocol - if a class implements a protocol then it will return the signature for any methods in that protocol even if the methods are not actually implements by that class

16911586
g++	gcc
mex is just a tool which calls one underneath and since g++ is the c++ compiler of gcc you should install this one
as far as i know it will still not work because matlab supports only gcc 4.3 not sure about that

16916159
onclick	onchange
tag should not have onclick event
change the code to using the onchange event of the drop down itself is the trick

16917229
sudo	passwd
be sure that you re really root so try try this and look if it differs ssh server.tld id ssh server.tld sudo id the second one should give you an output which should be this if this is not the output check your etc suders which should have an entry like this the command i runned and which worked ssh -l foo server.tld sudo swapon -s
maybe you re not in the sudoers file or you need to enter a passwd

16919837
inline-functions	inlining
it should be noted that compiler s decision-making algorithm that decide whether to inline-functions will generally be smart enough to avoid excessive code bloat to avoid generation of exceedingly long functions
this means that in some cases inlining the outer function might mean that the inner calls will not be inlined

16920176
implements	extends
your readersqlparametersetter should implements preparedstatementsetter not itempreparedstatementsetter if you look at the impl of jdbccursoritemreader the property is a preparedstatementsetter
if you look at the interface you try to use this interface does not extends preparedstatementsetter .

16924241
postgresql	mysql
you can make such this kind of query because you have set id as an auto_increment column you can actually do the same thing in postgresql by using the serial pseudo data type instead example of primary column serial id serial primary key
this is not because of mysql that happens

16925285
jar	war
first don t put the mail jar in both locations but in tomcat s lib folder
if you are using maven use provided scope for the corresponding to not package it in the war

16926807
macports	homebrew
macports has two ports imagemagick for the basic imagemagick and p5-perlmagick for the perl bindings
afaik homebrew version of imagemagick doesn t contain perl-magick

16927770
d3.js	raphael
if not then d3.js
use raphael

16928302
ssl	https
there are examples on how to do that in the jboss ssl configuration documentation
according to the jboss https connector documentation the certificate-key-file attribute should be pointing to a keystore not a key

16928302
keystore	jks
according to the jboss https connector documentation the certificate-key-file attribute should be pointing to a keystore not a key
so you will need to import that key into a jks keystore

16929034
google-chrome	firefox
as epascarello says in his comment initialize your variables in the load event and everything should work in google-chrome safari and firefox
from the firefox popstate documentation browsers tend to handle the popstate event differently on page load. google-chrome and safari always emit a popstate event on page load but firefox doesn t

16929268
daemons	systemd
so if you manage to avoid join ing all of your non-daemon threads you have to write code that can handle both having them hard-killed like daemons threads and having them continue running until exit
if they do continue running at least in cpython 2.7 and 3.3 on posix systemd that the main thread s os-level thread handle and various higher-level python objects representing it may be still retained and not get cleaned up by the gc

16929268
cpython	ironpython	cpython	pypy
if your code depends on deterministic gc there are many cases you can get away with it in cpython although your code will then break in pypy jython ironpython etc. but at exit time is not one of them
cpython can and will leak objects at exit time and let the os sort em out

16933249
apache	nginx
nginx is not included with mezzanine it s an entirely separate piece of software similar to apache
mezzanine includes a fabric script which can automatically set up a production server if you d like to use it and will install nginx on the server for you among many other things

16934640
google-chrome	firefox
to make it perfectly work on google-chrome i simply added this to regain focus
the misterious code of dixie works for me on firefox i.e and almost google-chrome it doesn t focus on the main window but on the pop-up

16936585
junit	testng
prior to java 1.7 the execution order was accidentally implied by the order of test methods within a class but it was not part of the junit contract.
some people switch to other testing frameworks for their integration tests testng if they find the unit test focus of junit is getting in the way of their test development the key point to keep in mind is that the maven lifecycle uses the test phase for the execution of unit tests

16938969
webkit	gecko
in the case of android it is webview which is backed by webkit not gecko
in the case of firefox os it will use gecko or some equivalent as exposed via ffos

16941573
mp4	webm
if you want wide compatibility then your best option is to transcode to one of the more common container codec combinations such as mp4 h264 or webm vp8
webm uses a variant of the matroska container so it s not too surprising that some browsers are able to play some .mkv files

16942065
g++	gcc
actually your g++ does not accept the conversion from to it s just that on your version std strrchr returns a incorrectly instead of a
to verify the first part of my statement try to compile the following on your gcc versions i predict that all will correctly issue an error now for the second part i tried to compile the following minimal code whose actual aim is to trigger an error in order to list the declared overloads of std strrchr well with gcc 4.7.2 the message shows the expected all non-const and all const overloads the prototypes but with gcc 4.3.2 the message was different the overloads were the second one is the c++ non-const overload

16943129
innodb	myisam
there s a restriction on them that is not present on innodb
myisam always reads the complete row from the disk even if some fields are not queried in the select

16945060
icomparable	gethashcode
since this method doesn t rely on sorting it also provides the benefit of not needing tkey to implement icomparable
a key reason that both this method and your method works is due to the fact that keyvaluepair overrides it s definition of equals and gethashcode to to be based on it s own reference but rather on the key and value it wraps

16946016
prepare	execute
one workaround is this or else use positional parameters instead of named parameters ps not related to your question about using prepare statements but your use of pattern for full-text search is thousands of times slower than using any fulltext index solution
another good habit is to check for errors after every call to pdo prepare or pdostatement execute

16949416
viewdidload	viewdidappear
i m assuming that the view controller s view is not in the window hierarchy at the point that it has been loaded when the viewdidload message is sent but it is in the window hierarchy after it has been presented when the viewdidappear message is sent
the solution is to move my code to the viewdidappear method

16951797
backgrounding	multitasking
regardless of how you schedule the work once your application is in the backgrounding it s allowed only a certain amount of further processing before all activity is stopped
trying to dispatch_async isn t magically going to buy you permanent multitasking

16952894
activemq	rabbitmq
what you want to do is make sure you do not refer to any activemq object in your code
then you need to create factory methods to acquire the activemq rabbitmq methods

16953723
inline	inlining
when you use let to bind it locally you are just binding the function object to a new name in local scope and the function object doesn t have any inlining information it was the inc var which has that info and therefore the compiler cannot inline it
just to add to what mikera has mentioned about inlining

16959029
set	bag
just to add my two cents to the discussion here one could understand the union operator as a pure set-oriented union - set a 2 4 6 8 set b 1 2 3 4 a union b 1 2 3 4 6 8 when dealing with sets you would not want numbers 2 and 4 appearing twice as an element either is or is not in a set
in the world of sql though you might want to see all the elements from the two sets together in one bag 2 4 6 8 1 2 3 4

16961510
prepare	execute
if you use prepare statements they are compiled by query parser and optimizer and then stored in cache
on each call query manager just execute that compiled query with new data so you will not gain any extra performance benefit i m talking about 10k hits per minute x n queries to db in each request i may be wrong in my conviction but for prototyping or fast growing project stored procedures has no sense

16961943
uiview	calayer
to blur a view on ios some more work seems to be required copying the uiview content inside an image then blurring and showing the image
the reason for calayer s backgroundfilters doing nothing on uiview is that unfortunately the backgroundfilters property is not supported on layers in ios

16963719
implements	extends
keyword extends is appropriate for named classes which can implements interfaces in addition to extends classes
in contrast anonymous classes can either implements an interface or extends a class but not both

16968290
mdpi	hdpi
based on that i would assume that creating ldpi icon is not necessary and that mdpi will be scaled down automatically
when eclipse creates launcher icons it only creates them for mdpi hdpi xhdpi and xxhdpi

16968717
wxpython	kivy
no wxpython does not currently support android
you may be able to use the kivy project which was already mentioned in the comments

16969523
vim	emacs
i haven t used it myself not being a vim user but it seems close enough
the reason lispers tend to like emacs is that emacs is a lisp machine

16969574
profiling	debugging
for another profiling i changed the filter about 20 hours ago and that profiling still isn t showing what the filter indicates it should be
the delay makes it a pain to debugging filters since when there is a problem you can t know for sure if your filter is wrong or if google just hasn t applied it yet or if there is a bug on google s side for a particular filter .

16972750
persistent	transient
instead you should use onpause to store persistent data such as data that should be saved to a database when the user leaves the activity
in the situation like yours the best approach is to use onpause as described here note because onsaveinstancestate is not guaranteed to be called you should use it only to record the transient state of the activity the state of the ui you should never use it to store persistent data

16972845
ssl	https
openssl s classic non-bio api is designed to support exactly that type of usage allowing an ssl tls session be attached to an existing socket at any time
https is not a good example of this usage since https requires handshaking immediately upon connecting

16974700
matplotlib	chaco
the pyqtgraph website has a comparison of plotting libraries including matplotlib chaco and pyqwt
the summary is matplotlib is the de-facto standard plotting library but is not built for speed

16975068
implements	extends
if the method was declared abstract you must implements or get compile-time error if the subclass is also not declared abstract
if you are inheriting from a class a extends abstractclass that is not abstract then a must have implemented any abstract methods or again compileerror

16975068
implements	extends
if you are inheriting from a class a extends abstractclass that is not abstract then a must have implements any abstract methods or again compileerror
if it hasn t implements any abstract classes then a must also be abstract and responsibility of implementing the abstract methods fall on subclassers of a

16979279
union	distinct
this one should do what you want i changed union to union all because union implies a distinct
i don t think that s what you want or even need union all is also faster because it doesn t have to check if there are duplicate rows

16979286
altera	xilinx
you can find more info about those at altera cyclone v xilinx zynq you maybe able to use an external host controller but then you have to connect it to your fpga and that is usually requires a lot of ios and those modules are more expensive than buying a zed board 395 or cyclone v board 450
you need to have a usb host controller inside your fpga such ip is not freely available one alternative is to use a zynq based for xilinx or cyclone v based for altera board

16980640
explode	substr
or any other sign that is not likely to be used there before 2nd and then use explode function reference
you can split them if they are always like this vith substr function reference but if they are dynamic in lenght

16981034
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome by design does not allow the loading of local files using the ajax methods
if you encounter this issue check to see if firefox and ie produce the same problem and if not then you will probably want to use a small webserver to serve up the files to your browser via 127.0.0.1 as a workaround

16984253
viewdidload	viewwillappear
i think the issue you are running into with this line can be explained like so in viewdidload the properties are set but the frame of the views are not yet defined
by the time viewwillappear is triggered they will be set

16985843
innodb	myisam
the trick in a before trigger manually check the table definition for the next auto_increment value warning this only works with myisam not with innodb i suppose it could work with innodb if but i am unable to tell for sure
edit 1 as for the concurrent-proof property of this approach i can say with myisam where only table-locks are available the safety is obvious an exclusive lock on the table s is acquired by any insert update delete and no concurrent access can happen

16989100
ssl	https
i would check your application servers ssl settings and make sure that the certification is configured correctly
this can also happen if you are attempting to connect over https and the server is not configured to handle ssl connections correctly

16993006
build.gradle	gradlew
add the following to your build.gradle making sure to keep whatever other dependencies you ve got my build.gradle is based on this gist
i m not particularly familiar with intellij or gradlew but i have figured it out

16993548
kerberos	ntlm
negotiate is the preferred method but this requires a kerberos token from an ad server which you won t have if you re not in the office
your browser then defaults to ntlm which is a challenge-response protocol that will work through firewalls but is less secure

16996133
implements	extends
when your outer class implements an inner interface and that construct would have been valid you d get a stackoverflowerror in the class loader when loading the class at runtime.
because it s an inner class you must use the full name of the class that you re extends use classwithbutton.buttonowner instead of just buttonowner public class classwithbutton implements actionlistener classwithbutton.buttonowner this won t work however as you re extends an inner interface cycle detected the type classwithbutton cannot extends implement itself or one of its own member types as to why a class cannot implement an inner interface a comment on the above question indicates that it could be because how class loading works

16999314
client-side	server-side
if you want to sanitize it on the client-side that will make no point since the attacker can always generate his own http request using his own tools not even using the browser
if you want to sanitize the url on the server-side use

16999727
ssl	https
second if you have ssl on website then i don t see reasons to worry when it comes to sending data over https. for above reason i wouldn t make any requests that contain user credentials in uri but rather send them over encrypted post
the http engine will do automatically that for you if you re using https ssl

16999835
build.gradle	gradlew
for android development under android studio and gradlew here s how to compile a library that isn t under your project s root but has a relative path include the library in settings.gradle and override the projectdir edit the build.gradle for the library to use the android-library plugin instead of android this causes the library outputs to be included into projects that reference it apply plugin android-library specify that your project has a dependency on the lib by editing the build.gradle for the non-lib project compile project path mytestlibproject mytestlib if the lib includes any jars that your project also includes the build will see them as a collision when it is generating the apk
abstract jars into an additional lib that both the project and lib reference or just exclude the colliding jar from the main project and let it pick up the jar from the dependency disclaimer this isn t how gradlew wants you to do this - you re intended to publish the lib using maven and then reference the dependency using the pom of the published lib which includes the version number

17000183
antialiasing	transparent
assuming that you want to antialiasing to what the background colour was set to which is not always the case but probably is here
you ve only set part of the background to be white the rest of it is transparent

17003605
client-side	server-side
for example for an example demo update answer to question was eventually resolved the following way op did not know that browsers can show client-side code
by using a browser to show the source code of the page she was able to retrieve the id of the server-side outputted html table

17003835
rspec	capybara
to assert that 5 elements are present an appropriate method is a rspec matcher expect page .to have_css selector count count.to_i i don t recommend to set match to prefer_exact as recommended by fontno as in most of situations you want capybara to throw an exception if find finds more than one element
if you want to check 5 elements you shouldn t use #find as by default since capybara 2.0 this method always throws an exception if it finds more or less than one element

17004154
ssl	https
ensure you have a valid copy of the root certs i usually suggest to valid the ssl certificates against
if by https ssl you mean whether your site itself needs to support ssl traffic over http and thus have a valid ssl certificate no it doesn t

17004154
ssl	https
if by https ssl you mean whether your site itself needs to support ssl traffic over http and thus have a valid ssl certificate no it doesn t
you do however need to be able to establish an ssl connection

17004537
spaces	linefeed
but since the same file works properly on debian but fails under cygwin it was not a spaces after the backslash
so the problem was automatic cr linefeed conversion by git combined with a strange refusal by cygwin to understand the line-ending conventions of its host operating system

17005622
udp	tcp
if you use udp you cannot be sure that the control packets reaches the uav which could cause it to become unstable and crash
if you use tcp you cannot guarantee that the control packets reaches the uav with regular time intervals which might cause it become unstable and cause a crash

17008387
equals	gethashcode
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values
two unequal objects are not guaranteed to have unequal hashcodes that s called a collision .this is what msdn says if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value

17009886
junit	testng
i can t present the benefits of junit over testng as the benefits of test ordering far outweigh not being able to order tests
while you can do almost everything junit can do in testng it takes a lot more work to have the facilities of testng in a junit environment

17010792
ssl	https
if you want to prevent a man-in-the-middle attack you need to ensure that the ssl certificate is trustworthy
if the https traffic can be intercepted then either the ssl certificate isn t from a trusted source or the analyser has access to the private key

17012583
shadowing	named
shadowing suppose we have this base class now suppose we derive from it and for some reason we want to have a named property that behaves differently the c# compiler will complain that we cannot do this the class already has a named property
what we can do is tell the c# compiler that when we re using derivedclass we want to use our named property

17014986
postgresql	mysql
let s look at the example table order matters when the words are quoted when we remove the quotes it will search for rows containing words database or comparison order doesn t matter now if we want to get rows containing either word postgresql or phrase database comparison we should use this request fiddle make sure that the words you are searching for are not in the list of stopwords that are ignored
as mysql manual says a phrase that is enclosed within double quote characters matches only rows that contain the phrase literally as it was typed

17015042
setcontentview	findviewbyid
the problem you have is that you are retrieving those buttons before calling setcontentview r.layout.escolher
so put calls to findviewbyid after setcontentview your oncreate method should look like this instead edit if you are not quite clear of what i am telling then try debugging

17017717
setinterval	settimeout
setinterval returns an id for the interval - so that you can choose to stop it
also settimeout doesn t pause the execution of the program

17022278
udp	tcp
with udp sockets you can get a package multiple times out of order or not at all
for a string you most probably would want to use a tcp socket

17024100
implements	extends
if you have already created your class you can make it extends you abstract class by hand and use right click on the source code source override implements methods.
and choose which methods you want to implements if they are not already implemented

17024100
implements	extends
and choose which methods you want to implements if they are not already implements
an other way to do it is to extends your abstract class by hand and use the quick fix provided by eclipse to add unimplemented methods

17024479
junit	testng
testng from a very early stage was suitable for integration automation testing it has a more powerful version of dataprovider than junit even before junit had dataprovider capabilities
it has much better annotation support than junit and unlike junit testng does not require your before after class methods to be static

17025149
nsexception	nserror
first of all and i m sure you ll get at least a comment from bbum about this nsexception isn t intended in objective-c for recoverable errors and propagating recoverable errors through code see introduction to exception programming topics for cocoa
instead the construct used in objective-c is to use nsexception basically for unrecoverable programming errors and to use nserror objects for handing around recoverable errors

17028660
apache	nginx
so you could try switching to use this technology which is implemented by many web servers not only apache
in my case i used it with nginx and i was pretty satisfied

17029081
prepare	execute
you have run into an unfortunate and misleading behavior of pdo s named parameters in a prepare statement
despite assigning names you cannot actually use a parameter more than once as mentioned in the prepare documentation you must include a unique parameter marker for each value you wish to pass in to the statement when you call pdostatement execute

17029943
hive	hdfs
hive stores the data as hive tables on top of hdfs the hadoop file system
but again hive is not suitable for real time stuff

17029943
sqoop	hadoop
you could easily move your sql data into your hadoop cluster either by writing your own programs or by more high level tools like sqoop
search is not the only area where hadoop is used

17031724
udp	tcp
this is appearently due to vpn not forwarding udp packets allowing only tcp connections
in your case your firewall or security settings or antivirus or whatever may be blocking udp

17034742
uiview	calayer
since here self.plane is a custom calayer as opposed to the layer backing a uiview it will not respect the parameters of uiview animatewithduration from the docs custom layer objects ignore view-based animation block parameters and use the default core animation parameters instead
instead use a cabasicanimation and calayer s addanimation forkey method and probably in this case a caanimationgroup

17035970
email	dkim
the button is not showing up because your email is not signed with dkim spf
without signature there s no way to prove that the sender is actually yourself and prevent malicious senders from spoofing your email address so the markup is being ignored

17037126
portrait	landscape
from the window s perspective everything is effectively in portrait mode
this is why even after device is rotated to landscape self.view.frame will not change

17037807
jar	war
you should check if jar is present in classpath or not
probable location since it doesn t get shipped with tomcat-6.x web-inf lib directory of war file

17038474
mp3	ogg	wav	ogg
supported formats for javafx 2.2 are mp3 aac and pcm in various containers such as mp3 mp4 and wav files
other formats such as ogg theora are not supported - so if you need such formats you will need a different solution than javafx 2.2

17040504
equals	compareto
taking a look at a quick string comparison example with the equals method if the following test were run the two strings would not be considered equals because the characters are not the exactly the same the case of the characters is different but when the two strings contain the exact same string of characters the equals method will return true as in this example option 2 string comparison with the equalsignorecase method in some string comparison tests you ll want to ignore whether the strings are uppercase or lowercase
when you want to test your strings for equality in this case-insensitive manner use the equalsignorecase method of the string class like this option 3 java string comparison with the compareto method there is also a third less common way to compare java strings and that s with the string class compareto method

17048193
spaces	delimiter
if you think the user might use a different delimiter other than a spaces you could use regular expression to determine if any character that is not alpha-numeric is present
then use that character as a delimiter and identify the individual keywords

17049716
implements	extends
how to implements it there are numerous ways to do inheritance this is the one i use which is not necessarely the best but is the one easiest to understand so if say that c does not have the method dosomethingelse and you do something like it will call a.dosomethingelse method on the c instance
a little explanation on the .apply function functions in javascript extends object as such they are object themselves

17052185
udp	tcp
you should write your code as if both client and server are on the same network your current code looks ok but you should also set up your routers so that they 1 allow routing udp through nat and 2 the router for the node2 5.6.7.8 must forward its udp traffic for port 1234 to the node2 s private address
routing udp packets as well as tcp is not the task you should solve in your code it is performed by routers

17054680
inline	inlining
setter and getter are usually good candidates to inline since they typically just copy data from one place to another and can easily be done where the call takes place
as others have said it s a please compiler if i may ask you kindly consider inlining this function - it s not a make this function inline

17054680
inline	inlining
as others have said it s a please compiler if i may ask you kindly consider inlining this function - it s not a make this function inline
the compiler on the other hand will often inline functions regardless of whether there is an inline keyword

17055628
nfa	dfa
convert the nfa to a dfa via the powerset construction complement the dfa by making accept states not accept and vice versa
convert the dfa to a regular expression

17056487
nsstring	nsobject
nsattributedstring is not a subclass of nsstring or vice versa
both of them inherited from nsobject

17057345
ssl	https
if you open a port https ssl security you opened it for everyone the only exception is if you intent to use client authentication using ssl client certificates that a guess is not the case here
however you can check if the user is accessing using https using httpserlvetrequest.issecure and send him back to http with a redirect or change all page links to starts with http if he is not logged in

17058167
equals	gethashcode	equals	compareto
well potentially if all the time is being spent in the equals of the tuple then changing to a record type might help
but probably not - because really if it was an hash container then gethashcode shouldn t be causing many clashes and it is was a map then it would be compareto anyway in real code you would obviously have different garbage collector affects etc etc

17058305
equals	compareto	comparator	comparable
note however that strictly speaking such a treeset no longer is a correct set because it effectively ignores the equals method of your objects note that the ordering maintained by a set whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if it is to correctly implement the set interface
see comparable or comparator for a precise definition of consistent with equals . this is so because the set interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a treeset instance performs all element comparisons using its compareto or compare method so two elements that are deemed equals by this method are from the standpoint of the set equals

17060730
jboss	glassfish
i think you can not load the glassfish native libraries in jboss appserver. i test the props.setproperty java.naming.factory.initial com.sun.enterprise.naming.impl.serialinitcontextfactory
config in three appservers glassfish 3 jboss 7 and websphere 8. the only application server that run the application properly was glassfish

17062108
rdf	owl
you should read up about rdf the resource description format and look at the representations like turtle and n3 which should make this clearer
the concept of relations that are uris instead of simple strings comes from there though link relations are not the same as rdf properties such as owl sameas or foaf name

17062476
junit	testng
ok firstly junit has been playing catchup with testng in terms of functionality they have bridged the gap some what with v4 but not well enough in my opinion
things like annotations and dataproviders are still much better in testng

17066491
hive	hdfs	namenode	hdfs
for example in hive if you create a table like this you will find this in the metastore when you insert data into employee_table the data will be stored in hdfs on hadoop datanodes and the namenode will keep track of which datanodes have the data
hive data not metadata is spread across hadoop hdfs datanode servers

17070649
ienumerable	iqueryable
while the syntax is virtually identical to the linq methods of ienumerable under the hood they re completely different
the iqueryable code isn t actually exectued anywhere at all

17071795
realloc	malloc
note that if you allocate say 50 bytes for a string and find it requires only 49 including the final 0 byte it may not be worth doing a realloc after all
it s perfectly ok to return newly- malloc -ed and possibly internally realloc ed values from functions you just need to document that you are doing so as you do here

17073334
bash	subshell
my first try was to grab the stuff on the right of the colon and let bash sum it so have to remove the quotes
oh yeah running while in a pipeline puts the modifications to sum in a subshell not in the current shell

17079020
jtextfield	jtable
i will not know the number of elements i will have it can be 2 it can be 20 it will depend on the observations i am unsure of how i can set this up in the context of a jtextfield jbutton and datechooser i wouldn t
it would be eaiser to manage with a jtable

17080272
implements	extends
search on the net there are plenty of examples in vb.net too. the strategy i can suggest is having a class implements the functions add subtract etc and use the reflection getmethod and invoke to call them according to the command string
an example could be using a dictionary of delegates would be probably better but it does not satisfy you request of automatic binding you need to manually add the new function in the dictionary when you decide to extends the function your interpreter understand

17085879
wildfly	jboss
in case you d like to upgrade to mojarra 2.3 which doesn t offer a 2-jar variant anymore on maven you d need to manually create the 2-jar variant based on javax.faces.jar file as per this procedure how to install one jar variant of jsf javax.faces.jar on wildfly
the below procedure applies to jboss 7.2+ jboss eap 6.1+ and jboss wildfly 8+ and assumes that you ve full control over the server installation and configuration

17090534
heroku	openshift
still yet to explore heroku and cloudbees
just to update this discussion on my recent finding openshift currently does not have prebuild cartridge framework for play framework

17091270
serializable	deserialization
if you want to communicate with a client side eliom program you do not need to serializable yourself your data to json
serialization deserialization of any ocaml type is done automatically by eliom

17093840
super	self
super b self returns a class not an object which makes sense - a class doesn t have a superinstance it has a superclass so you then call __class__ on that class which results in the unexpected result
you use __class__ on self because self is an instance of the class

17094931
ienumerable	iqueryable
see also enumerable.any method ienumerable
returns an iqueryable not a bool

17095879
g++	gcc
adding this c++ file caused libtool to switch from linking with gcc to linking with g++
seems that linking with gcc a -pthread is enough to add the dynamic dependency to libpthread but when linking with g++ it is not

17096445
memcpy	memmove
safer code there will be those who insist that memcpy is safe because the strings cannot overlap and at one level they re correct but overlap should be a non-issue and with memmove it is a non-issue
so i use memmove all the time...but i ve not done the timing measurements to see how big of a problem it is if it is a problem at all

17099963
.htaccess	httpd.conf
note i made these changes in the httpd.conf file not in the .htaccess of the root directory
you need to be careful to make it so the .htaccess in the root directory is even read - the default apache configuration has an override none for that directory so some extra work is needed

17104488
png	ico
not just a jpg or png renamed with an ico extension. - greg hostetler setting up favicons in ie7
it must be windows icon format instead of png or gif ie8 just supports ico. - xyberbit msdn

17104488
gif	ico	png	ico
it must be windows icon format instead of png or gif ie8 just supports ico. - xyberbit msdn
on the other hand internet explorer does not support png favicons but it will ignore the png favicon and use the ico favicon regardless of the order in which they are declared. - jonathon t.neal

17106056
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
as part of our definition of done we support the following desktop browsers ie8+ firefox 3.6 firefox latest google-chrome latest safari 6 the support of the latest versions of firefox google-chrome is fine because they both provide automatic updates and so if anybody has a problem on an older version of the browser it s out of our hands and they should update
the majority of firefox google-chrome testing can be done on our machines but there are obviously discrepancies with how the different os handle fonts and some quirks with native form elements that may or may not carry over to versions on windows

17106056
google-chrome	firefox
the majority of firefox google-chrome testing can be done on our machines but there are obviously discrepancies with how the different os handle fonts and some quirks with native form elements that may or may not carry over to versions on windows
to test firefox versions on os x i use the install all firefoxes script that i created to allow me to run multiple versions of firefox side-by-side

17107828
implements	extends
if you want to use the session in many actions over the application then to not implements this interface in every action you could create a base action
then actions will extends the base action to get the session compability

17110514
gif	png
gif and jpeg files do not specify a gamma value jpeg can with extra exif data so it s anybody s guess what their color values really mean
png does but most people ignore it or get it wrong so they can t be trusted either

17116995
rational-numbers	fractions
for my purposes this is acceptable since all the numbers i am dealing with standard measurements are rational-numbers anyway
here is a solution that first determines a valid fractions although not necessarily the simplest fractions

17119079
nfa	dfa
nfa if i am right a pure dfa cannot capture groups at least not easily
only nfa can capture groups

17119239
spaces	delimiter
phrase1 a b phrase2 a b phrase3 w o r d phrase4 word you can then parse it with this pattern outputs phrase1 a b phrase2 a b phrase3 w o r d phrase4 word if it s not possible to relax the above constraint you can try this pattern note there s a caveat with this pattern the string you re parsing needs to have an extra spaces at the end or the last phrase won t get parsed
the input text in your example doesn t have any clear delimiter between the phrases so parsing it accurately with regex is tricky

17126055
udp	tcp
udp is often used in telephony applications as the lower overhead makes everything faster and for this application it doesn t matter if packets are dropped or arrive in the wrong order
but since udp isn t an option you can use tcp

17126752
decimal	ieee
you can read all about why in what every computer scientist should know about floating-point arithmetic or the floating point guide you can trucate or round the value if you want exact representation of those values consider using the decimal module note that you need to start with the string representation of your float 0.1 since 0.1 is not exactly representable in binary in ieee floating point to then get a string representation back after you calculate you can use str another alternative is to use a rational-numbers library such as fractions with that result you will still need to round truncate or use an arbitrary precision arithmetic package to get an exact number depending on the inputs...
as has been stated countless times 0.1 cannot be represented exactly in ieee 754 floating point

17127591
single-quotes	double-quotes
i would use single-quotes since you then only need to escape singe-quotes and meaningful backslashes with double-quotes you need to escape double-quotes pounds hashes # percents and all backslashes not just meaningful ones you don t use curly brackets so only needs meaningful backslashes to be escaped ruby properly handles nesting with q and q so this works just as well even though you used and since they happen to be used conveniently balanced last if you don t want to deal with escaping any characters you could always just paste the strange string as-is into a file and read it
first you can use double-quotes or q it just takes more work than single-quotes or q

17130986
cpython	pypy
and pypy being implemented in a subset of python lets you run python code faster than cpython which rightly should blow your mind
- actually compiling to c so cpython does not translate your python code to c by itself

17132987
boost	stl
my advice is to use below steatment isntead or you could use boost shared_ptr instead
boost scoped_ptr is not copyable while stl container needs elements to be copy constructable

17133187
google-chrome	firefox
if you deal with firefox only the above solution is enough but it doesn t work in google-chrome 27
then you will ask how to trigger save password in google-chrome 27

17137392
operands	scalar
a similar list builtin doesn t exist i imagine largely because it could mean a number of different things might be defined answering the body of the question when confused by context remember that operators impose context on operands not the reverse
in your problem case you have a scalar assignment assigning to a scalar the result of a list assignment which puts the list assignment in a scalar context

17140176
calloc	malloc
use calloc if you want to make sure it is initialized with zeros
malloc does not initialize the memory only allocating the space on the heap

17140381
ubuntu	linux
you have an issue with pocketsphinx installation to make easy access to pocketsphinx just install pocketsphinx from repository more over recently pocketsphinx has been landed in ubuntu repository
if you compile pocketsphinx from sources the installation process for pocketsphinx is not an issue if you understand the complexity of audio subsystems in linux

17141036
realloc	malloc
don t bother realloc ing to the final size
when the memory is not needed anymore you will free it anyway and unless the string is huge chances are that even if you realloc it to a smaller size the alignment requirements of malloc will not change the space actually reserved so you just make a superfluous call to a quite expensive function

17141827
inline	inlining
the compiler s decision to inline a function once could be influenced by the inline keyword but it was and is only a hint
these days optimizers can predict better than any human when and when not inlining is a good choice so the compiler can ignore that hint whenever it sees fit and it can inline functions that have not been declared inline

17141827
inline	inlining
these days optimizers can predict better than any human when and when not inlining is a good choice so the compiler can ignore that hint whenever it sees fit and it can inline-functions that have not been declared inline
so with modern compilers inline is just a means to obey the odr for functions that are not declared inline implicitly

17143965
jlist	jtable
you may be able to achieve the desired effect using jlist using multiple_interval_selection and horizontal_wrap as shown here and here
as shown in how to use tables user selections jtable supports multiple selections among rows but not among individual cells

17146120
implements	extends
you can use whatever you want on the server side to persist your classes as long as all the source code of the entities and it s dependencies annotations implements interfaces are available to the gwt compiler
if you re entities have to extends some sort of magic server side class this is likely not to work

17147483
g++	gcc
some basics gcc gnu compiler collection g++ gnu c++ compiler both are drivers which calls the compilers as needed
clearing your doubt the problem with gcc is that it doesn t links in the std c++ libraries by default as g++ does

17147483
g++	gcc
clearing your doubt the problem with gcc is that it doesn t links in the std c++ libraries by default as g++ does
gcc is just a front-end

17147663
prepare	execute
also you can narrow down the problem by checking if prepare succeeded and then subsequently if there are any rows if prepare fails it means there is a either a connection error syntax error or missing table field name in the query
the bind_result call must be done after execute not before

17151419
base	fractions
unlike integers which can be represented exactly in any base relatively few decimal fractions have an exact representation in the base-2 fractions format
this means that fp integers are exact and generally fp fractions are not

17151725
oncreate	onstart
as of v2 of robolectric this is not the proper way to start activities now now the proper way is to use this this will give you an instance of the activity after calling oncreate
if you want to test onstart onresume onpause etc it is the same way just more methods

17151759
factors	matrix
you will have 49k factors and model matrix is trying to represent them as contrasts which will be 6 column matrix so 49 6 approx 300k columns. why not make binary dummy variables 7 per factors and simply construct this directly without using model.matrix
you could save 1 7th the space by storing this via sparsematrix glmnet accepts sparse matrix formats i did exactly that and worked perfectly fine

17152350
translation	localization
the localization of the sqlrepository items only apply to the bcc editor and does not translation any of the value properties within the repository
to do this you will need to implement some sort of translation solution yourself atg 9.x does not come with a data localization strategy out-of-the-box though there were some available to purchase from 3rd party vendors

17152507
dictionary	map
demo because we are using a dictionary the label-to-number lookups are constant cost so the whole operation will take linear time based on the length of the labels list
alternatively use a set to get unique values then map these to a enumerate count this assigns numbers more arbitrarily as set objects are not ordered this requires looping through labels twice though

17153905
factors	mean
as is often the case there are other factors to consider as well especially if your message size count etc
doesn t mean there s a clear winner in terms of performance and no one protocol meets your functional requirements in a way the other does not

17155811
implements	extends
this will avoid the scenario where a derived class overrides a virtual method but does not implements some special requirement perhaps because of lack of documentation on the base class at which point the derived class does not behaves as expected by the system potentially causing the system to crash or behave unexpectedly a typical violation of the liskov substitution principle
in your particular example this anti-patter does not apply you re extends constructors which by definition are required to be called as they instantiate the class into a useful state

17158245
email	dkim
as for some places to check if your email looks like a spam here are two i ve found
there are really many reason that might explain why an email ends up in the spam folder of your favorite mail client web based or not your server is in an ip blacklist your emails contain keywords that are triggering a spam filter you re sending spam your mail server is misconfigured and sending out emails that look like spam you are sending emails containing only images your server doesn t use dkim and spf to authenticate email see this webmaster se question many other reasons i don t remember

email	dkim
there are really many reason that might explain why an email ends up in the spam folder of your favorite mail client web based or not your server is in an ip blacklist your email contain keywords that are triggering a spam filter you re sending spam your mail server is misconfigured and sending out email that look like spam you are sending email containing only images your server doesn t use dkim and spf to authenticate email see this webmaster se question many other reasons i don t remember
- jeff atwood also wrote a nice article on his blog about good practices for send email through code

17158306
hex	binary
however pre-9.0 libpq versions will not correctly process hex format from newer servers
the new hex format will be directly compatible with more applications that use binary data allowing them to store and retrieve it without extra conversion

17159250
pthreads	fork
complete pthreads means fork mmap signal and such and these are almost impossible to implement on nt
to drive the point home gnu hurd has problems with fork as well because hurd kernel is not pthreads

17159250
pthreads	fork
to drive the point home gnu hurd has problems with fork as well because hurd kernel is not pthreads
nt is not pthreads too

17159415
youtube	vimeo
afaik youtube does not offer this service - it only allows you to select members to view the video
not only that but you can add a bunch of videos to an album in vimeo and password-protect the album so you only have to change the password for the album

17160101
factors	mean
the reason hog has had so much success with pedestrian detection is because a person can greatly vary in color clothing and other factors but the general edges of a pedestrian remain relatively constant especially around the leg area
this does not mean that it cannot be used to detect other types of objects but its success can vary depending on your particular application

17162071
queue	fifo
it s not entirely clear from your description what a better solution would be but it very much sounds like a message queue like rabbitmq or possibly kafka would be a much better solution
they are made to have a constant churn and fifo semantics cassandra is not

17162771
super	implements
if your row layout is not super simple you might be better off making your own custom adapter
change this to this and make sure beerdata implements a tostring method you are happy with

17164151
virtualenv	conda
to activate the anaconda installation s default environment do the following all python commands will now come from the default anaconda environment in which is itself a kind of a virtualenv
you can create sub-environments with conda create -n myenv1 ipython scipy but this is not necessary

17164484
.htaccess	httpd.conf
if it s .htaccess change it to a file name windows accepts conf.htaccess 3 double-check that your htaccess file gets read add some uninterpretable garbage to it and start server you should get an error 500
if you don t file is not getting read re-visit httpd.conf file if that looks ok check if this is the only file which defines htaccess and it s location and it does at one place -within the file- only

17178374
operands	scalar
that is if the left operands is false the right operands is not even evaluated
scalar or list context propagates down to the right operands if it is evaluated

17178374
operands	scalar
that is if the left operands is true the right operands is not even evaluated
scalar or list context propagates down to the right operands if it is evaluated

17178667
qthread	qobject
the 4.8 documenation states note that qcoreapplication exec must always be called from the main thread the thread that executes main not from a qthread
in gui applications the main thread is also called the gui thread because it s the only thread that is allowed to perform gui-related operations. but regarding qthreads in general - you ll find the the link provided describes qthreads as qobject that is a wrapper around threads

17178777
prepare	execute
but you were passing the return result of prepare to it which is a pdostatement object
prepare is used in succession with execute not query

17178777
prepare	execute
prepare is used in succession with execute not query
it makes sense to prepare your statements when you have input parameters that you want to pass to execute

17179685
zsh	tcsh
zsh probably has something similar
tcsh has a special syntax for glob patterns not supported in csh sh or bash

17179904
mongodb	bson
for anyone still looking at this the reason the code doesn t work is because mongodb stores documents as bson
bson just like json does not support functions so when the above class is saved by meteor into mongo the method is not saved as part of the document

17183232
floating-point	fractions
integers can be stored exactly but fractions numbers are usually stored as floating-point numbers
there are numbers that are easy to write in base-10 that cannot be exactly represented in binary floating-point format and 0.1 is one of those numbers

17186706
punctuation	words
the text in input.txt doesn t follow proper typographical practices a punctuation mark is always followed by a space
e.g. if the input file contains the quick brown dog jumps over the lazy fox then after the sed treatment the text will look like the quickbrowndog jumps over the lazy fox and the words quick brown and dog won t be treated properly

17190991
cpython	pypy
it s the same when you upgrade from cpython 2.6 to cpython 2.7 the modules you have already installed for 2.6 are not automatically available for 2.7 and must be re-installed
similarly you must re-install the modules for pypy

17193888
bash	zsh
compare with bash s less elegant handling of the situation
when using zsh if there is output from a command and it does not end in a newline zsh will print a highlighted and move to the next line to fix this make sure your output ends with a newline

17195918
avassetwriter	avassetexportsession
if for instance you want rotated video written to a quicktime movie file using avassetwriter it is preferable to set the -transform property on the avassetwriterinput rather than physically rotate the buffers in avcapturevideodataoutput
so the posted solution by aaron vegh that uses an avassetexportsession works but is not needed

17197161
viewdidload	viewwillappear
if you implement the removal of observer in the viewwilldisappear or viewdiddisappear then you should not leave the addition of the observer in the viewdidload
instead put the addition of the observer in the viewwillappear

17197321
serializable	deserialization
ios does not provide a deserialization method for php s serializable format
instead you should use json as your serializable format

17198022
awt	swing
from my understanding canvas is just the awt version of swing s jcomponent
you shouldn t use it directly unless you re making a pure awt app

17198741
google-chrome	firefox
in my personal experience it is impossible to modify the browser behavior in google-chrome if the addon api does not allow for it - in firefox this is much easier to change as much of the interface logic is written in javascript and there are api s for just about anything
google-chrome does support the npapi api however this is written in c++ and the documentation is best maintained by mozilla

17201166
boost	stl
to look at somewhat contained implementation see gnu stl map if you have access to boost it s open source boost has a map container
boost is reasonably self contained not sure if it suits your definition of no external dependencies

17201391
prng	random
but although the seed value itself does not directly participate in the prng algorithm it does uniquely identify the starting point in the sequence so if you give a particular seed and then generate a sequence of values seeding again with the same value should cause the prng to generate the same sequence of values
prngs pseudo-random number generators produce random values by keeping some kind of internal state which can be advanced through a series of values whose repeating period is very large and whose successive values have very few apparent statistical correlations as long as we use far fewer of them

17201807
content-length	content-type
summary to summarize connection is not needed content-length should be used
content-type should be used but depending on the server and the server side code it s probably not needed

17203340
awt	swing
the problem is i cannot figure out how to add them to the awt frame you can t add binding to a frame
key bindings are for swing components only

17204116
google-chrome	firefox
ie doesn t really have anything like the same security model as google-chrome so hardware access is at the same time harder because there s no explicit support in browser apis and easier because you pretty much just do it
for firefox good keywords to search on are boot to gecko and firefox os. you ll find that mozilla is working on all sorts of cool device apis

17207052
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i had the same problem an external css file was loaded alright but it was not applied in google-chrome
safari and firefox were ok about it

17207596
lisp	scheme
but as i said above this is only the definition of those terms in the context of the hyperspec and thus common lisp
in scheme however the r5rs doesn t mention form at all and talks about expressions only

17209280
implements	extends
or put another way the class declaration has an extends clause and an implements clause but it doesn t have a with clause
instead the with clause belongs inside the extends clause

17211184
actionscript	mxml
you can do this in actionscript
but not in mxml

17212686
gradle	ivy
i would use pure maven or gradle as it is easier to create build scripts but would steer away from ant
ivy is an underused dependency management solution and i personally have only cursory experience as in building artifacts but not managing them and i have never maintained an ivy build but seems pretty straightforward

17213594
rdf	owl
just so that you can see the structure of the resulting owl ontology apart from its rdf serializations here s the ontology in the owl functional syntax too
as mentioned in ian dickinson s answer there s not a direct way to do this in rdf

17213594
rdf	owl
in owl which can be serialized as rdf you can make arbitrary relationships between classes as annotations which will not affect the meaning of the ontology but can carry information that may be useful to other processing tools or to human readers of the ontology
in addition other owl constructs such as axioms including annotation axioms can be annotated too

17215465
boost	allocator
for instance in case you are not allowed to use c++11 for instance because your boss says the sw must compile on older versions of your compiler for compatibility reasons you can always kill your boss use boost s smart pointer classes such as boost shared_ptr and boost scoped_ptr
notice anyway that you should not perform a dynamic allocator unless you need to

17216002
google-chrome	safari
it seems to be okay in safari now but google-chrome 27 is still misbehaving
this is a solution that i am using borrowed from the accepted answer to this question video element disappears in google-chrome when not using controls

17216593
noexcept	throw
in c++11 throw x is deprecated the new form of exception specification is noexcept and can be noexcept true or noexcept false equivalent to throw and throw ... which is all that msvc supports
if you want to use the old-style exception specs just use throw to say will not throw and either nothing or throw ... to say might throw and do not use throw x

17219765
sudo	passwd
if you have already installed rvm and it is asking you for your sudo passwd you can disable autolibs otherwise you can install rvm without autolibs with this command i understand the motivation but find it rather annoying
i do not want to put my sudo passwd into rvm nor for that matter bundle

17219946
cstring	bstr
maybe the cstring contains a unicode string that is not being converted to ansi correctly
also when calling ierrorinfo getdescription you are leaking the returned bstr

17223487
dictionary	map
search the dictionary possibly the map using the sorted user input
when displaying anagrams from your dictionary be sure to remove the user input from the list of anagrams blam is not an anagram of blam

17225303
lodash	underscore.js
i personally use require.js to load underscore.js lodash
therefore in my app backbone doesn t know if it is underscore.js or lodash as long as i am passing _ using amd

17226027
floating-point	fractions
python time.sleep takes a floating-point number with fractions seconds
the posix sleep you re calling from c++ takes an unsigned int and cannot be used to sleep for fractions seconds

17227135
innodb	myisam
on local they were defaulting to to innodb
myisam does not support fk

17228028
implements	extends
you use the keyword extends and not implements because the interface foo is not implements anything the bodies of the methods of the parent interfaces are still not defined
if you had a class implements those two parent interfaces you d do something like also note that you don t need to use the keyword abstract when declaring an interface both the type and all its declared methods are implicitly abstract

17228146
google-chrome	firefox
if you re not doing that and you re just feeding everyone the hidpi images you can just zoom in with google-chrome etc or write css to zoom for you if that floats your boat
zooming on firefox edge currently on firefox and edge if you zoom it triggers dppx-based media queries

17228270
wav	flac
you already have all the related information channel bitrate etc so it should not be much of a problem to remove the wav header reading code
please refer to the below code flac encoder test code this example is using a wav file as an input and then encodes it into flac

17229077
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i improved it a bit css now it works in 100 cases in google-chrome safari firefox and opera. i do not know what to do with ie
korayem s solution works for me in 100 cases in modern google-chrome safari in 95 cases in firefox but does not work in opera and ie

17229487
prepare	execute
pdo prepare is not a replacement for mysql_real_escape_string
it parses an sql statement or lets the underlying database system do that work see pdo attr_emulate_prepares looking for placeholders which are replaced by actual parameters when the statement is execute

17230157
mp4	h.264
neither on rtsp nor on mp4 file you have this stream as is
on rtsp connection you typically receive nal units fragmented and you need to depacketize them no you cannot simply concatenate rtp h.264 packet depacketizer how to process raw udp packets so that they can be decoded by a decoder filter in a directshow source filter mp4 file is a container formatted file and has its own structure boxes

17234981
nhibernate	queryover
nhibernate doesn t know how to access a child property s child through the parent entity
a useful thing to remember about queryover is that it gets translated directly into sql

17239136
profiling	debugging
i like this article which helps me to understand crash logs a bit clearly demystifying ios application crash logs also do this if you see error message sent to deallocated instance products - edit scheme - enable zombie objects this will enable zombie objects and when you do profiling to your project choose zombie cause error and you will be able to see which objects was deallocated e.g nsarray myarray
yes xcode is not so friendly for debugging

17242982
cpython	pypy
the basic python implementation cpython is not meant to be super-speedy
if you need efficient matlab-style numerical manipulation use the numpy package or an implementation of python that is designed for fast work such as pypy or even cython

17243230
momentjs	datejs
momentjs does not handle #2 ..
only datejs does

17243439
qgraphicsview	qwidget
basically the widget you see in qgraphicsview is not real widget
qgraphicsview just redirects paint events to the underlying invisible qwidget

17247132
mongodb	bson
use mongodump and mongorestore instead - they use bson which is mongodb s native format and they preserve all types
you should not be using mongoexport and import if you are moving data between two mongodb instances

17247846
vbscript	vb6	vbscript	vba
i was under the impression it was a vbscript so i copied and pasted it into vbscript file and ran it
it was getting a compile time error at open c log.txt for append as #1 i did not have a vb6 environment installed but was able to run this using excel vba

17248262
opera	google-chrome
ok i found this is a bug of jquery-ui 1.10.3 see here that appears only with using ui 1.10.3 and when the scrollbar is not at the very top in firefox opera ie8
in google-chrome works fine and also with 1.10.2 on other browsers

17253152
hmac	md5
but typically hmac is a better choice on those situations and this does not apply to password hashing
short answer is that md5 md5 pw as password hash sucks because you re not using a salt it s fast if you d iterate md5 not twice but a million times and you d include a salt it d be a decent password hash

17255306
super	extends
the difference between and is that the return type of the second version is exactly the same as the collection s element type t while in the first version t can be a super type of the element type
the second question the reason for t extends object makes sure that t is a class and not an interface

17255638
jar	manifest.mf
run ant command as ant clean package -djava6.home usr lib jvm java-6-sun change the path according your machine and make sure you are connected to the network at this point eclipse plugin should be there in build contrib eclipse-plugin but the jar is not yet ready to work as it misses some required jars
add the following jars from your hadoop_home lib folder to the plugin lib folder commons-configuration-1.6.jar commons-httpclient-3.0.1.jar commons-lang-2.4.jar jackson-core-asl-1.0.1.jar jackson-mapper-asl-1.0.1.jar modify manifest.mf in meta-inf of the jar to include the path of these added jars

17255818
multiplying	multiplication
for example if on a given platform it is known that multiplying by 1.0 is an identity transformation without the potential to trap then the multiplication does not actually need to be performed
this may or may not be true for a given architecture since it is possible that multiplying a nan value by 1.0 could trap

17255818
multiplying	multiplication
this may or may not be true for a given architecture since it is possible that multiplying a nan value by 1.0 could trap
however the compiler could also replace the multiplication by any other operation which would produce the same trap under the same circumstances. in the absence of traps and assuming that multiplication by 1.0 is an identity transform the entire body of your function f can be eliminated because the standard requires that the set of float values is a subset of the set of double values possibly the same set

17256811
.htaccess	httpd.conf
the problem was in the configuration of apache which was not allowing loading of .htaccess files
my solution was to define a new directory statement for my sites path as follows you may insert this in httpd.conf or in any configuration file that is being loaded

17257787
bash	subshell
but it s also important to remember that time is part of the syntax of bash and it times an entire pipeline
consequently you need to wrap the pipeline in braces or run it in a subshell with bash v4.0 probably universal on linux distributions but still not standard on mac os x you can use to pipe both stdout and stderr alternatively you can use the time utility which allows control of the output format

17257967
google-chrome	firefox
dr if you re using selenium webdriver and you want to hover over links to reveal content like submenus use google-chrome and not firefox
it turns out the reason it wasn t working was that i was using a firefox driver

17258660
implements	extends
from searching around there doesn t appear to be a way of doing it this means you will have to implements this layout behaviour manually
two possible options are create a copy of radiogroup to extends a different layout or at least allow you control it dynamically

17259045
uicollectionview	uitableview
uicollectionview is available in available in ios 6.0 and later and therefore cannot be used if you want to support earlier version
and as per your requirement you need to display a gridview so to support earlier versions and get other cool features you can use other libraries here are some of the options 1 kkgridview 2 uigridview 3 aqgridview 4 nrgridview 5 mmgridview 6 wcgridview i am currently using aqgridview so surely i recommend that as it is the least buggy and its functions are very similar to uitableview

17260574
oncreate	findviewbyid
2.86 mb if your images don t need the alpha channel ie they are not transparent you can load them using rgba_555 you can do that in your activity s oncreate method
then use findviewbyid to get hold of the view ie an imageview and set the bitmap

17264234
rvm	bundler
i m still not completely sure what all went wrong but it appears that rvm installed bundler which messed things up when it went away because of ruby_noexec_wrapper which belongs to bundler being inserted into all kinds of things
ultimately the solution was to uninstall bundler then railties which removed rails from my local dir and then reinstall rails using sudo

17268727
shadowing	named
you couldn t call it user without extremely awkward error-prone shadowing
you will eventually inject your new user and instantiate it or you will want to iterate over several users using a simple var named like user for the current item let me know if you need more clarification as to why i believe best practice is first uppercase for class service named given the context of javascript

17268979
punctuation	words
it also has the benefit of working correctly with punctuation - it will properly return 1 as the count for the phrase mike saw a dog. whereas an argumentless split would not
it uses the b regex flag which matches on words boundaries transitions between w a.k.a and anything else

17269349
super	self
the reason that you pass both the class c and the instance self to super is so that it knows what to call next not just based on the superclasses of the class but based on the mro of the instance
essentially super c self .__init__ means call the __init__ of the class after c in self s mro

17271185
stateless	stateful
if you already use a transaction-scoped entitymanager within your stateless session bean you have an entitymanager annotated or annotated persistencecontext without type attribute because transaction is the default then that em will lose it s persistence context within the not_supported method because the pc is associated with the current transaction which is no longer accessible so you cannot use such an em in the method to run queries or lookup cached objects so you must use an additional application-managed em within the not_supported method you must create the app-managed em from an entitymanagerfactory in a place where no jta transaction is active in the not_supported method because the app-managed em will automatically associate itself with the current thread s jta transaction during creation any objects returned from queries by the new app-managed em will be in a different persistence context from the original em so you need great care to cleanly detach such objects from the pc appmgdem.clear or appmgdem.close or appmgdem.detach someentity if you are to modify merge them with the original em
if you already use an extended-scoped entitymanager within your stateful session bean you have an entitymanager annotated

17274203
oncreate	onstart
when putting the phone to sleep onpause and onstop get called but ondestroy doesn t so that oncreate doesn t get called when turning the phone back on
onrestart onstart and onresume do get called checked on nexus 7 by modifying the activity lifecycle training app to add log messages in all lifecycle methods so try to move as much code in initialisetabhost as you can from oncreate to onstart leaving only the minimum necessary in oncreate or leave it there and add the relevant part of it to onrestart

17275176
intersect	contains
the book having an authorid will not achieve this relationship and this is where the intersect table is required
it contains an authorid and a bookid

17276194
super	implements
see raymond hettinger s excellent article super considered super
in the first case where b does not implements something calling super will fall up to the place where it is defined ie a

17276194
super	self
in the first case where b does not implements something calling super will fall up to the place where it is defined ie a
in the second case you can bypass b by calling a.something self

17276432
dictionary	map
in this case read is polymorphic because it has an implicit parameter for passing the dictionary for the read typeclass so r needs to be recomputed each time
map is monomorphic because it doesn t have any typeclass restrictions

17282750
jar	war
tomcat does not use any webapp class-loader at this time. you use the javax.transaction.transactionmanager class in your web-application now it will be loaded with webapp class-loader from a copy of the jar file located in the webapp.war web-inf lib folder inside the war file
try to remove the jar files containing the javax.transaction.transactionmanager class from the webapp.war web-inf lib and try to redeploy your application

17282834
implements	extends
if you actually want to implements a custom calendar system
there are two routes you could go extends system.globalization.calendar - not very good in general but might get the job done

17283716
ssl	https
with regular https requests you cannot start talking plain text then switch to ssl then back to plain text
you have to commit to either plain text or ssl mode of communication

17285136
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
since january 2013 you can do this in google-chrome with where 2 is the stroke in pixels and 3 is the space in pixels
however other browsers does not implement this yet firefox ie10 safari opera

17287347
oncreate	findviewbyid	setcontentview	findviewbyid
you need to write something in the oncreate namely the call to setcontentview where you pass it your layout file
it s crashing because you re referencing a button that doesn t exist if findviewbyid doesn t find the view it returns null

17289127
prepare	execute
second part divide your logic into steps prepare the information you need from the db use php to build the html and add some js values if needed send the page to the browser allow the browser to determine what information will need next send async ajax requests if the user should not leave the current page but the browser needs further db infmration prepare a new php script to answer the ajax request verify what s needed return the information with json if possible json_encode to simplify the process at the browser still at browser the js will receive the ajax response parse it and take some actions depending of the logic of your app script you may need to prepare more information to be sent at the server again based on user actions implementing your idea there are different strategies to achieve what you want to do some might be easy some might be hard the one you choose will depend in how it fits with the rest of your code or idea
from your description the browser has a value stored php needs said value db will retrieve a list of matches the browser will show these matches so the user needs to visit the page first at this point the page has no reenactors list show anywhere but it can show a message stating that it is processing the list once the page loads a small script retrieves the join_affiliation value and sends the ajax request to some script like user sees a spinning wheel meanwhile ajax request returns error message to user no reenactors found for affiliation success create the list or add the list depends on the response of the php script important family of functions has been deprecated its use is discouraged as its low level control allowed malicious queries to be execute easily from code of inexpert coders

17292430
boost	allocator
other than a space-overhead there is little other cost to boost optional since it does not require a default constructor or dynamic memory allocator
if you are doing a sparse computation you can do two things keep a large complexmap containing the a lot of non-existing results with a boost optional

17292827
implements	extends
for example xylineandshaperenderer implements it or you will need to extends xyshaperenderer yourself and add the label drawing logic using any of the other renderer s source code as an example
i think the problem is that xyshaperenderer which extends abstractxyitemrenderer does not implement itemlabelgenerator logic yet

17293997
opera	firefox
while supported in ie webkit browsers and opera they all function slightly different to the specifications requirements except for ie - according to the calculating offsetx offsety section here
the properties aren t supported in firefox at all - it appears to be a long-time bug that is yet to be resolved

17296516
factors	matrix
however the main limiting factors in your function is that it s time complexity is only o n and so there is a drastic drop in efficiency when the size of the array you re running over crosses each cache level boundary
if you look at for example at large dense matrix multiplication gemm it s a o n 3 operation so if one does things right using loop tiling the cache hierarchy is not a problem you can get close to the maximum flops s even for very large matrix which seems to indicate that gemm is one of the thinks intel thinks of when they design the cpu

17297082
serializable	deserialization
as others suggested you can serializable and deserialize the whole list at once which is simpler and seems to comply perfectly with what you intend to do
in that case the serialization code becomes and deserialization becomes assuming that myclasslist is a list and hoping you will use generics you can also deserialize several objects from a file as you intended to please do not forget to close stream objects in a finally clause note it can throw exception

17300930
prepare	execute
as you can see below at each step we have a verification to know if we were able to connect to the database if the sql query was ok if the parameters you want to give are ok and we also take the opportunity to prevent injection with the prepare statement and we finally execute it
now notice how after we execute it i verify how many rows were affected using to know if it was ok or not

17301828
google-chrome	firefox
this was the 2013 solution that kind of fakes it css may need to add prefixes html this works today css may need to add prefixes ps only tested in google-chrome
hear firefox still doesn t support details in general

17302589
namedtuple	dictionary
the namedtuple added in python 2.6 are a sort of lightweight object class which can offer some performance advantages and lighter memory footprint over normal custom classes for situations where you only want the named fields without binding custom methods to these objects for example
why not a list of namedtuple or a collection list dictionary of objects from some class which you define with attributes for each column

17302589
namedtuple	dictionary
why not a list of namedtuple or a collection list dictionary of objects from some class which you define with attributes for each column
note mytable can be a list or a dictionary or whatever is suitable to your needs

17304096
octal	binary
thus 58 and 59 are not octal numbers and your method should be expected to give erroneous results
the reason that 58 evaluates to 101000 is because the first digit of the octal number expands to the first three digits of the binary number

17307637
ftp	smb
i have not used it. in build configuration settings new runners will be available for the build steps. new runners include smb deployer - upload files to windows shares via smb protocol ftp deployer - upload files to ftp servers ssh deployer - upload files via ssh using scp or sftp protocols ssh exec - execute arbitrary remote commands using ssh tomcat deployer - deploy war application archives to a remote tomcat instance requires manager webapp installed in the target tomcat server
according to the above ticket tw-1558 external artifact publishing ftp copy there is a new plugin appears to fix this problem

17309044
uiview	uiwindow
if you can t find a way for it to work by adding the view to a uiviewcontroller s view hierarchy then you ll need to manually listen for rotation events and programmatically adjust the positioning of your uiview
things you add to the uiwindow will not respect device rotations

17312156
implements	extends
interfaces cannot be instantiated they can only be implements by classes or extended by other interfaces
i believe what you should do is extends interfaces

17312188
implements	extends
obvious advantages you get out implements runnable are you have liberty to extends any other class you can implements more interfaces you can use you runnable implementation in thread pools extends thread class is just an option as it implements runnable internally so you end up implements runnable interface indirectly
its just that this class was not made final to prevent developers from extends it

17312804
boost	allocator
you re not likely to find better documentation for boost than that kept online at the boost site
if a good reference doesn t document exceptions it s usually because that function s code isn t explicitly written to throw any - though that doesn t mean there can t be exceptions thrown as the arguments to a function are prepared as a side effect of memory allocator or some reasonable operation on objects copy construction or operators or during the construction of a result

17320600
google-chrome	firefox
i m not sure why it doesn t work in google-chrome but you could simply override the style on the textarea cell like so jsfiddle html css update after inspecting the original fiddle you can see that google-chrome provides some default page styling in it s own stylesheet user agent stylesheet the included styles for a textarea include the style that is preventing your desired behaviour is display inline-block
the difference is that other browsers firefox don t define this style as a default

17320945
mvp	presenter
regarding mvp many people use the activity as a presenter but this is just one way to do mvp some use activities only as lifecycle managers for other components widgets that themselves use mvp or not
an activity could thus create a presenter and view or pick long-lived instances of either of them

17320945
mvp	presenter
some use mvp inside widgets as an implementation detail
celltable and actually almost all cell-based widgets is one such example it s complex enough that a presenter had a real value but that presenter is not exposed at all in the api

17323566
shadowing	named
so if superclass has a varaible foo and in subclassing you try define a variable with the same named that would be shadowing
this does not have a named

17328100
profiling	debugging
profiling will not be able to do that themselves if there is not enough debugging information
compile application with full debugging info issue a fatal exception in place of interest and do the stack backtracking to console with full call path - source file names and line numbers if available

17329191
division	multiplication
note that unsigned integer division rounds down. but this almost feels like cheating because division and remainder operations are so intimately related
in hardware fixed shift operations are cheap if not practically free and conceptually represent multiplication by a non-negative power of two

17329191
multiplying	subtract
some architectures such as arm can even combine shifts with other instructions to make them free a good deal of the time. armed couldn t resist with these shift operations we can proceed as follows find out the largest power of two we can multiplying q by and still be less than p
working from the largest power of two to the smallest multiplying q by each power of two and if it s less than what s left of p subtract it from what s left of p

17330250
umask	passwd
another pitfall are permissions - files which are not readable under - but this should not often be the problem because when svn creates them it takes care of the right permissions the auth directory is only readable by the user then not by the group all independent of the configured umask
with recent versions of subversion 1.8 you can configure passwd caching via but depending on your system this may be not enough

17333421
realloc	malloc
realloc is called with some index that we kow nothing about not likely good
it must be something got from malloc or realloc

17334023
firefox	safari
so technically firefox is doing the right thing
however note that although chrome safari include the accept and origin headers they do not verify that those headers are included in the access-control-allow-headers response header

17338087
udp	tcp
therefore a udp channel does not have an associated remote address in the way that a tcp channel does
while i think it s possible to get netty to associate a udp channel with a specific remote address i haven t got the details to hand and to be honest i think getting the address from the message event is the better option

17345080
matlab	simulink
calling the matlab engine
note you cannot call just simulink

17348527
dictionary	map
if you create your own data structure though that is a facade for lists using dictionary to map column names to indexes then it s simple enough note that if you were willing to fix the rows columns upon construction then you d be able to use a as the backing for the data which would both make the class dramatically simpler to implement and further reduce the memory overhead although that doesn t appear to work for your use cases
while you could use a to do what you want that wouldn t be particularly efficient in terms of memory and would have the potential for the inner dictionary to get out of sync

17351117
uiview	subviews
to enable clipping set the uiview clipstobounds property or set it in interface builder credit to mugunth for the image
by default a view will not clip it s subviews

17353894
rdf	owl
they touch upon the reason why the rdf list vocabulary rdf list rdf first and rdf rest can t be used in owl since rdf lists are used in the serialization of owl situations would arise where it would be unclear whether the triples were appearing as part of the data or as part of the owl encoding
this answer by michael schneider on answers.semanticweb.com also explains the issue if outside owl 2 dl there are many dangers to not safely get from rdf to the native owl 2 syntax

17353894
rdf	owl
this answer by michael schneider on answers.semanticweb.com also explains the issue if outside owl 2 dl there are many dangers to not safely get from rdf to the native owl 2 syntax
one example is when rdf lists are used as normal entities instead of argument lists for owl constructs if used for something like me traveledcountries argentina belarus china

17355922
config	ini
1 using config.ini on every symfony2 project there is a fille called config.ini on newer versions of the framework it changed to config.yaml in the app config directory
that file is where things like database configuration values are meant to be stored but you can add as many options as you want just adding them to the file getting those values is easy from a controller just call it might work for you but depending on what kind of data you want to store for ini files there is just key value way to go and for the newer versions using yaml files i m just not sure if the framework would parse a hierarchical structure for you it might give it a try

17355922
config	ini

other thing to keep in mind is that if someone deletes a config value your system will come down probably after the cache is manually cleared and there is sensitive data a.k.a

17356259
noexcept	throw
the noexcept is important because you don t want to throw an exception when your function is already exiting due to an exception
that leads to immediate termination. c++ doesn t check that the lambda really can t throw anything

17361369
implements	extends
you can implements this interface fieldkeysorter for the classes you want to control the order
you can write an annotation by yourself which does not only extends the target class but also implements fieldkeysorter at runtime by reflection

17363951
ssl	https
that being said you are able to add multiple sans subject alternative names to your ssl certificates making your elb respond to multiple domains subdomains over https
this way the traffic between your elbs and your instances won t be over https but you said that is not a problem

17364802
rdf	owl
an owl reasoner could be implemented that makes no use of rdf and a swrl engine could be built that make no use of rdf graphs
the code that you ve shown based on the presence of an owlontologymanager is based on the owl api not on jena s api

17368731
ecdsa	rsa
the issue was indeed the ssh server sending ecdsa keys which are not supported yet with paramiko
on my debian wheezy system i disabled ecdsa by commenting out a single line in etc ssh sshd_config # hostkey etc ssh ssh_host_ecdsa_key restarted sshd and it was back to using rsa

17375039
backtracking	greedy
the same with the classical example of the ashdflasd string details the possessive quantifier ++ is like a greedy quantifier + but doesn t allow backtracking
.. but doesn t allow backtracking too

17376877
google-chrome	firefox
check out this with google-chrome the key parts are
although it is not really well enough supported by firefox and ie the flex-box model is the right way to do it conceptually at least if not for practical purposes

17377996
firefox	safari
however the code does not work in firefox 21 i get the error message.
i notice that in both firebug and safari developer tools the server does not send a sec-websocket-accept header nothing i tried would make the code work in firefox 21.0

17377996
firefox	safari
i notice that in both firebug and safari developer tools the server does not send a sec-websocket-accept header nothing i tried would make the code work in firefox 21.0
to check whether firefox 21.0 even supports websockets i went to and it said my browser does support websockets

17379456
ssl	https
ssl itself is can be used in a stateful manner because it actually works over the transport layer in the osi model https on the other hand is not a stateful protocol by design
https is http over ssl so the two technically don t really have anything to do with each other except that in https ssl is used to secure the application data that is being requested

17379456
ssl	https
https is http over ssl so the two technically don t really have anything to do with each other except that in https ssl is used to secure the application data that is being requested
with https as with http once a request is made to the server it basically forgets about you not exactly how it happens but for all intents and purposes you can think of it this way

17380264
clang	llvm
change the lib target in the xcode to use the new clang llvm add a cflag -fsanitize address
then build if some api such as opengl system video function is reported not supported then you can put it into the app project your clang doesn t support compiling it

17380264
clang	llvm
then build if some api such as opengl system video function is reported not supported then you can put it into the app project your clang doesn t support compiling it
if you pass the compile it will report linkage problem of __asan_xxx function add a lib called libclang_rt.asan_osx_dynamic.dylib to the app s linkage dependency and it s located in your llvm s . debug+asserts lib clang 3.4 lib darwin folder

17383047
opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
it will only work in ie10 buggy though ff4 google-chrome 20 and opera
but not in safari or older ie versions don t even think about mobile browsers

17383883
qplaintextedit	qtextedit
if you are not interested in the rich text capability of qtextedit you should have a look at qplaintextedit
qplaintextedit is optimized to handle large documents and to respond quickly to user input

17390437
bash	subshell
there you ll read bashpid expands to the process id of the current bash process
this differs from under certain circumstances such as subshell that do not require bash to be re-initialized

17391400
tiff	png
maybe the images that you are trying to crop is in a tiff format which is not included on condition on your script
check the image format that has been exported from iphoto.photos from iphoto can be exported as jpeg | png | tiff

17391916
innodb	myisam
in innodb update statements lock every row they scan
this means that to update your 200 rows it have to create 350 000 row-level locks while keeping a rollback lock at the same time and providing the previous value to any transactions that are reading the already changed value since the transaction is not committed and the change is not final myisam on the other hand locks the entire table

17395878
ssl	https
basically if a man-in-the-middle attack is taking place the user will be notified that the ssl connection could not be made or that the server is not the correct server
never serving your website over http forces anyone linking to it to use https in the link

17399508
octal	decimal
do not start numbers from 0 - in java they considered to be octal base 8 - unless you have strange outcomes 001 1 010 8 octal 10 decimal 8 0123 83 octal 123 is decimal 83 08 - error
this s not an octal value etc

17399667
listview	gridview
starting animations in views for currently visible listview gridview-items will not work if you try to assign this animation to a referenced component of this item
instead you have to invalidate the gridview mygridview.invalidateviews and start the animation in the according getview method of the connected baseadapter

17399777
profiling	instrumentation
also note that this option is sometimes not available such as when profiling unit tests
there are two different cpu profiling methods in visual studio profiler sampling instrumentation

17401297
pyenv	virtualenv
the author suggests using pyenv
pyenv does not have built-in support for virtualenv but plays nice with it. pythonbrew is a version manager for python and comes with support for virtualenv

17403981
ioexception	fileoutputstream	ioexception	fileinputstream
use file instead of uri replace it with according to java doc public class filenotfoundexception extends ioexception signals that an attempt to open the file denoted by a specified pathname has failed
this exception will be thrown by the fileinputstream fileoutputstream and randomaccessfile constructors when a file with the specified pathname does not exist

17411508
punctuation	words
you need to do the following the does not take into account any punctuation that might separate words
the query you re currently running is doing a check for a specific phrase rather than checking for any of the specified words

17419415
implements	extends
in mainactivity and we want to pass value from xyzadapter to mainactivity then only one way i know make one interface define one method in that with parameters for passing value and then implements it on adapter class 2 if we want to pass values from adapter to another activity in which it is not set then we can use putextra method to pass value let me know if you have any issue.
edited for 1 answer make one interface in your main package in your adapter class make object of interface below this line public class cartadapter extends baseadapter and before constructor datatransferinterface dtinterface

17421510
udp	tcp
if you re going to use udp instead of tcp you have to do everything tcp does that udp doesn t by yourself if you need it
one of the things tcp does is transmit pacing -- slow start exponential backoff and so on

17422055
profiling	benchmarking
19 modern hardware transcendental functions are faster than old bit hack like quake-3 fast inverse square root versions 20 now there is opencl 2.0 which enables spawning kernels inside kernels so you can further increase resolution in a 2d grid point and offload it to workgroup when needed something like increasing vorticity detail on edges of a fluid dynamically a profiling can help for all those but any fps indicator can do if only single optimization is done per step
even if benchmarking is not for architecture-dependent code paths you could try having a multiple of 192 number of dots per row in your compute space since your gpu has multiple of that number of cores and benchmarking that if it makes gpu more occupied and have more gigafloatingpoint operations per second

17423376
profiling	instrumentation
on some platforms __builtin_return_address does not work beyond the current function so the call site information may not be available to the profiling functions otherwise. example compile and link this using the expected output would look similar to this enter 0x400665 0x7fcfedaf6c8d enter 0x400643 0x400681 exit 0x400643 0x400681 enter 0x40061c 0x400686 enter 0x400643 0x400633 exit 0x400643 0x400633 exit 0x40061c 0x400686 exit 0x400665 0x7fcfedaf6c8d
from the gcc documentation generate instrumentation calls for entry and exit to functions

17427000
set	bag
if i declare the bag like this then the reference to the parent is not set inside the child entity
however if i declare the bag like this collection productlineitems then it works

17427721
cpython	pypy
cpython is not a jit not evented
but these exist in python most commonly in the pypy project - a cpython 2.7 and soon to be 3.0+ compatible jit

17428416
cassini	iis
but you do not have to use iis you can try also iis express apache with mono cassini
you can host parts of asp.net outside iis like wcf services

17431354
macports	homebrew
as a workaround to get you going try rvm autolbs read-fail it will not install packages automatically - it will fail in case any packages are missing and will let you know names of this packages just install them manually with macports and it should be fine
other solution would be switching to rvm autolibs homebrew to use homebrew instead of macports or rvm autolibs rvm_pkg to detect what is already installed with pkg-config and try to install rest with the old rvm pkg install .

17433288
mayavi	colormap
here is what works for me it might not be the easiest solution i am not an expert on mayavi modified from here
i guess you want to reverse a colormap

17433628
i2c	spi
most external eeproms use i2c using pins 4 5 on an uno
looks like you re using an i2c library to write to a spi device - they are not the same

17434121
rar	zip
if i remember correctly rar can store directory information in file headers anywhere in the archive but this was only intended to be used for multi-file archives and isn t actually used there so you only need to read i can t remember if it s the end plus a few bytes off the front or vice-versa but either way it s the same basic idea as with zip files
read the spec and figure it out or test truncated rar files yourself

17438445
onresume	onpause
note you should not initialize the camera in oncreate since it is being done in onresume which is called even on first load
it appears that the onpause in your activity is being called and you re releasing the camera - this is good

17446837
concave	convex
having identified a set of points in that way you then need to find the concave hull for that set of points
i m assuming you want the concave hull and not the convex hull

17446837
concave	convex
i m assuming you want the concave hull and not the convex hull
finding the concave hull is a non-trivial task

17449043
intersect	contains
o 1 the rectangle and the shape do not intersect i skip this shape
the rectangle and the shape intersect using f1 i count all the points contains in this shape that lay in the rectangle o p and i continue

17449305
multiplying	multiplication
so you multiplying -1 with a value between 0.0 and 1.0 1.0 is not included according to the java docs of math.random
the multiplication would result in a value between -1.0 not including and 0.0

17451389
opera	google-chrome
in opera initially all worked fine
in google-chrome browser-side endpoint function is not implemented since stub creation at 2009

17451412
google-chrome	firefox
it will also be supported by google-chrome 30+ and ie11+
firefox 22 already supports it too but only partially it doesn t support flex-wrap property and flex-flow shorthand

17451412
firefox	safari
firefox 22 already supports it too but only partially it doesn t support flex-wrap property and flex-flow shorthand
previous versions of firefox chrome and safari 3.1+ support 2009 version

17451741
sudo	passwd
the problem is that the sudo binary itself must be owned by root
if you have the root passwd you could just get root to fix the problem su if not you could boot using a rescue system mount the partition and chown root root mnt usr bin sudo or fix the whole problem using the rescue system

17452486
dictionary	map
the name for map in vbscript is dictionary
then docs are here sample code select approach dictionary approach as you can see the key type of a vbscript dictionary is not restricted to string

17456634
setinterval	settimeout
setinterval runs a function on an interval endlessly until cancelled with clearinterval
in your case i d actually suggest not using setinterval but instead use settimeout

17456634
setinterval	settimeout
in your case i d actually suggest not using setinterval but instead use settimeout
this allows better control of execution settimeout runs once

17459876
google-chrome	firefox
why it doesn t work in google-chrome to run this on firefox you need to install the greasemonkey add-on
likewise to run this in google-chrome you need to install the tampermonkey extension

17459985
innodb	myisam
notice this only applies to innodb tables
interestingly myisam tables do not seem to show the same limitation

17460894
prepare	execute
converting that script would be something along the line of here s the explanation pdo prepare will create a prepare statement out of a mysql query and store it into a variable
pdostatement execute will execute the prepare statement using the array of parameters passed to it in this case none because the query does not have any parameter

17461538
apache	nginx
my guess is that your upstream server either apache or your script triggered a redirect to the absolute url
because you use in your proxy_pass directive nginx doesn t find a match of the domain name and returns the location header as is

17462949
persistent	transient
persistent makes a transient instances persistent
however it does not guarantee that the identifier value will be assigned to the persistent instances immediately the assignment might happen at flush time

17463502
sqoop	hadoop
basically i did not understand why does sqoop exist
why can t we directly use an sql data on hadoop

17464197
inline	inlining
inlining fields with static and final modifiers are inline by compiler
fields with only static modifiers are not inline

17466915
serializable	deserialization
i think that s not strictly a serializable
deserialization is used almost exclusively in pair with serializable

17467325
uitapgesturerecognizer	uibutton
if you added the uitapgesturerecognizer you removed the default tap recognition and now only this would work you should remove the above code and only set this where the imagebuttonaction is if you want to add an image next to the button let s say in the left of the button then the function should look like this now i am adding button to imageview but it does not get clicked
as i understand from you you need to set an image in a uibutton upon tap

17467326
sudo	passwd
sudo without specifying a user basically means do as root sudo passwd jenkins now you have to pay attention since the first passwd you have to type is the passwd of your kumar user and only after that the system will ask you for the new jenkins user passwd
login as root do a passwd jenkins if you are not root ask the administrator of your machine to do this

17470156
cassini	iis
when web.config is changed the web server iis cassini etc. does a recycle but in this case for whatever reason the process keeps the same so you keep attached to it with the debugger visual studio
the following helps in any case no matter if you re using iis cassini or whatever set your breakpoint in application_start start debugging breakpoint most probably is not hit - a page is shown in the browser change web.config enter a blank line and save it reload the page in the browser - breakpoint is hit

17474635
fgets	getchar
if you are goint to use the stdin stdout files just use the simpler ones take printf fscanf fgetc fgets fputc fputs
do not take printf scanf getchar gets putchar puts

17474803
firefox	safari
first off this should be this this doesn t do anything because ie doesn t have an implementation of the 2009 flexbox draft you ve also added the moz prefix on the properties from the standard flexbox draft but firefox implemented those prefix free only the 2009 properties should have a moz prefix
even if you fix all of these things it still won t work in safari or firefox

17476179
sudo	passwd
the problem here imho is not nohup but background processing sudo
you are putting the process in background at end of command but probably sudo needs passwd authentication and that is why the process stops

17477409
pascal	delphi
while pascal isn t really used much as templating language doing webdevelopment is perfectly possible with and several delphi component suites
some of the delphi options also support apache and have supported kylix in the past

17481806
implements	extends
according to microsoft under microsoft connect s bug id 781048 they have not implements css class intellisense for mvc razor files but are working on including this in a future release
i have a 10 minute webcast example of extends vs2012 intellisense that adds one solution that will add intellisense to your vs2012 environment a visual studio intellisense extension the webcast uses mef to extends visual studio to add an intellisense completion source that scans the currently loaded project for css class names to add as an intellisense completion set

17484967
build.gradle	gradlew
to use gradlew 0.4.3 the build.gradle file needs to be updated manually
updating android studio does not change the build file here is what i changed in build.gradle since changing this i have not seen any more mergedebugresource issues when running my project

17485523
scala	typesafe
you might want to install the eclipse plugin for play2 and the scala ide
not sure what are your constraints but if you can download a zip file you should try the typesafe activator

17487084
mp4	webm
the black line is in the mp4 video itself
it s not in the webm and ogg versions

17487168
ffmpeg	libav
if it is the libav developers then ffmpeg is secretly an alias to avconv this is the case on ubuntu
if you don t have ffmpeg and the real ffmpeg is not in your repository you have to compile ffmpeg yourself

17488871
client-side	server-side
so your server-side functionality in this case can be initiated by get_case.php and any relevant response can then be sent back to the page and handled by client-side code in the callback function where you currently have an alert
keep in mind that it s not necessary to post values to the current page. you can post to any server-side resource

17488893
stateless	stateful
a stateless server does not
so when you send a request to a stateful server it may create some kind of connection object that tracks what information you request

17489380
multiplying	multiplication
they just multiplying the elements and make sure that the result isn t larger than the maximum allowed value
here you can see how opencv does element-wise multiplication with cv multiplying

17489716
matplotlib	chaco
i don t believe the standard matplotlib plots are capable of the interactivity you want
chaco can do interactive graphs but not in an ipython notebook afaict

17492780
multiplication	exponent
i believe the correct answer which may not be the fastest is this if integer multiplication is not ok then your shift trick should now work
if the floating-point multiply is too stupid to just edit the exponent quickly then you can do it manually by bit twiddling but i wouldn t recommend it as a first option

17492953
keystore	jks
without knowing the password it is not possible to make changes to a keystore without the normal user of it finding out typically due to their tools telling them keystore was tampered with or password was incorrect in some other keystore types such as keystore.bouncycastle the keystore password protects against inspection as well as tampering
on a jks or bks keystore the password is not pointless but it doesn t do what you might assume either

17492953
keystore	jks
on a jks or bks keystore the password is not pointless but it doesn t do what you might assume either
it doesn t encrypt the data in the keystore or in any way prevent access to it but it does verify the integrity of the keystore

17499920
union	distinct
try using a standard join on a union subquery the important thing here is that the ids from the views come first in the from table list so that table can be accessed efficiently not the other way around when the in indexed view result would have to be table-scanned for every row of table
also note there is no need for distinct because the union inside the subquery eliminated duplicates

17506414
ubuntu	linux
- edit here s the default ulimit values on my 64-bit ubuntu 11.04 system so it appears that there isn t a default memory size limit for a task
by default in linux you don t actually get the ram until you actually try to modify it

17509554
slug	permalinks
it would look like this in case someone picks the same article name friendly_id will calculate a slug that doesn t clash with an existing one
so for example article with id #1 named hello would have permalinks user_id news hello article with id #2 named also hello would have permalinks user_id news hello-2 if you don t want to use that gem you can just use rails validations

17509938
super	self
in python 3 you can just do super .foo and it does the right thing
it s not clear to me what you mean about super self being a shortcut

17510970
equals	gethashcode
in order for the find to return the correct object your item class needs to override the equals method
of course you also need to override gethashcode as well although find of linkedlist does not call gethashcode the two methods need to be changed together types that override equals object must also override gethashcode

spaces	delimiter
i see you posted that partial matches actually are desirable the should match the start of theory so then you want this as long as no re metacharacters can appear in your matching words from list.txt or this otherwise that last is the most robust solution as it does a string comparison rather than an re comparison so is unaffected by re metacharacters and also will not affect white spaces which i know you said you don t care about right now
this will preserve white spaces unlike any solution that assigns to fields and won t incorrectly match the first 2 letters of there when looking for the unlike any solution that doesn t enclose word in word delimiter ... or equivalent the only caveat with this solution is that if word contains any re meta-characters + they will be evaluated by the sub

postgresql	mysql
some databases have a type just for this such as timestamp with timezone in oracle or postgresql or datetimeoffset in sql sever
unfortunately mysql doesn t have a type for this so you will need two columns

17515073
opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
not sure actually if they work in all of webkit browsers safari opera google-chrome but they do in google-chrome
checking with latest safari for windows opera and google-chrome proves that the property only works on google-chrome

17515073
opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
update 3 i did a quick compatibility test - google-chrome 27.0.1453.116 m works firefox 22.0 works ie 10.0.9200.16618 works opera 12.14 1738 works
as for safari for windows 5.1.7 7534.57.2 - it works but doesn t display shadow at all

17515086
qthread	qobject
qthread is the thread controller
its event loop doesn t block just because your qobject executes an infinite loop

17517619
bluestacks	android-emulator
you can even select and choose bluestacks as your android-emulator through eclipse and it is fully compatible
i know this does not solve how to run the android-emulator and avd on the surface pro but this is a fully functional and in my experience more efficient solution and replacement

17526643
des	aes
implementation is really easy think memset don t forget to add last chunk if ile is a multiple of 8 by the way des is nowadays seriously broken you should think about using a decent cipher if concerned with security thinking aes at least check
first i d like to point that des works on 64bits chunks making it 8bytes not 64 as you can see in check data block size

17526824
client-side	server-side
the first option might be more comfortable for you but it s going to involve either performing more post backs to replace the client-side show hide logic which is poor ux or it s going to require some awkward code in setting css properties server-side and keeping them in sync with client-side css properties manually
hint you can t set because then the elements aren t rendered client-side at all. the second option is probably going to be your best learning experience

17527043
oncreate	setcontentview
to the next-activity s oncreate method just like this main activity s oncreate 2 if you have not defined the next-activity in your-apps manifest file then do this also like you must have to perform the 2nd step every time you create a new activity otherwise your app will crash
1 place setcontentview r.layout.avtivity_next

17529034
google-chrome	firefox
these are considerably different than the older constraints mentioned here and different than the somewhat newer constraints still used by google-chrome who will be moving to the spec constraints sometime soon
note that firefox does not yet support those constraints though we will

17530638
factors	mean
so as far as server side scripts users not part of your domain and stringent security settings on your web server are all factors contributing
but i think you mean in the context of a user just trying to access code from the web browser without any additional permissions

17531273
serializable	deserialization
all the serializable deserialization of request response dto s to from json or xml performed by servicestack is bound to come at the cost of performance compared to pure c# objects that mvc controllers deal with
this doesn t sound right you should never need to do any un-necessary marshalling deserialization when using servicestack you can call servicestack services directly from mvc controllers which is just a c# method call

17533378
domcontentloaded	onreadystatechange
if the dom is not yet accessible an attempt is made to bind an event listener to the browser s native domcontentloaded event - this is the correct native way to ask the browser to inform you when the dom is available but it s a relatively modern feature
if this is not possible this almost certainly indicates you code is running in an older version of ie the code falls back to a couple of mechanisms try and attach to the onreadystatechange event of the document

17533531
translation	localization
wpf localization - on-the-fly language selection it provides an option for replacing languages at runtime on-the-fly it performs better than a lame xml xpath based binding solution it can be used via styles control templates and data templates it translation a formatted text with parameters using default and custom formatters it provides a translation custom markup-extension to write an elegant xaml wpf runtime localization switch cultures at runtime - automatically updating all localized elements use the existing resource file structure .resx files which can be maintained in visual studio keep design-time support for localized elements working in expression blend and hopefully other xaml design applications
it seems like wpf doesn t support the same features of winforms by speaking of localization and gloablization

17534418
activemq	rabbitmq
if you re only communicating between threads and not processes then you can use a blockingqueue or a priorityblockingqueue most systems i ve worked with use rabbitmq activemq zeromq hornetq to communicate between processes and then disseminate messages between threads using a priority blockingqueue
there are several open source messaging systems that are available for example rabbitmq activemq zeromq and hornetq - once you ve got them set up they re all pretty easy to use

17534511
gridview	sqldatasource
check the gridview s datasource before you do the databind
since you re missing the full aspx markup i m not sure if you re setting the data source programmatically or with a sqldatasource

17534961
equals	gethashcode
my understanding that in nhibernate s case equals is significantly more tricky and as result you see complicated implementation.i believe it is mainly due to the fact that some object properties may not be yet available - in such case comparing identity of object is enough
gethashcode should match concept of equals for your classes environment in addition to be constant while in a container and fast

17537921
google-chrome	firefox
although i do not know why exactly it is happening it disappeared when i switched to chromedriver 26.0.1383.0 i don t want this to sound like an advert for google-chrome but i did notice a significant increase in speed while running my test suite on google-chrome rather than firefox
if you are determined to use firefox or do not want to switch i would try disabling caching by 1-create a new profile with firefox.exe -profilemanager 2-go to the firefox profile directory and add the following to prefs.js user_pref browser.cache.disk.enable false

17538455
hex	binary
no you do not need to send the file data in hex
you need to send the file s original raw binary data as-is instead

17538983
jython	pypy	cpython	pypy
cpython 2.5 or 2.7 doesn t seem to be much different from jython 2.5 here but it does mean you can use numpy to get an 8x improvement
pypy 2.0 meanwhile is 11x faster with no changes

17539286
comparator	comparable
because a string is not a comparator
sure they are indeed comparable but they are not comparison functions 1 themselves it makes no sense to have string implement comparator

17540921
factors	matrix
take the z rotation the above is rather verbose you could of course drop all these terms completely omit the factors and in fact leave z alone altogether
the point here is matrix multiplication might look scary but it isn t

17541240
onresume	onpause
activity becomes non-foreground when its onpause is called. activity becomes foreground when its onresume is called
one way to find out whether the activity that this fragment is attached to is not in the foreground is to have the activity to set in the activity s onpause method and to set in the activity s onresume method and make this flag available to the fragment through a callback interface similar to the one described here

17541291
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
this is definitely possible now in google-chrome and firefox
i m not so sure about ie safari

17542132
oncreate	onstart
firstly don t get view dimensions in oncreate since the view might not have been initialized yet
you can do it in the onstart method

17543105
vsto	add-in
as explained the stackoverflow question you link to how to easily create an excel udf with vsto add-in project vsto does not support the creation of udfs for excel
alternatives for vb.net are to make com automation add-in as per your other links or to use something like the free excel-dna library which i develop

17547197
freebsd	linux
the technical limitation is that os x does not support operating system-level virtualization like containers in linux or jails in freebsd even despite the fact that os x is a half-blood bsd
but even despite that docker aims to provide an easy way to share container images and to make sure that any docker image would work on any docker-compatible system they had to limit it only to linux

17550072
uiview	subviews
class reference of uiview says if any view is hidden then it will not receive input events class reference of uiview says a hidden view disappears from its window and does not receive input events
it remains in its superview s list of subviews however and participates in autoresizing as usual

17551435
google-chrome	firefox
screensharing is available via an experimental getusermedia constraint in google-chrome not yet available in firefox
you ll need to first enable the flag called enable screen capture support in getusermedia in google-chrome flags

17551739
noexcept	throw
the std mutex lock member function is not declared as noexcept and from section 30.4.1.2 mutex types of the c++11 standard draft n3337 clause 6 the expression m.lock shall be well-formed and have the following semantics .
throw system_error when an exception is required 30.2.2

17551739
noexcept	throw
this implies that any function that uses mutex lock cannot be marked noexcept unless that function is capable of handling the exception itself and prevents it from propogating to the caller
i am unable to comment on the likelihood of these error conditions occuring but in relation to std mutex and resource_deadlock_would_occur which might be throw it indicates a bug in the code as opposed to a runtime a failure as this error might be raised if a thread attempts to lock a std mutex it already owns

17552734
memcpy	memmove
the loop case took around 7 seconds to run versus 1 for the memcpy
while memmove will be only slightly slower than memcpy due to the assumptions it needs to make about the source and destination in memcpy they cannot overlap it should still be far superior to any standard loop

17552746
persistent	transient
it says that a filehashmap is persistent by default but the zero- and one-arg constructors the one you re using which specifies the file name is the one-arg create a new transient filehashmap that is the file is deleted after the filehashmap is closed
the two-arg constructor takes the filename and an int options flag but there s no specific option for persistent so you just have to make sure the flag is not transient to be precise

17553150
svg	vml
given that i m not sure why you d feel the need to write your own svg vml code paths
but as an added point if you are going to write vml code i note that you discuss this being compatible with both ie7 and ie8 so i should warn you that the vml language changed significantly between those two ie versions

17554270
uicollectionview	uitableview
i tried to get the spacing to 5px on the uicollectionview but this does not work as well with a uiedgeinsetsmake 0 0 0 0 .
on a uitableview i can do this by directly specifying the x y coordinates in a row.

17555263
client-side	server-side
something like this this would result in the client-side javascript being rendered with the full url for the server-side path xml jsontest.json
the first one definitely won t work since doesn t mean anything client-side

17556180
inline	inlining
there are ways to force gcc to inline your code using function attributes but i will not describe them because it is rarely a good idea to use them
gcc should do the best thing regarding inlining for each function

17557315
google-chrome	safari
i have not seen a solution for using google-chrome though i really wish it were possible
here is apple s official answer to this question look for safari on ios topic

17558803
dbcontext	objectcontext
there are some lower level things you may not be able to do with dbcontext in which case you can drop down to objectcontext by using iobjectcontextadapter like this iobjectcontextadapter dbctx .objectcontext
vs2010 would generate by default an objectcontext based context and entityobject based entities

17560422
viewdidload	viewwillappear
you could try attaching your webview to a window in viewdidload so that not only does it start loading its url but can start rendering content
then in viewwillappear you can reattach it to its place inside your view controller s view

17560439
ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	icollection
any ienumerable implies deferred execution so you want to use this in a query when your retrieval is going to be subject to further processing downstream filtering being the most obvious scenario
if that isn t the case and indeed you want to make sure you don t enumerate the collection more than once you would make it available as ilist iset or icollection

17560439
ilist	icollection
if that isn t the case and indeed you want to make sure you don t enumerate the collection more than once you would make it available as ilist iset or icollection
ilist will be preferred when you want to ensure that the collection may have duplicates whereas iset is preferred when you want to ensure the set does not have dupes set behavior being more useful in my experience

17565023
postgresql	mysql
this behavior is the same as in many other database including postgresql
however mysql doesn t work like that

17565510
prng	random
the sequence is not truly random in that it is completely determined by a relatively small set of initial values called the prng s state which includes a truly random seed
the seed is used to initialize the random number generator

17565642
implements	extends
the idea graphically extends over the dividend is not easily implements
while browsers may when using a suitable font render 84 4 properly they fail with 84 42 the symbol extends over the 4 after it but not over the 2

17566019
serializable	deserialization
if a serializable class does not explicitly declare a serialversionuid then the serializable runtime will calculate a default serialversionuid value for that class based on various aspects of the class as described in the java tm object serializable specification
however it is strongly recommended that all serializable classes explicitly declare serialversionuid values since the default serialversionuid computation is highly sensitive to class details that may vary depending on compiler implementations and can thus result in unexpected invalidclassexceptions during deserialization

17566283
opcache	apc
it works fine in conjunction with zend opcache that is bundled in php 5.5+
apc doesn t support php 5.4 until version 3.1.10

17567011
ssl	https
from that version onwards urllib2 will verify ssl certificates by default
yes zc.buildout and easy_install both use urllib2 to retrieve https resources which does not verify ssl certificates warning https requests do not do any verification of the server s certificate

17570894
gif	png
if the final size of the gif or the png is large then probably a buffered video is probably better
this is because the whole gif png file needs to be downloaded before it shows i am not sure how interleaved pngs works when they contain animation though

17577034
google-chrome	firefox
it seems that google-chrome will parse the img attribute usemap mapname without the # symbol
however if you don t include the hash symbol # the map will not be associated with the image on firefox and internet explorer

17578972
inline	inlining
it took a long time to come up with this solution but it makes sense now 1 higher optimization enabled gcc to inline bzero which had no other references to it at link time
the memset calls it was inlining not inlining here were red herrings

17581307
jar	manifest.mf
ensure your jar contains org apache poi ss usermodel sheet.class or that your manifest hierarchy points to a jar that contains that class
when the command fails it s almost always because of one of two things your manifest.mf is messed up and doesn t list dependencies properly

17581602
innodb	myisam
try to add engine innodb when you create the tables
depending on version and platform the default storage format for tables is myisam and there referential integrity is not checked

17581852
bmp	png
not just as a bitmap. you may easily convert a bitmap to formats like bmp
you may also include the image directly in the html without using js example but the image must be in a correct format jpg tiff png etc

17582186
jython	pypy	cpython	pypy
other implementations jython ironpython don t have a gil but their approaches aren t practical for cpython and not easy for pypy either from what i hear and they can t exactly replace cpython as they lag behind a lot don t support c extensions are less portable to more exotic platforms etc
that said some pypy developers are working on an stm solution latest update that would free pypy from the gil

17582931
concave	convex
the polygon that forms the state of texas is concave and not convex
thus you need something a bit more generalized than the convex hull

17585514
super	extends
fields set as public or protected but not private in super class that s the official name of class which stands after extends keyword are accessible in extended object
in your program you re using extends correctly

17588533
super	extends	super	implements	implements	extends
the super easy and powerful way implements your own switchpreference
just make a class extends switchpreference and then implements override like so by overriding onclick and commenting out deleting super.onclick makes the switchpreference not call callchangelistener object newvalue

17590529
multiplying	multiplication
if you make computations that often multiplying two large numbers the algorithmic difference between the quadratic biginteger multiplication and gmp s that uses karatsuba or toom-cook when the factors are large enough fft for really large numbers would show
however if multiplying is not all that you do if you print out the factorials hence convert them to a string you get hit by the fact that biginteger s tostring method is abominably slow it s roughly quadratic so since the computation of the factorial is altogether quadratic in the length of the result you get no much higher algorithmic complexity but you get a big constant factor on top of the computation

17590590
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
java is case-sensitive but your windows file system may not be
unless you have two classes with the same name case-insensitive it should not be a problem

17599048
intersect	contains
yet an another way with using in and boolean vectors of common elements instead of intersect and setdiff
i take it you actually want to compare two vectors not two lists - a list is an r class that may contains any type of element while vectors always contains elements of just one type hence easier comparison of what is truly equal

17602128
client-side	server-side
from redis-cli now using lua for the example you gave is not that useful what is done with lua on server-side could be easily done on client-side with similar efficiency
and it is actually better to do it on client-side if you can

17603980
ssl	https
it could hijacked on it s way back to you in the redirect link which i ve seen frequently go to landing pages without ssl protection
even if you re 100 https thoughout your site everything s not fully safe

17605268
strtol	atoi
by the way you should consider using more robust solutions for parsing the number like strtol sscanf or the c++ streams - they all can report a parsing error in some way while atoi just returns 0 which isn t distinguishable from a 0 that comes from parsing the string
incidentally atoi is not in the stl by any means - it s just part of the c standard library

17609257
implements	extends
since javax.mail.internet.mimemessage does not implements this interface it cannot be serialized
public class mimemessage extends message implements mimepart consider serializing its content instead

17609488
equals	compareto	comparator	comparable
the javadoc of treeset also says note that the ordering maintained by a set whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if it is to correctly implement the set interface
see comparable or comparator for a precise definition of consistent with equals . this is so because the set interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a treeset instance performs all element comparisons using its compareto or compare method so two elements that are deemed equal by this method are from the standpoint of the set equal

17612553
persistent	transient
note that there is usually no reason to call save or saveorupdate on an attached persistent entity since hibernate dirty-checks the entities and makes persistent the changes automatically
save is supposed to take a transient instance as argument and not a persistent instance

17612553
persistent	transient
save is supposed to take a transient instances as argument and not a persistent instances
the javadoc is not very exhaustive but afaik calling save on a persistent instances has no effect other than cascading the operation to transient instances attached to the entity is such a cascade is configured

17613907
queue	fifo
amqp queue are fifo queue
under high numbers simultaneous message been published there might be some ambiguity which message come first so you may expect that message one and message two might not be in same order in queue as they happened in real world

17614937
build.gradle	gradlew
to be clear you need to edit the uses-sdk in the androidmanifest.xml and the android section particularly minsdkversion and targetsdkversion in the build.gradle file
found the solution to this problem gradlew assemble -info gave me the hint that the manifests have different sdk versions and cannot be merged

17615506
queue	fifo
as noted above things like drawing and i o are prioritized over anything in queue
once the main thread gets around to having time for queue service in the next event loop there s a couple other details that make it not quite as simple as counting on fifo 1 dispatch_async blocks ignore modes

17615887
onresume	onpause
things that i have found onpause onresume onstart oncreate etc all run inside the same thread by printing thread.currentthread.getid which is the main event thread and this single event thread is used for all activities unless you allocated a new process in the manifest
this isn t wholly unexpected but i did wonder if onpause for example might live in a system started thread used to stop the activity

17617309
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc
here s the amended rule every malloc or calloc must be paired with exactly one call to free or realloc
every realloc that does not free memory must be paired with exactly one call to free or realloc

17617309
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc
every realloc that does not free memory must be paired with exactly one call to free or realloc
vice-versa every free must belong to exactly one call made to malloc calloc or realloc . in other words calloc behaves like malloc for the sake of memory allocation

17623484
inline	inlining
but in any case standard does not guarantee inlining your function - even if you mark it as inline
yes you can use inline function members if they are not virtual

17627351
mp4	h.264
pcm audio streams are not compatible with the mp4 container look at the specs and your error message please note the mp4 video container format and the h.264 video stream format are two different things
the mp4 video container may also contain other video stream formats eg

17628094
dictionary	map
code here is the short explanation note map in python can accept any sequence not just list set or dictionary
strings in python are also sequence hence not satisfied with cody hess s statement map cannot accept strings

17629086
implements	extends
in your case classa does not implements interface b
to make that line work you can extends your interfacea with interfaceb interface interfacea extends interfaceb now you are doing in reverse

17630400
allocator	stl
if you d like to use an stl queue container then you can implement your own stl allocator class that gets its memory not from the heap but from shared memory
the allocator class used is part of the stl template declaration

17630400
allocator	stl
your custom shared-memory allocator would then need to know from what shared memory address exactly the memory can be allocated
the allocator support in most stl implementations doesn t play very well with per-instance data of allocators as to my knowledge so you d probably need some global static data in the allocator such that it can know where to get shared memory from

17632317
opera	firefox
you must use webrtc4all windows only to allow this in opera ie and firefox
webrtc is not allowed in firefox yet

17633797
innodb	myisam
innodb is supposed not to lock the table when inserting rows since it uses the mvcc technique
on the other hand myisam locks the entire table when new rows are inserted

17634602
postgresql	mysql
it doesn t apply to postgresql
the databases of mysql are the equivalent of schemas in postgresql

17634794
implements	extends
you could implements an androidtexture easily with a bitmap and use insamplesize
of course it won t be compatible with libgdx textures i couldn t find a way to extends correctly from libgdx textures

17635225
innodb	myisam
i assume you re not using innodb
this is a tangent but i strongly advise you convert your data from myisam to innodb

17638038
octal	hex
if they were wise in the ways of unicode they would write one of these jalape u00f1o jalape u000000f1o jalape xf1o # hex jalape 361o # octal and be happy
in python 2 they would need to prefix all of these with u to use unicode strings instead of byte strings. but alas they have been misled by those who propagate myths misunderstandings and misapprehensions about unicode all over the internet and so they looked up ñ somewhere discovered that it has the double-byte hex value c3b1 in utf-8 and thought they could write this jalape xc3 xb1o this does not do what they think it does

17639543
realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc	strdup	malloc
i understand that if i want to return a string literal or an array from a function i should declare it as static that s not exactly right although declaring it static would fix the problem so would allocating it in the dynamic memory malloc calloc realloc strdup etc
so the answer is yes returning malloc -ed memory from a function is perfectly safe

17639905
gdi	direct2d
however i am not sure whether it relies on gdi or not
it is more or less replacement of textout and similar gdi functions to support properly different scripting systems including aspects like right-to-left reading mixtures of left-to-right and right-to-left arabian with embedded european personal names etc. then there is also directwrite which is supposed to be used together with direct2d

17641256
innodb	myisam
generally you can have as good performance for reading as in myisam in innodb tables - you just can use count without where clause and you always should have a suitable index for where clauses as in innodb table scan will be slower than in myisam
select count without where is bad query for innodb as it does not cache the row count like myisam do

17641256
innodb	myisam
after you remove this specific type of query you can talk about innodb vs myisam read performance
generally writes do not block reads in innodb - is uses mvcc for this

17642585
jrebel	hotswap
jrebel fakereplace and dcevm - those guys do not care about the programming model
but the difference is quite big dcevm patches the jvm and its goal is to provide a complete hotswap solution which it does

17642717
gmail	hotmail
the latter article says this hover effects are not supported in outlook 2007 2010 gmail ios or android
you may still want to include the a hover style for all supporting clients outlook 2000 2003 hotmail apple mail and yahoo

17643212
apache	nginx
as other already suggested nginx + gunicorn or better nginx + uwsgi are better options than apache + mod_python to serve your django app
if you are using modpython yes you have to reload apache every time or your modules will not be reloaded

17644389
intersect	contains
for each existing square s test whether the candidate square intersect s and if so whether it contains s
if s intersect but is not contains then is not a possible replacement

17644389
intersect	contains
if s intersect but is not contains then is not a possible replacement
if s is contains but has the wrong color ditto

17644536
cpython	ironpython	cpython	pypy
because cpython uses reference counting as an implementation detail it will release most garbage objects specifically non-cyclic objects immediately after the last reachable reference to them disappears
this is not a guarantee of the python language and is not true of other python implementations like pypy jython ironpython so relying on it is generally considered to be poor practice

17647818
super	self
next you might consider updating classbuilder reservednames to protect your new boolean reservednames return a list of names that must not be used for variables # self super thiscontext true false nil self super thiscontext #true #false #nil .
the previous answer won t work without further modification to your smalltalk image because boolean overrides new to raise an error new self error you may not create any more booleans - this is two-valued logic if you try boolean subclass #other and then try to add the other keyword to the smalltalk globals as above you will raise an error

17649688
google-chrome	firefox
i used the jqgird 4.5.2 and the google-chrome version is version 28.0.1500.71. the solution list above is not work in my environment.i donot why so i try to log the testcell
5. and it is return false in firefox and false in chrome. finaly i add return false in the cellwidth not care the compare result. and it works

17652027
udp	tcp
both are true udp is not meant to be used for file transfer without implementing checking reordering and retransmission
instead of implementing all these over udp it is much better just to switch to tcp

17652804
mdpi	hdpi
instead i place all my images in mdpi and enlarge them for tablet something like this
i do not put copies of my images in mdpi hdpi xhdpi etc because i have far too many images for this approach and the apk size would be too large

17653423
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc
second we cannot change the size of the array after it has been declared whereas we can use realloc to resize the memory block we ve allocated
and finally vlas are limited both in where they can be used and how large they can be - if you need to allocate a lot of memory at runtime it s better to do it through malloc calloc realloc than vlas

prepare	execute
there are two problems with your approach apart from not using prepare statements
the first is that you trust user input this should be replaced by some kind of escaping of so that one can t execute arbitrary queries in a subselect and cause denial of services or worse if some query allows issuing delete or drop commands

ioexception	filewriter
the following is the throws clause from filewriter file ioexception - if the file exists but is a directory rather than a regular file does not exist but cannot be created or cannot be opened for any other reason the second snippet creates a directory named state because it is using the parent of state state.json and then a file named state.json and therefore uses filewriter on a regular file which succeeds
this is not permissions failure but is a misuse of filewriter

translation	localization
as for hijacking the existing code simply pick up that one that your user are most unlikely to face in real life and put your translation there
if the language got no code then you got rather no other way to hijack the code of other language or write own localization engine or use something existing but not the framework s one

build.gradle	gradlew
first i needed to modifying my build.gradle file to indicate that the correct gradlew plugin to use with my project was version 0.5.0 rather than 0.4
after modifying build.gradle i saw the apk path is not specified for module .. error when attempting to build

uiview	subviews
so i took another look at my nib and noticed that the original subviews i used to create a uicollectionviewcell was a uiview
even though i changed the class to a subclass of uicollectionviewcell xcode still considered it a uiview and hence the issues you see with contentview not catching touch events

17662297
uiview	subviews
even though i changed the class to a subclass of uicollectionviewcell xcode still considered it a uiview and hence the issues you see with contentview not catching touch events
to fix this i redid the nib by making sure to drag a uicollectionviewcell object and moving all the subviews to that

inline	inlining
in short let the compiler decide whether or not to inline and write your code in the most readable way
in reality the inline keyword has less to do with inlining code and more to do with allowing legal violation of the one definition rule

google-chrome	firefox
you can extract that to get at the javascript that makes up the bulk of the plugin cd google-chrome unzip noscript.jar which will yield the main source tree . content noscript abe.g abe.js abelexer.js abeparser.js aspidiocy.js channelreplacement.js clearclickhandler.js clearclickhandlerlegacy.js cookie.js dns.js dom.js externalfilters.js flashidiocy.js https.js lang.js noscript_license.txt placesprefs.js plugins.js policy.js profiler.js removal.js requestwatchdog.js sts.js scriptsurrogate.js strings.js urivalidator.js about.xul antlr.js clearclick.js clearclick.xul frameopterr.xhtml iaui.js noscript.js noscript.xbl noscriptbm.js noscriptbmoverlay.xul noscriptoptions.js noscriptoptions.xul noscriptoverlay.js noscriptoverlay.xul options-mobile.xul overlay-mobile.xul locale skin
the firefox xpi format does not prevent you from simply extracting the contents of the plugin to examine the source code

documentfilter	jtextcomponent
adding the documentfilter
a documentlistener cannot be used to modify the underlying document of a jtextcomponent

17666636
pthreads	fork
pthreads systems do not provide system calls like copyfile function in win32 so do not waste your time searching the copy_file function
if you do not want to reinvent the wheel i think it is a good idea to use fork to create a new process and call execl

17668068
ssl	https
firstly you are using require http for the server so it will not use the ssl options
secondly you are passing the certificate options to express instead of the https server

17669331
octal	decimal
the only tricky bit is that the leading 0 on the number makes vim think the number is in octal not decimal
you can override that by using followed by return to turn off octal and hex

17670162
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
case 2 not using uinavigationcontroller if you are not using uinavigationcontroller then you are required to add a bar and add bar button in the navigation item of bar
uinavigationbar mybar uinavigationbar alloc initwithframe cgrectmake 0 0 320 50

17670420
org.json	gson
iteration cannot be avoided here as org.json and other json parsers as well provide random access to objects but not to their properties collectively as a collection
so you can t query something like all name properties of all contact objects unless you probably get a json parser like gson to unmarshall it that way

17670972
implements	extends
possible solution assuming the following interface definitions i would suggest to drop the implements usermapperinterface abstract class abstractusermapper extends abstractmapper
the problem lies here abstract class abstractusermapper extends abstractmapper implements usermapperinterface as the first step inspect the definition of abstractmapper abstract class abstractmapper implements mapperinterface interface definitions between parent and child classes are transitive so we can merge the first definition abstract class abstractusermapper extends abstractmapper implements usermapperinterface mapperinterface this means that your class needs to implement and this is not possible because method overloading doesn t exist in php

shadowing	named
shadowing if a declaration of a type such as a member variable or a parameter named in a particular scope such as an inner class or a method definition has the same named as another declaration in the enclosing scope then the declaration shadows the declaration of the enclosing scope
you cannot refer to a shadowed declaration by its named alone

the lineargradientbrush mybrush will be used in two places the first is in the tabcontrol as the background the second is within the tabitem template as the background for all items that aren t selected using a trigger

tabcontrol	tabitem
the lineargradientbrush mybrush will be used in two places the first is in the tabcontrol as the background the second is within the tabitem template as the background for all items that aren t selected using a trigger
you could add additional selected styles if required note i ve changed the background of the tabcontrol so it s no longer transparent so it has the shadow

implements	extends
you can implements a list as a simple array but that means that you allocate a continuous memory area which for a large list is not efficient
also arrays are more difficult cu extends you have to reallocate it if you reach its maximum size

17678429
gif	png
this should work another way would be to grab the canvas directly as a pixmap save to clipboard qapplication.clipboard .setpixmap pixmap oh and you shouldn t use gif use png
due to it s proprietary nature gif is usually not available as supported output format

requestfactory	gwt
deploy gwt-servlet.jar if you use gwt-rpc or requestfactory
if you re not using managed dependencies maven etc. you might have to deploy gwt-servlet-deps.jar too which you ll find in the gwt sdk zip bundle

17680145
profiling	debugging
you can reference the image you want as a thumbnail with the og image and og image secure_url alternatively if you wanted to upload the image to facebook so that it goes into the user s album you should check out how-to use the graph api to upload photos to a user s profiling to be more clear you should not be sharing a link directly to the image but rather to a page which has opengraph meta tags one of which should link to the image
use the facebook debugging tool to see how facebook processes the url you re sharing

17681515
clang	llvm
given that you are building your llvm program with gcc it is not clear why you want to install the clang compiler
perhaps you want to use clang but you do not know that code blocks can support the clang compiler or do not know how to configure c b to use clang

17681515
clang	llvm
atropo pasted commands for installing the latest clang and its debugger lldb
but clang doesn t need all the llvm libraries and installing just clang and lldb does not give you all the libraries you need to build your llvm program

17681543
floating-point	fractions
because of imprecision the code cannot fulfill that purpose perfectly but in most cases it s more helpful to regard floating-point numbers as representing actual numerical quantities than to regard them as power-of-two fractions
when using floating-point numbers the relational operators have meanings but their meanings don t necessarily align with how actual numbers behave

17681851
octal	decimal
if the input string begins with 0 radix is eight octal or 10 decimal
exactly which radix is chosen is implementation-dependent. ecmascript 5 specifies that 10 decimal is used but not all browsers support this yet

17688836
equals	compareto
returns a negative integer zero or a positive integer as this object is less than equals to or greater than the specified object
additionally your compareto will throw a classcastexception at runtime if the object isn t an item

google-chrome	firefox
firefox did not support mp3 files but google-chrome did
this worked for me in both google-chrome as well as firefox

spaces	delimiter
spaces is not a good delimiter here because the string representation of the list contains a spaces
for my answer i m using | as the delimiter

17692971
apache	nginx
am not sure of nginx but i have used apache modules like mod_authnz_ldap mod_auth_cas to make sure the requests passing through it are authenticated
this is the sample of my apache config that uses cas for authentication and checks users ldap group for authorization user should belong to developers group whether oauth is a good choice for you really depends on your use case

17693150
mp3	wav
i usually use wav files and mp3 s
the only browser that doesn t support wav is internet explorer 9+ source you can embed multiple file types like so i would also recommend preloading the audio so it will play immediately when you run your document.getelementbyid alert .play

we store the major version in the project s package.json

17699286
strtol	strcpy
i made an answer from my comment following chrono s suggestion buffer overflow vulnerability if you allocate 100 bytes as i o buffer you should tell that to the function filling it or if you discard that buffer before returning unnecessary copy why not simply strtol temp null 16
use fscanf 3 and format strings to parse streams to parse lines like ffffffff8105b4a5 t send_signal i would write something similar to this is a lot more concise than a series of fgets strtoul and strcpy

17700811
trie	tree
there are a couple of blog posts written by the rabbitmq guys covering in detail how they do topic routing in summary though - it seems that as of version 2.4 at least they use a trie - a tree data structure storing each segment of the binding key at the next node
although they re not explicit about the algorithm used to traverse the trie in order to cope with and # for wildcard selections it s necessary to backtrack through the trie to capture all the possible matches

17701419
octal	decimal
so python tries to decode 008200 in octal but 8 isn t valid
assuming you wanted decimal use 8200

awt	swing
awt swing component must be focusable or focus owner in window otherwise never to react to the key events and top-level containers too don t to use keylistener without important reasons three or more keys are presses in the same time e.i

17710062
strtol	atoi
from your own link the atoi function is subsumed by strtol but is retained because it is used extensively in existing code
if the number is not known to be in range strtol should be used because atoi is not required to perform any error checking

17710626
keystore	jks
# create pkcs12 keystore from private key and public certificate. openssl pkcs12 -export -name myservercert -in selfsigned.crt -inkey server.key -out keystore.p12 # convert pkcs12 keystore into a jks keystore keytool -importkeystore -destkeystore mykeystore.jks -srckeystore keystore.p12 -srcstoretype pkcs12 -alias myservercert to verify the contents of the jks you can use this command keytool -list -v -keystore mykeystore.jks if this was not a self-signed certificate you would probably want to follow this step with importing the certificate chain leading up to the trusted ca cert
with your private key and public certificate you need to create a pkcs12 keystore first then convert it into a jks

google-chrome	firefox
result in google-chrome kbd online demo but be aware of that the support isn t that great yet for all browsers
currently it does not work in firefox as far as i can tell i believe you can use svg for firefox instead

17713637
icmp	udp	icmp	tcp
some more general notes on the checking if the point is to check that the machine is reachable online and routable icmp ping from the internet layer should be enough
using higher layer does not tell you more unless you are probing the same port you are willing to communicate to and cost much more overhead at least for tcp maybe it s better for udp but it s still more. later when you get back to this and try to implement more proper check i recommend reading port scanning basics on nmap site

serializable	deserialization
if you do not want to serializable it you mark corresponding field with
in this case the property will be null after deserialization unless custom deserialization is used

17714039
serializable	deserialization
if a serializable class does not explicitly declare a serialversionuid then the serializable runtime will calculate a default serialversionuid value for that class based on various aspects of the class as described in the java tm object serializable specification
however it is strongly recommended that all serializable classes explicitly declare serialversionuid values since the default serialversionuid computation is highly sensitive to class details that may vary depending on compiler implementations and can thus result in unexpected invalidclassexceptions during deserialization

17718219
strcpy	malloc
instead of one strcpy plus two strcat you can also write one call to printf
you need to not malloc does not initialize the buffer to zero so strcat is searching for a null byte in p first and probably not finding one reading past the end of the buffer and thus crashing

17724666
client-side	server-side
even in webforms the client-side ui-bound concerns belong on the pages or on resource files .js files in this case referenced by the pages or by the master page
client-side code shouldn t be unnecessarily obscured by server-side constructs

17724666
client-side	server-side
client-side code shouldn t be unnecessarily obscured by server-side constructs
edit based on a comment you added to this answer if you re looking to conditionally show hide a block of javascript based on server-side logic then you would still do that in the view

factors	matrix
a matrix-like structure whose columns may be of differing types numeric logical factors and character and so on
so if you want a rectangular table like you have shown but with columns of different types you should use a data.frame not a matrix

17732031
lisp	racket	lisp	scheme
in other flavors of lisp it works as the name suggests for example in racket a scheme dialect
in common lisp last is supposed to return a list from the documentation last returns the last n conses not the last n elements of list

17732354
punctuation	words
spelled-out medium and long dates will generally contain other punctuation spaces or words not just the day month and year and not necessarily in the same order returned here
in other words the method allows you to determine what order the day month and year fields are in according to the user s preference which triumphs the user s locale if you ask me

you should see the welcome to android studio window. click import project. locate the project you exported from eclipse expand it select the build.gradle file and click ok. in the following dialog leave use gradlew wrapper selected and click ok
you do not need to specify the gradlew home. note it s possible to import an existing android project to android studio even if you don t generate a gradlew build file from eclipse android studio will successfully build and run projects using an existing ant build file

this will prompt you for the admin passwd

17743772
atof	strtod
the standard says to atof except for the behaviour on error it is equivalent to strtod nptr char null so yours returning 0 has nothing to do with a float not being able to represent it or similar
would you use strtod instead which you probably should when stringstreams are not an option just to be able to report errors then you would likely notice that it stops parsing at the

17748458
mvp	presenter
gwt-platform an mvp framework for gwt also has similar lifecycle
another alternative is to not have your presenter add handlers on its view the view manages its event handlers and notifies the presenter through a contract expressed as an interface the presenter implementing that interface

it compares jboss glassfish and resin and this one compares glassfish 3.1 and jboss 6 7
i could not find a comparison of tomcat with glassfish but yes the new glassfish versions are very light weight and have very good performance

17756486
namedtuple	dictionary
the namedtuple is more practical in this case
i would suggest using namedtuple instead for readability and scalability if you really want to create tons of dictionary you can read it with your code above by accessing dictionary is super fast in python but creating them may not be as fast and efficent

ssl	https
more recent versions of net https have improved how it works with io socket ssl
it also can depend on the version of net https and on whether or not io socket ssl is installed

17756935
ssl	https
it also can depend on the version of net https and on whether or not io socket ssl is installed
net https will prefer io socket ssl which uses net ssleay over net ssl which uses crypt ssl

i don t know the details of the https .herokuapp.com stack but i m not surprised at all that it can service quite a bit more https traffic than a cold ssl endpoint elb
this answer assumes uses the ssl endpoint heroku addon to serve a custom cert

equals	compareto	comparator	comparable
as per the documentation the ordering maintained by a set whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if it is to correctly implement the set interface
see comparable or comparator for a precise definition of consistent with equals. this is so because the set interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a treeset instance performs all element comparisons using its compareto or compare method so two elements that are deemed equal by this method are from the standpoint of the set equal

17758902
equals	compareto	comparator	comparable
in the case of a treeset it handily explains how it does it right at the top of the oracle documentation note that the ordering maintained by a set whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if it is to correctly implement the set interface

if the lookup takes ammortized constant time a hash map then it will be o n otherwise you could do it in o n log d

fink	homebrew
fink install python27 homebrew installs python in usr local cellar with symlinks in usr local bin
brew install python or brew install python --framework to use them you must add sw bin sw lib or opt bin opt lib to the path and change the path of the python executable for me the main problem with fink and macports is that they do not take into account what is already installed and install all in their respective folders which can create real problems in the management of library paths

17760868
macports	homebrew	fink	homebrew
brew install python or brew install python --framework to use them you must add sw bin sw lib or opt bin opt lib to the path and change the path of the python executable for me the main problem with fink and macports is that they do not take into account what is already installed and install all in their respective folder which can create real problems in the management of library paths
the homebrew solution is cleaner in usr local and is based on existing libraries if they are up to date otherwise it installs its own versions of the libraries c the autonomous way the perfect solution is anaconda another scientific distribution with many modules preinstalled installs cleanly into a single directory where you want as users me anaconda doesn t require root privileges doesn t affect other python installs on your system or interfere with os x frameworks switch to from anaconda just by setting path or creating an alias in users me .bash_profile alias anaconda users me anaconda bin python alias anaconda3 users me anaconda envs py33 bin python3 you can install python versions from 2.6.x to 3.3.x innovative package and environment manager for python named conda but you can use pip or easy_install without problem for me now it is the best solution to install virtual environments as users me anaconda envs py33 d the hard way you can compile your own version of python in a classical form results in usr or as a framework

uiview	calayer
every uiview has a calayer backing it all views in uikit are layer-backed which is not normally the case on osx. so at some level they re intermixed whether you want them to be or not
it is perfectly fine to add calayer sublayers to the layer that backs a uiview although that layer will not have all the added functionality that uiview brings to the party

mono	xamarin.android
i ve uninstalled mono using the script found at the end of the mono os x page and i reinstalled version 3.1.2 then i launched xamarin studio i ve created a project added a reference to nunitlite and i ve been able to inspect it
it seems xamarin studio does not like different versions of mono installed side by side i understand that this may be related to the fact that as of 2013-07-20 xamarin products are still being updated to mono 3.0 see for example this thread in the mono mailing list and this page and this blog post on async support for xamarin.android and xamarin.ios update before installing mono 3.1.2 i ve researched if i needed to uninstall previous versions of mono

intersect	contains
but you need to intersect those pages because you need the pages each of which contains all the words not at least one word
so you need to intersect on each iteration instead of updating

17764624
srt	subtitle
the message you get means that your ssa or srt file doesn t specify the playresx and y values
so the vfilter assume a display resolution of 384x288 thats why your subtitle looks so small on a 1280x576 video

17764653
avr	microcontroller
as a consequence some of the register descriptions found on the include files given by avr io.h will not be readily avaiable for the atxmega16a4u
the solution to this problem is to create a new header file containing the necessary definitions for this microcontroller

17765074
multiplying	multiplication
i am not very sure i have understood you algorithm very well but lets say your array is if i get you right you will first compute and and before multiplying by e and f you would divide both numbers by and get and
when you multiply by e and f your new normalizing factor is and the resulting values before the next multiplication are and

17767210
caanimation	calayer
if you review the documentation you will note that caanimationgroup inherits from caanimation and that caanimation can only be assigned to one calayer
it s intent is really to make it easy to create and manage multiple animations you wish to apply to a calayer at the same time not to manager animations for multiple calayer objects

sse	avx
as of gcc 4.8.1 the full list of features supported by __builtin_cpu_supports is cmov mmx popcnt sse sse2 sse3 ssse3 sse4.1 sse4.2 avx and avx2
gcc includes a cpuid interface these don t seem to be well documented but example usage can be found here note that you must use __cpuid_count and not __cpuid when the initial value of ecx matters such as with avx avx2 detection

17770062
backtracking	greedy
note that also because of backtracking the greedy non-greedy options doesn t change if an expression has a match or not but only how big is the match and how much goes to each sub-expression
b the global option this is something totally unrelated to backtracking and simply means that instead of stopping at the first match the search must find all non-overlapping matches

17772267
mdpi	hdpi
also creating one icon for xhdpi and using it for hdpi mdpi and ldpi won t create sharp looking images
it will create drawables where pixels are overlapped on each other giving the feel of a sharper image in hdpi but might not be viewable on either an mdpi or for sure on an ldpi screen

17773184
implements	extends
next we update our normal interface to extends not only graphrepository but our new custom one too the last piece is to actually implements our findcustomernodebysomestrangecriteria method so there s a couple of points to note
we create a separate interface to define any custom methods that have custom implementations as distinct from spring-data compatible findby... methods our customernoderepository interface our main interface extends both the graphrepository and our custom one we implements only the custom method in a class that implements only the custom interface the custom implementation class must by default be called our main interface impl to be picked up by spring data so in this case customnoderepositoryimpl under the covers spring data delivers a proxy implementation of customernoderepository as a merge of the auto-built graphrepository and our class implementing customcustomernoderepository

google-chrome	firefox
edited to add a number of commenters point out that in google-chrome s web console performs numeric addition nan + nan such that actually returns false because it s not true that
firefox s web console gives the same result as google-chrome s but if you run this inside a page it gives the same result as node.js

17775182
uiview	cagradientlayer
and generally when doing this with a uiscrollview unless you want the gradient to scroll with you you make the uiscrollview a subviews of some other uiview and apply this gradient to that container view not the scroll view itself
you can use a cagradientlayer by adding the quartzcore.framework to your project see linking to library or framework

17777630
http	spdy
out of the box putting nginx in front as a reverse proxy is going to give you access logs error logs easy ssl termination spdy support gzip support easy ways to set http headers for certain routes in a couple of lines very fast static asset serving if you re serving off s3 etc
though this isn t that relevant the go http server is very good but you will need to reinvent the wheel to do some of these things which is fine it s not meant to be everything to everyone

invokelater	invokeandwait
without any side effects output is done on edt but is about good practicies to wrap inside invokelater i seen some usages of invokeandwait but only on application start_up use invokelater instead
invokeandwait must be called out of edt carefully with invokeandwait because can freeze whole swing gui locked by exceptions from repaintmanager not in all cases only gui is created relayout refreshed some of methods when repaint is called from nested methods for invokeandwait is required to test on true from isdispatchthread you can to result.set askuser

udp	tcp
i think there is a misunderstanding here about udp
udp is not a connection oriented protocol which means there is no permanent connection like tcp

17784371
udp	tcp
udp is not a connection oriented protocol which means there is no permanent connection like tcp
udp just bind to an address port and waits for packets from everyone

17786306
xsl-fo	xslt
so you simply need to add further templates to transform the other elements as needed and to create a valid xsl-fo document if you need help on that i suggest you ask a new question outlining which fo structure you want for the input elements once they have been parsed how you want to transform those node elements and how those html elements then hopefully someone who is more fluent with xsl-fo than i am can help out
the snippet you have posted is not even well-formed xml the myobject start tag lacks a so instead of what you have posted you need as for processing that with a commercial version of saxon 9 where xslt has access to the extension function saxon parse or the xslt xpath 3.0 parse-xml i think it should work but you need to use it twice once one the value of the objectinformation attribute of the myobject element then on the value of the node3 element so code would do to give you a more complete example when i apply the stylesheet to the input with saxon 9.1.0.8 latest open source version of saxon 9 to support saxon parse i get the result i realize that is not a complete and valid xsl-fo document but it shows that the templates for the elements that are escaped in the input and then parsed via saxon parse are called

17788917
spaces	linefeed
it s likely not a spaces tab kind of issue based on your screen shot
so it s almost certainly either white spaces at the end of the line like extra spaces or the ever so much more likely cr linefeed issue with using windows

17789028
setinterval	settimeout
setinterval does not wait which makes simuntaneos generate multiple events which causes the slowness
try settimeout this way settimeout waiting to finish the request to invoke a new request

17790443
super	implements
of course a lot of improvements and generalisation why not a super class named eloquentapi... are needed but you can see the idea
if the job is well done with methods all find save and few others implements you could switch between a database or a web service implementations easily

17791250
jar	war
it does not have any support for creating a jar war zip that you can deploy
it does not require play to be installed on the machine so it will work with a ci server although you need to get the plugin jar on to the ci machine for example using a local maven repository like nexus

17793164
google-chrome	firefox
onconnection is not part of the interface in the latest standard so that s probably why it s not implemented in google-chrome
the code in firefox lists onconnection as a mozilla extension

17793463
punctuation	words
the universal index does index punctuation but only for node values not for words
the term lists for words query do not include punctuation because the tokenizer defines words as strings that do not contain whitespace or punctuation

17793463
punctuation	words
however for most languages that feature still does not allow words to include punctuation
it would help to know more about the application domain to understand exactly why the searches are so sensitive to punctuation

freebsd	linux
oracle themselves do not support freebsd
there are ports of their linux client-libraries however that are made to work on the os databases oracle8-client databases oracle7-client unfortunately the above two are currently only working on i386 but you may be able to use the same technique as the port s author to massage the x86_64 linux binaries to work under freebsd amd64

ostream	ostringstream
for those interested in having the actual question answered specific to ostream try this
the question was on ostream to string not ostringstream to string

17798937
ssl	https
to work around that use the server s onconnect event to manually turn off ssl if the connection is not on port 443 eg if you are using indy 10 then that bug was fixed so all client connections will have ssl disabled by default so you can either use the onconnect event to turn on ssl if the connection is on port 443 eg preferred use the new tidhttpserver.onquerysslport event to tell the server which port should use ssl or not eg
yes you can use a single tidhttpserver for both http and https

17800170
inline	inlining
this is done with a combination of writing the inline or constexpr which are implicitly inline keyword before the function definition to override the one-definition rule which states that two files cannot include the same symbol during compilation due to linker errors
this leads to excessive inlining despite the fact that the inline keyword does not actually force inlining

17800170
inline	inlining
this leads to excessive inlining despite the fact that the inline keyword does not actually force inlining
classes and their methods are also implicitly inline if you define them in the header so having to put the keyword on those is unnecessary

17801428
google-chrome	firefox
until widespread support arrives this can be faked via image sprites and background-position or opacity. at this time i have found that nobody actually supports gradients google-chrome 17 firefox 12 ie9
only google-chrome supports background-image that s why it doesn t work in firefox for me

17802021
serializable	deserialization
this is not possible at least not using the native serializable libraries that both frameworks provide as stated in this previous so post
if you want to achieve cross language serializable deserialization you could resort to xml xstream for java xstream-dot-net for c# or wox wox is an xml serializer for java and c# objects

17803050
listview	gridview
a few ideas to get you started instead of using listview take a look at gridview
listview does not support more than one column you have to support that manually and gridview was introduced for this purpose

17806425
super	extends
when using inheritance a class inheriting from another subtype must call the constructor of the class it extends super type
when a type hierarchy exists meaning several classes extends from each other in a chain the calls to the super constructor propagate to the first class in chain that does not inherit from another class ignoring object

super	extends
when a type hierarchy exists meaning several classes extends from each other in a chain the calls to the super constructor propagate to the first class in chain that does not inherit from another class ignoring object
the super class constructors of a subtype must be called prior to the execution of the subtype s constructor since it may rely upon fields or methods in the super types

this stops raphael moving the background image in svg mode
in vml mode ie8 has a bug whereby even though the code moves the element this isn t updated on the screen until a redraw is forced

17808939
svg	vml
it s ugly in two ways for svg it relies on hacking raphael core code but only a small hack for vml it relies on an internet explorer redraw bug and will fail if your code causes a redraw but you can get relative positions so long as your code doesn t trigger an ie redraw by re-setting the element s fill
ideally there would be a way of doing this that works robustly in ie vml rather than relying on a bug

17808939
svg	vml
the behaviour described above isn t an svg default it s a raphael feature defined in the updateposition function which appears to be designed to make raphael svg elements behaviour match how vml elements would behave if internet explorer wasn t a bundle of bugs held together with bugs
note that the updateposition function is only called in svg mode - vml fills are supposed to behave this way by default but don t reliably because of the redraw bug described in the above linked question...

17810073
mp3	flac	wav	flac
even if mp3 is not supported natively with java you should take a look at lame which is a cli mp3 codec very easy to use with java create a process object with the parameters you wants... usage lame.exe -v2 file.wav file.mp3 or from a wav buffer if your application records the voice itself lame.exe -v2 - file.mp3
you will not be able to tune the flac codec and it s seams overkill to use it for voice recording

17810316
sqoop	hadoop
from hortonworks sqoop teradata connector option teradata.db.input.target.database does not work
the teradata hadoop connector used by sqoop connector uses incorrect hive database name while loading rows into hive tables

17810764
implements	extends
in java an abstract class can implements an interface
an interface cannot extends an abstract class

17811846
entity-relationship	diagram
there may be some other open source tools that support entity-relationship diagram but i am not familiar with them
i am not aware of any tools offered by teradata that support the generation of entity-relationship diagram

17811846
entity-relationship	diagram
i am not aware of any tools offered by teradata that support the generation of entity-relationship diagram
you will need to consider tools such as erwin from computer associates or entity-relationship studio from embarcadero

17811935
dictionary	map
it looks like you re aiming in that direction with your nested dictionary structure but a hash map isn t necessarily the most space-efficient store for this you don t mention any requirement for lookup performance
for example consider storing it as nested lists with a 1-tuple to distinguish the leaf value although we can probably come up with something cleaner with average length 3 this should be pretty shallow and hopefully there is less slack at each level using a list instead of a dictionary

17812189
serializable	deserialization
i think your problem is not with serializable itself but with synchronization
i can see few possible solutions serializable on closing and deserialization on opening your app

17812592
division	modulo
that requirement guarantees that the division algorithm terminates
in a general integral domain you can have a canonical choice of remainders modulo any fixed ring element but the canonical remainder need not be smaller in any meaningful way so an attempt to use the division algorithm need not terminate

17813954
plone	buildout
large python projects such as plone and django use buildout see for a good blog post describing it
one way not the only one to organize a large application is to use a combination of virtualenv and buildout

17814075
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
if you re not using qmainwindow call the qgraphicsview function show
note that you also need to add objects to the qgraphicsscene in order to see something

17816184
implements	extends
extends would normally work but in this case it does not due to how the url_helpers method is implements
from actionpack lib action_dispatch routing route_set.rb source the included block containing the routes.install_helpers self call indicates that you will need to include the module in order to get the methods install so extends is out

17820894
implements	extends
you will have to implements this yourself you cannot extends already implements behaviour
you can however force yourself or anyone else to implements various methods that is part one now you do not want to access getids and getnames via an enum instance itself but you want to access them via the class as a static function

17823042
equals	gethashcode
you need to override equals object and have it call equals baseid after checking that the object being compared is indeed of type baseid
in the second case you re right there probably isn t a need to override gethashcode since the object doesn t define any new fields or do anything that changes the meaning of equals

17823055
uiview	subviews
see apple s uiview doco a hidden view disappears from its window and does not receive input events
it remains in its superview s list of subviews however and participates in autoresizing as usual

17823236
multiplying	division	multiplying	multiplication
the excuse is arguably that at the time the various multiplying instructions were added to the instruction set of the cpu 8086 vintage i think that the existing instruction didn t have any obvious places to put multiplying where it could share the general decoding scheme available to other instructions mov add xor etc that there were not a lot of available transistors to do fancy decoding schemes to enable some other way to encode general operands and that any transistors that were available were better dedicated to the multiplication division logic
finally the multiplying instruction is needed rather less often than the general instructions mov add xor and so the effort to move the operands into place results from fixed places doesn t cause a lot of code bloat or impact performance much

17824690
required	placeholder
this method has the disadvantages of not immediately fixing broken images lots of time may be spent loading other large images before finally the broken images will be fixed and of not working for images which may be added to the page later after the initial loading event happens images loaded later from ajax data but it has the advantage of working for images which are loaded into the page by various mechanisms like your hmtlbuilder string that would required complete re-programming to allow images to individually have error handlers assigned
the ideal way to solve this problem which doesn t exist would be for browsers to bubble the image error event into a general document error event which could be monitored by a single event handler checking to see if the source of the error event was an img element and if so then checking the kind of error and replacing an image not found with the desired placeholder

17825426
realloc	malloc
you malloc ed and realloc ed the s pointer in the hstring structure objects but never free them
i noticed the constructor was not called when you do a malloc

17826484
persistent	transient
second a pojo can be either persistent your hibernate session is aware of the object and will save changes to the database when your transaction gets fflush or closed or transient hibernate doesn t know anything about this object and won t save changes to the database
calling save makes a transient object persistent and has no effect on a pojo that s already persistent

17826484
persistent	transient
your call to flush just before will ensure that any changes that have already been made get persistent but will do nothing to ensure that future changes do. it also means that anytime hibernate needs to retrieve any of those objects it has to go all the way back to the database instead of pulling them from the session s cache which is inefficient
if you really wanted to use the approach you ve got here and i ve done it occasionally such as in situations where i wanted to end up with many objects persistent but couldn t reasonably construct a new object for each so i reused the same object changing its properties while it s transient and not tracking those changes and then briefly making it persistent so it ll write the new object to the database the method you d probably want to use is the evict method which lets you remove just one hibernate object from the cache

17828652
prepare	execute
at first try to execute your procedure as simple statement not as prepare statement
this will look like this way you will see if it is problem with prepare statement

17829093
prepare	execute
being able to use prepare statements and bind variables doesn t affect this query but knowing how to use them will become more important later
execute the query then loop through the results

17829167
client-side	server-side
first of all those are two completely different approaches techniques you are talking about here whereas the first on is part of the js sdk and therefor client-side the second one using the php sdk works server-side
while you can recognize the user server-side as long as a cookie for them is set under your domain the php sdk getuser method is not able to recognize a recurring visit by a user once after those cookies are gone

17830965
prng	random
from the java doc for securerandom many securerandom implementations are in the form of a pseudo-random number generator prng which means they use a deterministic algorithm to produce a pseudo-random sequence from a true random seed. other implementations may produce true random numbers and yet others may use a combination of both techniques
note that securerandom does not guarantee true random numbers either

17834981
clang	llvm
note that this has to be done in clang which knows about #pragma
llvm itself knows nothing about them - #pragma are not part of the llvm ir

17838332
floating-point	fractions
there s probably a reasonable way to do the latter by looking for the unique decimal fractions whose nearest approximation in the given floating-point type is the given binary floating-point number
the problem isn t really solvable as stated since floating-point is typically represented in binary not in decimal

17839439
scheme	rebol
the rebol http scheme really isn t designed with this in mind it s geared toward reading content the way you would in a browser not services over http
in saying that you can hack the protocol to subvert how rebol 2 handles different response codes the caveat here is that the http protocol has to have been initiated any http port opened read

17839439
scheme	rebol
i have a rest protocol two versions one that uses curl and one that uses a customised http scheme that works but isn t as good
though are for rebol 2

17839571
equals	gethashcode
it is generally not good for classes to have more than one overridable virtual or abstract equals method
either have derived classes override equals object themselves or else have a sealed base implementation of equals object and possibly gethashcode chain to an abstract or virtual equals baseid and possibly getderivedhashcode

17842145
queue	fifo
see rabbitmq broker semantics messages can be returned to the queue using amqp methods that feature a requeue parameter basic.recover basic.reject and basic.nack or due to a channel closing while holding unacknowledged messages
edit in response to your comment time to dive a little deeper into the amqp specification then perhaps 3.1.4 message queues a message queue is a named fifo buffer that holds message on behalf of a set of consumer applications. applications can freely create share use and destroy message queues within the limits of their authority. note that in the presence of multiple readers from a queue or client transactions or use of priority fields or use of message selectors or implementation-specific delivery optimisations the queue may not exhibit true fifo characteristics

17842145
queue	fifo

the only way to guarantee fifo is to have just one consumer connected to a queue

17844044
ssl	https
for privacy security you ll want to use mod_session_crypto and ssl if that s possible
as you note you will not need encryption to be end to end https from client to outward facing front-end and between the reverse proxy and back-end applications but if outside connections are https and you keep session information on the server using mod_session_dbd as another response noted using encrypted storage you can avoid obvious threats inherent in sharing user session information across servers

17845091
gedit	sublimetext
here is how i fixed on my setup edit the bash file launchers i m not sure which one is the right one for you so edit both to be safe gedit usr bin sublime-text gedit usr bin subl update the location
this is what i experienced i had also installed sublimetext with the webup8team ppa

17845814
ssl	https
as vladtheimpala pointed out the issue is with ssl
though i included https in the uri string the http request was not in fact using ssl

17845814
ssl	https
though i included https in the uri string the http request was not in fact using ssl
here s the code where i explicitly set the http request to use ssl works like a charm

17846150
super	implements
there is no need to call super unless you are inheriting from something in which case you can delegate a method call to a parent or sibling using it - but you aren t doing that
get_books can be implements as nothing more than likewise for report_all_books

17846744
google-chrome	firefox
please bear in mind that the html5 is not supported by many browsers really just google-chrome and ie10 note not firefox
using google-chrome i was restricted from posting the form but on many other browsers you won t be

17849465
super	implements
note that the .equals method belongs to class object super class of all classes
you need to override it as per you class requirement but for string it is already implements and it checks whether two strings have the same value or not

17849987
oncreate	findviewbyid
this will be called between oncreate bundle and onactivitycreated bundle
not exactly sure what you re going for here but here are some suggestions have your global active object live in the main activity and call getactivity .someobject from your fragments findviewbyid will search down the view hierarchy until it finds the first instance of r.id.display your fragment views won t be available until you commit them with a fragment transaction this means that their views also won t be available until that time you are scoping findviewbyid to some view v by calling v.findviewbyid if you are paging through fragments perhaps try setting your active view in the fragment s onresume method the fragment s oncreateview method is only called once

17852453
margin	text-align
right 0 and margin 0 auto to your class
do something like the following fiddle the outer element has text-align center the gridspan element has display inline-block not absolutely positioned the inner element with the blue progress needs to be absolutely positioned so as not to be effected by the text-align center

17855431
union	distinct
but you don t need an union query for this
you are using a union query that will return distinct values and the order of the returned rows is not guaranteed

17855653
junit	testng
another approach is to use testframeworks which enables dependancy-management. therefore have a look at testng another very good java test-framework or jexample builds on junit visit akuhn blog 2008 jexample-quickstart for a short introduction
junit does not guarantee an order running as you mentioned yourself

17855875
super	implements
double is not a super type of number so you cannot pass in a
according to the documents readonlydoubleproperty implements which have a method so you need to pass in a where t is a super type of number or number itself

17858071
multiplying	multiplication
when you multiplying an int by an int the result is also an int so your result is being truncated
obviously the argument to setrepeating is a long but that doesn t mean the compiler will fix this for you - your multiplication will still be truncated

17858216
fileinputstream	filechannel
so i can choose fileinputstream instead of randomaccessfile which also returns a filechannel
but i cannot get filelength from fileinputstream which is a required input for defaultfileregion

17860782
ienumerable	icollection
here i overcommed this problem by simply stating that usergroups will be iqueriable instead of ienumerable
now i cannot do that because ef won t map it it has to be icollection

17861965
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
notice how your appdelegate is a subclass of uiresponder not uiviewcontroller instead create and or connect your navigation controller to a uiviewcontroller subclass - then you can make calls like this from your subclass to create and setup a navigation controller follow these steps may vary if you aren t using storyboards
create a new uinavigationcontroller obj-c subclass

17862258
oncreate	setcontentview
in oncreate at least before trying to call findviewbyid .. i bet your imageview is null because it could not find the resource
you have to call setcontentview r.layout.main

17862561
vb6	vba
so it s the leg up you get from a familiar syntax versus the knock back you could get from writing vb6 in .net.
it will be a bit of a step from vba vb6 to vb.net but there s no technical reason not to do it

17862561
vb.net	vb6	vb6	vba
it will be a bit of a step from vba vb6 to vb.net but there s no technical reason not to do it
based on my own thankfully limited experience of vb6 i d say you might be better off switching to c#

17862857
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
brian mentioned that ios6 gives the rotation control to the rootviewcontroller - this could not only be a uinavigationcontroller as mentioned but also a uitabbarcontroller which it was for me
my structure looks like this uitabbarcontroller uinavigationcontroller uiviewcontrollers .

17866975
setinterval	settimeout
you ll want to use setinterval not settimeout
setinterval will execute a function wait n milliseconds then execute it again

17869265
ssl	https
run the app through iis not iis express - this just makes ssl etc easier
ensure the site has a https binding set up install the identity and access tool for vs2012 right click your project to select the identity and access tool

17872115
hex	binary
windows files have their lines terminated with cr-lf hex 0d0a while unix just uses a single lf hex 0a
windows c stdio will map a crlf onto a single lf n for files not opened in binary mode

17875772
google-chrome	firefox
but the string format that you used is not supported in firefox take a look at the mdn documentation redirectslug javascript 2freference 2fglobal_objects 2fdate 2fparse i don t know why google-chrome accepts this format i couldn t manage to find the official docs but it s not cross-browser safe i would suggest to use new date year month date hours minutes seconds ms that is standard and cross-browser safe hope this helps
in firefox when you call new date string the static method date.parse string is called

17876603
qthread	qobject
if this is not your intention you might want to go back to good old qthread and use it instead
maybe you could split your logic in class foo into two the hoster qrunnable with a qeventloop and a worker qobject which you create on the worker thread in run before calling qeventloop exec method

17882488
viewdidload	viewdidappear
viewdidload is called lazily when first access of controller.view so by that time the frame is not set yet
this means that you can not rely on the frame bounds sizes at this point because it will only contain a default value although in many cases it will be correct . in viewdidappear the frame is usually set although if your parent controller is setting any animation you could also have a temporal frame state instead of the final one but it is not usual as by convention this method is called when the view is already displayed

17888647
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
it allows one uiviewcontroller and its views to be displayed in a container of your desired size
similar to a uitabbarcontroller which displays its child view controllers in a specified part of the screen not the whole screen

17889601
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu seems to make doxygen depend on all possible packages including latex but these are mostly optional and not needed for html output.
i suggest to try the linux binaries or sources from the official doxygen site

17889631
cpython	ironpython
in cpython this happens pretty much immediately after that line is executed because the file is never assigned to a variable
in other pythons such as jython or ironpython this may not happen right away or at all though all open files are always closed when the process exits

17889651
svg	vml
these icons are not always svg they are vml in ie6-ie8
first step is creating svg file with path s in it for every shape of an icon in any vector software like for ex

17890703
jruby	mri
ruby language implementation it could be different between mri rubinus jruby
tho i am not sure if the parallel gem support rubinus and jruby

17891208
uilabel	uitextview	uilabel	nsstring
uilabel does not have any inherent padding applied
uitextview has padding that nsstring s drawing methods do not have

17895056
super	implements
do you want to override methods from each of these super classes
if you don t implements them they may simply not be called but you may not get desired functionality

17895883
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc
no you can t reallocate elements like this realloc need an addressees that is returned by malloc calloc functions so what you can do is remove first 10 numbers from array then call reallocate
in many implementations a shrink-action call via realloc result in the change of the reserved size in the heap and wouldn t move memory

17898429
udp	tcp
at 50 ms the udp ping roundtrip was down to around 80 ms using 3g remember this was originally around 2000 ms
tcp also improved but not as much as udp

17898483
wordpress	joomla
add wp-admin so the url is afair to check if site is based on joomla add administrator your site uses neither wordpress nor joomla or this multilanguage plugin changes default login url
i m not sure how it works with multilanguage plugin but the easiest way to check if site is based on wordpress is to add wp-admin to site s url

17899092
rational-numbers	base	rational-numbers	fractions	base	fractions
a rational-numbers will become a repeating decimal if the denominator contains a prime factor that isn t among the ones in the base s prime factor list 2 and 5 a rational-numbers has an infinitely repeating sequence of finite length less than the value of the fully reduced fractions s denominator if the reduced fractions s denominator contains a prime factor that is not a factor of the base
the repeating sequence is preceded after the radix point by a transient of finite length if the reduced fractions also shares a prime factor with the base

17899718
gtk	clutter
if you want proper integration in a windowing system you should use clutter-gtk and embed a clutterstage into a gtk application
you cannot do this from clutter the windowing system api inside clutter only allows basic operations

17900674
haskell	sml	haskell	ocaml
but in practice it diverges enough that i think most people consider haskell inspired by ml but not an ml mostly because haskell is pure and lazy while ml has historically been impure and strict
furthermore the ml module system in both sml and ocaml differs quite a bit from haskell s and neither of the mls have typeclasses

17900730
implements	extends
in some cases the implements class is private and may change from run to run depending on the situation so it is not always possible
if you cannot identify the correct concrete image subclass to extends i suggest considering composition

17901074
inline	inlining
because he inline the definition of foobar in main then noticed that it could float the expression expensive 5 out of the call to part
if we disable inlining for foobar and foobar or alternatively not use -o it does not work any more so while ghc can in some situations do the right thing you should always check if it is the case if you want to rely on it

17901113
g++	gcc
g++ allows c99-style compound literals it is interesting that gcc tested gcc 4.7.1 on mac os x 10.8.4 accepts the compound literal notation even with stringent warnings but this is a gcc g++ extension over standard c++ g++ -o3 -g -wall -wextra -c x91.cpp code you have to provoke g++ fairly hard to get it to complain c++ 2011 and list initialization or extended initializer lists i think section 8.5 initializers in general and 8.5.4 list-initialization in particular mean that you can in fact write what you originally had if your class structure in the example has the appropriate support
consider this minor variant on your original code this code compiles ok under g++ subject to warnings about compound literals not being part of standard c++ when compiled as shown we can debate the wisdom of the use of strncpy that is tangential to the subject under discussion

17902974
implements	extends
however i want to implements the example from the link but i have a problem with generating a videos.videoscontroller and passing that to the #each iterator altough it s not the recomended way but to achieve what you are trying to do with your videoscontroller you should create an instance rather then extends
this would look something like this then you can use it like this to iterate over two things to note here we are not extends the arraycontroller but instead creating directly an instance of it and we are also using lower case videoscontroller to point out that it s an instance

17905355
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
at the moment only google-chrome and firefox support enough of the webrtc apis to make video chatting a possibility
very soon though opera will likely join the mix but no one s sure yet whether webrtc will be added to ie11 or not and apple seems to have no intention of adding webrtc to safari any time soon because they have their own proprietary technology for that

17906145
aggregate-functions	sum
you should use having clause if you want to work with aggregate-functions like sum
the having clause was added to sql because the where keyword could not be used with aggregate-functions

17906502
google-chrome	firefox
please go through this article.well explained and similar. only constraint is ie does not support this and older versions of firefox google-chrome also has some issues
you can also use cors instead of jsonp works with firefox google-chrome safari. cors is less troublesome to setup and requires only a filter in server-side

17908970
richtextbox	textblock
events began to work it is necessary to add blockuicontainer with isdocumentenabled property is set to true in richtextbox otherwise the event will not working altogether
in general i do not understand why you need it textblock inside richtextbox

17911598
shadowing	named
apparently jslint developers definition of shadowing is not what you expect
for them hiding a variable named coming from a closure is not shadowing

17912109
crfsuite	crf++
they perfectly work on a reasonable amount of data but when my dataset increased to be more than 100 000 sentences crf++ did not manage to deal with it and suddenly stopped working. look at the following link crfsuite - crf benchmark test there is a comparison between many crf software in some criteria
crfsuite is faster than crf++ and it can deal with a huge training data

17912389
inline	inlining
it would be harder messier for tools like valgrind to work and you could not arrange to use a debugging version of the functions if their code is expanded inline
the main thing stopping the inlining of malloc et al is their complexity and the obvious fact that no inline definition of the function is provided

17914134
interpolation	splines
again from the documentation we find so s determines how close the interpolation curve must come to the data points in the least squares sense
if we set the value very large then the splines does not need to come near the data points

17915763
nhibernate	queryover
nhibernate might be capable of inferring the entity type but you have to get the code to compile first
- the signature for the queryover function is as follows note that a is not the same type as a

17917381
octal	decimal
i d also advise you not to use octal literals
the problem is before the multiplication - it s here that s an octal literal with decimal value 46

17918387
innodb	myisam
innodb implements transactions foreign keys and relationship constraints myisam does not
myiasm does not support the rollback and commit you need to use the innodb for that

17918387
innodb	myisam
you will find better crash recovery in innodb
however it doesn t have fulltext search indexes as does myisam

17918387
innodb	myisam
innodb has better crash recovery
myisam has fulltext search indexes innodb doesn t

17919169
gridview	sqldatasource
this is because when we click delete button the gridview will accordingly pass on this to sqldatasource with correct parameters
simply set the delete command of this datasource control as now you also need to correct your gridview markup since you require that delete button will delete a row and you have assigned the gridview1_rowdeleted function as a event handler to onrowcommand which really doesn t makes any sense

17920714
sudo	passwd
two problems 1. you told sudo -u testuser -h ... what s mean run the command as testuser and he doesn t has permissions to write into the usr local therefore you getting permission denied
when you remove the -u testuser the command will run as root as default without passwd for the testuser and will create the directory

17920897
profiling	debugging
maven does not like it when a build profiling being active produces a different non-equivalent artifact
maven can probably live with the release profiling producing a version of the artifact with javascript minified and perhaps debugging info stripped though it would be better if it could be avoided .

17922113
comparator	comparable	implements	extends
but i can tell you why comparator delayed does not implements comparator object when you extends scheduledfuture by using scheduledfuture you re using a raw type which means that all occurances of generics are pretty much ignored in your class
that means that you re now implementing comparable and no longer which in turn means that you need to implements comparator object the erasure of but you implements comparator delayed

17922191
namedtuple	dictionary
you are also slicing the row not the csv file you seem to be under the impression that slicing line will result only 6 namedtuple objects
in any case you probably want to use csv.dictreader instead to go straight to dictionary for your template formatting

17923276
freebsd	solaris
this should also work on freebsd not documented but apparent from the kernel source although on that os ipcs uses sysctl to read the values of
on solaris ipcs uses to obtain the number of segments ids then calls to obtain the list of actual ids and then uses shmctl id ipc_stat ... to obtain information on each segment

17923325
opera	google-chrome
a piece of code that caused problems tried to detect opera old and opera next opera|opr .test navigator.useragent conclusion opera migration was made very well nothing should break in your projects
do not detect opera next and simply treat it as usual google-chrome

17925300
g++	gcc
yet compilers often provide additional guarantees for the union case and all compilers i know of vs g++ clang++ xlc_r intel solaris cc guarantee that you can read out of an union through an inactive member and that it will produce a value with exactly the same bits set as those that were written through the active member
this is particularly important with high optimizations when reading from network the implementation in 1 is sanctioned by all compilers i know gcc clang vs sun ibm hp while the implementation in 2 is not and will fail horribly in some of them when aggressive optimizations are used

17926832
filewriter	bufferedwriter
filewriter has its own schedule of when flushing happens i m not entirely sure but i think the buffer size is the default defined in streamencoder which is 8192
if looking at the java source for any of the bufferedwriter s write methods you ll see flushbuffer method calls which in turn calls out.write ...

shadowing	named
let creates a method called my_method but by assigning to a value called my_method first you re shadowing the method with a nil local variable
you should use a different variable named there on the first non-comment line of it doesn t work

google-chrome	firefox
for example jsfiddle edit this seems to be a rendering issue in google-chrome opacity is shown as 0 in the google-chrome inspector and this bug doesn t exist in firefox
one solution seems to be setting the -webkit-backface-visibility css property to hidden for the tooltip which solves the issue in google-chrome

implements	extends
if this is not an option than you need to implements your own linkfield control inherited from datacontrolfield or use itemtemplate as it was suggested by nitin
if you want to use hyperlinkfield you need to extends datasource object returned by getdata method with value that comes with pagerequested query string parameter

17934968
postorder	inorder
since the only two choices that make any sense would be to visit the current node first which is pre-order or last which is postorder
therefore inorder for a general tree doesn t really make much sense

17938492
thin	webrick
i had the same issue and was able to solve it by installing and using thin as my local webserver
i dug into sinatra source and see that it tries to guess what server to use when running in order which you can see via irb normally sinatra would fall back to webrick but mechanize has a module named http so it tries to use that as a server which doesn t work of course

17943420
sudo	passwd
this is the solution by david kastrup from sudo command with minibuffer passwd prompt gnu.emacs.help
note you still shouldn t call aptitude directly otherwise the subprocess will be there forever until you send sudo pkill aptitude

17949310
prepare	execute
if you have to carry a big number of data and prepare all data before the loading time will increase and your device runs out of memory
cellforrowatindexpath is called each time a cell is shown or changed by scrolling so the source execute here should not be too much but it depends on your data

17949657
d3.js	raphael
raphael supports older versions of ie whereas d3.js is based on current web standards
i wouldn t even think about library other than d3.js if my app is data driven

17950154
paperclip	fog
edit in one of my projects i use paperclip with fog gem and this works well
i think that s because bucket should be an option passed to paperclip not to s3

17950934
prepare	execute
the prepare statement concept is not specific to java it is a database concept
precompiling of statement means when you execute a sql query database server will prepare a execution plan before executing the actual query this execution plan will be cached at database server for further execution

17951174
hex	binary
using cast will not work select cast cast max timestamp as varbinary 8 as varchar 50 as lastts from users will treat the binary data as characters rather than hex values returning an empty string
reverse it to convert the stored hex string back to a timestamp select cast convert varbinary 50 0x000000000086862c 1 as timestamp note any code is released into the public domain

17952140
jlist	jtable
a jlist renderer can draw a checkbox but jlist does not support a cell editor
instead consider a one-column jtable

17956837
armadillo	lapack
since where equality is only approximate due to rounding errors solving for x in requires to permute rows of b and performing forward and back substitution due to the lack of a true triangular solver in armadillo and a fast way to perform row permutation this procedure will not be very efficient with respect to a direct call to the relevant computational lapack subroutines
general advice is to avoid explicit lu decomposition in higher level libraries like armadillo

17959805
cfstring	nsstring
the cfstring is created +1 retain count autoreleased and returned for the client
the cast to nsstring does not affect the retain count

17960774
uiview	calayer
1 option for this is to create a uiview subclass that uses this uiview private method to get an iosurface for a target view and then using a cadisplaylink once per second get and draw the surface
another option which may work i m not sure as i don t know your setup or desired effect is possibly just to use a careplicatorlayer which displays a mirror of a calayer using the same backing store very fast and efficient + public stable api

17961793
comparator	comparable
i also do not understand what the comparator inconsistent with equals even means
as per the contract of the comparable interface

17963324
decimal	ieee
it s not a decimal
in xpath 1.0 it s an ieee double-precision floating point number in xpath 2.0 it s an integer

17963547
innodb	myisam
thus is you need any acid features use innodb
myisam is does not support a lot of things like foreign key constraints for example

17963668
ssl	https
the ssl certificate should not be self-signed but signed by a trust ca like verisign. to configure ssl certificate on websphere application server here s the doc for you
to use https you need to configure your ssl certificate on your was server

17964364
google-chrome	firefox
if the favicon is a png type image it ll not work in older versions of google-chrome
however it ll work just fine in firefox

17965429
mapr	cloudera
imho m3 is not gonna give you huge advantages over apache cdh as some of the catchy mapr features are not present in m3 free edition like nfs-ha snapshots etc
being the first one cloudera definitely has an extra edge in terms of experience and a solid customer base

17970696
prepare	execute
placeholders as necessary sqlite3_step to execute the sql and or step through the results sqlite3_column to retrieve the columns of data as necessary sqlite3_finalize to complete close the prepare sql statement sqlite3_close to close the database bottom line your sqlite3_open call is not matched with a single sqlite3_close statement at the end but you have an extraneous sqlite3_close in the middle of your code
also each sqlite3_prepare_v2 must have its own sqlite3_finalize you only use sqlite3_reset if you want to reset a prepare statement so you can bind it with new values and step through it again

17974075
jlist	jtable
a jlist renderer can draw a checkbox but jlist does not support a cell editor
instead consider a one-column jtable

17974963
super	extends
you can remove override and it will work but by that you are saying this method doesn t exist in your super class
verify the class you perhaps extends

17976488
rvm	bundler
if you are not using rvm maybe you will not need to require rvm capistrano or the rvm-capistrano gem
adding following to deploy.rb require bundler capistrano require rvm capistrano before deploy assets precompile bundle install and following to capfile load deploy assets and following to gemfile gem rvm-capistrano resolved the issue for me

17977453
udp	tcp
i am not aware of a jms implementation which uses udp including reliability
so you cannot really address it since jms uses tcp features for reliable and in order packety delivery

17982097
macports	homebrew
this is what homebrew told me to move upon installation homebrew uninstall move macports undo when installing homebrew it tells you to move macports out of local with sudo mv opt local macports i started getting errors about libssl.1.0.0 not being loaded
after moving macports back the errors went away

17983475
uiview	subviews
simply uiviewcontroller is not your view it s your controller think of the uiviewcontroller as a puppeteer and the uiview as the puppet
uiviewcontroller controls what is displayed on the uiview uiview s main purpose is to contain subviews

17983495
fgets	getchar
when using sscanf or scanf etc. be sure to check the results mixing fgets with getchar and scanf is likely to confuse the issue
recommend not using fgets with those 2

17983835
ssl	https
to your nginx vhost that will help symfony recognize that the request is a ssl request symfony is checking against the https global variable to check if the request is ssl or not and redirect acordingly if that variable is not set inside by the webserver on a ssl request symfony will try to redirect causing the loop more info over here
try adding fastcgi_param https on

17984191
ssl	https
thus all requests to that ip regardless of domain name get the default ssl virtual host
without server name indication a server serving https content doesn t know what the domain name being requested is as the host header is itself encrypted

17996264
ienumerable	iqueryable
the result compile-time type table 1 actual type table 1 compile-time type ienumerable 1 actual type table 1 compile-time type iqueryable 1 actual type table 1 you see that the table class itself is always returned but its representation changes
now an object that implements ienumerable not iqueryable the results there it is

17996861
factors	mean
so yes you can do arithmetic on factors by converting them to integers
that doesn t mean you should do it

17997122
rtp	rtsp
if not success w sip rtp apis you could also check this very good java networking lib that allows you to build sip connections from the ground up and to swap buffers in any manner that you want
see my answer on this thread option 2 client server no jni native code req d here upload the audio from the sender and serve it from your server as rtsp to the receiver

17998184
uitableview	uipageviewcontroller
you then hook up the delegate methods of the uiscrollview uipagecontrol and uitableview datasource and delegate to methods within your uiviewcontroller class implementation
edit slightly modified approach since you want to mix multiple views on the same page which generally should mean within a single parent uiviewcontroller you do not want a uipageviewcontroller and a uitableviewcontroller since each of these wants to own the entire screen
