mri	rubinius
the mri default implementation of ruby currently cannot run more than 1 thread in parallel
for that you may want to try jruby or some other implementation like rubinius that allows parallel threads

26004753
super	extends
you need to change the entire structure of your program since a super class should have no knowledge of its child classes much less instances of it
my bet is that begin should not extends setup and that s where i d start

26005177
elasticsearch	kibana
you can use sql you do not have to care about parsing json from elasticsearch query answers
do not get me wrong i love elasticsearch logstash kibana but for log collecting and visualization

26005385
viewdidload	viewdidappear
since the view isn t actually laid out on the screen in viewdidload you shouldn t be trying to animate anything there
instead you should wait until the view is completely presented which happens in viewdidappear animated bool

26006589
ng-include	ng-controller
it seems that when using ng-include along with ng-controller the controller is only run once even when the ng-include src expression evaluates to null
to run it when the template is actually included when ng-include src isn t null a solution is to avoid the conditional ng-include and wrap it in a ng-if block so the whole element is re-created dynamically as shown in the codepen above

26007285
gson	jackson
and yes you can use google gson to stream json data this is an example how to do it readitemsarray function api model class before i use the streaming api from google gson i also got oom error because the json data i got is very big data many images and sounds in base64 encoding but with gson streaming i can overcome that error because it reads the data per token not all at once
and for jackson json library i think it also have streaming api and how to use it almost same with my implementation with google gson

26008825
ftp	telnet
if you can passively sniff the traffic you see username and password used by the ftp user in clear unless the client uses ftps
this is about the security you get with plain telnet instead of ssh or authorized access to mail servers which are not protected by tls most providers now offer tls

26009071
uitabbaritem	uitabbarcontroller
if that s not the problem then there are a few other stackoverflow questions asking the same thing tab bar reload every time tab is pressed detect a re-tab on selected uitabbaritem
it sounds like your viewcontroller class is not the delegate for your uitabbarcontroller otherwise tabbarcontroller didselectviewcontroller would be called

26012210
udp	tcp
udp is used by default for group membership and can be swithed off to tcp for example if you are running in a cloud environment where udp is not suitable
for session replication on the other hand tcp is used org.apache.catalina.tribes.transport.replicationtransmitter

26013035
google-chrome	firefox
in the chromium source code google-chrome for linux i can see a max of 30 per host 256 overall
in the firefox configuration go to about config and search for network.websocket i can see a max of 6 persistent connections per host and 200 overall but apparently the persistent conection limit does not affect websocket connections so only the 200 limit applies

26014161
google-chrome	firefox
i checked the link of codepen given by you in google-chrome firefox and ie
its working fine in google-chrome but in ie and firefox its not working

26016693
sudo	passwd
i just did a sudo chown -r me .subversion and now everything works
for some odd reason my .subversion folder was not owned by me and svn wouldn t save certificates of passwd

26018521
aggregate-functions	sum
edit alternatively you can use additional aggregate-functions for example max then group by is not required select min t1.starttime as starttime max t1.endtime as endtime max select sum t2.occurances from table2 t2 as occurances from table1 t1
just add group by for third column select min t1.starttime as starttime max t1.endtime as endtime select sum t2.occurances from table2 t2 as occurances from table1 t1 group by 3 this query returns one row

26021264
scheme	racket
i think the answer to your question is this these scheme guys dybvig felleisen hieb clinger rees wand flatt culpepper etc. are pretty smart
in particular somehow scheme racket manages to figure out how the binding structure works even when it doesn t know what s going to be a binding or not

26026685
setcontentview	findviewbyid
when you call findviewbyid ... it doesn t reference your main.xml directly - instead it references the content view attached to the activity in other words the one inflated by setcontentview ...
move after your setcontentview statement

26029451
postgresql	mysql
postgresql will in-line and flatten views into the containing query where it is safe to do so
i can t speak for mysql - not to mention the fact that it probably varies by storage engine and mysql version but for postgresql postgresql will flatten this into a single query

26030217
realloc	malloc
since the behaviour of realloc null x is the same as malloc x the same code would handle both situations
note that in c you should not cast the value returned by malloc and friends

26030813
uiview	subviews
let me draw it out for you step 1 add a uitableview to your view controller step 2 add your uitextfield subviews you can embed the uitextfield in a uiview container if you like as a subviews of your uiviewcontroller s view not your uitableview footer
step 3 if depending on if your using frames or autolayout you adjust the frame or autolayout constraint constant values for your uitextfield subviews when user tap on the text field

26032329
awt	swing
you can try overlaying an awt label with absolute positioning on top of the video this will work but the label will not have a transparent background
you can use the so-called direct rendering media player where you render the video yourself and then you can paint your own graphics on top of the video or use a swing jlabel

26037090
awt	swing
unless you have some desperate need to do so i would recommend against using frame and instead use a jframe as your window as awt is 15+ years out of date and generally is not longer used
take a look at creating a gui with jfc swing for more details instead start with a jpanel override it s paintcomponent method be perform your custom painting there

26037453
uiview	subviews
it was a standard uiview which was set to be my custom cell class
the problem seems to be that ios7 adds the contentview automatically on top of other subviews even if the contentview isn t the xib file

26038512
mdpi	hdpi
and also in present when eclipse creates launcher icons it only creates them for mdpi hdpi xhdpi and xxhdpi
based on that creating ldpi icon is not necessary and that mdpi will be scaled down automatically

26038622
jar	war
this confirms that the jar is downloaded and you can tick point 2 as confirmed
you can unarchive the war file and check in the libraries whether the json jar file is added to your end packaging or not

26039669
spaces	delimiter
is a standard delimiter edit the delimiter here is spaces
is not a delimiter for for f in batch and is automatically included in for f options as delimiter.with you exclude it

26042107
wadl	wsdl
although it is not included into the distribution jar tinywsdl has wsdl 2.0 - wadl convertor
obviously the service must be defined using http binding. the wsdl 1.1 definitions must be converted into wsdl 2.0 first also supported by tinywsdl

26042159
bower	npm
sometimes the automatic bower install does not work if you run npm with sudo
i would recommend setting up npm so it does not require sudo

26042291
multiplying	multiplication
as a result the 10k squared matrix actually takes 1 million times more work to multiplying than a single 100x100 multiplication
your 20000 executions of the 100x100 multiplication does not make up for the massive amount of work needed to multiplying the large matrices once

26042291
multiplying	multiplication
your 20000 executions of the 100x100 multiplication does not make up for the massive amount of work needed to multiplying the large matrices once
matrix multiplication is just many dot-products.your algorithm only breaks the dot products into groups to easy handling and does not use any special tricks to reduce the numbers in my calculations below

26042884
uiview	subviews
here s the pertinent code now this doesn t work perfectly under ios8 see uiview not resizing when rotated with a cgaffinetransform under ios8 for my question
i have a uiviewcontroller that only rotates some of it subviews when the device is rotated

26044260
addition	multiplication	operands	scalar
when both operands are identified to be numeric the addition is performed - this can even happen to objects
the operator itself does not seem to perform neither scalar multiplication nor matrix multiplication

26044466
bash	tcsh
tcsh -c source test.tcsh sources the file test.tcsh in the shell running the source command which is an instance of tcsh not the bash shell that runs tcsh
you aren t going to be able to execute a tcsh script in any way that affects the environment of the current bash shell

26044466
bash	tcsh
you aren t going to be able to execute a tcsh script in any way that affects the environment of the current bash shell
you could start a new bash shell that inherits from an instance of tcsh which was so modified with something like tcsh -c source test.tcsh

26044466
bash	tcsh
you could start a new bash shell that inherits from an instance of tcsh which was so modified with something like tcsh -c source test.tcsh
bash but that may not be what you need

26044466
bash	tcsh
bash but that may not be what you need
for instance tcsh -c source test.tcsh

26045967
ssl	https
even if your custom domain does not have an ssl certificate your appid.appspot.com does try accessing your project via https and you ll see
cloud endpoints is always serving the apis via ssl there s actually no way of changing it

26047843
implements	extends
so i would do something like this a b in your beaches and other fragments extends that base fragment and implements the required methods
example for beaches some notes 1 you will need to implements a listadapter for each of your fragments beaches and others as they do not have the same row layout

26048334
build.gradle	gradlew
look at this one paste this code at the bottom of your build.gradle file and adjust the list of google services you do not need
the below code helps if you use gradlew

26048787
direct3d	directx
before i gave up on it as being essentially hopeless i found the following microsoft s specific dependencies when trying to compile the sample in samples c++ direct3d basichlsl the __noop intrinsic the macros __min and __max various safe versions of standard functions like wsprintf_s and strcpy_s non-standard pre-processor token pasting allowing goto across variable initialization the __uuidof operator there are also problems with microsoft s directx headers that i haven t mentioned like being dependent on microsoft s sal annotation macros
arguably though this a failing of mingw for not having compatible versions of these directx headers

26054117
xjc	maven-jaxb2-plugin
maven-jaxb2-plugin is just a wrapper for xjc
it does not do any schema processing on it own it just calls xjc

26054486
build.gradle	gradlew
this is content of settings.gradle file and the content of build.gradle in this case will be and so on
you did not clarify the way you declare your lists of projects. gradlew can resolve your dependencies if all your project configurations are visible for him. that means you need to have gradlew build for each project which dependencies you want to print

26056685
spaces	delimiter
this gives you an array of strings split by the comma delimiter which would look something like this some words not split in a sensible way now you want to trim those spaces off
the string class has a great little function called trim which removes all whitespace characters spaces tabs etc from the start and end of strings

26056685
spaces	delimiter
the string class has a great little function called trim which removes all whitespace characters spaces tabs etc from the start and end of strings
now you have an array with strings like this some words not split in a sensible way next you want to join them back together with a comma delimiter

26059024
rspec	capybara
the generator is associated with the default rails testing framework which is not rspec capybara
check for rspec generators

26060999
implements	extends
the main implementation points are create an array in the constructor add the methods to the array and return that from the constructor copy dummy declarations of array methods to pass the implements array bit example of usage i made it available as a gist complete with tests and an example implementation of a subclass but i present the full source here of course the bits on identifiable the find and remove methods are not needed but i supply them none the less as a full fledged example is a tad more usable than a bare-bones collection without any methods of its own
while researching this i came across ben nadel s excellent post on extends javascript arrays while keeping native bracket-notation functionality

26061571
mongodb	bson
mongodb objectids are probably not simple strings
as per docs they are bson types. it s possible that member and user._id are two different objects that is why a reference equals comparison is failing even though their string representations are the same

26064025
mdpi	hdpi
if your target audience has resolution 240x320 ldpi 320x480 mdpi then you have to support mdpi and ldpi
if you are developing for api 14 it does not mean you have to focus only on hdpi this specifically depends on what is the screen resolution of your target audience

26066335
rtp	rtsp
when it is just rtp it s easy enough to implement the transport yourself since i ve had bad luck with gstreamer that did not have proper support for fu-a packetization in case of rtsp the overhead of the transport infrastructure is bigger and it is reasonable to use a 3rd party library like live555
there seems to be a point where every person trying to do h.264 over rtsp rtp comes down to this question

26068350
debian	linux
there was an issue in java 7 when packaging debian packages which would lead to the the package is of bad quality warning
rt-27989 linux deb installer does not specify installed-size rt-33784 packager disturbing alert dialog at installation of linux deb package account needed to view the bug tracker info but anybody can sign up for an account

26069265
ubuntu	linux
this is a known issue with javafx running under ubuntu 14.04
rt-37914 linux javafx media does not run on ubuntu 14.04 the issue has been fixed for java 8u40

26070571
awt	swing
also more directly see how to use borderlayout window is an awt component
you shouldn t try and add awt components to swing components

26072196
email	dkim
to prevent your email from going to spam can entail optimizing a number of things such as text of the email even if it s plain text
spammy salesy wording will still trigger spam the domain in which your sending the email from whether or not your sending domain is authenticated spf dkim checking that your not on spam lists what people usually do is create a link to a page which provides step by step instructions on how users can whitelist the sender in various email clients and providers

26073524
swift	objective-c
so what we can do is cast to anyobject make sure to import foundation or objectivec so the declaration is visible to the compiler we can then call it and it will work at runtime foo as anyobject .iskindofclass foo.self so basically from the objective-c point of view a swift class either has an existing objective-c class as root class if it inherited from an objective-c class or has swiftobject as root class
there are several object-oriented languages where one can define new root classes including c++ php and objective-c and they work fine so this is definitely not a special thing

26073524
swift	objective-c
all objects in swift are in a sense also objective-c objects in that they can be used with the objective-c runtime just like objects from objective-c
some members of the class the ones not marked objective-c or dynamic may not be visible to objective-c but otherwise all the introspection features of the objective-c runtime work fully on objects of pure swift classes

26073524
swift	objective-c
some members of the class the ones not marked objective-c or dynamic may not be visible to objective-c but otherwise all the introspection features of the objective-c runtime work fully on objects of pure swift classes
classes defined in swift look like any other class to the objective-c runtime except the name is mangled

26073618
google-chrome	firefox
update this is working in firefox and ie11 but just was informed by tj see comment below that it s not working in google-chrome
update 2 as asked for in the comments below now reverting to original previous position - fiddle 2 update 3 just installed google-chrome for me it s also working there

26074228
serializable	deserialization
i will also not explicitly put the owner of a car into its serializable form but i will show you how you could deserialize it and obtain the circular dependencies
i will use json4s in the example because i am a bit familiar with it and because i heard it is the de-facto standard for json serialization deserialization in scala

26076954
gif	png	tiff	png
reasons why not other formats svg - nice scaling but if user wants to reuse image it might cause issues jpeg - no transparency can t do creative stuff artefacts if not using highest quality gif - just let that format die tiff - bad browser support png - best quality always portable transparency
i would go with png 2nd place goes for jpeg

26077108
tiff	png
tiff is not supported by most web browsers that leaves us with the remaining four formats
let s compare the sizes of this qr code link to this page saved with gimp jpeg 90 39.4 kb jpeg 50 25 7 kb png 870 bytes gif 6 8 kb svg 29 kb svg gzipped 2 4 kb conclusion jpeg is not only uglier but also much larger than the other formats

26077108
gif	png
let s compare the sizes of this qr code link to this page saved with gimp jpeg 90 39.4 kb jpeg 50 25 7 kb png 870 bytes gif 6 8 kb svg 29 kb svg gzipped 2 4 kb conclusion jpeg is not only uglier but also much larger than the other formats
gif good but png is the smallest and has no downsides

26077591
stateless	stateful
stateless web service frameworks usually create service instances per client call and nothing can be stored locally in exception you use some global mechanism like shared memory or dbms and pass some id to distinguish one client to another
maybe it s not truly stateful

26080173
noexcept	throw
exceptions are a complex mechanism and noexcept greatly facilitates a compiler s life even in the even of zero-cost eh
edit in the specific case of the noexcept specifier if the compiler can t prove that your code doesn t throw a std terminate eh is set up with implementation-dependent details

26080173
noexcept	throw
edit in the specific case of the noexcept specifier if the compiler can t prove that your code doesn t throw a std terminate eh is set up with implementation-dependent details
in both cases code doesn t throw and or can t prove that the code doesn t throw the mechanics involved are simpler and the compiler is less constrained

26080219
comparator	comparable
i m just wondering if i can find the code for comparator function and modify it
this doesn t make sense to me as comparable is an interface and as such there is no code for the interface s comparator method just a method signature which you can easily find in the java api

26080343
debian	linux
you can download the entire kernel source as an rpm package or other type of package for whatever version of linux debian you are running from a variety of places
specifically the output that you are seeing is produced from whichever of the following files is for your architecture linux arch sparc mm fault_32.c linux arch sparc mm fault_64.c linux arch um kernel trap.c linux arch x86 mm fault.c an example of the relevant function from one of the files linux arch x86 mm fault.c from that we see that the variable passed to printout the process identifier is where and where then from linux include linux sched.h the comment makes it clear that the path for the executable is not stored in the structure

26083324
allocator	stl
the electronic arts stl described here with source online here some of the folks who made the above quasi-stl implementations tried to get their allocator model changes adopted into the c++ standard but they were not successful
this is indeed a weird thing about the stl

26083337
comparator	comparable
so you might have then you just pass an instance of the appropriate comparator into the arrays.sort method
basically implementing comparable is good when there s one sort order which is a sensible default - but comparators allow you to separate the things being compared from the thing doing the comparing. as a side-note using double to represent currency values like salaries is a bad idea due to the way binary floating point works not being able to represent 0.1 exactly .

26084323
spaces	linefeed
as these blanks like n spaces will be present in the stdin it will be taken by the next call to fgets and also one c because it is also a character
also use linefeed for double and not f

26086806
fgets	getline
if you cannot tolerate that use getline it s harder to use so use fgets if in doubt
as suggested by joachim pileborg use fgets

26087325
swift	objective-c
if you re going to work with crypto++ which is fine if you need algorithms not available in commoncrypto then personally i would write all the low-level stuff in pure c++ and just do the ui work in swift using a small objc++ interface layer to read the results
i always recommend minimizing your objc++ footprint so even if you wrote this in objective-c rather than swift my recommendation would be the same

26087432
hex	binary
you re doing some hex conversion yourself by the looks of it and then some conversion to decimal.
it s not really clear what your expected input output is given that you ve got a floating binary point in there but i would just parse from binary to a and convert that byte array to hex using a 3rd party library.

26088292
bower	npm
i m a npm bower noob - but what happened in my case was that i was using the angular js tutorial which seems to have bower set up to be used via npm and not via the command line directly
note in my case i think my bower install got messed up. i ran this to fix up my bower install npm install -gf bower then i edited my bower.json file to add in a new library that i wanted to use in my case angular-sanitize i cd to the location of my project cd myprojectpath then to run bower i actually used npm install npm install this seems to to run bower as a node package which in turn scans bower.json and installs any missing bower packages

26094006
hex	binary
as suggested by user npe you work with the binary files in binary mode only. here ascii code comes into the picture because when you are saving an int to file it is actually stored as sequence of 4 bytes. if you open your generated data file in any hex editor you will notice that when you saved i as 1 into the file it is actually stored as 01 00 00 00 or 00 00 00 01 according to the endian-ness of your system
on the same basis when you save 26 it gets actually saved as 26 00 00 00 or 00 00 00 26 but when you read this file in text mode and not binary mode then if chars 26 is encountered it is treated as eof and getw returns -1

26094254
backtracking	greedy
so it backtracking making the greedy quantifier match one less thing leaving the o at the end of the string unmatched
that still doesn t match the f in the regex so it backtracking one more step making the greedy quantifier match one less thing again leaving the oo at the end of the string unmatched

26094254
backtracking	greedy
that still doesn t match the f in the regex so it backtracking one more step making the greedy quantifier match one less thing again leaving the oo at the end of the string unmatched
that still doesn t match the f in the regex so it backtracking one more step leaving the foo at the end of the string unmatched

26100798
mri	rubinius
case you feel your production is just serving about fine under mri than you probably do not have that much concurrency around
puma s readme pretty much explains what you get under mri compared to rubinius jruby on mri there is a global interpreter lock gil that ensures only one thread can be run at a time

26102990
implements	extends
also hides the sign out bar implements the listener interfaces googleapiclient.connectioncallbacks and googleapiclient.onconnectionfailedlistener implements the listener methods handle the sign-in intent in onactivityresult
the game samples have been recently updated to not extends basegameactivity

26104942
google-chrome	safari
looks like a bug google-chrome composites and outputs rgb 254 254 254 while safari outputs rgb 255 255 255
interestingly it doesn t seem to matter what alpha value you use google-chrome always outputs the same colour

26110699
uiview	subviews
this is possibly not the best way to do it but the idea is that a uibutton is inherits from a uiview
so you can get your button array by looking for the subviews of the view with the buttons on

26110806
swift	objective-c
if i am the person storing the description of your nsdata for the sidebar now i know that i am not supposed to do describe d in the swift case but for the objective-c case i don t have equal knowledge and i run the risk of saying in short i don t think any such thing exists and making one work would also involve some trickery
there are enough moving parts in a playground and all of those would have to be reimplemented for objective-c

26115096
twig	smarty
if not but you want something with the performance twist you can use twig i ve been using it for awhile with phalcon and never had any issues
otherwise the difference in speed will probably be unnoticeable when using smarty as a plain php library

26116822
jboss	weblogic	jboss	glassfish
if you want to use jta you need to use a jta stand-along implementation like bitronix atomikos jboss transactions embedding a standalone transaction manager will give you access to a jta transaction manager exposing usertransactions through jndi
tomcat is a web server not a jta compliant application server jboss weblogic glassfish

26123731
jar	war
if you use a standalone project only classes included in main jar will be automatically scanned by the persistence unit
other jars will not be included in an archive like what happens for a war but will be searched in the classpath as required the entity classes including in the jar created by the other project are not scanned by default

26128900
super	self
the facts are these you must initialize all member variables before calling super
you may not call methods on self or access computed properties on self before calling super.init

26130097
punctuation	words
since you want punctuation to remain a part of your tokens in one way or another i m guessing that indexing words isn t really what you want to do so standardtokenizer is probably just not a good choice
yes punctuation will be removed speaking very generally it s more complex that just that

26130782
build.gradle	gradlew
if wrapper task is not found add the following to the build.gradle on git push heroku master you should see downloading in the console log like this
i fixed same problem by pushing gradlew wrapper files to heroku master

26132207
allocator	stl
however it shows assignment between strings using allocator classes of different types
implementing a useful allocator that supplies the full interface required by the stl without just disguising the default std allocator is not as trivial

26133387
swift	objective-c
therefore the complex macros that are in c and objective-c source files are not made available to your swift code. so you can not use your macros in swift code.you should make this as utility function and use in swift code
as per swift progamming guide in swift you can use functions and generics to achieve the same results as complex macros without any compromises

26135527
.htaccess	httpd.conf
you also need to have in public directory default .htaccess from laravel - i mention it because on webservers sometimes .htaccess files as hidden and if you copy project from ftp you might not copied them
you need to have mod_rewrite enabled in your apache configuration file - in httpd.conf line loadmodule rewrite_module modules mod_rewrite.so should be without # at the beginning

26136262
sudo	passwd
sudo add-apt-repository ppa gwibber-daily ppa sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install postgresql-9.3-postgis-2.1 sudo apt-get install postgresql-server-dev-9.3 create database in postgresql createuser -u postgres username -s -d -r psql -u postgres -c alter role username with passwd passhere
createdb -u postgres -t template_postgis -o username dbname if you do not have the template_postgis in the postgresql then switch to user postgres and run sudo su postgres createdb template_postgis createlang plpgsql template_postgis now for creating the extansions psql -d dbname -c create extension postgis

26137498
backgrounding	multitasking
that s not how backgrounding processing is supposed to work on ios
see apple s documentation on multitasking

26137719
rpm	yum
jboss as and jboss ews installation guide for redhat openshift origin v4 unfortunately up to now the jboss as and ews are not officially supported on openshift origin v4 however there is a solution for that. thanks for diego castro from getup cloud for creating the necessary rpm packages it was him who actually enabled the possibility to install jboss as on openshift origin v4 for us
so you have to install the following rpm packages before you can enable the installation of the jboss cartridges you can probably install them directly but i prefer downloading them with wget and then running yum install on them

26140525
prepare	execute
technically the question is if you prepare the computer beforehand for this task or not and also how strictly you define a piece of code as two programs can yield the same execute instruction sequence due to branches
in a lose definition of piece of code if you prefer the computer beforehand you could create a virtual machine that creates a history of execute instructions or alternatively and space saving the execute programs and send this history in real time using public key cryptography to a trusted machine the history keeper which marks the history stream with time stamps

26143932
ienumerable	iqueryable
you technically can by calling asqueryable on the result but that is just a ienumerable pretending to be a iqueryable it does not give you any of the benefits of using a real iqueryable like only retrieving the needed rows from the server
no you can t get a iqueryable from sqlquery this is because what iqueryable is doing is building a sql string dynamically based on what select and where filters you put in

26144502
ssl	https
this is a limitation on how ssl certificates work not a limitation in s3
whoever made this change has failed to account for the way wildcard certificates work in https

26145333
implements	extends
it s not trivial but you can do this if you implements a custom icontractresolver that takes your attributes into account
there are several steps involved in doing this create an abstract base class for your attributes that extends system.attribute next you need to create the icontractresolver that will actually use your attribute 1 create the attribute that overrrides converterattribute.converter returning your custom converter decorate your class with the attribute when serializing or deserializing specify the contract resolver in the jsonserializersettings you use i d say that this probably isn t worth the small benefit--all you re really doing is saving a few characters unless your attribute does something else

26145924
floating-point	fractions
all other fractions floats have more digits after the dot when expressed in decimal because the representation of floating-point numbers is binary not decimal
the binary and decimal systems are equivalent when it comes to representing integers they can both represent all the integers but not when it comes to representing fractions values

26146554
jsdom	cheerio
jsdom might be needed for some more complex ones but it has significantly worse performance so only use it if cheerio doesn t work
cheerio works pretty well for most use cases

26147664
opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox
2 i will additionally note that any time we have a browser prefix for transition google-chrome 26 firefox 16 safari 6.1 opera 12.1 then transform was definitely still prefixed as well google-chrome 36 firefox 16 all safari opera 23 meaning we can leave off the unprefixed version of transform following a prefixed rule
3 since firefox released unprefixed transition at the same time as their unprefixed transform we do not need the prefixed -moz-transform on the right-hand side of the unprefixed transition

26150948
decoder	encoder
the encoder sends information about any type once and expects the decoder to remember the information
even if the gob encoder calls write exactly once per encoded value packets sent by subsequent writes will not include the type information

26159085
gruntjs	package.json
the only other answer i can offer is similar to the assumption waqas-ahmed made that you mean to install dependencies and devdependencies from your package.json file and that perhaps you mean to call npm install not gruntjs install
can you please paste your package.json file here so we may see your dependencies

26162850
wildfly	jboss
if using maven you can create a repository and build the maven directory structure using mvn then in order to connect to the remote machine and cast the interface back to your-interface you use this uses wildfly remote which is in remote naming and ejb in wildfly-ejb-client-bom and i also required this dependency for communication and this one for the remote naming
also note the port is not the ususal port for jboss 5 jndi 1099 this is the default remoting port 4447 you can then cast your reference to your interface and use it as normal

26164450
seaborn	matplotlib
use seaborn .set_style function pass it your rc as second parameter or kwarg. mwaskom software seaborn generated seaborn.set_style.html
do not use pylab inline it is deprecated use matplotlib inline the question is not specific to ipython

26165598
super	self
you should be calling super u1 self .reset in u1.reset
when you use super you should always pass the name of the current class as the first argument not the name of the parent class

26166872
spaces	delimiter
if it doesn t skip initial white spaces then it stops immediately and returns an empty string
you don t say how you want the string to be delimiter

26167915
bash	tcsh	bash	zsh
for example on my machine using bin i get this output for your first example rmdir sh sleep stty sync tcsh test unlink wait4path zsh but with the latter bin bash -c line 1 syntax error near unexpected token sh bin bash -c line 1 sh because the command substitution takes place in your first shell in both cases your first one works the newlines are stripped out when making the command line but in the second case it doesn t - they remain in the string thanks to your
using echo rather than bash -c can showcase this you can see from that what your bash -c is seeing and why it doesn t work - the sh comes before the do

26169012
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
all exception types that are direct or indirect subclasses of class runtimeexception are unchecked-exception
all classes that inherit from class exception but not runtimeexception are considered to be checked exceptions

26171071
ubuntu	linux
note that when i create a dos windows format file data.dos and read that with the same bug fixed binary running on an ubuntu 14.04 derivative the output is got 1 blossom got 1 flower got 1 bewilder got 1 confound got 1 confuse got 1 perplex got 1 dwell got 1 live got 1 reside this exactly corresponds to the cr terminates the word and the first loop skips the newline scenario
you could also debug by adding printing statements in strategic places and on the unix file the output is now got-2 got 1 blossom got-2 n got 0 flower got-2 got 1 bewilder got-2 got 1 confound got-2 got 1 confuse got-2 n got 0 perplex got-2 got 1 dwell got-2 got 1 live got-2 n got 0 reside and with the windows file got-2 got 1 blossom got-2 r got 1 flower got-1 n got-2 got 1 bewilder got-2 got 1 confound got-2 got 1 confuse got-2 r got 1 perplex got-1 n got-2 got 1 dwell got-2 got 1 live got-2 r got 1 reside got-1 n note that unix linux does not treat the crlf combination specially

26171717
uiwindow	uialertcontroller
try this it looks like you can t present action sheets on uiwindow s directly anymore you have to present them on an actual view that is managed by a view controller so the root view controller s view is perfect for this
i think this has less to do with the fact that uiactionsheet is deprecated and you can t just magically switch to uialertcontroller just yet if you need to support ios 7 and more to do with the way their presentation is handled in the underlying implementation i m guessing it now relies on the view the sheet is presented in having a view controller which is not true for windows

26177040
.htaccess	httpd.conf
the easiest way to achieve what you want the end user not seeing that its not a html file is to move the file into a folder and configure the server to execute and server the results of that file when the user navigates to that folder move the file into a folder called database and then change your link to point there then configure the webserver to accept the python filename as a default file in your case running apache it should be something like this find the directoryindex directive in your apache configuration file httpd.conf or add it to a .htaccess and change it to look like this if you want to limit your default index file to just index.html directoryindex index.html you can also include more resources and they will be used in the order given e.g directoryindex index.html index.php would display the index.html file first if both index.html and index.php existed
don t forget to restart apache if you made the change to the httpd.conf file

26177085
google-chrome	firefox
all depends on what features from the resources inspector of google-chrome you are actually looking for
unfortunately it is not currently present in firefox developer tools but will be starting from firefox 34 to be released in november

26179347
implements	extends
but i won t elaborate on it any further because the method accept of serversocket does not exist in any method implements by serversocket
that was for the general case but in your real case i think you should use different subclasses one for each socketimpl subclass you want to extends and instead use a buffering object that you put in all your subclasses as a helper for overriding the methods that you need to

26185032
recvfrom	datagram
recv and recvfrom read a single whole datagram
if your buffer is too small to receive a given datagram you will get an wsaemsgsize error and that datagram will be lost if you do not specify the msg_peek flag

26185413
nsmutablestring	nsstring
change the first line of your method to declare an nsmutablestring instead of a string the problem stems from nsrange and built-in swift range instances not being compatible for strings.
you can do this if you use nsstring s methods

26185647
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
if you want them to not match then you need to use a binary collation instead of the case-sensitive dictionary one
to see this in action run the following dictionary case-insensitive select tmp.val from select bat union all select bar union all select bad union all select bar tmp val order by tmp.val collate sql_latin1_general_cp1_ci_as asc

26186191
backtracking	greedy
instead write or if you insist now noticing the part hiding in the parse call suggests you may expect backtracking to on succesfully matched tokens when a parse failure happens down the road
that doesn t happen spirit generates peg grammars and always greedy matches from left to right

26187521
mongodb	bson
the problem was in the way i was building the bson in php to send it over to mongodb
for example the following part the second add overrides the first one thus not only creating an invalid formula but also creating the wrong bson

26190086
profiling	debugging
theoretically able to establish a release build profiling that s identical to debugging
lucy ideally you shouldn t have to run in release profiling when debugging release is meant as an app distribution profiling with a small package size and little no debugging symbols

26190086
profiling	debugging
lucy ideally you shouldn t have to run in release profiling when debugging release is meant as an app distribution profiling with a small package size and little no debugging symbols
but if you must debugging on release due to environment data reasons make sure you have the optimization level set to none for release

26190918
required	placeholder
in each case you have to specify the full name including the type followed by a colon case bbphoto1.kommunen statements but since the type can be inferred by the variable type used in the switch you can ignore the enum type but not the dot case .kommunen statements last in swift a switch statements required that all cases are handled either explicitly 3 in your case or using a default case covering all cases non explicitly handled in the switch
a working version of your code would look like note that differently from other languages the code in each case doesn t automatically fallthrough to the next case so the break statement is not required - the only use case for it is when a case has no statement a case with no statement is an error in swift and in that case the break just acts as a placeholder and its meaning is do nothing

26195565
super	extends
each class has exactly one direct super class
if your example was considered multi-inheritance you wouldn t be able to use the extends keyword at all since each class already extends by default the object class

26196170
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
the other generic syntax components are assumed to be case-sensitive unless specifically defined otherwise by the scheme rfc 2616 defines the following comparison rule for the http scheme when comparing two uris to decide if they match or not a client should use a case-sensitive octet-by-octet comparison of the entire uris with these exceptions however rfc 7230 locks it down further by stating the scheme and host are case-insensitive and normally provided in lowercase
all other components are compared in a case-sensitive manner

26196816
move	drag
move the dragdrop.dodragdrop call to the datagrid s mousemove event the updated previewmouseleftbuttondown handler not only does it fix your problem but it provides a better user experience
the drag should be initiated when i move the mouse instead of when i press the row

26197934
punctuation	words
finally i m not sure it s a good idea to remove punctuation
for instance it s will be converted to its but these are different words with different meanings and they lemmatize differently

26202602
super	implements
if you as a developer override onpostexecute like above and forget to include the super call or simply delete it for whatever reason that the original onpostexecute method in the exampletask will not be called anymore
for example the whole listener implementation with the tasklistener would suddenly not work anymore since the call to the callback is implements in onpostexecute

26204078
prepare	execute
no you created a prepare statement then you used the normal query which has the placeholders thats why its not working
execute the prepare statement then fetch the result from that prepare statement

26205824
profiling	benchmarking
but i recommend that you run your program in profiling mode to find out the true bottlenecks
a benchmarking using constant data may not be fully representative of the times spent in a normal program

26208014
xjc	maven-jaxb2-plugin
i will try to get my patches to the xjc via pull requests but you know i m not sure when if oracle guys will accept my prs
in the maven-jaxb2-plugin i ve now implemented quite reliable workarounds

26208416
swift	objective-c
swift closures and functions are decidedly not c functions
they exist in a weird halfway state between c++ members and objective-c blocks so you ll have to move any callbacks into an objective-c file and take a block or have some other means of calling back to swift

26208416
swift	objective-c
it s an incredibly painful workaround for a problem that you shouldn t be trying to express in swift
code that must manipulate pointers especially function pointers is best left in a c or objective-c file

26209585
apache	nginx
auto-starting or not is up to you via the standard start tools on ubuntu update-rc.d assuming a recent openerp 6.1 or greater openerp odoo has werkzeug baked in but for prod you really want to use a wsgi server such as nginx gunicorn or apache mod_wsgi
i find nginx gunicorn pretty simple but i don t really have any apache experience so can t comment

26210945
erlang	elixir
if you still think that there is too much boilerplate to write you can read my article about it this one is in erlang
elixir modules are not classes and variables defined inside them are not properties so there are no such things as constructors and destructors

26211564
queue	fifo
when you use per-message ttl then messages removed from queue only when they reach queue head so situation when expired messages still reside in the middle of queue is normal
such messages will not be send to consumer and will be deadlettered or dropped but due to strict fifo nature or rabbitmq s queues that will happen as written above when they reach queue head and delay before removal may be greater than actual message ttl

26212292
decoder	encoder
decoder in mediacodec is not able to make resizing automatically it always output frames in real sizes. encoder also encodes frames and uses real sizes as input and is not able to make resizing internally
so if you want to put frame to encoder that has sizes not equal to decoded frame you need to make resizing

26214213
gradle	ivy
there is probably a more elegant way but you could try something like ps if you get this working it would make for a very interesting gradle plugin if you wanted to release it
gradle has not used ivy internally for some time so i doubt very much if your approach of using ivy ant tasks will work

26216640
coalesce	isnull
my copy-pasted comment once as opposed to coalesce used with subqueries the isnull function has an important advantage over coalesce in that internally it doesn t evaluate an input expression more than once
in accordance with standard sql coalesce v1 v2 is simply internally translated to case when v1 is not null then v1 else v2 end

26219797
prepare	execute
if you wish to execute your prepare statement you should call
you did not define thus it has no execute function

26220133
nfa	dfa
using with the regexp string the dfa generated from nfa has three states s0 initial state s1 after an a s2 after a b that doesn t follow an a follows a b or is initial b s3 after a b in s1 s3 accept existing implementations for regular expressions often allow backreferences not so re2 and use backtracking rather than nfa - dfa and are not therefore dfa the backtracking logic adds state similar to recursive call stack adding state
if you don t want to use backtracking one way to parse expressions like this may be going backwards from accept state the nfa reduction allows for seeing that the case of a is different as it is partial match of existing final sequence we should go to state s1 instead

26220133
nfa	dfa
if you don t want to use backtracking one way to parse expressions like this may be going backwards from accept state the nfa reduction allows for seeing that the case of a is different as it is partial match of existing final sequence we should go to state s1 instead
the same link above gives larger than necessary dfa diagram for a longer string their states 2 and 3 should be combined to a single state any b or c stays in state a goes out to state 1 to create dfa yourself you can first generate the original dfa for abc and then fill in whatever doesn t match this track top one highest priority overrides whatever is next this fills in to if we instead had you should think of the accept track similar to abc but also notice the sequence aa

26222725
geany	notepad++
i ve run in to limit issues with notepad++ but not yet with geany
for reading and editing geany for windows is another good option

26223762
dictionary	map
if you really want a linq solution then something like achieves the same thing but requires copying your dictionary into a list which might be a problem if your dictionary is very large
with a change to your rootobject you can then do this note we have eliminated the season object because json.net won t be able to map to the property number because that s not a property in your original json you can make it work but it would require some fiddling around with custom serialization

26224204
apache	nginx
apache s proxypass is awesome for lots of things like exposing tomcat based services as part of a site and if your node.js app is just doing a specific small role or is an internal tool that s only likely to have a limited number of users then it might be easier just to use it so you can get it working and move on but that doesn t sound like the case here
if you want to take advantage of the performance and scale you ll get from using node.js - and especially if you want to use something that involves maintaining a persistent connection like web sockets - you are better off running both apache and your node.js on other ports apache on localhost 8080 node.js on localhost 3000 and then running something like nginx varnish or ha proxy in front - and routing traffic that way

26224758
equals	compareto
note that if the comparison is equals to zero in either case we treat that as an valid argument zero is not greater than or less than zero so it passes our test
if we were to make our test exclusive we could include the result of compareto equaling zero in our check then we d be saying if the parameter is equals to the lower or upper bound that s an invalid argument too

26226446
realloc	malloc
given that realloc works with a null argument you could also just initialise sarray to null
for the record for malloc if the size of the space requested is zero the behavior is implementation- defined either a null pointer is returned or the behavior is as if the size were some nonzero value except that the returned pointer shall not be used to access an object

26227224
express	node.js
now with all of that in mind you should take that csr that you have and provide it to your ca and get the various certificates back concatenate them and then use that w your private key in your express server
so i think there s at least a little bit of terminological confusion and the node.js example you have there doesn t help by renaming everything to .pem

26227517
strtol	atoi
there are better ways to do this in the c standard library atoi or the more robust strtol -type functions all found in stdlib.h
the latter allow you to better detect if there was rubbish at the end of the number for assistance with validation atoi cannot tell the difference between 123 and 123xyzzy

26229227
move	drag
if you try to move the last element of the first column into the first position of the second column kendoui computes that oldindex and newindex are the same since there is no change it rejects the movement
sortable is for sorting not for drag and drop

26231312
realloc	malloc
your first call malloc with a size s and then realloc with the same size s
this is wrong you have to pass to realloc the new wanted size independently of the current size - it is not an increment

26231312
realloc	malloc
here there is a big chance realloc returns exactly the same pointer it received
btw it is not clear why you want to do with a malloc immediately followed by a realloc

26231798
swift	objective-c
see swift with ios 5 deployment target so the answer is not possible
it also doesn t matter if your project is written in objective-c because of the above reasons

26231866
config	ini
mainly it have few drawback 1 it involve installation and config of addition php library as yaml module is not coming by default or have to decouple from symphony framework and use it
2 read and write performance is worst among all config technologies if compare to ini xml json

26231866
config	ini
2 read and write performance is worst among all config technologies if compare to ini xml json
taking lots more time read compare to ini file 3 readability is not good compare to ini and xml format

26233318
division	addition
here is the java example to get the hue edit added check if min and max are the same since the rest of the calculation is not needed in this case and to avoid division by 0 see comments edit fixed java error
in addition to umriyaev s answer if only the hue is needed it is not required to divide the 0-255 ranged colours with 255

26234019
strdup	malloc	strcpy	malloc
i think you mean strcpy not strdup
malloc does not provoke the corruption

26234497
noexcept	throw
if it doesn t throw the existing elements are transferred from the original storage to the new storage and here is where the noexcept specification of the move constructor matters
if moving might throw and the type is copyconstructible then the existing elements will be copied instead of moved

26234561
super	self
the convenience or secondary initializers which can include init do not call super
instead they call through a message to self the initializer in the series with the next most parameters supplying a default value for the parameter not passed into it

26235589
client-side	server-side
server-side client-side this is only a test example and you shouldn t use it right away because html.raw reveals xss vulnerability in that context
javascript isn t a server-side language so you can t use its objects within your c# context

26237849
comparator	comparable
you can implement a comparator as a static nested class of the one being compared if you are in control of that class and if it is a class rather than an interface
it is not at all uncommon however that you want to compare instances of a class that you do not control according to an order that the target class does not support natively whether by being comparable or by providing a comparator class

26237849
comparator	comparable
it is not at all uncommon however that you want to compare instances of a class that you do not control according to an order that the target class does not support natively whether by being comparable or by providing a comparator class
in that case you must create your own separate comparator

26239268
translation	localization
the last example you gave allows your separate out the translation of the word cost with the reset of the string which might be fine - but could be insufficient to effectively convey your meaning in all languages
maybe there s a language that you wouldn t label value then just translating cost doesn t get you to good localization

26239377
dbcontext	objectcontext
check exceptions in objectstatemanager.changeobjectstate in the second example if the object doesn t exist in the context it gets added you ll still get an exception when you call db.savechanges but the same approach could be used to add a new record just by changing entitystate.modified to entitystate.added you ll also need to grab the underlying objectcontext from your dbcontext using iobjectcontextadapter context .objectcontext
basically you are invoking a function on the underlying system.data.objects.objectstatemanager of your dbcontext class to change a property vs retrieving and changing it directly via the dbcontext

26239770
gdi	direct2d
the reason for this is that wpf doesn t use gdi to draw window contents wpf gdi interop situations notwithstanding
instead wpf uses its own renderer based if i m not mistaken on direct2d and direct3d

26239770
direct3d	gdi
instead wpf uses its own renderer based if i m not mistaken on direct2d and direct3d
thus a pen in wpf isn t the same kind of thing as in gdi where it exists as an actual graphics drawing primitive object

26242296
swift	objective-c
swift 1.x the answer is you can t at least not currently
if you want to interoperate with enums you need to declare them in objective-c

26243004
google-chrome	firefox
actually i was using prefix-free.js which was not correctly coded for google-chrome
once i changed the browser and run that code on firefox it worked perfectly

26243909
build.gradle	gradlew
the proposed solution is ...in the root project s build.gradle in all the android modules .
one think i noticed was that this doesn t work on older versions of gradlew i was trying with 1.10 and got an error

26248058
nsmutablestring	nsstring
i m not sure when that change was made since stringy is an nsmutablestring now you can t call countelements on it
just use nsstring s length property instead

26250548
uiview	subviews
if for example the view contains another view the above downcast is equivalent to doing this which fails because a uiview is not a uibutton although thanks to polymorphism the opposite is true being uibutton inherited from uiview
if you want your code to print the tag for all uibutton s ignoring all other ui elements then rahul_send89 s answer is the correct one it loops through all elements of the subviews properties and it prints the tag only if the current element is a uibutton

26252312
ssl	https
big note as of apache v2.2.12 and openssl v0.9.8j it is now possible to secure more than one site per apache instance. this tutorial does not cover that process. see here for more details here and here and here and like i said at the top now you need to do some reseach on all the options available in the ssl config and make thing work as you want rather than using the default
how to configure wampserver to use https ssl this is not a trivial process

26252312
ssl	https
how to configure wampserver to use https ssl this is not a trivial process
this tutorial will hopefully get ssl working for you. however getting it configured correctly once it is working is totally down to you

26252617
serializable	deserialization
consider the following messages it is possible to serializable those different messages into one single data container and deserialize it as one single filedata message as long as the filedata is serializable before zero or more moredata and both the filedata and moredata have the same index for the repeated field
in addition to jpa s answer it might be relevant to say that the data does not need to be in the exact same container when being serializable for it being compatible on deserialization

26262280
swift	objective-c
therefore the complex macros that are in c and objective-c source files are not made available to your swift code.
you will probably need to convert it into a function or generic as per this documentation page complex macros are used in c and objective-c but have no counterpart in swift

26263586
alarmmanager	timertask
also the alarmmanager does not have the option to check if anything is scheduled
so i made a timertask which would do the job and by that way the system didn t destroy the service when it finished it s job

26264694
apache	nginx
i can think of plenty of operational issues why you wouldn t want to do this logging rewrites throttling efficiency not tested but i m guessing nginx is a lot faster than php s built-in non-optimized server integration with anything else you have that extends nginx apache and iis things like new relic however there is a solution where you get most of the benefit of running php with its built-in web server while getting most of the benefit of running a web server out front
that is you could use a server like nginx as a reverse proxy to php s built-in web server

26267036
bower	jspm
if you want to execute script files from bower you need to create your script tags for each of them
while jspm is not only a module downloader

26267983
jpql	hql
i believe that this is a hibernate function in other words replace belongs to hql and not jpql
i have searched in the spec and in this oracle page and there is no replace for jpql function

26268234
portrait	landscape
i could drag in a label and that label would only show up on iphones in portrait
if i rotate to landscape the label would not appear because it s a different size class

26268383
hive	hdfs
it is trying to do this as the hive user
here is the error what it is trying to tell you permission denied user hive access write inode hdfs supergroup drwxr-xr-x the exception tells you who it is doing it user hive what the user is trying to do access write what dire is being accessed inode the permissions of the location hdfs supergroup drwxr-xr-x run hadoop fs -ls -la the permissions you describe 777 are not reflected in the error message

26275608
pyenv	virtualenv
use pyenv to control the python version pyenv is designed for installing python into the home folder so you don t need root access but even with root access it s a great idea it lets you use a specified version of python within your home folder hierarchy rather than the os version
you should also install pyenv virtualenv so you can use a virtualenv for your project not strictly essential but virtual environments are a great idea and you should always use one with pyenv they re practically effortless

26275608
pyenv	virtualenv
you should also install pyenv virtualenv so you can use a virtualenv for your project not strictly essential but virtual environments are a great idea and you should always use one with pyenv they re practically effortless
one of the neat things about pyenv is the pyenv local command which specifies which version of python or which virtualenv should be used for a folder and subfolders once you ve used pyenv local in your project folder to set the python version any time you use the python command it ll use the version set by pyenv local

26275608
pyenv	virtualenv
one of the neat things about pyenv is the pyenv local command which specifies which version of python or which virtualenv should be used for a folder and subfolders once you ve used pyenv local in your project folder to set the python version any time you use the python command it ll use the version set by pyenv local
it s not needed if you only install one version of python and don t use a virtualenv in that case you can use pyenv global to set the version for the user

26275608
pyenv	virtualenv
it s not needed if you only install one version of python and don t use a virtualenv in that case you can use pyenv global to set the version for the user
the neatest thing about pyenv local global setup is it works great with both scripts and manually invoking python it is simply set-and-forget unlike other python environment managers which require activation

26281048
client-side	server-side
checking server-side involves testing whether comment is set and simply not output any of the prepending javascript checking client-side involves outputting the empty value in a variable so you can inspect it in javascript vefore prepending it to your element i would use the first approach
you can either check server-side conditionally output different javascript or you can check in client-side in javascript

26285749
jython	pypy
jython doesn t deal in pointers it deals in java references which the jvm of course probably represents as pointers but you can t see those and wouldn t want to because the gc is allowed to move them around
pypy lets different types have different kinds of id but the most general is just an index into a table of objects you ve called id on which is obviously not going to be a pointer

profiling	instrumentation
however when selecting an the same already running app and then starting profiling while the app is running this functionality works
i have also not been able to get the leaks tool to generate any activity on instrumentation 6.0+ whereas it had no issues in instrumentation xcode 5

26288521
persistent	transient
all non-transient instances variables that are not annotated with the transient annotation are persistent
field is not persistent

26289525
swift	objective-c
in swift array is a struct not a class
to have a class that is an array subclass you will need to use nsarray its objective-c counterpart

26289789
multiplying	multiplication
this can be computed with similarly h 3 z can be computed using then summing the polynomials boils down to summing the coefficients with the only catch that you have to pad h2 so that the two vectors of coefficients have the same size the final multiplication by z -2 which can be represented by the polynomial coefficients could be achieve in the same way using conv with or alternatively you may realize that multiplying by a single term polynomial is essentially equivalent to shifting the coefficients
unless you are using a non-standard notation h 2 z is not but rather the multiplication of a polynomial with coefficients h with itself

26289863
qtreewidget	qtreeview
as mumush mentions andrea s answer applies to the qtreewidget only not a qtreeview
qtreeview has no selecteditems method so you have to use selectedindexes which will return you a list of qmodelindex objects

26290938
opera	google-chrome
code is note the download attribute is not supported in ie safari or opera version 12 and earlier
i run your code in google-chrome fire-fox and looks like its works perfectly

26291636
spaces	delimiter
in your example if all first and last names do not contain spaces themselves you can do the following
you can split a string into an array using a delimiter

26294445
ubuntu	linux
on ubuntu first install xvfb sudo apt-get install xvfb then install pyvirtualdisplay from pypi pip install pyvirtualdisplay sample selenium script in python in a headless mode with pyvirtualdisplay
though not a solution to your phantomjs troubles i think selenium with python bindings can be used very efficiently as a headless scraper in a linux environment

26294546
viewdidload	viewdidappear
you should not present a view controller in the viewdidload method of another controller because you cannot show a view controller present modally or push when a transition is already occurring push pop present dismiss
my suggestion is that you move the code in your code sample to the viewdidappear method

26295142
google-chrome	firefox
works for firefox ie and google-chrome
from what i can tell the doubleclick action does not work in ie or google-chrome on an option in a select element

26295653
bash	zsh
the character is treated as special in filename expansions in zsh but only if the extended_glob option is set zsh setopt noextended_glob zsh echo head head zsh setopt extended_glob zsh echo head zsh no matches found head zsh bash doesn t have this feature
to be precise bash does have an extended glob feature enabled by shopt -s extglob but bash s extended glob syntax doesn t treat the character as special. with this feature enabled is a special character similar to but with a different meaning

26296582
build.gradle	gradlew
if you download the buildsrc zip attached to that issue and change to use the new plugin apply plugin sonarqube-runner it will pick up sonar runner 2.4 and give you a sonarquberunner task which should work with the latest sonarqube when 2.2 of gradlew is released you can roll back to the old plugin but add a bit to your build.gradle to update the version
looks like it might be this issue with gradlew prior to 2.2 which isn t out yet you can t change the sonar-runner version

26296947
treemap	linkedhashmap
or if you want the keys to be sorted in natural order using keys compareto method then you may go for treemap
the strange thing is when i call the hashmap with the order is completly an other and the keys doesnt fit to the insertion hashmap does not maintain the order of insertion but there is an alternative called linkedhashmap that maintains the insertion order

26298547
swift	objective-c
in swift this is possible and built in you just define your method to return not an optional type and you re good to go
conclusion if you really want checks like this in objective-c there s no magic you only do it at the run time at the same time you could provide context which is great

26299914
bufferedreader	bufferedwriter
if you are reading text file then you should use bufferedreader bufferedwriter instead of reading whole file at a time like this if you are reading binary files then it is suggested to use bufferedinputstream bufferedoutputstream
you cannot read binary data using bufferedreader because it convert binary data into string format your file will corrupt or damaged

26299982
serializable	deserialization
this will tell jackson not to serializable that property
however that means that you have to reference them yourself again upon deserialization and on serialization you have to add something to the json datastructure to know what to reference again upon deserialization

26300158
division	subtract
as noted by andyg your cpuweapon is a string you need to get the damage associated with that weapon so make a dictionary then you can select the weapon by then you can get the damage associated with that weapon from the dictionary although i m not sure why you aren t subtract the damage from your health but i left it as division since that s what you seem to be doing
another reason you may want to subtract is that the value for miss is 0 so you will be dividing by zero which certainly isn t what you re after

26300869
libstdc++	libc++
the missing piece here is that libstdc++ currently has not implemented movable streams
this does compile with libc++

26301825
multiplying	multiplication
after that multiplying by the 0..15 value and divide by n 2 which is the same as bit wise down shift by n
if you do not want to use an integer multiplication and have a few bytes of memory to spare you can use some kind of table lookup with pre-calculated values

26302039
sudo	passwd
and modify anon-access and authz-db and note that i put authz in data so than my multiple repos share it add the following to schedule svnserve on startup sorry couldn t find one so manually make one sudo cp etc init.d skeleton etc init.d svnserve sudo chmod 755 etc init.d svnserve sudo update-rc.d svnserve defaults sudo pico etc init.d svnserve change desc to subversion server change name to svnserve take out the s in the sbin of daemon to make it just bin change daemon_args to -d -r data --log-file var log.svn.log sudo etc init.d svnserver start test your favorite svn client tortoisesvn
svn with sasl enabled on a debian v7 box using active directory on another server note that i already setup samba and winbind which included libsasl2-2 so also get the startup executable and svnserve and modules needed for svn plain or other mechanism to work which just fyi puts them in usr lib x86_64-linux-gnu sasl2 libplain.so sudo apt-get install sasl2-bin svnserve libsasl2-modules sudo pico etc default saslauthd change to and to and not 5 and remove the var in front of run from the last line so that it s control x y enter sudo pico etc saslauthd.conf add the following note you may need an ou folder in front of the dc series run sudo testsaslauthd -u usernamehere -p passwd to test the ldap setup and cat var log auth.log to see log

26302080
rpm	yum
if yum was previously working then it is difficult to see how the rpm module is not installed
take a look in usr lib python2.6 site-packages rpm - that directory should exist and should contain a couple of python files __init__.py and transaction.py and a shared library for rpm

26302401
implements	extends
if the receiver class does not extends from messagelistener and so implements onmessage the inner method methodinvoker from messagelisteneradapter class specifically ask if the receiver is instance of messagelistener see last line of image below
to solve this problem just extends from messagelistener and then you can add the additional adapters directly

26303249
implements	extends
i prefer to implements the listener on the class so you re not storing a variable but do whatever works best for your case
above is the correct answer but you don t need to create a new buttonclicklistener that extends the onclicklistener if you aren t drastically modifying the class

26303303
domcontentloaded	onload
and order of window body events being triggeed depends on when you register the event listeners would result in head - domcontentloaded end - domcontentloaded img onload head - window load body onload end - window load jsbin and not all browsers support document.load
window body onload fires after all the images are loaded

26303807
serializable	deserialization
note that with serviceknowntype applied the class will be serializable even if subitem was not marked with tha datamember attribute here an example service side client side
when you use for the first case given that subitem inherits from item you are telling to your webservice when he expose it s wsdl to take into consideration the deserialization of subitem type as it may be used as an argument for the item parameter polymorphism principal otherwise the receiver endpoints will not able to pass a subitem as an argument for the method even if the type was deserialized on the client side by the datamemberattribute

26304024
client-side	server-side
you can create a server-side app powered by node if you want that will respond to a client-side request and produce the image you want to show
but the server-side code will run on the server-side not in the browser

26304899
apache	nginx
nginx doesn t use it file is ignored and treated like any other and apache config rules don t apply to nginx
.htaccess is an apache config file

26305467
direct3d	directx
there is no support for the direct3d 9 debug device on windows 8.1
the pix for windows tool in the directx sdk does not work for direct3d 10.x or direct3d 11.x on windows 8.1 windows 8.0 or windows 7 sp1 with the directx 11.1 runtime installed

26306497
prng	random
i need random numbers for rsa key generation. this means that a prng routine too often erroneously called rng a pet peeve of mine is unacceptable and will not provide the security desired
an external true rng is acceptable but the most elegant answer is to change over to an stm32f2xx or stm32f4xx microcontroller which does have a built-in true random number generator meant precisely for applications such as this

26311329
google-chrome	firefox
since you get validation errors with firefox and lwp but not with google-chrome google-chrome has probably an additional ca as trusted which they others don t have
from your code it looks like that you are using windows and from my understanding firefox comes with its own ca store lwp uses mozilla ca which contains the cas usually shipped with firefox but google-chrome uses the system ca store

26315145
strcpy	memmove
note you cannot use strcpy because the source and destination buffers overlap
you can use memmove to copy the remainder of the string to the position of the characters to remove

26318653
implements	extends
note this class is abstract because it doesn t implements gettabrenderercomponent ... method
defaulttabrenderer class a concrete implementation by extends abstracttabrenderer class

26318660
realloc	malloc
use this instead that being said if you precalculate the buffer size you can get rid of realloc and use a single malloc
your realloc is not allocating enough memory to hold the data you are copying into the buffer

26319078
bower	npm
for many people working with node.js a major benefit of bower is for managing dependencies that are not javascript at all
if they are working with languages that compile to javascript npm can be used to manage some of their dependencies

26319813
swift	objective-c
kvo cannot function with pure swift optionals because pure swift optionals are not objective-c objects
swift forbids the use of dynamic or objective-c with generic classes and structures because there is no valid objective-c equivalent and so the runtime is not setup to support kvo on instances of those kinds of objects

26319813
swift	objective-c
swift forbids the use of dynamic or objective-c with generic classes and structures because there is no valid objective-c equivalent and so the runtime is not setup to support kvo on instances of those kinds of objects
that type is toll-free bridged to nsstring so it is semantically equivalent to an objective-c type that the runtime knows full-well how to deal with

26323746
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	linux
it looks like that most of users are runing ubuntu as everyone is talking about www-data
as a noob for linux apache i didn t know that default user for apache in centos that i m running on my server is apache and not www-data

26327640
client-side	server-side
i am trying to make a point with this tough.. actually you could even do both client you don t need jquery on the client-side for this in fact you re not using it now and server-side using node.js in pure javascript
but what you really want to do skipping learning a server-side language and sql is probably nowhere supported i wrote probably because

26327655
implements	extends
that doesn t make sense because a concrete class must be concrete and on contrary you are making it implements a generic interface without specifying concrete type for tentity
like i said extends model.student is not the right approach here.. do not declare a new student class

26327883
opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
it works in google-chrome msie and opera s default consoles but not in firefox s however it does work in firebug
if you use console.clear that seems to work in google-chrome

26335476
gif	png
gif is limited to 256 colors and do not support real transparency
you should use png instead of gif because it offers better compression and features

26335476
gif	png
png has a wider color pallete than gif and gif is properitary while png is not
gif can do animations what normal-png cannot

26335481
calloc	malloc
for malloc vs calloc it doesn t really matter
a call to calloc is basically a malloc followed by a memset ptr 0 sizeof mallocd area

26338725
queue	fifo
but even though this actual relation exists i reckon that the point of omitting it it this diagram is that conceptually a deque could be seen as not only a specialisation of a queue
a deque provides you with both the last-in-first-out principle of a stack and the fifo one that a queue offers and representing only the strict actual hierarchy of these classes and interfaces could be misleading

26342407
client-side	server-side
if the id of the client-side element is _ddlmytest then the selector would be if as you suggest the client-side id is different webforms has a history of doing that then you d need to make sure you re using that id
i m not really certain how you d get that from within the context of that stringbuilder in the server-side code but presumably if there s a clientid property then it would look something like or not sure if the characters in the javascript code would mess with string.format though or whichever you think is more clear they all essentially should produce the same result with minor performance differences

26346931
equals	gethashcode
gethashcode must return the same result for any two values that could be equals
it is not however necessary that two strings that are not equals return different hash-codes although it is highly desirable otherwise everything will go into the same hash-bucket

26351410
comparator	comparable
the natural order comparator which is what you get when you use comparing with only one parameter does not handle nulls
i m not sure where you got the idea that it did. the natural order of a comparable class is defined by the compareto method which is used like this obj1.compareto obj2 obviously this won t work if obj1 is null

26351918
google-chrome	firefox
short answer you probably can t get ie firefox to behave the same as google-chrome or even each other
opera is essentially google-chrome at this point even using google s engine not webkit so consider it tested if google-chrome works

26352492
couchbase	couchdb
couchbase lite implements the couchdb replication protocol and is 100 compatible with couchdb
however couchbase server does not require certain document metadata that couchdb documents contain for performance reasons

26354251
fgets	getchar
so fgets doesn t read at all
use getchar

26355892
g++	gcc
it is not valid with g++ but is with gcc time passes the error message with gcc -wstrict-prototypes is instructive
it strongly suggests that gcc is somehow pointing at the c++ compiler and not the c compiler

26356297
prepare	execute
for me it looks like a job for a prepare statement
every execute is called as a single request so you should not be timeouted by requesttimeout

26358197
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
if you are using google-chrome or firefox then the below code will works well to accomplish the task
this code not tested in ie or safari

26358442
realloc	strdup
you can use realloc note that strdup is not a standard function but its available on many implementations
as an alternative to realloc you can use a singly linked list of strings

26361715
jtextfield	jlabel
from the image you pasted it looks like it is a text input control under show info button like jtextfield and not a jlabel
you can use html content with jlabel constructor as well as with its settext method too

26363716
bower	npm
that s because bower does not add variables to the global scope
the version you download is identical to the version that you install via npm

26364809
udp	tcp	sctp	tcp
however if you have legacy nat systems in your network then you may need to go for encapsulating sctp in udp
tcp is not a message only protocol

26364809
udp	mtu	udp	tcp
however note that if you can send a large data by splitting udp will not be able to ensure the ordering of the packets and also it will not be able to deal with packet drops as it does not have error correction mechanism like re-transmission
if you would want to have a message based communication just as in udp but coupled with tcp features like reliable in-order delivery congestion control and also additional improvements features on top of it like multi-streaming multi-homing in-built mtu discovery then sctp should be your choice

26366894
daemons	systemd
they mean that you shouldn t do anything fancy like forking to create a daemons program
your program should just work logging its operations directly into stdout and init systemd like systemd or launchctl will automatically handle everything else including startup shutdown logging redirection lifecycle management etc

26366894
daemons	systemd
googling for something like fork daemons gives a lot of articles on how to create a daemons and you can see that this is not an easy task
certainly you can do something like this in rust because it exposes all of the necessary systemd calls through libc crate

26367243
zlib	libpng
so if you ve installed a newer version of zlib manually in a local directory libtools doesn t find it while trying to build libpng and the error results from the requirement of libpng for a newer version of zlib
the solution is to simply run . configure with ldflags and cppflags set to the lib and include directory where the newer version of zlib was installed

26369127
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome iframe problem when you run this your window will scroll so that the fragment in the window is at the top of your page as you can imagine this causes issues in certain fixed height websites like jsfiddle
it is also unique to google-chrome i ve only tested on firefox not ie firefox doesn t scroll the parent window

26369127
google-chrome	firefox
it is also unique to google-chrome i ve only tested on firefox not ie firefox doesn t scroll the parent window
there is a discussion about it not being in firefox here

26369351
inline	inlining
the comment basically says that if the method contained such an assignment then the jit would currently not be able to inline it
inlining a method means that instead of generating call instructions to a method branch commands to a different code location the jit would instead insert the method s whole body in the place where it is called

26369367
google-chrome	firefox
on google-chrome e.preventdefault is not necessary and what it does is prevent the default form function
on internet explorer or firefox if this is not present javascript will not be able to hijack the form and do what it needs to do

26370111
postgresql	mysql
s order by field in postgresql
since postgres doesn t have an order by field some_column zebra hipo like mysql does - you could try to use order by bang

26370111
postgresql	mysql
since postgresql doesn t have an order by field some_column zebra hipo like mysql does - you could try to use order by bang
like such as suggested on this post simulating mysql #39

26373667
division	multiplication
element-wise division means dividing the first element of one matrix by the first element of the second then the second element by the second element third by the third...until all are done returning a matrix the same size as both the first and second
this is instead of the matrix operation where you invert the second matrix and do the matrix multiplication of the two to return a third matrix that may or may not be the same size as any of the parent matricies

26374568
google-chrome	safari	mp4	webm
in my blocks i was writing the video code like this here was my problem if i put the mp4 line first google-chrome would play the video part but there would be no sound
if i put the webm line first google-chrome would play the video and sound correctly but apple safari would not detect the video at all

26375750
swift	objective-c
swift isn t finished yet and it will surely change over the time until it matures
also concerning the ios apis they are written in objective-c and adapted to work in swift

26381764
innodb	myisam
to be able to guarantee foreign key integrity you can switch to the innodb engine globally specifying this in mysql configuration file my.cnf or locally in the database dropping the tables then re-adding them with the complete mysql specific syntax like note innodb is default storage engine since mysql 5.5 to determine if innodb is available in your setup execute the query show engines
the myisam storage engine will accept foreign keys declarations but will not enforce the constraints

26385275
postgresql	mysql
so the answer is no you cannot do that at the moment but you can access the mysql server from within postgresql instead
according to the mysql create server documentation the wrapper_name should be mysql and may be quoted with single quotation marks

26386806
google-chrome	safari
basically there is a collision in the browser version string for google-chrome starting in 7.1
asp.net believes that you are running an older version of safari browser that doesn t support recent javascript

26388941
rsa	aes
aes encryption of rsa keys will be only supported in pycrypto 2.7 right now there is an alpha version available on the web site
however aes encryption will be applied at the pkcs#8 level binary and not at the pem level the text envelope

26390150
udp	tcp
the procedure of binding is not necessary in either the tcp client or udp client because it does not matter in whatever port the client communicates
till this point it is same for both tcp server and udp server

26390731
implements	extends
there is no setview because views are a pain in the neck to implements and test and that effort is less worth it since the nice properties of sets generally require you to have already eagerly created the entire set o 1 or o log n lookup
contains isn t in iterable precisely because set extends iterable and a set contains should not type check unless you ask for something that could be in the set

26393398
rsa	aes
that s ok if you want to wrap a 256 bit aes key using rsa
but your rsa key is the second parameter not the first

26395067
prng	random
the prng-generated sequence is not truly random because it is completely determined by a relatively small set of initial values called the prng s seed which may include truly random values
although sequences that are closer to truly random can be generated using hardware random number generators pseudorandom number generators are important in practice for their speed in number generation and their reproducibility

26404195
sml	scheme
it even provides a sublime text theme called son of obsidian that you could enable in preferences - color scheme - sml - son of obsidian
but you are not required to enable the theme to work with sml this is just a preference

26412969
swift	objective-c
you have to import the pod header files using objective-c and not swift
so you ll be mixing the two languages if you want to use cocoapods with swift

26413186
matlab	simulink
so to generate c code from matlab you needed to have simulink even if you were not using simulink
i guess that s why they introduced matlab coder in r2011a

26414534
listview	gridview
i don t have a full solution yet but i have an idea since you have to sides to the timeline listview is not appropriate because events can overlap
instead consider using a 2-column gridview

26417855
direct3d	directx
xna game studio does not support direct3d 10 or 11 or 64-bit native
see directx and .net for a summary

26423744
build.gradle	gradlew
therefore plugins that were being included from buildconfig.groovy are being ignored and it was being built using the plugins defined in build.gradle which did not include the asset pipeline plugin
thus the war file being created by grails run-war was different to that created by gradlew war

26425035
subtraction	multiplication
it seems does subtraction and type conversion on the fly
also it seems division with a scalar is not optimized it s faster to do the division once and then a bunch of multiplication on the array

26425046
exponent	modulo
since a larger private exponent requires more storage and at least in the naïve implementation makes decryption slower the smallest possible private exponent is the most suitable
it s not a requirement but there is no reason for it to be larger than the modulo the private exponent d is calculated from the public exponent e and modulo n to satisfy ed 1 mod φ n now if we assume that then we can define and not only is but the above relation still holds ed 1 mod φ n thus d is also a valid private exponent and since d must also be less than n

26426350
client-side	server-side
you can only prompt the user with client-side javascript running in the browser via a tag in the rendered html not the javascript api engine running on the server
but prompt as well as alert etc. can t be used in server-side scripts executed by node.js

26428360
viewdidload	viewwillappear	viewdidload	viewdidappear
viewdidload should really be used for initialization at this stage there is not guarantee that the receiver s controllers view hierarchy has been placed in the navigation tree
if that is your intent you should override viewwillappear or viewdidappear

26429445
namenode	hdfs
though given the little reading i have done about namenode it seems like there won t be a good solution yet for high availability anyways and it is a single point of failure
the second option to explore if you are looking for a clustered file system and not hdfs in particular would be to check out the recent ceph fs support added to the kernel in coreos 471.1.0

26430119
debian	linux	debian	centos	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
or my favorite uninstall ibus if you are not using it. in a debian ubuntu distro should be sudo apt-get remove ibus ctrl+space autocompletion should be back
if your are using a linux distro ubuntu debian centos etc it is due to ibus

26430131
bash	zsh
the ambiguity reflects the difficulty of parsing bash builtins particularly since there is no standard syntax to guide us
zsh sidesteps the issue by not allowing the assignment of arrays in a typeset declaration

26431992
spaces	delimiter
you can specify an optional delimiter as a third parameter note that you pass 50 for the length and get will subtract 1 automatically because it knows about the spaces needed for null terminator
this is a little tricky with character arrays what you need to do is tell cin that you do not want to receive more than a certain number of characters 49 for a 50-character buffer because you need spaces for null terminator

26432446
phpstorm	aptana
probably worth considering an ide such as netbeans or phpstorm or using aptana solely as an editor
there doesn t seem to be any official support for symfony 2 on aptana however this might be of help

26433768
udp	tcp
if you need that kind of reliability then you need tcp not udp or you need to do a bunch of extra work to re-invent the tcp wheel
it s udp

26434010
spaces	delimiter
the tokenizer uses the default delimiter set which is t n r f the spaces character the tab character the newline character the carriage-return character and the form-feed character
delimiter characters themselves will not be treated as tokens. so this means that if you don t specify a delimiter you need one of those default delimiter otherwise if there is not even one of them in the string you give to your program like say you type 1+2-3 4 5 then there is only one token and it is 1+2-3 4 5 but if you put let s say the spaces character like this 1 + 2 - 3 4 5 then your program will print + - because those are the only ones you allow to go in your stack because of the if

26443245
udp	tcp
if it is behind a firewall and can not call out directly with udp it will try to detect a http proxy and use it to tunnel the traffic using a proxy connect request
this means it will use tcp in this case

26443861
lisp	scheme
in scheme unlike common lisp and emacs lisp there are no different namespaces for functions and other values
so the statement you quoted is not true for scheme

26444913
strcpy	malloc
by not allocating enough room for the terminating null character and then performing a strcpy memory may get corrupted
minor no need to cast the return from malloc

26446579
comparator	comparable
your problem is that comparator returns an int value not a boolean
see the java api docs for comparator in interface comparable at method detail comparator returns a negative int zero or a positive int as this object is less than equal to or greater than the specified object

26454387
ffmpeg	handbrake
if the mpeg-4 with h.264 videos produced by videowriter are unacceptable i d recommend exporting your video in the highest quality possible or lossless and then learn to use a full-fledged encoding framework library ffmpeg libav x264 or application to encode to the quality and size you desire
apparently handbrake has support for variable frame-rate encoding though it s not necessarily designed for what you may want i ve not tested it

26455831
udp	mtu
i am not sure what exactly it is that you are trying to test when you say to test udp sockets but most network tests are performed with packets sizes less than 1518 or 1522 bytes for this reason
most devices support mtu mru up to around 1500 bytes

26467886
lapack	magma
since i never worked with magma before i m showing the same code only using regular lapack code adapted from a previous answer i gave
it shouldn t be difficult to convert it to using magma equivalent functions instead

trie	tree
ok this is a very rough draft which you might have to tweak but the general idea is this a trie is used to build a dictionary of words a clstrieiterator class allows tracking multiple words at a time within the trie the string to be tested is parsed one character at a time each one starting a new clstrieiterator all the existing active clstrieiterators consume each next character and if the resulting combination of characters is not possible given the dictionary it stops being tracked here is a short example of the use which outputs the following to the immediate window in vba building contractor upholstery engineer ...and below are the classes
clstrienode is each individual node of the tree

26468820
memcpy	malloc	strcpy	malloc
better use strlen to get the received string length then allocate memory then perform strcpy or memcpy to copy the recived string
malloc sizeof pattern and then not correct

26469181
equals	compareto	comparator	comparable
note that the ordering maintained by a sorted set whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if the sorted set is to correctly implement the set interface
see the comparable interface or comparator interface for a precise definition of consistent with equals. this is so because the set interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a sorted set performs all element comparisons using its compareto or compare method so two elements that are deemed equal by this method are from the standpoint of the sorted set equal

26473876
rcurl	httr
if you re willing to live on the cutting edge of the hadleyverse rvest is handling this quite well i ll poke at why straight rcurl rvest wraps rcurl isn t working
update went one level deeper and used httr another rcurl abstraction it returns the same as above so that s working fine too

26475547
awt	swing
also never do graphics in a jframe s or frame s paint method and you shouldn t use frame or awt components anyway
please read the swing graphics tutorials before going forward with this

26477096
division	multiplication	multiplication	modulo
you combine two numbers into one with multiplication and retrieve them via division and modulo
just remember to be sure not to overflow at the multiplication

26479138
google-chrome	firefox
last i checked in google-chrome it couldn t process the output of webrtc through webaudio while firefox can
however there are two bugs blocking firefox from taking webaudio-generated source streams in a peerconnection one of which has now been fixed in nightly aurora and the other should be shortly

26479578
super	implements
so it makes no difference in this case whether or not you call super drawrect rect
from the documentation the default implementation of this method does nothing.subclasses that use technologies such as core graphics and uikit to draw their view s content should override this method and implements their drawing code there also from the documentation

26480834
super	self
in python 2.7 use class parentfooa grandparentfoo def __init__ self some_important_initialization_code class childfoo parentfoo def __init__ self super childfoo self .__init__ note that another nice properties is that you don t have to use the name parentfoo anywhere in childfoo except when you define inherited for instance in the line class childfoo ...
it also works for other methods class childfoo parentfoo ... def do_buzz self super childfoo self .do_buzz super does not work for old-style classes that is classes that don t inherit from object . this means that with much of the standard library you still have to call the parent class s constructor explicitly

26480834
super	self
it also works for other methods class childfoo parentfoo ... def do_buzz self super childfoo self .do_buzz super does not work for old-style classes that is classes that don t inherit from object . this means that with much of the standard library you still have to call the parent class s constructor explicitly
so in this case class oldstyleparent def __init__ self ... you would have to call oldstyleparent.__init__ explicitly in __init__

26481260
google-chrome	firefox
this works well on google-chrome but looks different in firefox and would need some tweaking to make it match google-chrome
your example is not working in firefox because you are using e.offsetx and e.offsety in your mousemove event

26482123
mri	rubinius
therefore your tests do not run in parallel when using mri
you can get you tests to run in parallel by using a ruby interpreter that supports concurrent threads like jruby or rubinius

26486329
swift	objective-c
swift temporary logging and fixme markers swift does not use a preprocessor so pragma flags and macros are not an option
it is still possible though to provide similar functionality to the nlog and fixme macros used with objective-c by making use of the benign warning treating a forced downcast as optional will never produce nil i ve created some code to do this available under the mit license at here is an example of the usage from the documentation for snlog there are more usage cases shown on the snlog github page

26487724
google-chrome	safari
your example works fine in google-chrome 38 afaict
safari doesn t have support for sizes nor for srcset s w descriptor. webkit nightlies support it but it wasn t turned on in the safari branch as far as testing shows

26489036
punctuation	words
for instance output six-pack he s this that note here i m defining the pattern by using a character class including all posix for punctuation preceded and followed by a words character but negating a character class containing either or -
you can probably work out a set of punctuation characters that are ok between words and another set that isn t then define your regular expression based on that

26489550
prepare	execute
you should not be using mysql_query but rather pdo or mysqli with prepare statements but if you insist on using it escape it first with mysql_real_escape_string fred made a good point in the comments though
this bit of code is going to execute the first time you load the page before the form is submitted and throw an error or warning because doesn t exist yet

26491618
entity-relationship	diagram
an entity-relationship diagram is more abstract
sql server let you create a physical data model diagram that could come from a entity-relationship diagram or not

26491932
swift	objective-c
as a consequence the factory method cannot be called from swift
short answer create the object with details the objective-c factory method is mapped to swift as this is documented in interacting with objective-c apis thanks to nate cook

26493137
client-side	server-side
otherwise is a client-side thing and is not directly accessible in the server-side code
will render tag on the client-side but you can access it in the code-behind through its id

26493270
oncreate	setcontentview
the solution is to move the findviewbyid call to the oncreate method as follows
the textview is not available until after setcontentview is called

26493270
setcontentview	findviewbyid
the textview is not available until after setcontentview is called
so findviewbyid will return null when mainscreen is instantiated

26493673
backtracking	greedy
go s regexp doesn t have backtracking so you can t use like you would do in perl
however if you don t care if the closing tag matches you can use just saw your update is a greedy operator it will match everything in between you have to use non-greedy matching aka

26493768
asterisk	ivr
there are no perfomance issues for 2 e1 just 62 channels on asterisk performance issues can be at voice recognition tts but that is not asterisk part that is tts complexity based tts is not so trivial thing recognition is more complex to not experience any issues you have use fastagi control routine and do cache tts files not re-do tts for ivr again and again with same text
asterisk have no any issues upto 400-500 channels depend of dialplan

26494754
lxml	elementtree	lxml.html	elementtree
update based on the new information that lxml.html is the parsing library lxml doesn t use pure xpath in the same way pure xml libraries might
instead it s a marriage of xpath and the elementtree elementtree that s common to a lot of python xml html parsing libraries salted with a handful of its own homespun approaches

26496530
spaces	linefeed
but the spaces characters including tabulations or linefeed are not valid base64 characters
if some spaces characters has been added to certificate string you could probably safely remove them since they are not valid characters

26498218
punctuation	words
but the words characters can not be changed and do not contain punctuation so we can not use it
if you need to match at the end of line too where there is no space after the words use to include cases where the character after the file name is not a space character but other whitespace like a tab t or the name is directly followed by a comment starting with # use i will illustrate the matching of words boundarys too because that would be the perfect solution except that we can not use it here because we can not change the set of characters that are seen as parts of a words

26498320
grepl	substr
here s one approach using the qdapregex library to see the regular expression used by the function as qdapregex aims to help analyze and educate about regexs you can use the grab function with the function name prefixed with grepl tells you a logical output of yes this string contains or no it does not
grep tells you the indexes or gives the values but values are the whole string nut the substr you want

26499375
implements	extends
in order to make it compile you d have to change to and you ll also have to implements but doing it that way won t give you the flexibility to sort by multiple different dimensions
the issue is that you ve specified in the line that e must extends and country does not

26501442
pascal	delphi
in delphi this contrasts sharply with c++ because c++ classes are basically structs like delphi records with some embellishments meaning that you can declare instances of classes in c++ as member variables where their memory is allocated on the stack in the same way you can declare instances of structs as well as records in pascal
but this doesn t work in delphi even though the syntax looks the same

26503381
spaces	linefeed
as i came here and did not find a good generic solution here is how i did it this replaces comma followed by anything but a spaces linefeed tab.
by a comma followed by a spaces

26507121
fgets	strcpy
also on this line fgets does not return eof but null on error so you need to do while fgets templine 128 filein and on this line head is a pointer you need to fix the type of currnone finally you need to change your initialization function and the call
here you need to strcpy functionin to you can t simply assign to it

26507471
jxtable	jtable
consider the example below see this q a for a related problem jxtable use a tablecelleditor and tablecellrenderer for a specific cell instead of the whole column
however this does not make the jtable boolean renderer to render the checkboxes as disabled for uneditable cell

26508264
bash	zsh
the above works in any bourne-like or posix shell except zsh not just bash
with zsh there s no implicit split+glob operator upon variable expansion unless in sh emulation

26513566
persistent	transient
no methods or persistent instances variables of the entity class may be final
hoever not all implementations follow this rule and handle final fields openjpa does not support final fields they are treated as transient

26515134
cpython	pypy
for a large object this is pretty slow in cpython so it s not just a pypy issue
it is possible that performance is worse in pypy though

26519157
postgresql	mysql
details postgresql crosstab query other rdbms while every is defined in the sql 2008 standard many rdbms do not support it presumably because some of them have shady implementations of the boolean type
not dropping any names like mysql or oracle ...

26523196
daemons	systemd
so you may want to find your daemons script and check it first
if this is not your situation maybe you just downloaded mongodb from somewhere and unzipped it to your systemd and you start mongodb with nothing but mongod this way i guess the default location of mongod.conf is decided by the compiling parameters

26523620
g++	gcc
fork a compilation into a shared object shared library with position independent code so run from inside your program g++ -wall -fpic -g -o -shared genfoo.cc -o genfoo.so call dlopen and dlsym from your main program notice that dlopen do weird things if you pass it a filename without any use the function pointer globfun as you need if you are serious you should dlclose hdl before exiting
if you just want to compile and run a different program things are much simpler just compile the generated program as usual gcc -wall -g genfoo.cc -o genprog and execute it as usual system fork + execve .... if the target system does not have any c compiler but consider also tinycc which is able to compile from a string -containing c code- in memory with its libtcc you cannot do that

26523660
opencv	emgucv
if monodevelop-unity go the solution explorer in the left right click on refrences- edit references- and search for system.drawing in the left column and check it to see it in the right column then press ok also don t forget to change the build settings in unity- file- build settings in this way pc mac and linux instead of webplayer target windows architecture x86 then push the player settings button go to the other settings in the new screen and set api compatibility lavel to .net 2.0 instead of .net 2.0 subset for now you re free to test your script and do awesome work using opencv ps i m not sure why exactly the npp32_50_35 and cudart32_50_35 have to be in the editor folder but it s the only situation that worked for me
this is what i did for everyone who want to use it install this version of emgucv which creates a folder emgucv in c in this folder you will have a single folder named emgucv-windows-universal-gpu 2.4.9.1847 go to bin folder from the bin folder you need to copy all the dlls in the x86 folder 22 dlls and also those in the bin directly 12 dlls emgu.cv emgu.cv.ui .

26523809
daemons	systemd
you can customize the timeout using a systemd property but it would be better to find why gradle is not reusing an already running daemons process
it should do it assuming that the daemons uses the same jvm same set of jvm args and possibly some other constraints

26524829
mtu	icmp
if a transit router decides it cannot send out the packet without fragmentating the packet it will return an icmp destination unreachable packet with error code 4 and the next-hop mtu
the ip endpoint receives the icmp unreachable and adapts its pmtu

26530206
bluestacks	android-emulator
bluestacks and the arm devices you see under avd are not virtual machines
they are android-emulator that translate arm instructions to x86 and that is why they are slower

26532699
scala	typesafe
it shouldn t be necessary to use something that relies on runtime reflection - scala is expressive enough to implement these kinds of things in a typesafe way
scala favours immutable values

26534168
setinterval	settimeout
many issues can come up when using setinterval instead of a recursive settimeout
setinterval will run regardless of weather or not the callback function was successfully executed which means over time you could potentially end up with a hung browser

26537488
super	implements
you need to use the super keyword only if you need to access methods that you have overridden in your subclass or fields that you have hidden which you shouldn t do anyway
the collection.sort method expects either a collection of objects that implements comparable or a collection of objects and a comparator object that allows comparing them

26538127
apache	nginx
if not using apache 2.4 you can remove --with-httpd24 from the above command
if using nginx follow the caveat instuctions for starting fpm to launch php-fpm on startup mkdir -p library launchagents cp usr local opt php55 homebrew.mxcl.php55.plist library launchagents launchctl load -w library launchagents homebrew.mxcl.php55.plist install any php extensions you re going to need eg

26540055
antialiasing	transparent
the first is to turn on antialiasing which you can do like this in the desktop launcher and in the android launcher not in the core project or on desktop however this will not perform very well on a phone if your game has very many sprites at all
a better way to do it is make a sprite that has a transparent border built in

26540340
fgets	atoi
however the second time through the enter key is still in stdin s input buffer because the first fgets did not have any room in to read it so the second fgets fills with n 0 without waiting for new user input
the first call to strtok line thus returns n which atoi converts to 0 then the next call to strtok null fails and returns null which causes atoi to segfault

26541500
namenode	hdfs
it is not possible to have one single namespace or namenode for all the namenode present in the cluster
no it is not possible to have so because each namenode in the hdfs federation would have the separate namespaces and each namespace requires separate and individual standby namespace namenode

26543847
pthreads	fork
if you are absolutely sure you require fork and cannot instead use a more platform independent way of multiprocessing a thin fork createprocess wrapper or multithreading pthreads boost.thread c++11 std thread ... then you are forcing yourself to use cygwin
note that cygwin s fork is pretty much as efficient as fork can get on windows which is not very as the os wasn t designed with that operation in mind hence the kernel level support is missing

26547153
google-chrome	safari
as great as this may sound it yet comes with a few issues that should be taken into consideration google-chrome does not support viewport units for border widths column gaps transform values box shadows or in calc until version 34
safari ios safari both 6 and 7 does not support viewport units for border widths column gaps transform values box shadows or in calc

26548154
gif	png
png new image file format with advantages over gif and jpeg
png use lossless compression of data in a wonderful way the format compress the images so that you will not be able to detect degradation of quality

26549304
union	distinct
to get just one column try a union select ip_src from table union select ip_dst from table as noted in the comments not only will the union remove duplicates between the columns but also those that occur with the columns meaning using a distinct is unnecessary
note that your example only applies the distinct to ip_src

26549682
lisp	prolog
univ is handy because it lets you treat prolog terms similarly to how you would treat a complex s-expression in lisp it converts terms to lists of atoms
this lets you traverse prolog terms as lists which is handy if you aren t sure exactly what you ll be processing

26550339
octal	binary
binary octal decimal and hexadecimal
for example binary base 2 0b100101100 300 in binary the leading 0b together tells the compiler its a binary value not all compilers support this

26550833
factors	matrix
for euclidian the distance then will be for mahalanobis inverse of covariance matrix distance is then so the distances for the classes will be the same as euclidean but with a scale factors
since the scale factors is the same for all classes and dimensions you will not find a difference in your class assignments

26555293
intersect	contains
a little bit more formal approach given y_1 .. y_n are all sorted sets if the intersect of these sets are an empty set and there is an ordering of the sets where for every y_i y_ i+1 set it is true that where x is the last element of the y_i sorted set and means a comparative function then the sets y_1 .. y_n can be read after each other as a sortedset
now if any of the following conditions are not met if the first condition is not met then the definition of a set is not fulfilled so it can not be a set until a deep copy merge is completed and the duplicated elements are removed see set javadoc first paragraph sets contains no pair of elements e1 and e2 such that e1.equals e2 the second condition can only be ensured using exactly the same comparator function the first condition is the more important because being a sortedset implies being a set and if the definition of being a set cannot be fulfilled then the stronger conditions of a sortedset definitely cannot be fulfilled

26557097
swift	objective-c
here s what i did in general comment out recently changed swift code check commits until the app compiles again command-click each called method in the failing line and check if there could be an ambiguity my example in my case i was using the xmppframework written in objective-c the failing code looked like this once i replaced roommessage.nickname with 0_test the code didn t fail any more
so i command-clicked the method nickname twice and here s what i saw my guess was that the swift 1.1 compiler has problems with figuring out which method to call if the exact type of an object is not clear

26558670
dictionary	map
if the content-type is not application json then the formvalueprovider is used to build the dictionary which ignores case and combines the values as the following shows if the content-type is application json then the jsonvalueproviderfactory is used to build the dictionary which in turn uses javascriptserializer to deserialize the request but this throws an exception because of the duplicate case-insensitive keys
you could possibly write a custom javascriptconverter to handle this although i am not sure if that is appropriate because value providers are used in conjunction with model binders to build a model s and your model cant contain both properties foo and foo unless perhaps if your intending to map foo and foo to other known model properties

26559063
vbo	vao
in this case the vbo is automatically unbound from the currently bound vao but not from other vaos that are not currently bound
if other vaos have references to the vbo the vbo will stay alive until all those bindings are broken or the vaos deleted

26559711
swift	objective-c
the uikit interfaces you see are not actual swift implementations they re just declarations that expose objective-c apis to swift and describe their behavior in swift terms
the objective-c attribute exposes a swift symbol to the objective-c runtime

26559967
autocompletetextview	spinner
note as i experienced the last point is correct in spinner not in autocompletetextview
because autocompletetextview is an edittext itself

26562817
mp4	h.264
from the error message it seems like you are trying to wrap h.263 coded video stream and aac codec audio stream into a mp4 file which is not possible because as a container type or transport format mp4 cannot use h.263 video payload in video tracks
it will be working if you wrap h.264 streams to mp4 files in this case you will be required to transcode video track from h.263 to h.264 which will require a h.264 encoder and more computation than the command you are copy mode you are running now

26564845
nfa	dfa
convert this nfa to a dfa
traverse the dfa and see if the final state is terminal or not

26566336
fseek	fread
this has a significant advantage over normal file i o as it is truly random access so you don t need to worry about fseek and sequential read writes etc
while fread and fwrite are thread safe the stream buffer represented by the is not

26570860
google-chrome	firefox
the current implementation in google-chrome is inaccurate as they rely on multiplying the value of math.log x by math.log2e making it susceptible to rounding error source if you are running firefox it either uses the native log2 function if present or if not on windows uses a similar implementation to google-chrome source
the only difference is that instead of multiplying they divide by log 2 instead all the other code is just to cache the results in a table which google-chrome does not do

26570860
google-chrome	firefox
the only difference is that instead of multiplying they divide by log 2 instead all the other code is just to cache the results in a table which google-chrome does not do
this does not have any effect on the accuracy of firefox s math.log2 function

26572188
nstextview	nstextstorage
finally core data model has not a big nsattributtedstring transported property but a nsorderedset of entities each of them representing a unique paragraph of nstextview thanks to nsuuid
it seems it s working. in textstoragedidprocessediting delegate method i m calculating changes made to nstextstorage

26572872
prepare	execute
in a prepare statement and later passing the actual values in a call to execute
this not only speeds things up because the sql statement can be prepare compiled just once but protects the database from malicious data by quoting every supplied value appropriately for the data type and escaping any embedded quotes so that it is impossible to close one statement and another open another

26575191
filewriter	printwriter	filewriter	bufferedwriter
using a bufferedwriter is recommended for an expensive writer a filewriter and using a printwriter gives you access to println syntax that you re probably used to from system.out
but the bufferedwriter and printwriter wrappers are not strictly necessary

26575925
listview	gridview
if the listview doesn t need scrolling use a linearlayout
if the gridview doesn t need scrolling use a tablelayout or gridlayout

26576257
portrait	landscape
if it is not set there then i would lock it down unless you need portrait orientations
the fix for when you have mixed orientations but somehow a view has the presentation incorrect force the landscape mode for the view by setting the orientation mask tutorial here other code examples can be found within the ray wenderlich tutorial below

26578075
setcontentview	findviewbyid
you need to call setcontentview before finding views and pass your xml layout in it setcontentview r.layout.my_acitivty_layout
your views are null because there are not a part of activity at time you re trying to get them through findviewbyid method

26579808
strcpy	memmove
you could replace it with strcpy if you prefer but it should be slower the probably not measurably slower because strcpy has to test each byte as it copies but memmove does not
i use memmove because it is always correct

26580366
apache	nginx
what you verified with lsof only proves that 80 port is occupied by certain process for instance apache or some other http servers
if nginx process is not running and yet 80 port is being used which also explains why you can t start your nginx

26589617
haskell	sml	lisp	sml
the haskell type system has a number of features which all exist in other languages but are rarely combined within a single consistent language it is a sound static type system meaning that a number of errors are guaranteed not to happen at runtime without needing runtime type checks this is also the case in caml sml and almost the case in java but not in say lisp python c or c++
it performs static type reconstruction meaning that the programmer doesn t need to write types unless he wants to the compiler will reconstruct them on its own this is also the case in caml and sml but not in java or c

26590070
realloc	malloc
you should look at realloc since malloc will not keep the old block s data around
also stop casting the return value of malloc

26590287
spaces	delimiter
this seems like a plausible enough assumption if it s a delimiter in a text file usually a comma spaces or tab
it further assumes that the delimiter doesn t occur elsewhere in the input within quotes or something

26591454
swift	objective-c
swift uses arc in exactly the same way that objective-c does
if you re seeing a leak you re probably creating a retain loop somewhere and you would avoid those in almost exactly the same way as in objective-c with the additional option of using unowned but those are very similar to unsafe_unretained so even that isn t a major change

26596401
serializable	deserialization
you should be able to tell jackson which will handle serializable deserialization of json in spring by default what attributes in the response json map to your pojo attributes. another option if you are not sure what attributes are being returned is to just map the json to a map sometime this is the easier way to do custom object mapping when the response json is convoluted or just doesn t deserialize easily
try adding some of jackson s annotations to your page class to help with the deserialization of the json

26598534
bower	npm
because neither jquery nor your plugin support commonjs modules you need to shim them to make them compatible with the bower modules concept
npm install browserify-shim --save-dev add alias for jquery and your plugin to your package.json optional but recommended add bower shim transformation to enable shimming by adding to your package.json configure shims consider in dependencies configuration before colon you should specify file name not shimmed module name

26603483
pickle	dill
pickle doesn t do this b c it usually works with classes by name reference and not storing the class object itself so you have to work with __reduce__ to make pickle work for you
no need in most cases with dill

26603871
nsorderedset	nsset
nsorderedset doesn t conform to sequencetype
nsorderedset is subclass of nsobject and not nsset as one could imagine

26604752
jar	war
this is covered in the documentation about static resources do not use the src main webapp folder if your application will be packaged as a jar
although this folder is a common standard it will only work with war packaging and it will be silently ignored by most build tools if you generate a jar

26612466
setinterval	settimeout
you are also limited to the drift associated with settimeout setinterval
you see settimeout queues something for execution after a given delay but it does not guarantee timely execution

26612555
super	self
note in python3 this would just be super
don t supply the self explicitly in the arguments of method it is not needed

26612827
getdate	datepart
the ssis expression language does not support getdate -1
you will have to use dateadd + dt_str 2 1252 datepart day dateadd day -1 getdate also this should be done for each date part

26613610
super	implements
this one module + extends + super decorator is especially succinct the blog post lists these pros and cons the benefits of this implementation are it delegates through all decorators it has all of the original interface because it is the original object the drawbacks of this implementation are can not use the same decorator more than once on the same object difficult to tell which decorator added the functionality i recommend reading the rest of the post to see the other implementations and make the choice that best fits your needs
thoughtbot has a great blog post on different ways to implements decorators in ruby

26614103
draggable	droppable
few things to note here jquery ui draggable only adjusts the style of an element it does not alter its position in dom so the .item will always be the child of first draggable and since you ve specified the css hover pseudo selector - .droparea hover you ll always be hovering the first droppable while dragging since you re hovering it s child
we can fix this issue by setting highlight class on hover using the hoverclass option of draggable but since you re removing the highlight during drag event the class set on hover will be immediately removed

26616136
bash	zsh
your bashrc file was written for bash
zsh is not bash

26616136
bash	zsh
zsh is not bash
i m surprised zsh is trying to load your .bashrc at all

26616349
octal	decimal
first unix file permissions are conventionally expressed in octal corresponding format string is o not d
rw-r--r-- is really 0644 but in c language for example the latter is in decimal

26616471
build.gradle	gradlew
then your main project build.gradle can use apply from gradlew sharedproperties.gradle and buildsrc build.gradle can use apply from .. gradlew sharedproperties.gradle
in gradlew buildsrc is a different build not just a project within the main project

26619254
innodb	myisam
if you re using innodb that s not the case
depending on what you need this table for you may be able to get away with myisam

26619271
super	self
super uses the type to find the place to start searching from skipping the passed in type
in this case you can just call the parent __init__ directly class c b a def __init__ self print c __init__ b.__init__ self a.__init__ self waaa because your __init__ methods have specific signatures you cannot just use super

26619966
azure	hdinsight
azure table storage doesn t have a map reduce engine attached to it in itself though of course you could use the map reduce approach to write your own
you can use azure hdinsight to connect map reduce to table storage

26621046
fseek	getchar
just to note that the getc function moves the active file pointer to the next position automatically after reading a character so the fseek stdin 0 seek_set
opens the file and sets the pointer at the first char the getc gets the next character in line the h and moves the pointer forward one character c now h the getchar seams to be working not recommended when reading from a file try using c now e and the filepointer is moved to the first l

26624184
move	drag
you will have to implement the logic required to determine if a move is valid or not
the logic should be implemented in such away as to actively reject the drag

26624198
rpm	yum
then show the current version rpm -qa | grep postgres postgresql93-libs-9.3.5-1.52.amzn1.x86_64 postgresql93-9.3.5-1.52.amzn1.x86_64
assuming you re on the amazon linux ami issue the following to get postgresql 9.3 installed the version should then be 9.3.5 update the amazon repository currently doesn t hold postgresql 9.3 so you can t yum update your postgresql on the machine. i have worked around it by installing manually

26624799
postgresql	mysql
obviously you d have to change any views and queries from the postgresql inheritance version to regular multi-relation queries
mysql does not support table inheritance

26626554
portrait	landscape
if the modal controller was in landscape orientation before dismissal the presenting viewcontroller may not return to the origin orientation portrait
the problem is because the appdelegate supportedinterfaceorientationsforwindow method is called before the controller is actually dismissed and the presented controller check still returns landscape mask

26627548
lxml	beautifulsoup
you may consider using lxml or similar which supports xpath dead easy if you ask me
xpath should be the straight forward answer however this is not supported in beautifulsoup

26631400
super	implements
change your class constructor calling the appropriate super constructor
in code while this might work i m not able to test it without all your classes i would like to emphasize one more time that this way to implements a tree table model doesn t feel right to me

26632603
client-side	server-side
you can use for example jsp or thymeleaf if you want to render your pages on the server-side and then just have angular.js manage some small part of those pages on the client-side
but if you want to have your front-end completely client-side you shouldn t need jsp thymeleaf or any other server-side templating technology

26633024
selecteditem	selectedindex
i don t think that this is correct behaviour of the listbox but if i keep this in mind there are some workarounds that i can use dependent on the situation after removing the selecteditem set the selecteditem to a different item in the collection or to -1
use selectedindex instead of selecteditem because this doesn t have such problem

26633411
calloc	malloc
in general your malloc statements should be written as or c doesn t require you to cast the result of malloc calloc 1
c++ does require it since it doesn t allow implicit conversion of void pointers but if you re writing c++ you should be using new and delete instead of malloc and free

26635698
subtraction	addition
based on the fact that subtraction works and addition doesn t i can only assume delvalue is actually a string
when strings are used with the + operator this operator becomes a concatenation operator and not the addition operator

26639712
ssl	https
in former you can directly use ssl or some other way to send data to browser
while in this if you are not using wcf with https and there are some proprietary data going over wires it may be concerns

26642551
memcpy	strncpy
you could also create a memslice function if you wanted which would allow for embedded null bytes but it already exists as memcpy
honestly you don t need a string slicing function just to check for palindromes within substrings with that you can create the following of course if you really wanted a string slicing function merely for output since you technically shouldn t cast a size_t to int and you still want to be able to format the output easily the answer by paul griffiths should suffice quite well or you can use mine or even one of strncpy or the nonstandard strlcpy though they all have their strengths and weaknesses strslice actually works like a combination of strncpy and the nonstandard strlcpy though there are differences between these three functions strlcpy will cut the copied string short to add a null terminator at so copying exactly n bytes before adding a null terminator requires you to pass n + 1 as the buffer size

26644928
opera	google-chrome
however the method hasownproperty can be used to determine if the array has a property called values or not this works for browsers implementing array.prototype.values like opera 25.0.1614.63
google-chrome 38.0.2125.111 doesn t implement anymore array.prototype.values

26646039
ienumerable	iqueryable
ienumerable is suitable for querying data from in-memory collections like list array etc.but not suitable for querying data from out-memory like remote database service collections and paging
so i strongly recommend to use iqueryable in this case

26646265
boost	allocator
in pool_alloc.hpp replace all instances of with it seems like this is a bug with boost not updating their code for c++11 support but the fact that g++5.0 which i confirmed compiles without issues implies that adding this support isn t mandatory going forward
it could be that std allocate_shared is intended to be backwards compatible with the old allocator interface and the crash and compile errors on 4.7 4.8 and 4.9 was that support being broken

26647233
google-chrome	firefox
if you do not want to switch to google-chrome it is worth trying
there is a singular add-on for firefox called angscope which is non-official but appears to be very helpful when debugging angular.js in firefox

26656329
multiplying	division
my compiler provides addition precision with the long double type so i am able to use it as reference for answering this question for double in usual programming practice one wouldn t bother and simply multiplying by the floating-point representation of 180 π because multiplication is so much faster than division. as it turns out in the case of the binary64 floating-point type double almost always maps to π 180 can be represented with better relative accuracy than 180 π so π 180 is the constant one should use to optimize accuracy a double π 180
with this formula the total relative error would be approximately the sum of the relative error of the constant 1.688893e-17 and of the relative error of the division which will depend on the value of a but never be more than 2 -53

26656329
multiplying	multiplication
but even when the real constant you want to multiplying a double by in order to get a double result is one of the exceptions to the theorem the above computation is still clearly very accurate and only differs from the best double approximation for a few exceptional values of a
if like mine your compiler provides more precision for long double than for double you can also use one long double multiplication this is not as good as the solution based on fma but it is good enough that for most values of a it produces the optimal double approximation to the real computation

26659103
clang	llvm
by default the pnacl toolchain builds with a downloaded binary of clang because google s automated builders run ubuntu 12.04 and the gcc on those systems cannot build recent versions of llvm
so there are 2 options if you used chromium s depot_tools to get the native client sources you can easily get a copy of the same compiler the builders use from the parent directory of native_client run tools clang scripts update.sh which will download and install clang in the directory where toolchain_build_pnacl.py expects it

26661249
client-side	server-side
but since the radiobuttonlist was not in the update panel the checked checked attribute for the second item was never getting written to the browser even though client-side the second radio button visually appeared to be selected
therefore when selecting the original item the second time the onselectedindexchanged was not firing server-side because the newly selected index was already indicated as selected in the post event

26661311
union	distinct
you can use union
select item_no qty location from view_1 union select item_no qty location from view_2 or if you don t care about duplicates a more efficient way is union all select item_no qty location from view_1 union all select item_no qty location from view_2 the union will perform a distinct internally where union all will not hence the better performance

26662299
google-chrome	firefox	rsa	dsa
you re right for reasons unknown to me the ec keytype is not supported not working on webkit which both google-chrome and safari are and the only one i was able to get working in google-chrome was the default rsa type
e.g. on firefox however the rsa dsa and ec are all supported as expected

26662299
firefox	safari
e.g. on firefox however the rsa dsa and ec are all supported as expected
especially with new features like this it s a good idea to always check in different browsers and safari is not worth testing in as they either support less or the same as chrome

26663944
virtualenv	conda
if you are using anaconda conda is a better alternative to virtualenv as it manages conda packages which are not limited to just python packages
create a conda environment like this will create an environment with python 3 and all the packages that come with the anaconda installer

26664036
udp	tcp
but that doesn t mean you have to use udp
if you want to send separate messages over tcp you just have to come up with some way to separate the messages yourself a length prefix a terminator or separator a self-delineating format for the messages etc

26664125
google-chrome	firefox
this seems to be how the standard is written so technically google-chrome might be wrong here by working as-is
it seems firefox only supports the content css attribute with the before or after pseudo-class but not with a bare element

26667653
equals	compareto	comparator	comparable
note that the ordering maintained by a tree map like any sorted map and whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if this sorted map is to correctly implement the map interface
see comparable or comparator for a precise definition of consistent with equals. this is so because the map interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a sorted map performs all key comparisons using its compareto or compare method so two keys that are deemed equal by this method are from the standpoint of the sorted map equal

26672373
apache	nginx
it is a feature of apache
so options are the host doesn t use apache and uses nginx headers actually confirm this version even if it apache htaccess parsing is disabled

26675243
inline	inlining
so it s about the inline cache check which is a very cheap operation
what the inlining compiler in development will add is that the cpu call and return are really going to be removed with inlining which will cover the cases where the cpu has not anticipated them

26677943
swift	objective-c
currently we build all our internal reusable components in objective-c and all apps in swift
currently swift support has not been added to cocoapods check out the discussion

26683078
union	distinct
turns out this works which is equivalent to a union all statement in google bigquery
not sure how to do it if you just want a union since distinct is actually not supported in bigquery

26683087
ubuntu	linux
you might need to install it first with sudo apt-get install imagemagick on ubuntu on windows that s not an option unless you install cygwin or something
on both linux and windows you can use the image magick module to access that functionality from perl but you ll have to install the module yourself

26683313
profiling	benchmarking
benchmarking and code profiling
if you re trying to measure the performance of a code sequence particularly if it s very short it can be important to ensure that parts of the benchmarking operations aren t being executed outside the timed sequence

26683457
awt	swing
android does not support swing awt api
so your project should not depend on swing

26684662
build.gradle	gradlew
androidmanifest.xml app build.gradle
you do not need to specify the version information in the manifest manually for an android studio project and you instead have to modify the gradlew build file

26685490
spaces	linefeed
to treat spaces as not a blank line remove .trimend
get-content returns an array so any carriage return or linefeed are lost

26685836
debian	linux
i copy this script on system bin i have not yet succeed to run a xserver but i can use xwindows binaries through the android xserver application i can run update my debian with apt-get upgrade run an apache server with php run a ssh server and all binaries on a terminal including user management i have also a problem with semaphores handling please contact me if you have any trouble
yes i have done that on several rooted machines i set a debian linux on a sdcard by dd

26686574
comparator	comparable
moreover treemap can be used with non comparable keys too provided a comparator at creation time
hashmap does not need keys to be comparable but still implements map interface

26689399
postgresql	mysql
in addition to which if you want to insert like 10k datas at a time then possibly you need to gooogle and comeback to so for an answer on how to insert that many records in least time. sqlite is used mostly for mobile games data storage by browsers like firefox to store data for single users mostly now if you are deciding between postrgres and mysql i would suggest postgresql because not that mysql is bad but depending on the engine you use you may or mayn t have certain functionalities and i really kindof dislike the way mysql handles not null and default values
if you have an application where you are using multitenancy for example a bank application where you have a single user table and then you want to distinguish your user data s from one another on a database level postgresql works best because of its schema support

26689723
bash	subshell
in bash the variable shlvl is not incremented for subshell see abs guide
for nested subshell see bash_subshell

26691551
swift	objective-c
that s not how swift works
you could get away with it in javascript and a bit in objective-c but not in swift

26693520
wildfly	weblogic	jboss	weblogic
consider using role base access control which is available on wildfly and jboss eap 6.3 so that you allow some privileges just to one superuser
unfortunately it s not possible to lock the configuration like for example oracle weblogic does in production mode

26694628
.htaccess	httpd.conf
and then you get the following error in your error log .htaccess options not allowed here open xampp apache conf extra httpd-xampp.conf and find and change allowoverride authconfig with allowoverride all no authentication or authorization will be required after the change unless you specify it in your httpd.conf extra confs or in .htaccess
you may also want to read the apache documentation for the option allowoverride and choose more optimal and secure setting that will allow you to use your .htaccess without causing a server error

26697034
serializable	deserialization
if there are no external libraries available then - as long as serializable deserialization - yield the same result you will probably not have bugs but features .
testing the deserialization with stored external datafiles does also make sense but this does not apply to the serializable imho

26697110
spaces	delimiter
if you re reading the text from a file and you can reasonably assume that the spaces character will be your only delimiter you should use the strsplit method to tokenize each line strsplit allows you to separate any string into a string of substr based on the char delimiter you provide in the first argument
the second argument in the code above is one of the values in the stringsplitoptions enumeration which has values of either none provide all strings or removeemptyentries do not return any substr that consist solely of delimiter characters

26703029
punctuation	words
is character class which also includes # character so class like lets you match w alphabetic characters digits and _ and punctuation one of which lets #grocery be matched even if it is not the last words
your second regex allows # to be only at start of last matched words in string stating with add while in your sentence # exists in words which wasn t last

26705001
realloc	memmove
there are two problems with your code realloc may return 0 on failure in which case the old pointer is still valid
you need not concern yourself with the possibility that it might also return 0 if no space is requested as you request some. you need to multiply the number of elements memmove shall move with the element s size

26705642
multiplying	division
mul with a 32 bit operand will always multiplying eax producing a 64 bit result in edx eax automatically
also your code first performed the division and then the multiplying which is not what your formula says

26705642
multiplying	division
also your code first performed the division and then the multiplying which is not what your formula says
considering the above you could rewrite your code like note that this is integer division so the result will be zero

26705713
cdr	cons
well or will return the very first non nil return from recursion with car or cdr
well when it s not a cons it will evaluate to the intermediate value of a incf of counter when the symbol matches or nil when it doesn t

26705734
client-side	server-side
you cannot do a captcha check on the client-side
you do need a server-side script that would do the check for you

26706015
scheme	racket
if not then just about anything calling itself scheme will do
i think you won t hit that many problems using racket itself until chapter 3 where they start using things like set-car

26706637
daemons	systemd
they cite instances of kludgey frameworks built around daemons where the daemons was not written with an eye towards that management thus requiring an excess of resources to restart it clean up after it etc
they point out and recommend the use of systemd management facility software including smf solaris upstart linux launchd osx and even hoary old init and ttys older unix versions and bsd based distros

26706709
uiview	uiwindow
uiview is more generic than uiwindow and should be preferred
in ios 7 and earlier uiwindow s coordinate system did not rotate

26707104
bash	subshell
if you are learning bash then in addition to explaining that grep -v empnum is what causes the header to be skipped the -v option meaning find lines that do not include empnum there are a few other items to point out
first good bash code utilizes the tools bash provides for reading input and parsing data rather than relying on spawning subshell to run additional programs cat grep cut

26707498
apache	nginx
that is users connect to nginx chosen over apache for the much better performances and nginx makes a request to the node.js app
with this setup you would actually not need to enable ssl in node.js as long as nginx has ssl enabled

26710273
ienumerable	iqueryable
if you can use list dynamic you can use where and select ienumerable t extension methods like below
this does not work with iqueryable because those methods require an expression which cannot be dynamic

26711937
hive	hdfs
in hive when we create a table not external the data will be stored in user hive warehouse
but during external hive table creation the file will be anywhere else we are just pointing to that hdfs directory and exposing the data as hive table to run hive queries etc

26713884
swift	objective-c
sign... search for -swift.h in the release note tests written in objective-c cannot import the swift generated interfaces header product_module_name -swift.h for application targets and therefore cannot be used to test code that requires this header
tests for swift code should be written in swift

26714603
qthread	qobject
considering that the moment of closing the main window is the moment of closing the whole application and considering that you don t need to further do processing after the application was closed you can pass the main window pointer as a parent to the qthread by either passing it to the constructor or using qobject setparent
releasing the resources acquired inside the thread handled by qthread must be handled separately as you can t make the qthread object a parent of a resource managed by it - qthread lives in the thread where it was created and not in the thread it manages

26716903
bash	tcsh
bin bash
the syntax you re using works in bash not in csh tcsh

26717502
implements	extends
if com.example.testbattle.serverside is intended to be your servlet application entry point then go ahead an implements the mentioned interface and all its derived methods onservice ...
such an error reports that you are trying to register pass an non servlet class as a servlet one meaning here that obviousely com.example.testbattle.serverside does not implements javax.servlet.servlet or extends a subclass of it

26720399
division	multiplication
if the offsets were not remembered from segment to segment then they would have to be recomputed every time using at least one division and one multiplication per re-computed index plus conditionals or serious bit trickery
when sieving the full 2 32 number range 8192 segments of 32 kbytes each that s at least 53 583 872 slow divisions and the same number of somewhat faster multiplication

26722394
shadowing	named
shadowing emphasys mine some declarations may be shadowed in part of their scope by another declaration of the same named in which case a simple named cannot be used to refer to the declared entity ... a declaration d is said to be visible at point p in a program if the scope of d includes p and d is not shadowed by any other declaration at p
... a declaration d of a method named n shadows the declarations of any other methods named n that are in an enclosing scope at the point where d occurs throughout the scope of d

26724886
clang	llvm
recalling that llvm is a set of libraries not just optimization passes but also data structures utility modules diagnostic modules etc.. clang also leverages many llvm libraries during its front-ending process
you can t really tear every llvm module away from clang since the latter is built on the former set

26726875
mongodb	bson
mongodb doesn t use json in the first place
it uses bson which is kinda similar to json from the outside but supports more types and more importantly is binary not text

26726875
mongodb	bson	dictionary	map
most mongodb drivers use the underlying language s dictionary hash map type to represent queries note that is a python dictionary not a json string
the mongodb driver pymongo in this case takes that dictionary and serializes it to bson before sending it to the database

26726905
ienumerable	iqueryable
when the model needs iteration the comments class should implement ienumerable iqueryable interface in this case it is not implemented
or the partial view should get a ienumerable iqueryable object as model

26727869
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
you should specify which orientations are supported in the uiviewcontroller and not in the uinavigationcontroller
your life will be very difficult if you use multiple uinavigationcontroller

26729158
dictionary	map
dictionary is an abstract class in java whereas map is an interface
since java does not support multiple inheritances if a class extends dictionary it cannot extend any other class

26729158
dictionary	map
since java does not support multiple inheritances if a class extends dictionary it cannot extend any other class
therefore the map interface was introduced

26729748
swift	objective-c
i was doing this because in the objective-c header file i needed to use a class that was declared in swift the solution was to simply use the class declarative
so basically the error said failed to import bridging header the error above it said file not found above that was an error pointing at a specific objective-c header file namely a view controller

26730417
hex	binary
you have to output the blob as hex then convert it back it binary so that you then can display it in the format you want
the sqlite3 shell cannot display ascii values in a binary data dump

26731796
factors	matrix
this step coerces the factors columns in your data.frame to character
so my suggestion would be to pass two factors vectors edit when you pass a matrix or a data.frame to the x argument that object is taken to be a contingency table which is not what you want here

26732526
exponent	addition
in this case the last 52 bits of the array should be transferred to the significand of the result and the exponent should be set to zero to indicate a denormalized result
short answer if you need to ask you are not going to implement floating-point addition from bitwise operators

26733429
ienumerable	iqueryable
ienumerable is more memory and performance expensive cause it loads everything to memory so you will be able to trace its values this is not a good choice for performance
iqueryable creates a query in the memory that query points to your data but it does not have your data nothing loaded to the memory for this reason you cannot trace it unless you load some or all its query data to the memory

26733971
virtualenv	conda
from the terminal prompt you should create a new virtualenv using the conda statement conda -n new_env_name as is explained in the docs
the virtualenv package does not work with anaconda

26735413
sudo	passwd
sudo sh -c sync probably fails because sudo needs to read user passwd
as it is run from your program and not a terminal it fails to prompt for that passwd

26735413
sudo	passwd
try use -n non-interactive option for sudo and modify etc sudoers so that command you need to run doesn t need to prompt for passwd
better do not use sudo inside your program instead run use sudo to run your app

26736598
jar	manifest.mf
yes gagravarr i discovered that the jar command doesn t use the -classpath argument although you don t get an error if you include it in the command line
more importantly the class-path section of the manifest.mf file uses a space to separate the items instead of the semi-colon

26742602
prepare	execute
demo with php 5.3.10-1ubuntu3.15 pg 9.1 ubuntu 12.04 this produces error sqlstate hy093 invalid parameter number other as a comparison point the same test with emulated prepare statements produces an error with a different error message the one mentioned in the question error sqlstate hy093 invalid parameter number number of bound variables does not match number of tokens make sure you re using a recent version of php pdo
first postgresql itself errors out if we try to execute a prepare statement with a parameter in excess

26744782
vim	sublimetext
long answer it s not that there is anything wrong with vintage but it is essentially binding vim keys to native sublimetext methods
therefore it s useful if you are coming from vim but less so if you are just starting with it

26747093
ssl	https
2 - except of session-based authentication you could also implement basic http authentication and or https ssl to secure user credentials when login
if you are not using https you should use field or form encryption because in wire all are in plaintext

26748018
octal	decimal
actually in python 2.x number literals starting with 0 are treated as octal not decimal so 0011 is actually 9 not 11
and in 3.x numbers starting with 0 are a syntaxerror to avoid the confusion caused by accidentally writing octal numbers

26748021
swift	objective-c
you will then need to create a bridging header file as defined in the swift docs
example #ifndef fun_bridging_header_h #define fun_bridging_header_h #import cloudinary.h #endif unfortunately their objective-c api is not fully interoperable with swift namely their upload api cluploader

26748021
swift	objective-c
example #ifndef fun_bridging_header_h #define fun_bridging_header_h #import cloudinary.h #endif unfortunately their objective-c api is not fully interoperable with swift namely their upload api cluploader
what i ve had to do to make it work was to create a factory class in objective-c for it the interface cloudinaryfactory.h the implementation cloudinaryfactory.m and the updated bridging file #ifndef fun_bridging_header_h #define fun_bridging_header_h #import cloudinaryfactory.h #endif now to use it i hope it helps

26748587
google-chrome	firefox
fyi window.close and self.close do not close the window in google-chrome close windows that were not opened by script using javascript
window.close command will only work in ie but not on firefox and chrome. if you see in your java script console you will see warning on this scripts may close only the windows that were opened by it

26749801
octal	decimal
it s no different from asking a computer to process a decimal number such as you should also be careful with things like 02132 - it is not the same as the decimal number 2132 rather it s the octal variant 2x8 3 + 1x8 2 + 3x8 1 + 2x8 0 or 1114
a leading zero means an octal number which is one that allows the digits 0 through 7 inclusive so while 02132 is a valid octal number 02492 is not because it contains the non-digit in the context of octal numbers character 9

26752189
wildfly	jboss
jboss as7 wildfly for instance will use resteasy-jackson-provider if you don t add a provider to the classpath. jboss 5 does not provide the jax-rs libs as far as i know so there it makes sense to add the resteasy-jackson-provider with scope compile
the resteasy api and runtime is provided by newer versions of jboss

26752904
gridview	sqldatasource
i recommend you change gridview with sqldatasource to sqldatareader if you are not using any orm framework in your application
regarding your question even if you hide gridview via it still saves data in viewstate on page

26753662
ienumerable	ilist
you can also inherit from ienumerable instead of ilist and it works
it seems that sqlite-net doesn t support objects inheriting from ilist

26757308
move	drag
when you move a drag cursor over an application it checks whether is is possible to drop an object or not using available formats and rarely data
if you need to drag more than one object you need to place data describing the objects in the clipboard using

26759428
rational-numbers	fractions
remember that 12.1 is the rational-numbers 121 10
note that this fractions is in lowest terms cannot be reduced by removing common fators of the numerator an denominator

26762063
hive	hdfs
hive stores a list of partitions for each table in its metastore
if however new partitions are directly added to hdfs manually by hadoop fs -put command the metastore will not be aware of these partitions. you need to add partition alter table externalexample add partition for every partition or in short you can run msck repair table externalexample

26762369
wildfly	jboss
like aop exist other changes you can see in how do i migrate my application from as5 or as6 to wildfly and experiences with migrating from jboss 7 to wildfly 8.1 the last link refers to some changes that are not in the official documentation
according documentation replace jboss aop interceptors jboss aop aspect oriented programming is no longer included in jboss 7

direct3d	directx
the most important change is that you must reverse the include lib path order for vs 2010 it was or for vs 2012 2013 it has to be or of course a better option is not spend time learning the older direct3d 10 api at all and use the latest direct3d 11 win32 desktop tutorials on msdn code gallery
in fact i ve posted many of the legacy directx sdk samples there so they work fine with vs 2012 2013 express for windows desktop and vs 2012 2013 pro+ as-is without the directx sdk at all

26766416
ssl	https
but since you are using a proxy you should use the latest versions of lwp useragent and lwp protocol https too because proper proxy support with io socket ssl backend was only added to version 6.06 it might be in 6.04 already if you use debian or a spinoff like ubuntu
while it looks like you are using lwp useragent 6.06 you do not show the version of lwp protocol https

26768766
postorder	inorder
postorder needs to call itself not preorder
inorder needs to call itself not preorder

26770217
multiplying	multiplication
solution currently your script is set to add all of the odd numbers from 1 to 1000. to perform the product you just need to change the starting value of product to 1 and multiplying within the loop however it is faster to create a vector and have the built-in prod function perform the multiplication problem matlab does not by default have enough memory in the default 64-bit numbers to compute the exact value of this product. the number is too large since this is essentially a factorial
you ll find that matlab returns inf for the 500 numbers you re multiplying and it is only finite for up to 150 elements. in fact using floating point arithmetic the number is only accurate up to 15 digits for the first 17 digits using floats integers saturate at that level as well

26771707
vbo	vao
can i bind a different vbo to index 0 just prior to a draw call and have it use the contents of that vbo yes if you bind a different vbo to binding index 0 all attributes with binding index 0 will use the content of that vbo
a lot of examples i find precede calls to glvertexattribformat and glvertexattribbinding with a call to glbindvertexbuffer which should not be necessary if the vao tracks only indices the vao tracks the state set by all these calls so it does make sense to use all of them as part of setting up the vao

26773157
ubuntu	linux
one problem is that the data directory need to have mysql as owner and group in ubuntu
and windows is case-insensitive and linux is case-sensitive so keep all names uniform either the whole name lowercase or uppercase but do not mix them

26774262
bower	npm
instead of getting a remote resource you get a local one it s quicker except if you use a cdn check below answer npm was originally to get node module but with the essort of the javascript language and the advent of bower it has a bit grown up
in fact you can even download angularjs on npm that is not a server side framework

26778114
bash	subshell
from man bash bashpid expands to the process id of the current bash process
this differs from under certain circumstances such as subshell that do not require bash to be re-initialized

26778250
vim	atom-editor
if that doesn t work for you a plugin or custom configuration has corrupted your vim
though you need to escape certain characters to prevent them from being interpreted as regular expression atoms which can be reduced by prepending the v very nomagic atom-editor

26778615
intersect	contains
for searching for segments that intersect a horizontal vertical line i would probably use two intervaltree s
just because you are storing your objects in one structure does not stop you maintaining other structures that also contains your objects

26779648
innodb	myisam
it s because your table directorycolumntags is myisam not innodb
myisam doesn t support foreign keys

26780220
arp	udp
once the kernel not your socket receives the arp reply it will know the targets mac address and can thus encapsulate your ip packet udp is based on ip into a frame for the local physical network with the local and target mac included and send it out through the network card
arp is not a udp based protocol and thus cannot be captured with an udp socket

26780220
arp	udp
arp is not a udp based protocol and thus cannot be captured with an udp socket
have a look at the osi layer and you will find arp at layer 2..3 link..network while udp is at the transport layer layer 4

26780220
arp	udp
have a look at the osi layer and you will find arp at layer 2..3 link..network while udp is at the transport layer layer 4
without arp udp cannot even work in the local network

26780220
arp	udp
without arp udp cannot even work in the local network
if you send an udp packet from your socket it will look into the arp cache of the system to find out the hardware address mac associated with the target ip address at least if the target ip is inside the same local network

26783259
sudo	passwd
it might be wiser to use sudo su instead to directly log in as root instead of the current user since connecting to localhost with ssh seems unnecessary in this case
by default the root passwd is not set

26785494
g++	gcc
your makefile should look more like this all main main main.cpp classa.o classb.o g++ main.cpp classa.o classb.o -o main classa.o classa.h classa.cpp g++ -c classa.cpp -o classa.o classb.o classb.h classb.cpp g++ -c classb.cpp -o classb.o you build .o files from .cpp files and then link .o files into the final output also built from a .cpp file
you need to list all relevant object files when linking and do not need to list them when only compiling which is what happens when you use the -c flag which tells gcc to skip the linking step

26786119
hex	binary
for example np.fix np.array -.4 .tostring .encode hex # 0000000000000080 np.fix np.array -0. .tostring .encode hex # 0000000000000080 that is the resulting numbers are exactly the same but np.fix np.array 0. .tostring .encode hex # 0000000000000000 is different
this is why your method is not working since it s comparing the binary representation of the numbers which is different for the two zeros

26788597
bower	npm
so do the following and try again before yo npm install -g bower grunt-cli
i believe there is a bug in the most recent generator-angularfire where it doesn t list bower or grunt-cli as a dependency

26789472
tabcontrol	tabitem
although this question is fairly old and well answered already i thought i d add this additional answer to demonstrate an alternative way of changing the selected tabitem in a tabcontrol
if you have a view model for each tabitem then it can be helpful to have an isselected property in it to determine whether it is selected or not

26789506
noexcept	throw
c++11 has introduced noexcept throw is somewhat deprecated and according to this less efficient noexcept is an improved version of throw which is deprecated in c++11
unlike throw noexcept will not call std unexpected and may or may not unwind the stack which potentially allows the compiler to implement noexcept without the runtime overhead of throw

26789506
noexcept	throw
unlike throw noexcept will not call std unexpected and may or may not unwind the stack which potentially allows the compiler to implement noexcept without the runtime overhead of throw
when an empty throw specification is violated your program is terminated

26789556
lisp	scheme
accidental infix algol programmers are used to prefix fun expr and infix x cmp y while in lisp dialects all those have one common form and that is prefix all the way fun expr and cmd x y
since scheme can have functions as argument meaning every argument can be put in the first position it might be exactly what you wanted and scheme doesn t know until it gets a number to be called as a procedure that something is wrong

26790379
nexus	artifactory
so since you added tag to your question here s an artifactory online service which provides you with exactly what you are looking for except it s not nexus but artifactory
if you prefer using iaas and not saas you can run artifactory on aws azure or google cloud platform with bitnami

26791268
noexcept	throw
scott meyers discusses the new noexcept in his forthcoming book effective modern c++
the standard throw doesn t enhance optimizability

26791268
noexcept	throw
this is deliberate and makes noexcept a simple crude and very efficient mechanism much more efficient than the old dynamic throw mechanism
in c++11 if an exception is throw from a function marked as noexcept the compiler is not obligated to unwind the stack at all

26793783
jar	manifest.mf
the meta-inf folder contains three files in cert.rsa this is your certificate manifest.mf this is the nominal jar manifest that contains the hashes for all files referenced in the apk cert.sf is the signature file for all entries in the manifest.mf as well as the manifest file as a whole if you change any file in the apk it s hash will change and signature verification will fail
as far adding arbitrary files to an apk android will only permit you to access files that are in the manifest.mf and since you can not change this file without breaking its hash you are effectively unable to add any files to the apk as well

26794399
prepare	execute
it is not uncommon to see javascript code begin with a wait for the dom to be fully loaded and prepare
for example a script that starts should be read as execute the function called and pass it an annonymous function that should be run when the dom has loaded

26796017
jar	manifest.mf
so no the jvm does not extract a jar to temp files classes and resources are simply loaded on demand
a jar file is basically a zip file with a predefined entry meta-inf manifest.mf this is only mandatory in case of an executable jar

26797009
jar	manifest.mf
no the jvm extracts the jar file to the memory and not to the file
it reads the manifest.mf inside meta-inf which has an entry for the main class

26797966
ssl	https
the only way to avoid this is to use ssl all the time - this gives websocket the best chance of working
check this out this is almost certainly due to not using https ssl

26797981
google-chrome	firefox
this returns 14 06 2014 in google-chrome
update firefox and ie wouldn t swallow 14-jun-2014

26802455
google-chrome	firefox
ah according to the docs the shim doesn t support true iterables another approach that works in firefox but but again not in google-chrome is the spread operator .
edit in google-chrome 46 and possibly earlier all of array.from and the .

26804450
bash	subshell
so for a pure bash solution printf s t n -1 or if you need to store the result in a variable var printf -v var s t -1 no external programs and no subshell
since bash 4.3 it s even possible to not specify the -1 printf -v var s t but it might be wiser to always give the argument -1 nonetheless

26805583
setcontentview	findviewbyid
update sorry no code tag i update from phone you should use r.layout.dialog instead of r.id.dialog in your setcontentview method
this error occurred because you try to do findviewbyid on view s that not exists in your activity but exists in your dialog

26806294
google-chrome	firefox
testing results on testing the above snippet ie 10 and firefox yielded me the same result which is selecting the last option from the drop down however google-chrome seems to be bugged as it always selected the next option from the original selection
the results from ie 10 and firefox made a little sense as to not maintaining the state however google-chrome behavior seems like a bug

26812376
google-chrome	firefox
the effect of that varies in google-chrome the swf is loaded but flash s externalinterface is blocked so the swf can t be told to do anything
in firefox the swf doesn t even get loaded

26814496
mongodb	bson
mongodb 4.x and upwards there were some additions to date aggregation operators since the original writing but from mongodb 4.0 there will be actual real casting of types as opposed to the basic math tricks done here with bson date conversion
for instance we can use and as new helpers here that s a bit shorter and does not require defining an external bson date for the epoch value as a constant in defining the pipeline so it s pretty consistent for all language implementations

26816676
implements	extends
novel extends storage and since it s not abstract it must implements readfromxmlfile but since it implements it as a private method the storage constructor can t call it
beside that the constructor of storage assumes that any sub-class of storage would implements istorage since it casts this to istorage

26819039
opcache	apc
i m not sure about debian flavors all my searches return the pecl library while opcache is native to 5.6 but in centos you have to install the php-opcache package which contains the opcahce.so file
apc is more or less a deprecated package the last release 3.1.14 was unstable and had to be rolled back

26819699
uiview	calayer	uiview	subviews
so if a uiview has subviews these show above the uiview s layer and its sublayers
the calayer and its sublayers if any is a representation of a uiview but not its subviews

26819699
uiview	calayer	uiview	subviews
the calayer and its sublayers if any is a representation of a uiview but not its subviews
each subviews has its own calayer

26819741
swift	objective-c
so while we d have to call the method like this in objective-c in swift we should instead be simply calling wxmediamessage
in objective-c this is the equivalent to calling it s important to note that the actual factory method doesn t get called when we use the swift default initializer

26820147
swift	objective-c
in swift it looks like this hope this helps the next guy or gal
i was porting some objective-c code to swift and could not get the didsendbodydata method to be called

26820202
g++	gcc
then when asked to optimize with g++ -wall -o2 a compiler generally do some loop unrolling as if it copied and constant-folded a loop s body several times
with gcc you might help the optimizer by using __builtin_expect with #ifdef __gnuc__ #define my_unlikely p __builtin_expect p 0 #else #define my_unlikely p p #endif and then you ll code at last manually optimizing your code might not worth the pain you should benchmark

26820712
swift	objective-c
you can find the web version of the swift programming language on developer.apple.com
ditto for the other apple swift ibook using swift with cocoa and objective-c and a lot of other documentation swift-specific and otherwise that isn t on ibooks

26828054
hive	hdfs	namenode	hdfs
for more details see by default hive create tables according to your configuration of namenode i.e hdfs localhost 9000 user hive warehouse
later if you change the configuration of namenode i.e if you change fs.default.name property to hdfs hostname 9000 in core-site.xml also in hive-site.xml and try to access table by executing select query it means you are trying to search at previous location i.e hdfs localhost 9000 user hive warehouse to which your namenode is not connected

26828054
hive	hdfs	namenode	hdfs
later if you change the configuration of namenode i.e if you change fs.default.name property to hdfs hostname 9000 in core-site.xml also in hive-site.xml and try to access table by executing select query it means you are trying to search at previous location i.e hdfs localhost 9000 user hive warehouse to which your namenode is not connected
currently your namenode is connected to hdfs hostname 9000 that s why it gives you call from oodles-latitude-3540 127.0.1.1 to localhost 9000 failed on connection exception in my case i changed my hive-site.xml file like this now when hive creates table it will choose value of fs.default.name from here

26830405
heroku	openshift
i know this isn t a normal answer but i ve tried to get websockets working on heroku for more than a week
after many long conversations with customer support i finally tried out openshift

26832443
jar	manifest.mf
so you should check if your spring core jar has a correct manifest.mf in the folder meta-inf
it may also be the case that you have the correct manifest.mf but the metadata can not be retrieved by the classloader

26833180
exponent	addition
that isn t what you want at all as the exponent and coefficients remain constant throughout a program that has to evaluate those functions many times and you really don t want to ask for the values again each time
here are some pointers to getting perl code working in general write your program in tiny chunks -- a line or two at a time -- and check after each addition that the program compiles and runs and produces the expected results

26834064
opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
please not this currently works in google-chrome and opera only with partial support in safari
firefox and ie do not support that feature yet

26834430
namenode	hdfs
not sure if the question is exactly the same problem i checked the log files generated by the data-node usr local hadoop-2.2.0 logs hadoop-mrp-datanode-mrp.local.out and found the following entry 2014-11-09 17 44 35 238 fatal org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.namenode.namenode exception in namenode join org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.common.inconsistentfsstateexception directory private tmp hadoop-kthul dfs name is in an inconsistent state storage directory does not exist or is not accessible. based on this i concluded that something is wrong with the hdfs data on the datanode
i deleted the directory with the hdfs data and reformatted hdfs rm -rf private tmp hadoop-kthul hdfs namenode -format now i am up and running again

26835724
aggregate-functions	sum
i think you should change the first few lines to this here is info on aggregate-functions and parameterized queries
as liang hinted at if you want the sum of ratings you can change your sql query to that way you can just store an int that is returned and not have to worry about anything else

26836768
libstdc++	libc++
thus the problem was one of compatibility between the two libraries --- std future_error had a different mangled name in both and at runtime when i was using libc++ the symbol from libstdc++ couldn t be found
the proper solution for this problem which i bit the bullet and did was to re-compile any library in this project using libc++ as the the two implementations of the standard library are not in general compatible

26839731
n-gram	words
as inspectorg4dget said in the comments you rarely go to the high n-gram n 5 or n 6 because you will not have enough training data to make it worthwhile
in other words almost all of your 6-grams will have an occurrence count of 1

26840054
udp	tftp	udp	tcp
udp does not have anything equivalent to tcp s sequence number acknowledgement number mechanism to let you track packets and detect packet loss
if the higher-level protocol that s running on top of udp rtp tftp etc. has some sort of identification number or sequence number or block number that is unique per packet and that changes in a predictable way then you could display that number in a custom column and manually look for missing numbers but there is no way in the udp protocol itself to identify missing packets

26845478
queue	fifo
there s not a generic setting for perform sync tasks first or for setting relative priority between enqueued blocks in a single queue
to recap what may be obvious a serial queue is going to work like a queue fifo

26853168
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
subclasses of exception other than runtimeexception will not
exception has subclasses that are unchecked-exception runtimeexception extends exception

26854544
stateless	stateful
you are correct in that moving your state to a different layer means your application is stateful there are very few truly stateless applications mostly only ones doing pure math
that doesn t mean individual layers can t be stateless and those layers that are will scale differently than the stateful layers

26854544
stateless	stateful
that doesn t mean individual layers can t be stateless and those layers that are will scale differently than the stateful layers
the idea is that by making a particular part of the application stateless you will be able to scale it horizontally instead of vertically thus able to respond to many more requests by simply buying more hardware

26858826
wildfly	jboss
the gelf library has connectors for logback and a connector for jboss wildfly
logs of your jboss and your application can be sent over the same channels so you do not need to parse logfiles anymore

26860086
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
according to your comment the view controller at index 0 is a uinavigationcontroller which naturally also does not respond to setsports because just like uitabbarcontroller it is a class provided by apple and doesn t know about this method
now you need to find out where in this uitabbarcontroller your custom view controller play is located

26861125
jar	manifest.mf
your ejb module cannot find the interface cwmdf0015e the class loader cannot load the com.service.ejb3.ejb.monitoringremote it is probably defined in the other jar
you need to fix classpath in the manifest.mf file for your ejb module to point to correct jar

26864158
google-chrome	firefox
alternatively -- try debugging in google-chrome
if firefox is v33 or newer then yes firefox has removed old api for javascript debug and jetbrains browser extension ide does not support new one yet

26864169
hive	hdfs
every mapreduce tools has its own notion about hdfs data example pig sees the hdfs data as set of files hive sees it as tables
with having table based abstraction hcatalog supported mapreduce tools do not need to care about where the data is stored in which format and storage location hbase or hdfs

26864482
prepare	execute
that option is not enabled by default and it has a big downside of its own it makes the query plan for a prepare statement depend on its bound values so sqlite will re-prepare the statement much more often
possibly every time it s execute i don t know the details tl

26868194
uigesturerecognizer	uibutton
i d recommend the programmatic uigesturerecognizer for a quick setup and go
i ve not run into that problem before but you may want to consider adding a uitapgesturerecognizer to your viewcontroller s main view and using that for detecting your taps instead of a uibutton

26869400
innodb	myisam
see you can recover the structure using the .frm files with some file trickery but you will not be able to create them as innodb tables at first
here s a blog that covers a method for recovering .frm files as myisam tables you won t be able to use pma for this

26869486
rsa	aes
in general rsa is not fit to encrypt data directly because its deterministic encryption means you can always test values against the given ciphertext there are certain other undesirable algebraic properties and rsa itself is hideously slow
instead rsa is usually used in a hybrid encryption scheme where only a symmetric key for aes or salsa20 etc. is exchanged via rsa and the use data is encrypted symmetrically

26870652
ssl	https
fyi for others battling lwp 500 erors some lwp 500 errors are apparently caused by another type of ssl problem which isn t solved with the verify_hostname setting
instead lwp may be communicating with the https server but the response is not what lwp expects

26873548
swift	objective-c
note that you cannot subclass a swift class in objective-c
instructions from the apple website to import swift code into objective-c from the same framework under build settings in packaging make sure the defines module setting for that framework target is set to yes

26875103
pandas	seaborn
this feels like buggy behavior in pandas with not all of the keyword arguments getting passed to both axes
but if you want to have the grid off by default in seaborn you just need to call sns.set_style dark

26875143
urllib	httplib
the simple answer to your question is you re right neither httplib nor urllib has public built-in functionality to do this
also you really shouldn t be using urllib for most things in particular for urlopen . of course you can always rely on implementation details of those modules as in lukas graf s answer

26875907
elasticsearch	kibana
it won t work although the azure search service utilizes elasticsearch in the back end it does not expose the elasticsearch api
that said the elasticsearch sdks and tools like kibana will not work with it out of the box

26876444
uiview	subviews
make sure that you put ssdview and hddview at the top of the parentview so that each uiview s top bounds are flush
also make sure that you did not drag one of subviews into the other

26877549
implements	extends
spring data mongodb does not do that yet and there are many things lacking from common operations that are even only implements under
the issue for tracking implementation of any support is here for the rest of the world it looks like this to get that sort of thing to work under a mongotemplate aggregation you need a class extends aggregation operations that can be built from a dbobject then you can define the group as a dbobject and implement in the aggregation pipeline that allows you to come up with a pipeline that is basically the same as the shell representation above

26878163
swift	objective-c
because it requires passing of c callback function and swift does not support it currently xcode 6.1.1
then i had to fallback to objective-c and wrap it again

26879031
openmpi	mpich
in the current releases of openmpi i don t believe there is any support for that sort of failure citation needed though there is work to improve that ongoing
in the current version of mpich you can pass the flag -disable-auto-cleanup to mpiexec and it will not automatically clean up your application after a process node failure

26885915
portrait	landscape
i can see you have accepted an answer which doesn t solve your problem entirely this will force your app to be portrait on both phones and tablets
you can have the app forced in the device s preferred orientation by using this will lead to forcing your app to portrait on most phones phones and landscape on tablets. there are many phones with keypads which were designed for landscape mode

26887089
gruntjs	package.json
create a file named 1.js and run gruntjs you will see your new task running hinting the .js files see this nice beginners-guide-to-grunt tutorial to understand the concepts of node_modules package.json gruntfile.js
gruntjs by its self doesn t have the init command

26887089
gruntjs	package.json
gruntjs by its self doesn t have the init command
in order to use gruntjs you need a gruntfile.js and package.json files updated you can set up gruntjs with these simple steps 1 npm init after running the above command you will be prompted with some questions

26888322
freebsd	linux
the linux implementation of sockaddr doesn t have sa_len as a member but the freebsd version does
apple s implementation is based off of the freebsd version parts of os x pull from freebsd and netbsd hence why you re receiving that error

26889517
clang	llvm
emscripten s llvm + clang implementation fastcomp is based on clang 3.3 at the moment emscripten version 1.26 . so the answer is no emscripten doesn t work with c++14 for now
update starting from version 1.28 emscripten uses clang 3.4 so c++14 features are available in this version

26896020
viewdidload	viewdidappear
this method of centering doesn t work in viewdidload
putting generatescrollview into the viewdidappear animated bool method instead of viewdidload did the trick for me

26898411
profiling	debugging
now if i m not mistaken you ll get the no provisioning profiling found for this executable message or something like that
you need to change the code signing identities in the build settings of your xcode6. change everything code signing identity debugging any sdk any ios sdk release any ios sdk to ios developer and set provisioning profiling to automatic

26900719
super	extends
you should read how the super keyword and inheritance works in java
getting the superclass or the class your class extends is not really necessary in the general case

26902428
udp	tcp
udp does not care and will deliver the packets in this order to the application
in tcp data have a sequence number so the receivers operating system will detect reordering and forward the data to the application in the correct order

26903204
listview	gridview
note you are not using the convertview passed to getview method of your adapter this is generally not good for listview gridview
you can search listview adapter convertview in google and you will find plenty of articles introducing it

26903204
onclicklistener	onitemclicklistener
nb you do not need to set the onclicklistener for each view of your list item really
instead you can directly set onitemclicklistener for the listview and switch the fragment there

26904696
rsa	aes
now the random key for aes is at most 256 bit big so it will fit into rsa with 1024 bit key it doesn t fit into a 512 bit key because of padding
you encrypt the aes key with your public key and send the encrypted key along with the encrypted data

26910173
decimal	ieee
xml schema itself does not impose minimum and maximum values on xsd decimal definition decimal represents arbitrary precision decimal numbers. the value space of decimal is the set of the values i 10 -n where i and n are integers such that n 0
contrast this with xsd float which corresponds to ieee single-precision 32-bit floats. implementations on the other hand may support limits to the range of xsd decimal note all minimally conforming processors must support decimal numbers with a minimum of 18 decimal digits with a totaldigits of 18

26911208
swift	objective-c
note that you cannot subclass a swift class in objective-c
you should import project-swift.h in appdelegate.m not .h in appdelegate.h you can use forward declaration class and protocol like appdelegate.h appdelegate.m #import appdelegate.h #import project-swift.h implemetation appdelegate .... end project-bridging-header.h #import appdelegate.h any.swift the document says to avoid cyclical references don t import swift into an objective-c header file

26911208
swift	objective-c
you should import project-swift.h in appdelegate.m not .h in appdelegate.h you can use forward declaration class and protocol like appdelegate.h appdelegate.m #import appdelegate.h #import project-swift.h implemetation appdelegate .... end project-bridging-header.h #import appdelegate.h any.swift the document says to avoid cyclical references don t import swift into an objective-c header file
instead you can forward declare a swift class to use it in an objective-c header

26911413
swift	objective-c
swift probably does not include enough runtime type information to check for protocol conformance
protocols are really only a compile-time thing and objective-c includes extra tables in the built product that aren t strictly necessary for running the program to allow determining conformance

you should probably let the api manage its own domain objects and in your project map those objects to custom model or viewmodel objects as necessary whenever working with viewmodels try to remember that mvvm or mvp is a pattern for your ui not a pattern for business logic
presenter should call other classes which should be regarded as outside the mvvm mvp mvpvm pattern to do their business logic

26912197
ssl	https
if your page is not displayed on https requests it is more likely that your web service is not properly configurated for ssl and the request are not directed to the public index.php
http and https requests are processed within the framework equal

26919957
ocaml	racket
also in ocaml there re things like row polymorhism classes functors and modules that do not have direct correspondence in typed racket afaik
the main difference for me is that ocaml type system will always infer a most general type for you so that you do not need to add type annotations with some small exceptions in objective part of the language

26924388
coalesce	isnull
the isnull return value is always considered not nullable assuming the return value is a non-nullable one whereas coalesce with non-null parameters is considered to be null
so the expressions isnull null 1 and coalesce null 1 although equivalent have different nullability values

26924388
coalesce	isnull
-- this statement fails because the primary key cannot accept null values -- and the nullability of the coalesce expression for col2 -- evaluates to null
create table #demo col1 integer null col2 as coalesce col1 0 primary key col3 as isnull col1 0

26924388
coalesce	isnull
create table #demo col1 integer null col2 as coalesce col1 0 primary key col3 as isnull col1 0
-- this statement succeeds because the nullability of the -- isnull function evaluates as not null

cagradientlayer	calayer
unfortunately cagradientlayer doesn t support radial gradients
the only way to do that is to subclass calayer and do the drawing yourself

26926082
swift	objective-c
here an example on how to do it using objective-c as least as possible objective-c wrapper for cfunctionpointer to a swift closure
currently there is no way convert swift functions to c functions so it is not possible to do this only with swift

26927143
swift	objective-c
there s been a edit-suggestions that want to use this instead for swift 4 i ve not tested this from objective-c though
before swift 2.1 just put objective-c yourclassname in your swift class and you can use nsstringfromclass like this nsstringfromclass yourclassname.self it should also work from objective-c then

26927143
swift	objective-c
before swift 2.1 just put objective-c yourclassname in your swift class and you can use nsstringfromclass like this nsstringfromclass yourclassname.self it should also work from objective-c then
swift 2.1 with swift 2.1 a comment to this answer states that this is sufficient and just use i have not tested this from objective-c code myself though

26927718
super	self
super a ... will look at the mro find a then start looking for __init__ on the next baseclass not a itself
for c the mro is c a b object so super a self .__init__ will find b.__init__

26927718
super	self
in that case just the one super c self .__init__ call would be needed and the next class in the mro order would take care of chaining on the call
putting it differently when you use super you can not know what class will be next in the mro so that class better support the arguments you pass to it

26929318
gson	jackson
gson afaik doesn t have a built-in for this but its not hard to build a method that will traverse gson s objects
you have an example in this blog as you seem to be open to alternatives take a look at jackson as well the two libs are the de-facto standard in java

26932385
opus	speex
if you set that modified sdp locally and send it to your peer and if they support pcma...does not have to be default for them as the negotiation will force pcma if you only offer it then pcma will be your audio codec and not opus
couple of asides the sdp i am talking about is the one generated and passed through the success callback of the createoffer and createanswer functions of the peerconnection this type of idea will work for adding codecs that you know are supported by the underlaying systems h264 speex etc.

26933488
trie	tree
the isend killswitch is set when the word ends but it s not the end of the trie or the search
the words are stored lexicographical into a tree or hashmap

26934118
ubuntu	debian
it doesn t work on ubuntu 14.10 and works on ubuntu 14.04
i use mysql-workbench on debian wheezy with the expected behavior

26934168
translation	localization
since xliff is a standardized file format this means translators and translation tools do not need to understand apple s internal strings format
here s an example of the resulting xliff document produced by exporting the above referenced swift project for localization

26934573
ubuntu	debian
it doesn t work on ubuntu 14.10 and works on ubuntu 14.04
i use mysql-workbench on debian wheezy with the expected behavior

26941275
factors	matrix
otherwise x and y must be vectors or factors of the same length
cases with missing values are removed the objects are coerced to factors and the contingency table is computed from these. you cannot and should not perform a chi-squared test with missing values included in your vectors matrix because it would lead to erroneous results

26941325
build.gradle	gradlew
so you are including a method somewhere in your build.gradle file that is not supported by your program
for example make your dependencies this which is the same as writing dependencies.nothing this.does.nothing.build gradlew 0.7.+ and you will see an error saying unsupported gradlew dsl method found nothing

26944900
comparator	comparable
you can compare your object to different objects using instanceof inside comparator object o but you need to specify how the comparison should be handled with a specific object java will not guess for you
if your class implements comparable you can add a public int comparator object o function

26948540
vmware	virtualbox
for more information see these links unable to use hyper-v platform inside a windows 8 virtual machine how to enable windows server 2012 hyper-v role in vmware and some useful topics on virtualbox forums which explain why the feature is not available on virtualbox t 20589 t 52625 p 304452 i really miss this feature on virtualbox because i find vmware to be bloated and it slows the host system down much more than virtualbox does
as far as i know virtualbox does not support it but vmware does even in their free vmware

26948540
vmware	virtualbox
as far as i know virtualbox does not support it but vmware does even in their free vmware
i have been running windows phone 8 emulator in vmware without problems

26949038
icmp	tcp	mtu	icmp
the tcp layer may come to know of the path s mtu value even though the icmp message is not layered upon tcp
it s up to the implementation of os the network stack to notify the tcp layer of the mtu so it can then use this value to update its mss value

26949038
icmp	tcp
however once an icmp fragmentation needed and df set error message is received by a host its behavior as dictated by the lower layers is not conclusive
rfc 5927 section 2.2 refers to rfc 1122 section 4.2.3.9 which states that tcp should abort the connection when an icmp fragmentation needed and df set error message is passed up from the ip layer since it signifies a hard error condition

26949038
icmp	tcp
for conclusion i think that the specification is not definitive in regard to the required behavior from a host upon receipt of an icmp fragmentation needed and df set error message
my guess is that both layers ip tcp are notified of the message in order to update their mtu mss values respectively and that one of them takes upon the responsibility of retransmitting the problematic packet in smaller chunks

26950482
sudo	passwd
splitting this off from the other answer since there are multiple questions within this post once you connect to your gce vm using putty or gcloud compute instances ssh or even clicking on the ssh button on the developers console next to the instance you should be able to use the sudo command
note that you shouldn t be using the su command to become root just run and it should not prompt you for a passwd

26951767
shadowing	named
the global keyword when used in a non-global scope allows you to rebind the named to a different object and have that rebinding take effect in the global scope too otherwise you would simply be defining a new variable in the local scope which would indeed be shadowing the original variable
shadowing isn t a technique or a tool it s something that is simply a consequence of python s scoping rules

26954548
hex	binary
if you use binaryencode on your query column and convert the binary to hex you can see it is the same value
update unfortunately i do not think you can easily convert the cfdump representation back into binary

26955647
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome did not display the html-document generated with xml data
firefox and safari however did the job. doing some research i found out that i have to start google-chrome this way go to the terminal and and start google-chrome with the allow-file-access-from-files - flag by typing in google chrome.app --args --allow-file-access-from-files for those who have the same problem here is a demo

26957734
comparator	comparable
the comparator in your case would hold the logic of how to compare two instances
you should read the docs of the treeset constructor you are using you are adding a to your but doesn t implement comparable

26959088
httphandler	httpmodule
the integration guide shows how to use a httpmodule to initialize httphandler
a httpmodule however doesn t get created per request

26964218
ssl	https
optional be sure your web servers are running in a private subnet with only private ip addressed and no route to the internet gateway if you really need to have an end-to-end ssl tunnel between your client and you backend servers for example to perform client side ssl authentication then you ll have to configure your load balancer in tcp mode not in http mode see support for two-way tls https with elb for more details more details ssl load balancers load balancers in vpc
elastic load balancer can not forward your https requests to the server

26964250
prepare	execute
you are not using prepare or query correctly here
prepare is used to create a prepared statement that gets ran with execute and query is used to run an sql query string

26964441
google-chrome	firefox
only google-chrome exhibits this kind of behaviour you will not see this in firefox or ie
and this case is only for an empty input field in google-chrome

26964450
firefox	safari
also note firefox doesn t support mp3s as far as i know so you ll need to supply .ogg files for it
conversely safari doesn t support .ogg

26964725
swift	objective-c
what we can do is to implement the suggested myscrollviewprivatedelegate in objective-c don t forget to import it in the bridging header file and the scroll view subclass in swift like the following myscrollview.swift myscrollviewprivatedelegate.h myscrollviewprivatedelegate.m
i don t know about any 100 swift solution for this. taking this objective-c answer to the same problem and trying to port it to swift it turns out that is not possible since nsinvocation is not available in swift

26964821
oncreate	findviewbyid	oncreate	setcontentview	setcontentview	findviewbyid
for more explanation probably not to judge ofc you are familiar to call findviewbyid in the method oncreate of an activity but before that you did call setcontentview
after setting the content by setcontentview android knows where to search for the id when you call findviewbyid

26964821
setcontentview	findviewbyid
you won t be setting the content by setcontentview instead you have to prepare a view and return it on oncreateview and let the android set the content as it wishes
be careful on lines you are calling findviewbyid above there you haven t return the view yet so android does not know where to search as you call findviewbyid

26965138
udp	tcp
unlike tcp a udp read is an all-or-nothing operation either a whole udp message is read or an error occurs there is no in-between
if you are missing data then either the os is not providing it such as if it belongs to the udp and or ip headers or you are not reading data from the adata parameter correctly

26966525
comparator	comparable
provide your own comparator of the jxtable row sorter implementation.
okay after much digging i ve found two things one jxtable has it s own row sorter which wraps the default one and two because defaulttablemodel returns object.class by default from getcolumnclass these things are getting screwed up swingx s sorter is trying to make use of the comparator interface but if the object class is not comparable then it defaults to using tostring you have two choices.

26966626
swift	objective-c
you get a bad access because swift classes do not have traditional ivars anymore try to grab a swift class ivar layout and see for yourself
but swift classes are also objective-c objects to the runtime and there don t appear to be any paths excluding swift classes in it

26972690
spaces	linefeed
this includes tab character and all spaces separator unicode characters
this is the same as v is the negated class of v - it is named non vertical whitespace character and matches any characters which aren t a vertical whitespace character of those which are treated as line breaks in the unicode standard and would be matched by v and is the same as the following as introduced in perl 5 n matches any characters which aren t the linefeed character n

26975048
udp	tcp
you will get very less performance network improvement with udp in small scale usage. tcp is always better
according to me first of all know what tcp offers over udp flow control order security and reliability established connection if above things are not important or doesnt matter for you if you are handling these in your code then use udp else tcp is best option

26980384
client-side	server-side
you cannot mix javascript and jsp like you re trying in the update_coordinate_javascript function because javascript runs client-side and jsp server-side
what you are doing in that function is printing the values that the jsp has in mycord at the time it runs on the server-side

26982340
realloc	malloc
you can use realloc instead of malloc if your array grows
the already allocated data stays in place even if the memory is not the same notes realloc null size behaves like malloc size

26982799
jtable	jlabel
the cell renderer component is not actually added to the jtable
the jtable just uses it to do painting. defaulttablecellrenderer creates jlabel so you can set their background and foreground colors freely

26985194
innodb	myisam
no mysql doesn t lock innodb tables for queries that only read data from tables
this is only the case for old myisam tables where all readers must wait until the writer is done and vice versa

26988312
udp	tcp
note udp doesn t really have a concept of connect just sending and receiving packets
if making a tcp connection is analogous to making telephone call then sending a udp packet is more like mailing a letter

26988837
build.gradle	gradlew
remove this chunk of code from your build.gradle in the root directory apply plugin com.android.application and as it says that note do not place your application dependencies here
they belong in the individual module build.gradle files meaning this line of code goes to in the gradlew file inside your app folder

26989133
daemons	systemd
it turns out that pulseaudio is really not packaged or configured to be run as systemd daemons and the default configuration assumes that you will be running within a session ideally under x
this has direct implications for access to the systemd bus pulseaudio expects a session dbus to be at its disposal and module-bluetooth-discover relies on this in order to dynamically load module-buetooth-device and set up the corresponding sinks sources

26990877
cloudant	couchdb
cloudant will not be able to support your couchdb installation - you will need to support it yourself
here are the approximate steps a server running couchdb in ec2 continuous replication from cloudant -- couchdb periodic nightly cron job to copy the relevant .couch file over somewhere zip it up use aws command-line tools to put the zipped file on s3 use aws command-line tools to send that s3 file to glacier things to remember glacier keeps everything unless you say kill that backup from 30 days ago so you keep paying for old backups

26990879
viewdidload	viewdidappear
if you want to create your custom experience simply set your shareviewcontroller to inherit from uiviewcontroller once your extension is activated all the regular viewdidload viewdidappear etc will be called
at this point after installing your containing app you will already by able to see myshareextension in uiactivityviewcontroller menu get the shared uiimage in your shareviewcontroller.mm in viewdidappear use the following to get the image note - this code is only for demonstration extensions should be quick and lightweight and not block the ui thread while loading an image in real application you would do this in the background

26991220
client-side	server-side
you can ofcourse write this all in php but it will not be the php that is performing the actual logic on the client-side it will most likely be javascript
php is a server-side scripting language this means that when the client asks to view the page the php-script will render an html-page that the client then receives

26993555
n-gram	words
in order to generalize this to n-gram as it was in my example code in the question by using the argument one can use the following code then use the custom analyzer as argument to countvectorizer make sure that minngramlength and maxngramlength are defined in such a way that they are known to the ngrams_per_line function by declaring them as globals since they cannot be passed to it as arguments at least i don t know how
the accepted answer works fine but only finds bigrams tokens consisting of exactly two words

26993923
google-chrome	safari
android and google-chrome i believe allow you to access old keys in session storage but not write to it
i know that safari will not allow any use of session or local storage

26996621
qthread	qobject
whether it is not a bad practice to put qthread workerthread_ as the member of threadedworker class when an object is moved to its thread the object and its children are moved
the children are the objects linked in the qt parent child hierarchy when you pass a parent to a constructor of a qobject derived class or call setparent

26996621
qthread	qobject
the code presented in the question doesn t refer to a qthread pointer but a qthread instance
with this in mind consider the documentation for qobject movetothread when it states - warning this function is not thread-safe

26996621
qthread	qobject
for this reason i would say it is not a good idea to have a qthread instance as a member of a qobject and move the object to that thread
if you re going to use qthread then i suggest reading and following the method as outlined in how to really truly use qthread

26999502
swift	objective-c
you have to setup an initial interface with objective-c or c for the c++ code and then bridge that to swift
not really fun at all but thankfully it s not as common a use case as bridging objective-c primarily or c

27001118
jar	war
thats actually not the maven way of doing thing right. you should have a pom.xml for the jar project that has those pojos
than you should have another pom.xml for the war project that has the first project as a dependency

27003379
apache	nginx
so depending on what http server you are using nginx apache etc if properly configured these service accounts should not be able to execute that command because they do not have root level privileges in order to execute the changes you are wanting to make even if shell_exec is enabled
you can test this by logging in as root and if running apache run the following commands su - apache or whatever user apache is running as this should return

27007444
draggable	droppable
however your draggable does not
this means that your draggable is the full width of the container which is much wider than the droppable and thus can t possibly intersect by 50

27008399
accelerometer	gyroscope
from the book while an accelerometer provides measurement of forces in the x- y- and z-axes it cannot measure rotations
on the other hand a gyroscope is a rate-of-change device

27008507
flask	django
and install it in the project s virtualenv and where to import the script also depends if the app is not complicated no other dependency views.py is the place to go if the app is quite complicated that you even need to separate them into multiple views i may create a common.py under the app to import the script about django or not it depends our your potential project complexity if you project may grow big or you will use python to write big web project django is worth to learn as it s the most powerful web framework in python if you only need a simple web application that even doesn t need db flask is simpler to learn as paulo said
as you probably have seen in the tutorial a django project usually have several apps

27009728
fileoutputstream	printwriter
edit so your code will lead to this stream model therefore a println will not directly write the string to the fileoutputstream
the printwriter is not flushed

27011793
cpython	ironpython
you have to run the program using ironpython .net as wpf will not be available in standard cpython environments
you can check which python version you are running on by doing import sys print sys.version which will give you output like 2.7.6 default nov 10 2013 19 24 24 msc v.1500 64 bit amd64 or 2.7.3 ironpython 2.7.3 2.7.0.40 on .net 4.0.30319.34014 64-bit depending on your chosen python interpreter

27015569
mongodb	bson
using your mongodb drivers i think you ll still be able to actually supply the value nil but in this language agnostic post the correct value would be null
you can use the operator to match values that are not equal to null i ve changed your reference of nil to null because nil is not a valid bson type

27016356
google-chrome	firefox
since the cookie is delted in sessions helper however that doesn t change hartl s main point that the user was also logged in via google-chrome which is where the error occurs
you are correct that the short-circuit does not occur since elsif user_id cookies.signed user_id does not run and the user variable would never be set in firefox

27016959
jar	war
1 ejb jar in the pom.xml of the jar make the dependency not provided so maven knows the dependency is needed on the runtime classpath and thus to be deployed with the application - that will trigger it to add it to the ear lib
1 war basically what you describe here is that instead of packaging the dependency with the war package it in the parent ear

27017105
addition	multiplication
counting the bits however involves some sort of addition but that s ok add can be implemented as putting it together it s obviously much easier if you had addition no add function perhaps surprisingly though it s even simpler than that with multiplication no more popcnt at all
implementing multiplication in terms of bitwise operators wouldn t help that s much worse and i m not sure you can even do it with the listed operators unless the right shift is an arithmetic shift but then it s still a terrible thing involving 32 additions each of which are function themselves

27024057
ssl	https
the steps are exactly the same except that you need to issue your own certificate for ngrok client-server communications and use cloudflare s flex ssl for dev-machine.yourdomain.com
ngrok s white labeled domain does not support https if you are using your own domain

27024058
ionic	angular
create the meteorproject client lib folder move the app.js file into that one you should have the following structure client controllers.js index.html lib app.js templates browse.html login.html menu.html playlist.html playlists.html search.html css style.css public img ionic.png server import the meteor packages meteor add urigo ionic that one will include other dependent packages below added mquandalle bower at version 0.1.11 added urigo ionic at version 0.0.6 added urigo angular at version 0.4.8 added urigo angular-ui-router at version 0.6.1 added tinytest at version 1.0.3 bower package allows to use the bower package manager
well basically it is a tool to allow easily include other packages using a description file which might be used by angular but not packaged for meteor yet you will likely be using it for installing ngcordova

27024917
noexcept	throw
as for the reason why the small buffer is not used here this might be related to the fact that your implementation defines the function move constructor to be noexcept
if the move constructor of function is noexcept it can not call any function that might throw hence the implementation simply refuse to move your object from the f s small buffer to the g s one and allocates it on the heap so that it can just move a pointer in the move constructor assignment

27024917
noexcept	throw
if the move constructor of function is noexcept it can not call any function that might throw hence the implementation simply refuse to move your object from the f s small buffer to the g s one and allocates it on the heap so that it can just move a pointer in the move constructor assignment
both libstd++ and libc++ generate a copy constructor call at the line if you simply add noexcept to a s copy constructor

27025683
bellman-ford	dijkstra
that makes your worst-case performance worse than bellman-ford which is therefore preferred for graphs with negative edges
this doesn t mean that your modified dijkstra isn t useful

27028385
mp3	wav
i am trying to play a wav mp3 .
javax.sound.sampled does not support mp3

27028466
scikit-learn	libsvm
but that will only be of benefit if you re grid searching or wanting to know accuracy scores as far as i know the model libsvm creates cannot be used in scikit-learn
there is also a gpu accelerated version of libsvm which i have tried and is extremely fast but is not based on the current libsvm version

27028755
gridbaglayout	grouplayout
before go any further i d suggest you don t set back the layout manager to grouplayout step 3 and use gridbaglayout instead
this is not my favorite either but imho it s a better choice than grouplayout

27030199
google-chrome	firefox
jsfiddle works in ie 11 firefox 33 and google-chrome 38 i did not test other browsers
badri is right you should use dommousescroll instead for firefox

27031135
build.gradle	gradlew
failed tests are ignored if you add the next code to all your tested modules build.gradle files
another option is to skip the install stage and only to use . gradlew build or . gradlew build without gradlew wrapper so tests are not performed

27032860
clang	llvm
it built clang successfully the only difference is that you need to do that from the developer cmd window and you d need to run cmake -g visual studio 12 .. llvm and then compile the solution in visual studio
however that clang failed to compile a sample cpp it complained about undeclared identifier char16_t and __int128 is not supported on this target within the mingw standard library headers

27033655
super	self
if you are using python 2 remember when using super that you need to use the fully qualified name super socialdog.personality_2 self .super_class_method super socialdog.personality_2 self .super_class_field
to inherit from the class you specified according to the code you provided all that is required is to define the class personality_2 like this class socialdog dog #... class personality_2 dog.personality_1 #... now as for your problem when trying to use super this might be because your base classes of dog and dog.personality_1 do not inherit from the python default class object which is required in order to use the super method

27034478
comparator	comparable	implements	extends
comparable is a template for interfaces that implements an order relationship and implements the method int comparator type o . so it s normal to define a class a binary tree wouldn t work for a class that was declared that s because you would be able to compare foobar s to snafu s but not each other
the interface comparable is itself a template. so what you have there is a template with a parameter that must extends a template. and specifically it must extends a template that received the extends class as a parameter

27036534
base	fractions
in 2011 peter dalgaard suggested which gives what wikipedia calls fractions ranking and in base rank is the default
your example is what wikipedia calls dense ranking which isn t available in base rank but - as commented by david arenburg - is provided by dplyr dense_rank so you can library dyplr and use looking at the code for dense_rank it is just suggesting that if you don t want to load dplyr and are happy with a 2-statement solution creating another variable - r - you could use edited to add .

27037897
postgresql	mysql
edit2 original script did not correctly process fields of tinytext mediumtext or longtext type added a conversion to postgresql text type edit3 the original script did not process enum fields choked on non 7 bits characters and had a wrong error management you commented out line 2 where connect was defined but you left line 9 where connect is used untouched so the error
as you now explicitely connect to mysql you should replace with it should now give with the conversion of text types line 28 above script convert enum to varchar

27038639
persistent	transient
this also solves a tricky little problem where obtaining the hashcode of a transient object doesn t always return the same hashcode for an equivalent persistent object
vaughn vernon s excellent book suggests that an appropriate strategy for creating entities is that they arrive fully-formed with an identity opposed to being created in a transient state i suppose

27038948
junit	mockito
if you use junit use springjunit4classrunner and define dedicated configuration class for your tests like that the class under test the test class and the configuration class for this test having that said i wouldn t recommend this approach i just added it here for reference
in my opinion much better way is to use mockito runner

27041297
rsa	dsa
in the context of your crypto api that rsa encryption scheme either is the default treatment when the treatment is not explicitly named or the kind of treatment is deduced from the private key you use as parameter in the sign call --- if it is a rsa private key it uses rsa
if it is a dsa key it uses dsa

27044943
inline	inlining
however we can also see that inline is only a hint and other factors may outweigh it
i wasn t sure about your claim smaller functions are automatically inlined by optimizer irrespective of inline is mentioned or not... it s quite clear that the user doesn t have any control over function inlining with the use of keyword inline

27044943
inline	inlining
i wasn t sure about your claim smaller functions are automatically inline by optimizer irrespective of inline is mentioned or not... it s quite clear that the user doesn t have any control over function inlining with the use of keyword inline
i ve heard that compilers are free to ignore your inline request but i didn t think they disregarded it completely

27050503
comparator	comparable
now as you have correctly pointed out if you do not specify a comparator the natural ordering of the class that is the comparator method you have defined is used
however the comparable class documentation also states the following it is strongly recommended though not required that natural orderings be consistent with equals

27050503
equals	compareto
in particular such a sorted set or sorted map violates the general contract for set or map which is defined in terms of the equals method
since the class instructortreenode does not override object#equals your compareto method may return 0 even if returns false

27050581
jacoco	eclemma
jacoco apparently uses keeps track of the classes it s watching via a hashmap whose hashcode is derived by the class definition so the hashcode will be different after mockito modifies the class so jacoco can t find the class in it s internal maps anymore
discussed in more detail why eclemma doesn #39

27051641
memcached	opcache
memcached and redis solve entirely different problems data persistence not code execution speed
php 5.5+ ships with the opcache extension formerly zend optimiser+ by default thereby obsoleting solutions like eaccelerator which do the same thing

27051648
azure	hdinsight
the problem caused by azure hdinsight tools for visual studio which is new release and possible not compatible with visual studio 2012 however installs into the visual studio 2012 and causing problems at start
to fix this problem uninstall azure hdinsight tools for visual studio from the system

27056300
single-quotes	double-quotes
you can then make use of the context connection which is the in-process connection hence fast and build a dynamic sql statement of select from table where id value obviously check inputs for single-quotes and dashes to avoid sql injection
when you call sqldatareader you can not only step through each field easily but you then also have insight into the datatype of each field and can determine if it is numeric and if so then don t put the double-quotes around the value in the output

27058376
postgresql	mysql
if you re not using mysql just replace mysql with sqlite or postgresql or whatever
to get the database connection parameters server username password etc if you re using mysql you can do this on my local development machine this gives driver mysql host localhost database local_dev_db username root password not-my-real-pwd ...obviously you should never show your password or any of these other details in your live app

27059672
des	aes
you cannot use a secretkey with algorithm des in a context where an aes key is needed for example
in your code the following line produces a secretkey however at this point the key is not an aes key

27059698
inline	inlining
the url you provide does not inline the content when i access it on my wired network connection so the problem is most likely with your isp and not the site
inlining is usually done by a proxy server often a transparent one between the browser and the server and is most common on mobile 3g 4g etc internet connections in an attempt to improve performance by reducing the number of http requests at a cost of reducing caching

27060632
shadowing	named
look at the code the parameter flavours is shadowing your field flavours so the compiler is trying to find an add method in string not arraylist
you could just explicitly qualify it this.flavours.add flavours but it would be much better to change the parameter named

27060904
phpstorm	webstorm
in phpstorm the stuff listed under external libraries branch will include phar files folders from settings | php | include paths folders that are not part of the actual project but still referenced for code completion libraries installed globally
quite likely it s the same here in webstorm for javascript libraries global npm modules or whatever

27061453
aggregate-functions	sum
the second solution can t be used for time averaging because it s not an aggregate-functions
the best solution i ve managed actually uses a stored function which you can create if you have the privileges on the database as follows you can then calculate the average by calling on the function within a query select vavgtest sum sin radians winddirection sum cos radians winddirection as vectoraverage from table group by hour mytimestamp dayofyear mytimestamp year mytimestamp order by mytimestamp

super	extends
remove super
you do not extends any class

27070735
google-chrome	firefox
however in google-chrome there s a little bit lag jump. also in google-chrome horizontal scroll bar doesn t show up while in firefox it does
it s worth to mention that firefox doesn t show twitching problem

27071309
ubuntu	centos
ubuntu has binary openjfx packages available so if you could switch to ubuntu you should be able to use them i ve never tried it
i am not aware that anybody has created anything similar for centos this may change in the future

27083276
namenode	hdfs
do the following steps create a directory in your home directory for keeping namenode image datanode blocks replace with your login name modify your hdfs-site.xml file in your hadoop_conf_dir hadoop configuration direcotry as follows format your hdfs namenode start using
looks like you are not overriding the hdfs configurations dfs.name.dir dfs.data.dir by default it points to tmp directory which will be cleared when your machine restarts

27084733
lxml	libxml2
from the lxml docs here.. his original post is here cannot install lxml on mac os x 10.9 there s some other ios related fixes there as well
andre augusto pointed out if you want to use lxml together with the official libxml2 python bindings maybe because one of your dependencies uses it you must build lxml statically

27085835
innodb	myisam
first you want to make sure your tables engine is innodb not myisam since latter doesn t support foreign key
if that s the case you can change engine if this is not the issue you can check for specific error by running show engine innodb status g and then looking in latest foreign key error section

27087060
csv	tsv
do not use a csv parser to parse tsv inputs
it will break if the tsv has fields with a quote character for example

27087184
multiplying	addition
it is not yet supported in internet explorer but the linked page contains a replacement function that simulates imul for older browsers which works by multiplying the top and bottom halves of the numbers separately
for addition we can or the numbers with 0

27089831
implements	extends
the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed solution upfront advantages few loc to implements fosuserbundle update proof does not override the view scripts disadvantages performance overhead due to subrequests only forms can be displayed form submission and subsequently error handling upon submission will always go to the pages provided by fosuserbundle still feels like a quick-n-dirty fix but better than other options only needs to override the layout.html.twig file with that being said here is what i have done render the form in your template use embedded controllers to render the forms you need override fosuserbundle layout as i use the routes provided by the bundle i had to override the fosuserbundle layout template file to extends the standard layout of my application
as the overriden fosuserbundle layout file extends the main applications layout file the layout would be repeated for each call

postgresql	mysql
conclusion as a general rule there s not an exact way to convert a postgresql query to a mysql query but there are a lot of workarounds the resulting query might be as simple as the original one or it might become very complicated but it depends on the query itself
there s not an exact equivalent to convert a postgresql query that makes use of select distinct on to mysql

27091297
postgresql	mysql
there s not an exact equivalent to convert a postgresql query that makes use of select distinct on to mysql
postgresql select distinct on in postgresql the following query will eliminate all rows where the expressions col1 col2 col3 match and it will only keep the first col4 col5 row for each set of matched rows select distinct on col1 col2 col3 col4 col5 from tablename so if your table is like this col1 | col2 | col3 | col4 | col5 -------------------------------- 1 | 2 | 3 | 777 | 888 1 | 2 | 3 | 888 | 999 3 | 3 | 3 | 555 | 555 our query will keep just one row for 1 2 3 and one row for 3 3 3

27092152
gtk	cairo	gtk	clutter
if you want to use a gtkstylecontext and the gtk api to draw something inside a clutteractor you can use a cluttercanvas content and then use the api with the cairo context that the cluttercanvas draw signal gives you
clutter does not know anything about gtk or css so you cannot use the gtk css machinery with clutter

27095589
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
this is one of opera s innovations you can read more about it in their 2011 dev article on object-fit yep it s been around that long
a few years ago i wouldn t have been able to recommend it to you but caniuse shows that everyone else is starting to catch up opera 10.6-12.1 -o- prefix google-chrome 31+ opera 19+ safari 7.1+ ios 8+ android 4.4+ using a value of contain will force the image to maintain its aspect ratio no matter what

27095807
direct3d	directx
in short don t use direct3d retained mode directplay voice or directx 7 8 visual basic 6.0 as they aren t in the os starting with windows vista
as noted you can t statically link the directx libraries direct3d directinput directsound etc

27095807
direct3d	directx
as noted you can t statically link the directx libraries direct3d directinput directsound etc
that said depending exactly on your definition of any windows system you actually do not need the directx redist

27097637
apache	nginx
apache is not as well suited to this kind of reverse proxying websockets work
many of us have started out trying pump.io behind apache and switched to nginx because it s easier to configure and troubleshoot

27098784
bmp	png
it converts raw data to simple ppm format and converts ppm to bmp using imagemagick with almost no overhead after it gets raw data upd this shell script by max_plenert is a better example
if the slow part is raw to png conversion time adb shell screencap -p sdcard x.png is considerably slower than time adb shell screencap sdcard nonpng.raw as i have it in games and png is not necessary then you can do like here

27101314
qthread	qobject
you should not subclass from qthread in this case
instead derive your class from qobject

27102090
opencv	emgucv
emgucv using opencv s deprecated c-api can only read cascade files in the old format build with opencv_haartraining
you cannot use that cascade file with emgucv

27104379
config	ini
if you want to preserve the order of your keys when you check in your config files pyyaml doesn t do that unless you specify
omap which makes it less easy to update than a normal mapping if you want to have complex structures with lists of unnamed elements containing mappings dictionaires then configparser and configobj won t help you as the ini files key-value pairs have to go into sections and lists can only be values

27107053
config	ini
so my opinion is only use xml when you have options you can not represent in an ini file the ini sections work great for seperating live staging and dev config also keeping them seperate but together in a simple and easy to edit way
config files are by far the easiest to work with they can be put in your version control system to see changes over time etc

27107777
swift	objective-c
you must check again importing swift into objective-c in your viewcontroller.m .
remove this line #import chunk.h and add this line #import foo-swift.h the file should already be created automatically in your project even if you can not see it. update if chunk.swift is descendant of an objective-c class

27109118
swift	objective-c
i m surprised swift doesn t bridge that automatically
that subscripting is only available from objective-c since it s implemented using objectforkeyedsubscript and setobject forkeyedsubscript

27113376
inline	inlining
you can write it inline like this a complete example note that this is not the way backbone is meant to be used
this inlining won t work with events

27113752
implements	extends
servletcontainer uses instanceof to know if your class is the child of httpservlet or genericservlet or servlet interface. since your class is not the child of httpservlet genericservlet class or implements servlet interface instanceof will fail
you are forced to extends httpservlet because you need to add your application specific logic to it

27115002
ssl	https
there might be a couple of issues ssl verification problem
if you are making a request to a https website and if your curl library is not configured to trust the certificates you ll have a problem

27117909
google-chrome	safari
also this version of safari allows setting the origin header on the xmlhttprequest object google-chrome does not xhr.setrequestheader origin null
setting the header to null to get closer to the other browsers does not change the result safari 7.1 still allows the response to get through to the requester

27122104
ubuntu	linux
the kernel is whatever you are really running on redhat in your example while the userspace is supplied by the container ubuntu
most linux kernel variants are sufficiently similar that applications will not notice

27124513
punctuation	words
what about punctuation
i would approach this as follows the root of the code is the assignment of words in new_phrases which transforms the phrase and syns into a more usable form a list where each element is a list of the acceptable choices for that words note the following use of generators to deal more efficiently with large numbers of combinations not building the whole list at once

27125726
setinterval	settimeout
what you should do instead is not use setinterval and create a recursive function that uses only settimeout jsfiddle
that s because you aren t doing anything with your settimeout except passing it an intervals id

on the other hand if only portrait sizes are used the app size could be more less

27126594
spaces	delimiter
you will end up with something like this i have not tested this most lines are delimiter with either tabs or commas but there is no reason why you cannot use a spaces as long as it does not appear in your data
if you separate the fields with one spaces or any single character called a delimiter you can use the split function to separate the fields

27130935
debian	centos
and debian will definitely not change this behavior to be different from all other linuxes
here s a quick verification all on amd64 x86_64 which is what you re most likely running macos ubuntu centos openbsd there s something else wrong with your compilation

27131797
portrait	landscape
when the ad is presented portrait the failed to retrieve an ad but the instantiation of the adinterstitialad instance has sent another request
this has loaded because you do not set a frame for the instance s view it does not know it is meant to be landscape and so a portrait version is presented

27132748
hex	binary
you aren t parsing your input string as a hex representation
you re taking each character getting its char value and converting that to binary representation

google-chrome	firefox
reading a few articles it seems as of an update with google-chrome recently it will no longer render segoe ui correctly at font-weight 300 200
plus be weary about using local fonts anyone not using a windows pc will not see this typeface render ala mac linux google-chrome firefox os s

27137820
config	ini
the jvm is started with it s own config file that details what it can and cannot support
the cpl is going to set up standard ini files that are used by a java client an application on desktop but cf runs as a serve instance and won t use that information

libstdc++	libc++
you are not using libc++ you are using libstdc++ which is entirely different
the problem doesn t have anything to do with debug versions of libstdc++ either

27146263
factors	mean
the system will also determine whether to pass your notification along based on other factors such as time since last launch
too soon after closing or a long time after closing the app might mean that your app won t get priority and will have to wait for other apps too soon content is still relatively fresh. long time the user is not using the app a lot

27147426
swift	objective-c
swift enums are not the same as objective-c enums
in objective-c the enum is the backing value referred to by a different name

27148697
implements	extends
you have to check the javadoc java.lang.classloader doesn t implements the addurl method it is implements by java.net.urlclassloader
the compoundclassloader is not extends it

27152965
fgets	realloc
in particular max would start at 0 not 1 and i would not use the +1 in the call to fgets
i think it likely that your problem is the way you use pointer the trouble is that realloc can change where the data is stored but you fix it to the location you are first given

27153708
sudo	passwd
the docs now recommend using --ask-become-pass instead while also swapping out the use of sudo throughout your playbooks with become
the docs strongly recommend against setting the sudo passwd in plaintext and instead using --ask-sudo-pass on the command line when running ansible-playbook 2016 update ansible 2.0 not 100 when marked --ask-sudo-pass as deprecated

27153735
orientdb	neo4j
orientdb implements the blueprints api directly warning tinkerpop 3 is not supported spring data
an excellent implementation for neo4j exists

27154195
rsa	aes
since an asymmetric cipher like rsa is needed the client only has a public key and the server a private key the server can only sign a message with rsa but not encrypt it
so the client will need to generate an aes key and send it to the server and the server will use this key to respond securely

27158158
scheme	racket
the documentation you link to is for mit-scheme rather than to racket. the documentation for racket is here note that the scheme in #lang scheme doesn t mean r5rs or r6rs but rather the mzscheme language
nowadays one most people use #lang racket

27162396
comparator	comparable
you have two options trees implements comparable implement a comparator and call collections.max trees comparator
it looks like trees is not comparable

27163014
google-chrome	firefox
i actually had it working with slightly different code in i.e. but not in google-chrome
firefox doesn t support the use of filter elements to import fragments from the svg so the test case fails

27171441
portrait	landscape
heres how it works with the assumption that your app does allow the masterviewcontroller to be dismissed in portrait and does not allow in landscape
in portrait while the masterviewcontroller is visible if you were to present a modal from a viewcontroller in the masterviewcontroller and then rotate to landscape the modal would disappear in ios7 and the app would not rotate in ios8

27172948
onresume	onpause
onresume will be called every time the app is viewed again
the issue is that you re setting the preview callback to null in your onpause and then not fixing it in your onresume

27172948
onresume	onpause
the issue is that you re setting the preview callback to null in your onpause and then not fixing it in your onresume
so change your onresume to this that should fix your issue

opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
and to be more clear it is a firefox specific feature that do not exists in google-chrome or opera for example
try open a firefox go to this page and ctrl click on your own question above

27176052
comparator	comparable
there are two types of constructor for treesets - ones where you specify an explicit comparator and ones where you do not
in the latter case the set will use the natural ordering of its elements which requires that they implement comparable

27178311
prepare	execute
whether it will actually work or not depends on whether the code is prepare to deal with being aware that it s not running as the interactive user with access to hkcu user profile items like personalfolder and the code knows where its data is
when a custom action executable gets fired off it is via the createprocess type of call not a shell execute call and so there is no uac dialog manifest checking stuff going on

27178765
swift	objective-c
from xcode release notes if you set a swift subclass of nsvaluetransformer as a binding s value transformer the xib or storyboard will contain an invalid reference to the class and the binding will not work properly at runtime
you can either enter a mangled class name into the value transformer field or add the objective-c attribute to the nsvaluetransformer subclass to solve this problem

27182267
bower	npm
starting with meteor 1.3 you can add 3rd party javascript libraries to a meteor project directly via their npm package meteor npm install --save moment both server-side and client-side package work without modification because meteor s es2015 module system takes care of creating a node-like environment in the client much as bower or webpack do
if an npm package happens to not function correctly look for a wrapper on atmoshpere

27183062
orientdb	neo4j
so have a look at orientdb see orientdb vs neo4j
you have mentioned above that it s not possible to store complex types in a neo4j array

27183881
super	extends
the classa has a method of whoami and the object has equals hashcode getclass etc... when you re extends to an object the super class doesn t inherit the methods inside the child class
in your example since classa is extends object super class object will not inherit the whoami method but it is the other way around

27185780
gif	png
if you add call to forcealphachannel after you have drawn gif image you will get transparency based on transparent color you define
just by drawing gif image on png canvas will not move transparency information from gif image to png. you will have to do it yourself

27185780
gif	png
just by drawing gif image on png canvas will not move transparency information from gif image to png. you will have to do it yourself
forcealphachannel procedure will create alpha channel for any png image based on given transparentcolor

27189692
qgraphicsscene	qwidget
unfortunately qgraphicsitem is a base class of all graphics items usable inside qgraphicsscene and as most item-like objects in qt is not derived from qwidget or qobject
moreover they can only be parented to another qgraphicsitem apart from being owned by qgraphicsscene

27189700
multiplying	addition	multiplying	multiplication	multiplying	subtraction
a program can be created in strings to multiplying two very large numbers here i am talking about numbers say 5000 digits in length each
i have already created them for addition and subtraction and it s not that hard to create it for multiplication and i assure you that though you will think that using biginteger will be faster but using strings would be ultrafast as compared to bigint

27190913
setinterval	settimeout
try changing the last lines of timer to be like this and remove the setinterval line
speaking generally settimeout is much preferred to setinterval because it doesn t require a managed state countdowntimer in your example and is far more flexible

27195338
hive	hdfs
the older hadoop services like hive tend to be slow and are usually used for batch jobs not for streaming. as streaming becomes more and more a necessity other services have surfaced like storm or spark that are designed for faster execution and integration with messaging queues like kafka for streaming
in data analytics though most of the time processing is not al real time historical data may be processed in batch mode to extract models that are then used for real-time analytics so a streaming system is usually based on a lambda architecture a service like spark tries to integrate all of the components with spark streaming for the speed layer spark sql for the serving layer spark mllib for the modeling all based on hadoop distributed file system hdfs for replicated large volume storage

27195746
fgets	realloc
in the fgets you probably meant c1 not c
you could do it like this if you insist on using realloc here are some comments you expect to read a string thus you should use not

27196506
uiview	subviews
then cut paste your existing table and toolbar views as your new uiview subviews
since toolbar now isn t a subviews of your table view it ll never scroll with it nor will it have any crashes upon taps on its items

27197238
opentype	woff
for this it also matters whether you have a real .otf file opentype with cff outline data or not a properly designed real .otf file is going to be much smaller than an equivalent .ttf file but if you got that .otf file through something like font squirrel as part of a font formats bundle that started life as a .ttf that won t be the case and you might as well use the original .ttf instead
and then of course just like the short and slightly longer answer but really you just want to wrap whichever is smallest up as a woff so you don t need multiple sources

27203437
gulp-sass	gulp-ruby-sass
if that doesn t work the article i linked to above shows how to use the gulp-sass plugin which which doesn t have the source map issue
i was having the same issue with the gulp-ruby-sass plugin

27205403
factors	matrix
i guess the problem is that you are trying to copy values of a factors variable in a numeric matrix and this is why your faux matrix does work because it is inserting numbers not factors
i really don t get why you need it in a matrix as you try to copy the entire vector that you already have

27206158
uiview	subviews
also i found that if i was working with a uiview subclass i had to make a call to layoutifneeded before the animation block on the view being scaled and moved
interestingly enough when working with regular uiview objects i found that it was not necessary to make the call to layoutifneeded in order to produce the desired effect of keeping the subviews centered after the center cahnge and transform

27206158
uiview	subviews
interestingly enough when working with regular uiview objects i found that it was not necessary to make the call to layoutifneeded in order to produce the desired effect of keeping the subviews centered after the center cahnge and transform
i am at a loss as to why these specific conditions are required to keep the subviews centered during a transform and coordinate move

27208247
sctp	udp	sctp	tcp
sctp can also be used as media transport but with limited retransmit option not all stacks support it
there are attempts to use tcp to punch through nat points but all this is an act of despair. if your application supposes sending a voice message more than to one recipient at a time a kind of broadcast or multicast this rejects use of connection-oriented media transports effectively retaining only udp

27209407
punctuation	words
here s a simple example using the provided sentence tokenizer i m not entirely clear how your sentences are delimiter if not by normal punctuation but running the above code on your text i get i m having trouble figuring out how i would take a text file of a lengthy document and append each sentence within that text file to a list. not all sentences will end in a period so all end characters would have to be taken into consideration but there could also be a . within a sentence so i couldn t just cutoff searching through a sentence at a period. i m assuming this could be fixed by also adding a condition where after the period it should be followed by a spaces but i have no idea how to set this up so i get each sentence from the text file put into a list as an element. n n but fails on inputs like this is a sentence with. a period right in the middle. while passing on inputs like this is a sentence wit.h a period right in the middle i don t know if you re going to get much better than that right out of the box though
from the nltk code a sentence tokenizer which uses an unsupervised algorithm to build a model for abbreviation words collocations and words that start sentences

google-chrome	firefox
result update text-decoration works fine on google-chrome 41.0.2235.0 canary
here is the demo unfortunately this solution doesn t work on firefox

27211169
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
if you wanted to know if a site has been served with spdy in google-chrome there is chrome.loadtimes .wasfetchedviaspdy obviously only works in google-chrome
for firefox and safari you would have to inspect the headers as far as i know there is not a similar api though plugins exist to do this for you

27212884
jar	war
from your question it is not clear what you want to do or what is inside the jar files
in general cases web applications are deployed as war or as ear file

cocos2d-x	libgdx
performance i did some test with simple game similar to swing copters and found that game created with libgdx consumes 15-20 more ram on ios device that the same game created with cocos2d-x but then i used apportable to run cocos2d-x game on my android device and found it almost not playable
anoher case one of my games developed with libgdx has lots of heavy graphic like map 5000x5000 levels backgrounds 1920x1080 etc and it runs without any lags on iphone5+ devices

27213755
cdr	cons
template values first list rest list let-values left list reshape car template list let-values right list reshape cdr template list values cons left right list
traversing a tree of pairs in left to right order isn t particularly difficult as car and cdr let you get to both sides and cons can put things back together

27213775
swift	objective-c
the only concept i know that is in objective-c but not in swift is key-value observing kvo
you can use kvo for a swift class to observe the property of an objective-c class but you cannot observe any arbitrary property of a swift class

27217437
swift	objective-c
the fact that you should never make a method call is so basic it isn t even a lesson. but step one is to rewrite this in c or even swift which at least has a hope of optimizing effectively
objective-c is not the right tool

27218235
google-chrome	firefox
display flex works to an extent on buttons in webkit based browsers such as google-chrome and safari though the behaviour of the button and its flex children is buggy
it does not work at all in firefox and this might be technically the correct behaviour mdash

27222218
google-chrome	firefox
more examples of console commands in google-chrome edit dirxml also works in internet explorer 11 and later but not in firefox though this shouldn t be an issue as firefox outputs elements in xml format
this does appear to be random at least in google-chrome

27227611
lxml	elementtree
the api used lxml elementtree as backport for parsing xml
the lxml allowed additional argument - namespace but elementtree does not allow

27229663
implements	extends
so the general guidelines are more or less if in your application s domain the only class where it will make sense to have friends and ignores and their operations is user and no other conceivable entity would ever need them then implements them directly in user
if other entities may need similar functionality and not all of them extends user anyway you may consider this functionality to be an entity or class in its own right and then you should have every class which has an is_a relationship to this entity extends it

27230213
recvfrom	datagram
what your code does is this query the size of the next datagram in the receive buffer which is 52 bytes read 40 bytes from the next datagram in the receive buffer and discard the rest check whether recvfrom returned 0 which will never be the case since the socket is not set to non-blocking -- my bad overlooked the msg_dontwait flag assume wrongly that a zero-length receive means other end has closed the connection -- that s for tcp
udp has no connections or pipes there is nothing to close a zero length means a no payload datagram which consists only of the header that s perfectly legal

27236410
awt	swing
since javafx doesn t have system tray access you basically need an awt application to run in the system tray
i would then consider embedding the javafx aspects in swing using a jfxpanel and basically make it a swing awt application with some javafx embedded

27238697
bash	zsh
it s generally more convenient than bash s behavior just starting the command prompt where the output ended
when non-null output from a program doesn t include a trailing newline zsh adds that color-inverted to indicate that and moves to the next line before printing the prompt

27240920
ionic	angular
but if your problem is how to display a calculated value in angular get rid of firebase angularfire ionic and first figure out how to display a calculated value with just angular
one way to do this with firebase s web javascript api doing this in angular does not make it too different

27241197
ubuntu	linux
though ubuntu has more focus on getting apps running regardless of platform
know that linux has no single convention but its convention is simply derived from pragmatism not by theory

27244304
udp	tcp
for example in theory you could use udp which is connectionless to negotiate the new tcp port you d re-establish the connection on
communication using udp in theory of course itself is not guaranteed by design

27244562
haskell	ocaml
haskell s lazy evaluation and therefore reasoning about the behaviour of programs is somewhat simpler for programmers who do not necessarily have a background in functional programming we were especially concerned with reasoning about the space behaviour of programs with is sometimes even for experts quite challenging in haskell
ocaml allowing you to selectively escape to imperative and even object-oriented programming is something that sometimes comes in handy but not something we recommend to our programmers as a good practice in everyday programming

27252034
nsurlconnection	nsurlsession
the block-based methods of nsurlsession are richer than what was provided by nsurlconnection
also nsurlsession offers background session features that allow requests to continue even if the app isn t running

27252585
rdf	owl
my answer provides more discussion of what rdf xml and owl xml are how both can be considered owl files but aren t both rdf files. owl xml vs rdf xml serialization owl xml or rdf xml-abbrev
the xml code you re showing in not rdf xml

27252585
rdf	owl
the xml code you re showing in not rdf xml
it s owl xml

27252585
rdf	owl
rdflib should be able to parse the rdf xml serialization of the rdf mapping of the owl ontology but that s not the same thing as the owl xml serialization of the ontology
you should either use an owl tool to convert the owl xml file to an rdf xml file or ask the provider of the ontology to provide the rdf xml serialization

27266840
google-chrome	firefox
it s not the best solution but it might help update it covers this case and works with google-chrome have the developer tools opened right-click on the element you want to examine but don t click inspect element or anything else the pop-up will freeze so you will be able at least to find it in the already opened inspector
in a case like this a quick solution that works with firefox google-chrome developer tools and firebug is the following have the developer tools opened scroll your page to a position where the element that has the hover effect is a bit covered by the developer tools pane

27268316
serializable	deserialization
note but you can serializable by implementing externalizable interface then default constructor no-arg will be called of that class only not of parent class on deserialization process
when there is parent child relationship and only child implements serializable

27268742
prepare	execute
first i do not think that stored procedure works because the select statement is not defined in a cursor or a prepare statement
if you want to execute a dynamic sql in a stored procedure you need to define in a stmt then prepare it and execute it

27271173
dictionary	map
you can make it a dictionary by putting dictionary around it or as jonrsharpe pointed out it can be done more simply by defining the dictionary directly
what you have defined there as map_btw_regime_klant_topaccount is a list of pairs not a map

27273616
ssl	https
once that has been removed go into wordpress and edit your homepage you will see on the right hand side it will have an enable ssl tickbox this will redirect http to https forcing https for the current page only simply tick this box and then repeat for all pages that you want to display in ssl https be sure to update all pages that you have changed to ssl https and you are done
it took me a long time to realise that by doing this i was forcing ssl https on all pages already and that having anything else like a plugin or code snippet in htaccess was just making the loop endless since wordpress was already redirecting http to https anything else doing the same would produce an endless loop and the 404 page was redirecting endlessly becauise the 404 error page only loads in http and not https making it a target for redirection by force ssl https plugins or code snippets

27273616
ssl	https
it took me a long time to realise that by doing this i was forcing ssl https on all pages already and that having anything else like a plugin or code snippet in htaccess was just making the loop endless since wordpress was already redirecting http to https anything else doing the same would produce an endless loop and the 404 page was redirecting endlessly becauise the 404 error page only loads in http and not https making it a target for redirection by force ssl https plugins or code snippets
after realising this i can see another way to fix this would be to have the 404 error page load in https

27274499
apache	nginx
basically you can retrieve the client ssl certificate with if you need more variables or a strict compatibility with apache you can find a port to nginx of the standard apache ssl variables not completely finished as of now
with this installed your application will see the same variables as with apache

27274534
set	bag
if you have another dictionaries within your dict you should not worry about it pig will understand it and use the following syntax there is one big disadvantage about passing dict back to pig from a jython udf you are only able to set one datatype for all the values in the dict meaning that if you don t set any datatype pig will use bytearray as the data type and this could be a problem when working with dates or complex structures
for example tuples and bags when you want to return a tuple or a bag back to pig from a jython udfs it is useful to remember that python s lists convert to bags and tuples to tuples

27274753
icmp	tcp
check your server network activity using wireshark i ve had the problem where the server was trying to connect to the client using netbios and icmp to resolve the clients details and that was timing out
disable the netbios over tcp on the server and check then to see if it s a networking issue and not actually a programming issue

27278132
email	dkim
please follow this process 1.send a real-life email coming from your production servers or a server with similar dkim spf from return-path headers including the markup schema to schema.whitelisting+sample gmail.com
2.if you send a test blank email an email that does not contain schema or if you don t send an email for review your application will be silently discarded

27281843
onclick	onchange
this means you should go with the onclick event and should be fine jquery check box change function not working in ie 8
this older post explains that in ie8 and older the change and onchange event is only executed on submit

27282321
implements	extends
the first is adding a method to the actual jquery object and is also the easiest to implements the second is to add to jquery object instances which expect specific things to happen chaining iteration context management event etc.
utility functions this is the easy one because your not manipulating jquery objects but instead just extends jquery as if it was any normal javascript object

27285466
equals	compareto
compare t obj1 t obj2 comes from the java.util.comparator interface implemented in a separate class that compares another class s objects to give a negative int value for the first object being less than 0 for equals or positive value for greater than the second object
it is needed when you cannot make a class implement compareto because it is not modifiable

27288476
multiplying	multiplication
then multiplying all values by old_area new_area ratio
if you have also negative values and not computing absolute area then you have to handle positive and negative areas separately and find multiplication ration to best fit original area for booth at once

27289000
opera	google-chrome
it seems that opera does not include the concept of a highlighted tab which is already pretty obscure in google-chrome
your query is excessive anyway in google-chrome the active tab cannot be non-highlighted

27291280
set	bag
assume the variables are ordered lets say a set of sums is a bag if all sums in it are distinct. all sums in a bag can be divided into two groups sums that do not contain variable a and sums that do contain
lets call the first group as head and the second as tail . note that both are bags because they contain distinct sums. we can subtract a from each sum in tail so that all sums remain distinct the tail is still a bag

27291403
spaces	delimiter
bash treats whitespace specially in ifs if ifs has a value other than the default then sequences of the whitespace characters spaces and tab are ignored at the beginning and end of the word as long as the whitespace character is in the value of ifs an ifs whitespace character . any character in ifs that is not ifs whitespace along with any adjacent ifs whitespace characters delimits a field
a sequence of ifs whitespace characters is also treated as a delimiter

27293129
haskell	agda
agda has this restriction as well but has now removed the mutual keyword in favour of giving types then definitions . to expand on this when you have dependant types the automatic dependency analysis à la haskell would be difficult or impossible because the dependancy order at the type level may very well be different than the dependancy order at the value level
haskell doesn t have this problem because values can not appear in types so it can just do the dependancy analysis and then typecheck in that order

27293129
haskell	idris
haskell doesn t have this problem because values can not appear in types so it can just do the dependancy analysis and then typecheck in that order
this is what the idris tutorial is getting at about the reduction behaviour of values being required for the type checking

27293682
persistent	transient
entities are persistent structures and the repositories should manage entities not the other way around
think of transaction demarcations and transient detached instances

27294197
mono	xamarin.android
the original author was no longer maintaining nor uses the project codecontracts are not implemented in mono
there was a gsoc project but it didn t end up with a complete solution so conditions is your only choice if targeting xamarin.ios xamarin.android xamarin.mac platforms or just mono in general

implements	extends
using a libgdx project as a view inside an android app is now documented clearly with example code in the libgdx wiki implements as a fragment the best practice for modern android apps add android v4 support library to the -android project and its build path if you haven t already added it
this is needed in order to extends fragmentactivity later change androidlauncher activity to extends fragmentactivity not androidapplication implement androidfragmentapplication.callbacks on the androidlauncher activity create a class that extends androidfragmentapplication which is the fragment implementation for libgdx

27297486
apache	nginx
i m fairly sure that same thing can be done with apache but i have no experience with setting up wsgi with apache
the main point is that you ll actually need to run few different internal web-servers one for each app and you ll be able to unite them on the same port with nginx i m not sure if cherrypy supports listening to file socket instead of port so if it can - you may omit gunicorn and configure nginx directly with cherrypy servers

27298642
punctuation	words
this issue is that punctuation is not considered to be part of a words specifically it is not included in the w class
that means that if your words ends with punctuation then that will not be followed by a words boundary b unless there is a words immediately following the punctuation

27299713
floating-point	fixed-point
generally the coordinates used for rasterization are not floating-point at all
they are fixed-point with a few bits reserved for subpixel accuracy you absolutely need this since pixel coverage for things like triangles is based on distance from pixel center

27299713
floating-point	fractions	floating-point	fixed-point
but if gl_max_viewport_dims did not exist then for sure it would make sense to use floating-point pixel coordinates since you would want to support a massive potentially unknown range of coordinates
in the minimum opengl implementation there must be 4-bits of sub-pixel precision gl_subpixel_bits so if your gpu used 16-bit for raster coordinates that would give you 12-bit integer + 4-bit fractions to spread across gl_max_viewport_dims the value would probably be 4096 for 12.4 fixed-point

27300471
jar	war
exclusion of transitive dependencies should then work as with any other jar dependency
the problem is not so much that the war plugin handles dependency exclusion differently but that it handles dependencies of specially

27310626
wav	flac
both will make the same decoded output make flac from wav compare md5 hash of each decoded file the input file ffmpeg output flac output this shows that both ffmpeg and flac make the exact same output when decoded and the decoded output of the flac files are exactly the same as the decoded wav file
differences flac was slightly faster in my single lazyass test but not significantly

27319214
jar	war
unless you are running your application as war the src main webapp folder won t be included in the output as stated in the documentation do not use the src main webapp folder if your application will be packaged as a jar
although this folder is a common standard it will only work with war packaging and it will be silently ignored by most build tools if you generate a jar

27321941
strdup	malloc
try changing the return statement of your function to this return strdup s.ptr
this will automatically malloc the string but you do not have to worry about that

27322782
ssl	https
the request is to port 443 not 80 so net http isn t happy trying to use non-ssl to a ssl port
see using net http.get for an https url which discusses how to turn on ssl

27323918
dictionary	map
i would solve it using a bit of functional approach using filter map and reduce what the code does convert the results array into an array of nsdictionary filter the array by removing all elements which are dictionary not having the totalworktimeinhoursstring key or whose corresponding value is not a string convert each element of the array to a double by extracting the value corresponding to the totalworktimeinhoursstring key converting to nsstring and then to double apply the reduce method passing the + operator to sum up the resulting array of double this is the data i tested my solution with in a playground
looking at your code i deduce that results is an array of dictionary and each dictionary has a totalworktimeinhoursstring key whose value is a string representation of a double number

opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

newer versions of safari and firefox also seem to have support but internet explorer doesn t

27327422
textview	imageview
it s not working because you re telling the textview to be in the center of the parent relativelayout but the imageview is attached to the top-left of the parent
one approach would be to force the textview to be the exact size of the imageview using relativelayout s alignxyz properties

27328750
spaces	linefeed
group 1 stops right before the first spaces because the spaces character was not included in the search criteria
groups 2 and 4 are simply the white spaces which in this case is literally a spaces character but could also be a tab or a linefeed etc

27330950
vmware	virtualbox
going to vmware virtual machine settings for your vm network adapter configure adapters and try swithing around the adapters if you have the same set up as i had
it might be helpfull to restart the virtualbox vm after you do some switching in vmware but i m not sure it is necessary

27330950
vmware	virtualbox
it might be helpfull to restart the virtualbox vm after you do some switching in vmware but i m not sure it is necessary
also i think the internet connection was succesfully established on virtualbox vm once i turned on the vmware vm - but i m not sure 100 about it

27331206
build.gradle	gradlew
have a look a the following build.gradle when gradlew -q help --task lol is run the following output occurs so this is how option looks like --debug-jvm here you can find how it s implemented - configuring an option not an option itself
org.gradle.api.internal.tasks.options.option is a part of internal gradlew api

gson	jackson
the method and class names are part from the gson library and part invented by me on the fly but you get the idea
i think it shouldn t be difficult to translate this using the classes of jackson

27334496
bash	subshell
edited answer enclosing the variable daysago with brackets will cause bash to interpret it as a subshell function a function with its own local variables
any global variable in this case daysago will not be substituted into the subshell function..think of the function like a separate script with codes and its own variables

27337012
swift	objective-c
so you have now two -size methods the original one from sktexture and a second one defined in your swift code
if you do the same with your own objective-c class defined in the same project then you will get a linker warning instance method size in category from users ... main.o overrides method from class in users ... myclass.o if the objective-c class is defined in a external framework as in your case the linker does not notice the conflict

division	modulo
when r is 0 this will not work because cannot be evaluated modulo 0 would require division by 0 to be defined
it attempts to evaluate the division before is checked

27343619
getchar	fgetc
getchar is equivalent to fgetc stdin and is often a macro
fgetc returns the character read as an int or returns eof to indicate an error or end of file. see also _set_fmode however i am not sure if that changes the behaviour right away or whether you have to close reopen the file

27343959
directx	direct2d
since windows.ui.xaml doesn t have a raster graphics api the only options are to use vector graphics to render into a bitmap and display that or to interop to directx
microsoft s win2d library at also see exposes direct2d through c# and is probably the best match for what you are looking for

27344535
directx	gdi
the third and probably best way to support drawing a large number of polygons would be to switch from using gdi to using something like directx or opengl that s designed from the ground up to support exactly that
the short answer is that gdi simply isn t designed to support drawing from multiple threads into the same dc simultaneously

27345851
inline	constexpr
basic.def.odr 3.2 4 an inline function shall be defined in every translation unit in which it is odr-used
if a constexpr function is not defined inside the header the compiler can not see the definition of the constexpr functions while compiling all the other source files

27346854
noexcept	throw
using the noexcept expr operator the library implementation can determine whether a particular operation may throw
the property of operations not throw becomes part of the contract if that contract is violated all bets are off and there may be no way to recover a valid state

27346854
noexcept	throw
to propagate knowledge about noexcept operations do not throw it is also necessary to declare functions as such
to this end you d use noexcept throw or noexcept expr with a constant expression

27347787
dns	spf
spf uses either the ehlo domain of the sending server or the domain in the return-path to look up spf records in dns
most systems that handle multiple domains do not use spf records on the ehlo domains of the sending servers so the spf domain is taken from the email s return-path

27347787
dns	spf
so adding spf records to your non-profit s dns won t do anything
while this may seem the easier path it causes problems with dmarc and may cause the email to be flagged as spam even if it passes spf as the address in the from header will have a domain that doesn t match the return-path if the return-path is on a subdomain of your non-profit s domain then you should definitely add an spf record to your non-profit s dns

d3.js	chart.js
there are a lot of conventional charting libraries built on top of d3.js - nvd3.js dimple.js dc.js if you want to go that route
i m not familiar with chart.js but a quick look at the website tells me it s more of a run of the mill charting library

27348815
keystore	jks
if you subsequently save your package to a different place eclipse will access the original keystore file from where it was originally saved but will not show you where that is. the problem is finding it
if you want to use android studio to access the keystore it suggests that you need a keystore with the file extension jks

27348815
keystore	jks
if you want to use android studio to access the keystore it suggests that you need a keystore with the file extension jks
a search for jks files will not show the eclipse generated keystore files as they don t have any file extension at all. find the place where you ve saved the original eclipse package and you ll find the keystore unless you deliberately saved it elsewhere

27348815
keystore	jks
a search for jks files will not show the eclipse generated keystore files as they don t have any file extension at all. find the place where you ve saved the original eclipse package and you ll find the keystore unless you deliberately saved it elsewhere

gruntjs	package.json
create a gruntfile.js containing update package.json with gruntjs grunt-cli and grunt-contrib-jasmine dependencies update npm dependencies npm update and relaunch test using gruntjs and not directly jasmine . node_modules grunt-cli bin gruntjs jasmine and you got done without errors
a solution is to use gruntjs

pickle	dill
no the dill._objects module is just a list of types dill can and cannot pickle
adding to that will just make dill think it can do more while remaining the same functionally

27354945
calloc	malloc
apparently the optimizer may not be that smart which is the reason for this question why malloc+memset is slower than calloc
i want to know whether using malloc over calloc has any advantages the differences between them are just calloc also takes object count as opposed to malloc which only takes byte count calloc zeros memory

27359749
ssl	https
this error message in client layer code is a consequence of code hardening following ssl v3.0 poodle vulnerability - cve-2014-3566 in recent java updates
and it is a bug - here are work-arounds in case you cannot update your jre immediately a first option is to force tls protocol when establishing https connection if you can update httpclient to a more recent version than 4.3.6 then sslv3 will be disabled by default and your code should no longer report such exception

27361827
build.gradle	gradlew
open up your top level build.gradle and look at the android gradlew plugin version it will look something like classpath com.android.tools.build gradlew 1.0.0-rc3
if the plugin is at version 0.13.0 or higher you need to make sure you are using gradlew 2.1 or newer. if the plugin is below version 0.14.4 you cannot use gradlew 2.2+

sudo	passwd
you should study the authorization services programming guide but if you want to do this using sudo you can
what sudo requires is a passwd to authorise the execution it normally gets this from the terminal - that is not the same as standard input though in a command shell the standard input by default is also connected to the terminal

27363410
sudo	passwd
what sudo requires is a passwd to authorise the execution it normally gets this from the terminal - that is not the same as standard input though in a command shell the standard input by default is also connected to the terminal
the -s option of sudo instructs it to read the passwd from the standard input

27365368
swift	objective-c
i had an object defined in swift this class was then used in the initializer of an objective-c object this made my unit tests for bar not compile since the myproject-swift.h header isn t real and the unit test target can t see it
the release note shared by hyouuu is on point - but i m not testing a swift class i m testing an objective-c class

27365368
swift	objective-c
the release note shared by hyouuu is on point - but i m not testing a swift class i m testing an objective-c class
i was able to fix this by changing the header file for bar to use a forward class reference instead i then included myproject-swift.h in bar.m and everything worked - my tests of objective-c objects written in objective-c compiled properly and continued running and i could write new tests for swift objects in swift

printwriter	bufferedwriter
but you shouldn t use printwriter over a network as it swallows exceptions you need to know about
use bufferedwriter

27366707
direct3d	directx
you ll need to use direct3d 9 and directsound8 avoid using d3dx9 at all so all hlsl shaders would have to be pre-built offline and you can t use the effects fx9 system or d3dxmath
if you are using vs 2012 vs 2013 you can target windows xp using the platform toolset but remember that that uses the windows 7.1a sdk and not the windows 8.x sdk so it has some implications for directx development

27372108
ssl	https
i m not sure it s fair to say there isn t any answer on stack overflow to the question of how ssl works cookies work the same way over https that they do over http
https is just http but with the server and client using a shared secret symmetric encryption key to encrypt and decrypt the data they exchange so that a third party can t intercept and read the communication

27373723
profiling	debugging
if you are using int32 values and your inputs are not happen to be boundary values then you can use this but i suggest you to forget all about it profiling your application you will see the real problem is somewhere else not in calling math.abs you should always make your code readable first then tweak performance problems after you prove that they are really performance problems
programmers waste enormous amounts of time thinking about or worrying about the speed of noncritical parts of their programs and these attempts at efficiency actually have a strong negative impact when debugging and maintenance are considered

27373737
opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
there are also and -webkit-image-set css function but they seem to be supported only by safari google-chrome opera
example i m not sure if the examples in the accepted answer by moin zaman work on ie firefox

27376502
swift	objective-c
whether you use any or anyobject depends on your intended use if your dictionary will be used only within swift code then you should use any because your types int double float string array and dictionary are not objects
if you will be passing your dictionary to objective-c routines that expect an nsdictionary then you should use anyobject

27379568
google-chrome	safari
the free codeschool course discover devtools focussed on the google-chrome devtools and sponsored by google-chrome may help you discover some of the features of client developer tooling and many of the interfaces and techniques will be broadly applicable to other browser dev tools
if you want to test on devices that are not available to you browsers that you cannot install on your system safari on windows or simply a newer or legacy version which you cannot install alongside the one already installed locally then there are services like browserstack which allow you to do so in hosted virtual machines

27379749
implements	extends
generators are implements as function scopes the scope of names defined in a class block is limited to the class block
it does not extends to the code blocks of methods this includes generator expressions since they are implements using a function scope

27380172
ubuntu	debian
you could use the ubuntu .deb file to install it on debian. but as the packaged fabric version is quite outdated i would recommend to install fabric the following way apt-get install python-setuptools # for easy_install easy_install pip pip install fabric
the fabric package is not available in debian

27387854
hex	binary
instead you need to decode the hex string into binary then use the encryptbinary function
note i did not see an iv mentioned in the link so my guess is they are using ecb mode not cbc. since the function also returns binary use binaryencode to convert the result to a more friendly hex string

27388057
swift	objective-c
you need to remember that the parameters are part of the name in objective-c so saveimagecomplete doesn t specify a method that could be called in swift
if your method were an objective-c method the selector would be something like saveimagecompleteimage err context

27390102
bower	npm
installing locally makes bower available to the current project where it stores all of the node modules in node_modules
this is usually only good for using a module like so it will not be available as a command that the shell can resolve until you install it globally npm install -g module where npm will install it in a place where your path variable will resolve this command

27392994
opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
elements have load and error events but they are garanteed only for google-chrome firefox and opera
if you don t need to support ie or safari i think this is just enough edit just tested with ie11 and ie8 onload is supported but onerror isn t

27393897
udp	tcp
the standard port numbers for rpcbind or portmapper are 111 udp 111 tcp and nfs are 2049 udp 2049 tcp
rpcinfo -p | sort -k 3 restore the pre-nfs-firewall-rules now write iptables rules for nfs server note loopback adapter has to allowed else you will see packets dropped and also when you restart nfs service it will spit error starting nfs quotas cannot register service rpc timed out rpc.rquotad unable to register rquotaprog rquotavers udp

27394174
uilabel	uibutton
the problem is that you re setting cell.button.tag to indexpath.row and if there are 12 or more rows your uibutton s can end up having the the same tag as one of your uilabel s already tagged 11 - 14
so what s occasionally happening when you call for example is that you re pulling out the uibutton and not the uilabel the cast doesn t change that and so you end up attempting to set the uibutton text when that property doesn t exist -- thus the error

27394681
g++	gcc
gcc compiling and g++ compiling files has a few extra macros
if you use g++ to link the object files it automatically links in the std c++ libraries gcc does not do this

27394681
g++	gcc
if you use g++ to link the object files it automatically links in the std c++ libraries gcc does not do this
that is why xcode g++ and clang++ will compile your code but gcc will throw errors

27394681
g++	gcc
g++ will compile files but they will all be treated as c++ files. also if you use g++ to link the object files it automatically links in the std c++ libraries gcc does not do this
gcc compiling c files has less predefined macros

27394745
strncpy	malloc
some minor comments you have not included the prototype for strncpy string.h you also cast the return value of malloc which is not a good thing to do - it is but not considered good practice
if you are on a c++ compiler that requires a cast then you should have used delete new instead not malloc free

27397116
rsa	aes
when you export public part or rsa key pair it is ok to make the 2nd cryptexportkey parameter null and export key in unencrypted form
however you can not do the same for symmetric key that must specify non-null hexpkey parameter. if you specify hexpkey parameter your code works see example if you want to do key exchange lets say if you want that alice send to bob her aes key you have to do following steps bob generates rsa key and sends its public part to alice

27399392
backtracking	greedy
the engine traverses the string from left to right and because it doesn t have to backtracking it won t attempt to shorten anything
to make it work in the way that s expected here you need to have a greedy prefix in your expression the first memory capture contains the string that you re after

27399462
java.util.calendar	java.util.date
if this is not possible it may be necessary for applications to convert these dates using java.util.calendar and explicit timezone definition
if you don t want to use a general solution you can always set format per property for more information please read here edit as a side note aka please do not use java.util.date ever

27402739
implements	extends
place the config.jelly in that directory in jenkins go to a job then to config next if the class you made extends a class derived from builder add build step if the class you made extends a class derived form publisher add action after build step and select the name you set in the getdisplayname method now your config.jelly should be visible in this section add to project page create a class implements action override the necessary methods and give them a value not null in the created builder publisher class override the method and return the above created class which implements action override the perform abstractbuild build launcher launcher buildlistener listener method in the builder publisher class and let it return true as it worked there is a link visible in the side panel on the project page link a index.jelly to this action class in a resource map with the same name as the action class you will see this page if you click on the link in the side panel to show something on the project page itself you need to create a file called floatingbox.jelly also in the resource map with the name of the action class
configuration page first you need a class which extends a descendant of buildstepcompatibilitylayer like the recorder or builder class

27403630
swift	objective-c
if you take a look at the objective-c header you ll notice that nsstringdrawingoptions is declared as an ns_enum which is why it gets converted as an enum in swift opposed to ns_options which gets converted to struct
due to that you cannot set it in swift to any another value but the available enum cases without getting a runtime error

27408468
apache	nginx
i wouldn t recommend putting apache in front of node however
nginx is better but not really necessary anymore

27411594
required	placeholder
obviously to not required html5 this page uses a sprite sheet with the different frames of these animated transitions
there are also single images obviously used as placeholder and as a fallback

27411658
concave	convex
if you find your framerate limited by cpu usage after this change or if you want to have a dynamic body be effectively concave you might get better performance by making a physics shape that s a compound of several other shapes build a dummy node hierarchy not one that s actually in your scene containing a bunch of cylinders or boxes arranged into a ring then make a physics shape from them with scnphycsicsshape node options
dynamic bodies in scenekit must be convex

27412809
swift	objective-c
variable type string in swift contains different functions compared to nsstring in objective-c
and as sulthan mentioned swift string doesn t implement randomaccessindex what you can do is downcast your variable of type string to nsstring this is valid in swift

27416840
vbo	vao
more precisely the vbo pointer are associated with the location quadattrib and that association is tracked in the vao
you queried quadattrib from your shader but the vao state does not contain any direct association with the shader

27417365
multiplying	multiplication
if i understand you want to multiplying the elements in the dictionary
so is not your solution results in try instead list comprehension to take into account the order because you shuffle it shuffle the keys before the multiplication then create the values list in the same order that the shuffled keys and finally multiplying the keys and finally random_key.append keys.pop random_key_value.append values.pop also take care about the random function it doesn t work as you are using it

27417761
setinterval	settimeout
use setinterval for achieving this as - in your code the for-loop wouldn t wait for the settimeout to complete
hence by the time settimeout waits

27424658
git-merge	git-rebase
rather i believe it is contrasting the behavior of git-rebase with git-merge
the merge strategies section is clearly ripped from the git-merge manual page so it s somewhat easy to imagine that the author felt the need to emphasize the swap when using git-rebase since it s not mentioned in that section

27424658
git-merge	git-rebase
the merge strategies section is clearly ripped from the git-merge manual page so it s somewhat easy to imagine that the author felt the need to emphasize the swap when using git-rebase since it s not mentioned in that section
the following sentence to me confirms this interpretation ... git-rebase replays each commit from the working branch on top of the branch using the given strategy ...

27429079
udp	tcp
in general the operating system of the machine where the server is running will look at the protocol type field of the ip packet see that it is udp look around for a matching listener not find one and then discard the packet
in the meantime the server process will have registered with the operating system listen for connections to a specific port for tcp connections

27431152
dictionary	map
it s in this line datal2 is a dictionary and dictionary does not have a method called append what you want is basically the call to json.load for this file returns a list of dictionary
json arrays map to python lists json objects map to python dictionaries

27432496
clang	llvm
i do not know the details about the binaries provided by the halide team but your problem may be that msvc often prevents to mix debug and release binaries especially if they use the stl see this answer building llvm clang and halide from source is easier that it looks and will allow you to build binaries suited to your build environment
i recently built llvm 3.5 clang and the latest halide with vs2012 without problems

27432903
vbscript	vba
initially it was helpful to use vbscript to provide an independent verification that the server was registered and working the simple code is shown above
vbscript uses late binding and i wanted early binding but it was nevertheless helpful because i then realised that excel did not work with the late binding vba code either on machine a

27432903
vbscript	vba
vbscript uses late binding and i wanted early binding but it was nevertheless helpful because i then realised that excel did not work with the late binding vba code either on machine a
something odd happened too with vbscript

27439238
comparator	comparable
this is not a good implementation of the comparator class but it will suffice due the bizarre request from your teacher
you should add the entity book as comparable by implement icomparable

27442053
debian	centos
the workaround i used on debian -
there is an open issue for this not centos specific the discussion contains some workarounds

27446979
required	placeholder
this would probably required a review of your database design
if your question is how to use an array in an in statement which i believe it is this code should help obviously you will not always know how many values you have in an array and therefore you can use this to dynamically generate the placeholder you may also consider adding another array element that is all elements together unfortunately this does not help if you need to test all variation of the ids ie 1 2 2 1 1 3 1 2 3

27447093
vim	emacs
note that in many distributions the default editor is not vim - though it looks a little like it - but some nano type thing where from memory you want o x or similar
you will need to configure your editor git config --global core.editor emacs substituting emacs for nano pico or something else you are familiar with

27448776
g++	gcc
i m not sure about g++ on windows64 with dmd
most other platforms including linux dmd works along well with g++ as does gdc + gcc

27454101
ethernet	wireless
if you re only seeing the sender and destination then likely you are seeing a fake ethernet capture need to scroll down a few paragraphs. hub probably isn t really the right term to describe an ap any more
a wireless network is basically a single medium like a hub network with bandwidth shared between clients

27454293
arraylist	treeset
if you expose that you are using an arraylist to store items client code becomes coupled to the arraylist implementation
you can not safely change it to a treeset because the implementation is part of the public interface

27457271
selecteditem	selectedindex
in case of objects you ll need to find which one is now the same as the one before because it s not the same instance anymore so you ll have to search for it in the new results list and assign it to the selecteditem
the easiest way would be to just re-set the selectedindex but because the list probably changes it would also sooner or later re-select the wrong item

27458820
gif	png
if you want to analyze the image data and transform it in various ways it makes sense to use a format with better colour support than gif eg a stream of png images which i assume is what zulko mentions in his answer
fwiw there s an anim format related to png called mng but it is not well supported or widely known

27460488
strcpy	strdup
strcpy writes to an existing buffer it doesn t need to and shouldn t call malloc
there s a different function strdup which copies a string and allocates just enough memory for it

27463604
oncreate	onstart
however if a service is triggered and it is already running then it will not go through oncreate
it will however go through onstartcommand onstart pre android 2.0

27463803
inline	inlining
it now has a semantical meaning and not an inline hint
you can use __forceinline in visual studio to enforce inlining - in practise it works in all cases where it s semantically possible

27463824
inline	inlining
compiler writers know this and consequently have heuristics in place which inline hints to follow and which not
while you can put everything in header files in c++ it is not a good idea to do so even that does not force inlining

27467446
daemons	systemd
the jvm will then shut itself down according to jls 12.8 emphasis added a program terminates all its activity and exits when one of two things happens all the threads that are not daemons threads terminate
some thread invokes the exit method of class runtime or class systemd and the exit operation is not forbidden by the security manager

27467584
interpolation	splines
cubic splines the most popular splines are cubic splines whose expression is splines interpolation problem given a function f x sampled at the discrete integer points k the splines interpolation problem is to determine an approximation s x to f x expressed in the following way where the ck s are interpolation coefficients and
splines prefiltering unfortunately starting from on so that the ck s are not the interpolation coefficients

27467857
subtraction	modulo
the conditional test and subtraction is typically less expensive than a modulo especially if the sum does not frequently exceed mod
a modulo is effectively an integer division instruction which typically has a latency which is an order of magnitude greater than that of compare subtract

27470016
swift	objective-c
in order to get it running in my app i had to make sure to implement the xmppstreamdelegate protocol as well as to inherit from nsobject which is given as you are inheriting from uiviewcontroller like so swift class signinviewcontroller uiviewcontroller xmppstreamdelegate objective-c
as i use the xmpp framework with swift i am not sure whether this helps you

27472788
setinterval	settimeout
additional explanation using nested settimeout instead of setinterval prevents checkreadystate from overlapping and race conditions when its execution is prolonged for some random reasons
settimeout has a default delay of 4ms so active polling will not drastically affect program performance

27473723
interpolation	splines
for your particular problem where you want to interpolation a series of 3d points using a splines basically it is a univariate interpolation problem
however since a space curve cannot be represented as y f x the splines function will be represented in parametric form as s t x t y t z t

27475898
cdr	cons
rest func car rest loop cdr rest really straightforward and guarantees left-to-right order
rest cons func car rest recur cdr rest in scheme the evaluation order for function arguments is not specified

27477149
postgresql	mysql
in postgresql you can use distinct on clause
my simple solution for sqlite and probably mysql however it doesn t work in postgresql and maybe some other platforms

27485863
ienumerable	iqueryable
casting iqueryable to ienumerable works but should not be used
the reason is iqueryable has funky implementation of ienumerable

27487493
swift	objective-c
given all that it s pretty simple to turn the objective-c in that answer demonstrating pressing cmd-space to swift i just tried pasting this into a scratch app and it worked fine though i haven t checked the api docs for whether the retain is the correct thing to do or not
the code on that linked answer is fairly readily convertible to swift code however there are a handful of gotchas you will need to take care of along the way cgeventsourcecreate takes a cgeventsourcestateid which is a typealiase for a uint32 but the constants such as kcgeventsourcestatehidsystemstate are defined as int so you ll have to cast them cgeventsourcestateid kcgeventsourcestatehidsystemstate

27489906
serializable	deserialization
a serializable class can declare its own serialversionuid explicitly by declaring a field named serialversionuid that must be static final and of type long if a serializable class does not explicitly declare a serialversionuid then the serializable runtime will calculate a default serialversionuid value for that class based on various aspects of the class as described in the java tm object serializable specification
however it is strongly recommended that all serializable classes explicitly declare serialversionuid values since the default serialversionuid computation is highly sensitive to class details that may vary depending on compiler implementations and can thus result in unexpected invalidclassexceptions during deserialization

27491452
intersect	contains
let s iterate over all events and maintain a sorted set using a balanced binary search tree edges should be compared by their y-coordinate their relative order never changes because none of them intersect of all started but not ended edges the first type event adds one edge to the set the second type removes one
i claim that one polygon is contains within another if and only if at some point there is a following sequence in the set a b b a where a are edges of one polygon and b are edges of the other

27492856
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox
edit 2 firefox is interpreting and doing something different compared to google-chrome and safari
edit 3 in firefox div#wrapper is not centered

27495401
build.gradle	gradlew
however that plugin has not been updated in quite some time and i expect that the build.gradle file it would generate would be largely broken
you may also wish to set up a basic gradlew wrapper to smooth the import process

27499216
scheme	racket
scheme for short or #
racket which are synonyms and not a official scheme language

27499216
scheme	racket
racket which are synonyms and not a official scheme language
for an actual scheme language you need to use #

27500496
client-side	server-side
also keep in mind that client-side js is single threaded so when you are sitting at a client-side js breakpoint somewhere other js cannot run until the current js thread of execution has finished
as for the behavior in breakpoints on the server-side that all depends upon what the server execution environment is and how it works during a breakpoint

27501179
implements	extends
becouse activedirectoryldapauthenticationprovider is a final class i implements the adcustomauthenticationprovider via composition this way in the mapper i extended ldapuserdetailsmapper implements only mapuserfromcontext method
i ll probably need to implement mapusertocontext method beacuse i m using a custom userdetails implementation that not extends ldapuserdetails so the reverse convertion process could throw an exception... note this way i m repeating the same query to users table two times.

27501607
client-side	server-side
i m also assuming the api and front-end code runs on the same domain here although if this is not the case you can use cors to allow your front-end code to read and retreive data client-side via the api
yes the server-side script would be the way to go if you do not want to expose the secret api key within your client side code or request data

27506526
namenode	hdfs
from the comments no java processes are running and thus neither the namenode nor jobtracker are running
the particular error 8020 refers to the namenode hdfs is not up

27506526
namenode	hdfs
the particular error 8020 refers to the namenode hdfs is not up
depending on the version of hadoop you may be able to do start-dfs.sh start-mapred.sh or start-all.sh after that you will need to examine the hdfs logs to see what are the issues

27508697
nunit	mstest
and do not yet make use of xunit .net or nunit as these cannot be combined into one report without switching to the new agile test runner
mstest is kind of the deprecated test framework of visual studio 2013

27508881
octal	decimal
010 is an octal number it starts with a 0 which isn t followed by a decimal point which is 8 in decimal
see the manual for numbers to use octal notation precede the number with a 0 zero

27509477
ssl	https
explain the mechanism can be lengthy so i will just list the most significant differences in behaviour do require ssl in iis the context basically expalin what it do it s require not enforce which means if people trying to access your website content through http the server will just respond with a 403 error which is usually not a desired behavior but this may help some certain situation using url rewrite module the module itself can do quite some different thing but i assume you are just going to do the regular https redirect
which means if user trying to hit any content of the site through http the server will do a 301 or 302 redirect to the https version of same url

27512184
floating-point	fixed-point
they do not have floating-point to integer conversions defined and thus can only be written to using integer colors
traditionally what happens is that the value gets clamped to the range 0.0 1.0 and then since 99 of the time the output color format is unsigned normalized each component is re-scaled to the fixed-point range if gl_rgb8 float_color 255

27515573
client-side	server-side
javascript cannot do this nor any other client-side language
as a matter of fact there are no server-side languages that can do that either

27515738
gtk	gdk
the designers of gtk did not want to have all the window manager interaction code for each individual platform that gtk supports in gtk itself
instead they created a separate library included with the gtk source code called gdk

27517319
swift	objective-c
while in objective-c you were able to compare any two pointers with this is no longer true in swift since types play a much greater role during compilation
a playground will give you with strings we will have to get used to this but then you can also have fun as follows i am sure you can think of a lot more funny cases - update for swift 3 as suggested by the comment from jakub truhlář this looks a little more consistent with type int does not conform to protocol anyobject however we then get type of 1 as anyobject _swifttypepreservingnsnumber.type but the explicit conversion makes clear that there might be something going on. on the string-side of things nsstring will still be available as long as we import cocoa

27517463
knitr	latex
with knitr + latex the option will prevent a pdf version from automatically being included i m not sure if this is necessary for rmarkdown
the above code will generate a file called myplot.png which in latex can then easily be included in the document with an includegraphics command nested in a figure environment

27517824
gruntjs	package.json
the gruntjs package should be installed in your project directory using something like that will add a line to your project s package.json file then you configure a gruntfile.js for your project with tasks that are run from the command line with
you re not supposed to install gruntjs globally only grunt-cli

27518276
g++	gcc
if you use gcc instead of g++ the c++ library is not automatically linked
this is from man g++ however the use of gcc does not add the c++ library

27518276
g++	gcc
this is from man g++ however the use of gcc does not add the c++ library
g++ is a program that calls gcc and automatically specifies linking against the c++ library

27518292
gam	mgcv
i m going to assume you re using gam from the mgcv library
it appears that gam doesn t like functions that are not defined in base in the s terms

27519617
factors	mean
i assume you mean something like this assumes year is a factors as it is in your sample data
if it s numeric use factors year note that most lattice functions expect a formula as the first parameter not a simple vector

27520148
spaces	delimiter
do not worry about spaces character as you are already accepting input using nextline
the issue is with your delimiter pattern

27520850
hive	hdfs
for example if you have a table named a in mysql you could use sqoop to get the table into hive like so sqoop import --connect jdbc mysql localhost yourdbname --username root -p --table a --hive-import --hive-table a -m 1 once the import gets completed you can join two tables assuming b is your other table in hive
no you could not use hive to join table sitting in mysql oracle with table in hdfs

27520850
hive	hdfs
no you could not use hive to join table sitting in mysql oracle with table in hdfs
as a workaround you could use sqoop to get the table s from mysql oracle to hive and then join them both within hive

27522547
multiplying	multiplication
fun4 0.007 s moreover since fun8 is not that memory hungry anymore due to the smart tensordot you can multiplying much bigger arrays and see it use multiple cores
you could sum over one index first and then continue the multiplication

27522788
build.gradle	gradlew
add publishnondefault true into its build.gradle from gradlew plugin user guide it is also possible to publish all variants of a library
we are planning to allow this while using a normal project-to-project dependency like shown above but this is not possible right now due to limitations in gradlew we are working toward fixing those as well . publishing of all variants are not enabled by default. to enable them android publishnondefault true application add normal and simulator product flavors productflavors

27524499
xslt	xquery
the documentation here says that xslt support is experimental and keys are not yet implemented
i haven t come across qt4 before but it seems to be primarily an xquery engine

27525305
ssl	https
elb can only serve up a single ssl certificate
if you are using ssl you have to have exactly one cert that s valid for all of the domain names or you have to run the elb listener in transparent tcp not https mode and handle the ssl certs with sni on the instances themselves

27525521
profiling	debugging
but if you try with distribution provisioning profiling to send notification than you must have to run app in distribution mode.it doesn t work if your app is run in debugging mode
if you run your app in device as a debugging mode than only development profiling will work to send notification

27527146
g++	gcc
for this release version 4.8.2 of the g++ runtime library is used. reference
it is not possible to load a shared library which is built with gcc into an executable built with solaris studio 12.3. if exceptions are not disabled

27533364
jruby	mri
i ve tested both mri yarv and jruby on my rails application. since most of what the app does is route http requests fetch from db apply simple business logic and write to the db parallelism isn t much of an issue
puma on mri does handle multi-threading for blocking io operations db api

27534033
trie	dawg
a trie for all of english would only use up something like 26mb which isn t very much
i would only go with the dawg if space usage really is at a premium and you aren t doing many insertions or deletions

27535012
nsurlconnection	nsurlsession
further nsurlconnection doesn t honour the device proxy settings
you can use the code you have to retrieve the configured proxy and then use this with a library such as nsurlsession or afnetworking that does support the use of a proxy server

27540157
daemons	systemd
you can use normal old style daemons that forks with init script
if the application does not fork on its own you can use something like supervisord to do the forking for you and directly integrate with separate systemd script

27543122
ssl	https
when an https url reaches an intermediate ssl offloading server the request is decoded to offload the decoding task which would have been done by the actual target server otherwise into an http request and the ssl offloader now sends that decoded http request to the actual target server it may go through few other intermediary servers for other purposes as well . now the target server has no clue whether it was originally an https request or not and it treats it as an http request only
this is the reason why a servlet calling sendredirect on the target server will result into an http url for the redirected resource having a relative url and the same http url is sent back to the client browser. remember no ssl offloading server will come into picture for this url as it s an http request and not an https request

27543122
ssl	https
this is the reason why a servlet calling sendredirect on the target server will result into an http url for the redirected resource having a relative url and the same http url is sent back to the client browser. remember no ssl offloading server will come into picture for this url as it s an http request and not an https request
if the redirected resource is an absolute https url then also an intermediate ssl offloader may convert that https request into an http request before it reaches to the client browser

google-chrome	firefox
result google-chrome version 39.0.2171.95 64-bit linux mint 17 but in firefox innerhtml doesn t split the contents into many nodes firefox version 34.0 linux mint 17 so you d need to take into account that different browsers handle childnodes differently and perhaps iterate over all child nodes and concatenate
i noticed this because i tried to use innerhtml to unescape a 100k html encoded string. in fact in firefox i can create an of length 167 772 160 by looping to above

27545923
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
firefox will render it fine when it s in the body but google-chrome doesn t
i don t know how internet explorer opera safari behave but go with the safe choice and put it in the header

27546498
uilabel	uibutton	uicontrol	uibutton
because uilabel is just a uiview type where as uibutton is uicontrol type
that s why you couldn t change the uibutton class name to uilabel or subclass of uilabel in ib

27550477
oncreate	findviewbyid
you can truly respect the lifecycle of your objects being an activity oncreate onresume etc or a fragment oncreate oncreateview onviewcreated etc which differs
answer again in your case textview findviewbyid r.id.current_location makes no sense from the activity point of view since current_location is not in its view but in one of its children a fragment

27553107
spaces	delimiter
it is not either tab or spaces
works if you switch to raw strings prints in general delimitedlist works with something like pdpdp where p is the parse target and d is the delimiter or delimiting sequence

27553566
quicksort	heapsort	quicksort	mergesort
this uses 5 algorithms internally depending upon dataset size do checkout the source code of arrays class. before java 1.6 i think it was using three algorithm quicksort for primitive types such as int and mergesort for objects and when quicksort out performs it start heapsort see here for more details
first of all arrays.sort doesn t only use quicksort it uses multiple algorithms java1.6 onwards see below code from arrays class sorts the specified array into ascending numerical order. implementation note the sorting algorithm is a dual-pivot quicksort by vladimir yaroslavskiy jon bentley and joshua bloch

27554580
multiplying	division
another possibility that may be advantageous on some targets if you are only ever coding for desktop x86 targets this may be irrelevant is to avoid the multiplying instruction by using shifts given that is equivalent to the expression in the loop can be replaced with but again the optimizer may well do that for you
it will also avoid the repeated evaluation of but if that were not the case the following may be beneficial the shifting technique is likely to be more advantageous for division operations which are far more expensive on most targets and it is only applicable to constants

27555011
pascal	delphi
in most if not all c implementations certainly for windows char is an 8-bit 1-byte value so an ansichar is most likely to be the appropriate pascal type and ensures a 1-byte char on any delphi version
returning to your specific example the fact that explicitly dimensioned arrays are involved rather than explicitly or implicitly null terminated strings i think it may be advisable in this particular case to declare types for each of the required array types with corresponding pointer types you then have two choices in your pascal version of the c function declaration

27556940
textview	imageview
you are putting those controls textview button on the right side of the imageview with id ivimage
however your layout does not contain any imageview with that id but has one with ivlove

27558108
ssl	https
to start a play server with ssl turned on then connect to wss localhost 9443 ws2
it looks like you re trying to connect to the http port using wss that can never work you need to enable https and then change the url not just to wss but also to use the https port

27563283
addition	multiplication
mathematical side note the num class generally models algebraic structures called rings which have a commutative addition and a not necessarily commutative multiplication which satisfy some compatibility rules
in this case the addition is not commutative so it cannot be a ring

27566455
super	self
super already passes self along for you
super ipaddresssimple would not know about self so in that case you d need to call super ipaddresssimple .__init__ self ip_type

27566639
super	implements
the reason why it is not possible is because of languages like c# doesn t support multi-inheritance like we used in languages like c and that s a compiler s choice to recognize the right super class s members
the way that c# compiler is implements it doesn t know which member is which if we don t declare that explicitly

27566958
inline	inlining
from gcc documentation always_inline generally functions are not inline unless optimization is specified
for functions declared inline this attribute inlines the function independent of any restrictions that otherwise apply to inlining

27571390
spaces	delimiter
hence when the string does not contain the separating spaces between the operands and the operator sscanf consumes all the input
i ll append here a different approach to your problems solution we copy the string this is required by strtok you can t pass an inmutable string there are plenty of methods to copy this string you just have to pick the appropriate one for your case now we use strpbrk to find the operator create a string containing the operator as a delimiter now we use strtok to tokenize the string and find the operands second call to strtok needs null first argument and finally free our copy of the input string

27571755
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome it s possible to place linkbutton inside tags
in firefox and ie 10 it s not

27574832
exponent	modulo
the problem is that n and possibly the private exponent are negative
modular arithmetic doesn t work with a negative modulo

27576504
clang	llvm
later phases of compilation are either built into the clang tool as libraries or if they are separate executables clang knows how to invoke them
with the right command line arguments you can make clang stop part way thru -emit-ast just does the parse and makes the abstract syntax tree -emit-llvm makes the llvm intermediate representation but not turn it into code for your computer clang will work as the driver for the whole build because that s what programmers usually want the soure parsed the object generated the executable made

27576760
swift	objective-c
i like implementing the above example as an initializer to make it cleaner in swift
i think your best bet for now until apple updates the implementation of nskeyedunarchiver to not use exceptions or adds exception support to swift you are going to have to use an objective-c wrapper to try-catch

27576760
swift	objective-c
i think your best bet for now until apple updates the implementation of nskeyedunarchiver to not use exception-handling or adds exception-handling support to swift you are going to have to use an objective-c wrapper to try-catch
you can see an example of a wrapper here essentially you can introduce a single objective-c function or class that will allow you to use a try-catch block from swift

27578685
oncreate	findviewbyid	oncreate	setcontentview
in oncreate which puts the custom view in the frame
alongside the classic causes mentioned elsewhere make sure you ve called setcontentview before findviewbyid make sure that the id you want is in the view or layout you ve given to setcontentview make sure that the id isn t accidentally duplicated in different layouts there is one i have found for custom views in standard layouts which goes against the documentation in theory you can create a custom view and add it to a layout see here

27581705
implements	extends
edit as thumbnail says this turned out to be a faulty approach - i was only testing records implements the protocol interface and didn t notice that extends the applicative protocol didn t actually implements functor
remember extends does not require that the type being extended is a concrete implementation

27584971
decimal	ieee
dr there is nothing political about decimal 128 bit formats being worked on and binary 128 bit formats not there is a proposal for one and not the other and the proposer me has no interest to write proposals for both
here are a few simple reasons why there is work on decimal128 and not a binary floating point with 128 bits ieee 754 2008 defines three basic decimal floating point formats 32 64 and 128 bit

27584971
decimal	ieee
the decimal floating point support will be required to use ieee 754 2008 semantics
the currently defined floating point format is still not required to follow ieee 754 semantics and doesn t even define the base there are implementations using base 2 and base 16

27587464
multiplying	multiplication
if you multiplying a column vector by a row vector you will get the matrix of pairwise products so your code would result in version 2 - more general and reusing code if your formula were to combine the values by something else than multiplication you couldn t go with linear algebra
for this there is the marvelous function bsxfun which combines the column and row vectors in a similar way but you can specify the function to use instead of multiplication

27587932
ubuntu	centos
it s not really a solution but more a workaround. i have replaced the centos vm by ubuntu and now everything runs smoothly just be ensuring the folders are owned by apache user. it is really a mystery to me
and i realise that i had never deployed a symfony application on centos before

27592681
daemons	systemd
a look at the designing daemons and services section for an overview of possible routes and best practices for overall design
if your app runs entirely in user space is not for all users on the systemd you can go with a login item as your server application if you want to provide ui for starting and managing tasks

27594970
spaces	delimiter
the below code should work but has not been optimized printing out output.tostring generates updated requirements also include delimiter characters + - and non-delimiter characters are only digits with optional spaces before the delimiter
any such spaces are part of the value not delimiter themselves

27598539
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc
the solution was to not use realloc malloc but only calloc
of course the makes doing a realloc a problem

27599417
draggable	droppable
also you can make use of the position utility method to center the draggable relative to droppable with ease
the problem is that jquery ui draggable widget does not actually append the element to droppable on drop it just manipulates the css positioning properties hence will be false even if the item is dropped into another droppable

27599417
draggable	droppable
the problem is that jquery ui draggable widget does not actually append the element to droppable on drop it just manipulates the css positioning properties hence will be false even if the item is dropped into another droppable
you can fix this by manually appending the draggable to droppable

27601912
retrofit	okhttp
update 03 2016 since retrofit 2.0 there s no need for making your own responseinterceptor you can make use of the okhttp interceptors that come integrated with it
as retrofit currently doesn t provide a standard way of doing it i managed to make it work by decorating the retrofit.client.client implementation that is given to the retrofit.restadapter see it below 1 define an interface for the interceptor 2 make an implementation of it

27604464
boost	stl
qt would guarantee binary and source compatibility during the life cycle of the same major version while boost may not do the same for such a long period as qtcore does
either way none of these options are pure stl solutions in the end of the day the way i think you wanted it to

27604953
ienumerable	ilist
for subtypes casting you need to have a generic covariant interface. ienumerable and iqueryable are a good examples of that
the only thing that you need is that every method of this interface only return objects of type t covariance or if the interface methods only receive object of type t contravariance and you interface definition need the in out word. ex then in your specific sample you can not use casting because ilist isn t covariant

27609079
inline	inlining
whether to inline a function or not is entirely up to the compiler s discretion which means that different compilers might have different criteria for function inlining
that being said you can prompt the compiler to inline a function with keywords such as inline __inline and __forceinline

27609623
inline-functions	inlining
the effects of instantiation declarations a guarantee that the template is not instantiated implicitly does not apply to inline-functions according to 14.7.2 temp.explicit paragraph 10 except for inline-functions declarations with types deduced from their initializer or return value 7.1.6.4 const variables of literal types variables of reference types and class template specializations explicit instantiation declarations have the effect of suppressing the implicit instantiation of the entity to which they refer
note the intent is that an inline function that is the subject of an explicit instantiation declaration will still be implicitly instantiated when odr-used 3.2 so that the body can be considered for inlining but that no out-of-line copy of the inline function would be generated in the translation unit. end note the standard library is clearly free to declare any of its functions as inline

27610502
calloc	malloc
the irony is that the only part of your code that was actually right was the calloc part except for not checking the returned value from it
first problem you don t initialize the values of x or y and still you try to print them while the other problem being the more important is and then you malloc you should malloc this way which yields but since you want to allocate 128 of int it is clearer to do this is the fixed code you must always check the result of malloc it returns null on failure

27610916
super	implements
so what you can do in this instance is implements what i refer to as a super object much like a regular object but only with a cape jk
here s what i mean now with the super object any calls to ancillary data stored in other tables will not cost you a db hit which will truly lend itself to optimizing your app

27614808
bash	zsh
above patch does not hurt bash i ve tested on bash-4.3.30 1 -release
you could patch django_bash_completion something like below on zsh zsh-5.0.7 here it works fine with explicitly using env 1

27616419
factors	matrix
if the original matrix is written as consisting of row vectors the normal matrix can be calculated by replacing each row by the cross product of the other two rows this neglects a constant factors which is 1 divided by the determinant
but often times you ll have to re-normalize the transformed normals anyway so the constant factors does not matter

27616758
oncreate	findviewbyid
you cannot call any activity methods like findviewbyid before oncreate
move the call to oncreate

27618213
build.gradle	gradlew
they belong in the individual module build.gradle files remove the 2 compile statements in that gradlew file compile com.android.support appcompat-v7 20.+ compile com.google.android.gms play-services 6.5.+ and then make your other module s build.gradle dependencies look like this
as the note of your project s build.gradle file suggests note do not place your application dependencies here

27619409
jboss	glassfish
but you can use mobicents built on top of tomcat or jboss
i m not sure if you can use glassfish for sip servlets i m not aware of any implementation working with it

27620191
matlab	simulink
it depends what sort of integration you are after if you just want to load some data from the database run your simulink model using that data and then maybe write some data back onto the database once the simulation is finished you don t need to the matlab function block you refer to
simply write your matlab code as scripts or functions doesn t matter and call those scripts functions in the model callbacks probably in the preloadfcn postloadfcn or initfcn callback for the code to load the data from the database and in the stopfcn for the code to write the data back to the database

27620203
swift	objective-c
this attribute indicates that the protocol should be exposed to objective-c code and is described in using swift with cocoa and objective-c
even if you are not interoperating with objective-c you need to mark your protocols with the objective-c attribute if you want to be able to check for protocol conformance

27622013
swift	objective-c
explanation there are two reasons in general that can prevent a particular swift class or method from being used in objective-c
the first is that a pure swift class uses c++-style vtable dispatch which is not understood by objective-c

27622013
swift	objective-c
i say effectively because if you try this and print the name of the class in objective-c it shows _ttc7divided5nguni00007fb5e2419a20 where divided is the name of my swift module
so objective-c is certainly aware that this is not a watusi . workaround a workaround is to use a thunk that hides the generic type parameter

27623286
base	fractions
it s virtually guaranteed depending on the integer and floating point number involved because of the mismatch between what we use fractions numbers in base 10 and what ieee-754 floating point numbers actually are fractions numbers in base 2 then represented in base 10 for our use
just as we can t represent 10 3 precisely in base 10 there are various base 10 numbers that cannot be precisely stored in base 2

27623903
udp	tcp
fortunately in most cases you don t want to send or receive udp packets bigger than around 1500 bytes anyway since that is the largest packet an ethernet card can send without fragmenting it into smaller packets and generally you want to avoid fragmentation if possible
for tcp keep in mind that you are sending receiving a stream of bytes rather than a series of individual packets and that so the sizes you pass to send and recv will not generally correspond to the sizes of the network packets anyway

27624185
prepare	execute
the nested db.execute insert ... call resets the list of prepare statements associated to the connection object
the solution is to not rely on the shortcut execute method s automatic cursor management and to explicitly hold a reference to the running cursor

27626466
swift	objective-c
but not native swift stuff like string or array etc
it seems that needs to return an object that conforms to objective-c protocol

27628974
super	self
or to be specific - classes that do not call super in your code configparser.rawconfigparser__init__ .. is never called
to fix this you could call it manually simply add configparser.rawconfigparser.__init__ self ... in acc s init although i m not sure this is recommended or even valid

27628974
super	self
this will prevent super from calling them
the other answer isn t very safe because of this scenario fix to other answer adding these lines to acc s __init__ should inform to explicitly instantiate the classes configparser.rawconfigparser.__init__ self theclassicclass.__init__ self to confirm the problem in your code let s try to reproduce this problem in a simple setup.

27629705
textview	imageview
one has 3 textview one has 2 textview and one has 1 imageview
i have noticed that you last imageview is of height where as most other things in your code are i cannot guarantee that this will fix your problems and knowing how layout pieces interact with each other is very intricate sometimes

27630255
centos	linux
i built that on centos and it works fine
just follow the instructions in its install file to install it -- it requires a c++ compiler which is commonly on linux or if not install one using yum or apt

27636369
implements	extends
so first - warrior should not implements weapon definitely
implementing an interface or extends a class is an is a relationship

27637940
inline	inlining
we could potentially do better here for example if 99 of calls end up in the same target you can generate code that does a check on the method table of the object the virtual call is going to execute on if it s not the 99 case you do a call else you just execute the inline code but unlike the j language most of the calls in the primary languages we support are not virtual so we re not forced to be so aggressive about optimizing this case
delegates can point to anything at runtime so inlining isn t that easy

27638714
implements	extends
update you can t use action performed for panel it s only for buttons or like that.if you want to do something with click on panel then you need to use implements mouselistner .and put action code inside mouseclick method .run this example at that time you only want to move square with mouse click so u can still use awt mouse event but when you use keys you have to use key binding
you cannot add non visual component to jpanel so you need to extends redsquare class from component for example jpanel and override paintcomponent method

27641843
noexcept	throw
for that an assert handler that throw a particular form of exception is used and the test driver can then call out of contract and verify that the component is checking the behavior long winded story the point is that if that if the functions with narrow contracts can be called out of contract are marked as noexcept because the implementation should never throw calling front on an container then when called out of contract it cannot throw and the above mechanism cannot be used to verify that the component will detect contract violations
this was part of the reason for a late revision of the c++11 standard just before approval to remove noexcept from all functions with a narrow contract

27642780
wav	ogg
but better ogg than wav
encoding into smaller formats is currently only supported by firefox chrome firefox gecko internet explorer opera safari webkit not supported 25.0 25.0 not supported not supported not supported afaik only ogg is supported

27644058
retrofit	okhttp
as on okhttp wiki says interceptors will not work in retrofit with okurlfactory
you need to provide your client implementation to execute retrofit requests on this custom client and directly on okhttp unfortunately it is not out yet soon

27645346
ng-view	ng-include
html above tag will render the template from the condition which you had mentioned in .config configuration phase of angular limitations - the page can only contain single ng-view on page if your spa has multiple small components on the page that you wanted to render based on some conditions fails
to achieve that we need to use directives like ng-include ng-switch ng-if ng-show which looks bad to have them in spa you can not relate between two routes like parent and child relationship

27647327
viewdidload	viewdidappear
do not write anything in viewdidload
try putting webview related code viewdidappear or any custom method

27647692
keystore	jks
you can download it on portecle.sourceforge.net you will need to use that tool to create a keystore in jks format for the server side and another keystore in bks format for the client side
the format is different because android does not support natively the usage of jks keystores only bks and viceversa

27647692
keystore	jks
the format is different because android does not support natively the usage of jks keystore only bks and viceversa
once you have two keystore created you need to generate a key pair public and private key for each one of them

27649221
noexcept	throw
i also recommend scott meyers book effective modern c++ item 14 declare functions noexcept if they won t emit exceptions for further reading
there are many examples of functions that i know will never throw but for which the compiler cannot determine so on its own

27649221
noexcept	throw
on the other hand if you are confident that the function should never throw and it is correct that it is part of the specification you should declare it noexcept
however keep in mind that the compiler will not be able to detect violations of noexcept if your implementation changes

27650158
interpolation	splines
the first and last points aren t connected in the way we interpolation
we can fix this by padding the x and y sequences with the second-to-last and second points so that there are wrap-around boundary conditions for the splines at the endpoints

27651732
postgresql	mysql
whatever tool you used to convert your mysql schema and database to postgresql is also sort of at fault
the type cast is not needed postgresql can convert an integer to double precision all by itself so just amount double precision default 0 is sufficient

27652283
stateless	stateful
so your stateless bean inside a request scoped backing bean will destroyed after http request-response but the stateful one will go to the passive state
before a stateful session bean is deployed it is in the does not exist state

27653626
punctuation	words
while dotnet answer is on the right way it assumes that you should maintain punctuation marks list yourself it isn t full in his answer
besides there could be words with hyphen

27654082
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
and per the runtimeexception javadoc runtimeexception and its subclasses are unchecked-exception
unchecked-exception do not need to be declared in a method or constructor s throws clause if they can be thrown by the execution of the method or constructor and propagate outside the method or constructor boundary

27655334
super	self
a typical superclass call looks like this class c b def method self arg super c self .method arg
super only works for new-style classes any class which inherits from object .so you couldn t pass class object to super

27658385
google-chrome	firefox
you can switch to chromedriver to make it work this is what i m sure is working getting google-chrome performance and tracing logs browser performance tests through selenium
as far as i understand performance logs are not available for firefox webdriver at the moment

27662227
vbscript	vb6
you also don t specify how the pos software knows about your dll and whether it uses automation idispatch like vbscript would or custom interfaces and you don t say who declares the interfaces
setting up the appropriate interfaces in c# vb.net can be a tricky problem because vb6 doesn t exactly make it easy to look at the details

27663278
quicksort	timsort
soon after timsort became the way java sorts an array of objects too alas not an array of primitives -- for technical reasons that had to remain a less robust variant of quicksort
btw timsort is named after its inventor tim peters also known as the timbot in python circles being a bot in the python community involves being able to respond to a lot of technical questions very fast and usually correctly

27663285
decimal	ieee
further that proposal dates from 2009 and has not taken into account cor.2 2012. iso prolog does only provide a framework for floating points see iso iec 13211-1 1995 7.1.3 floating point both binary decimal and even any positive even base radix would fit
in the 1980s some systems c-prolog used to have floats with a precision a bit lower than single precision ieee floats

27665325
strtol	atoi
the behavior is the same as strtol nptr null 10
except that atoi does not detect errors

27665971
multiplying	multiplication
also the multiplication has to be a complex multiplying not a multiplying of just the 2 separated component vectors
multiplication in the frequency domain does a circular convolution not a straight linear convolution unless you zero pad out the ffts and ifft to longer than the sum of the length of the time domain signal and the full time domain impulse response

27666093
noexcept	throw
the keyword noexcept can be used in two contexts the noexcept operator which takes an expression as an argument and returns a bool indicating whether or not the expression is non-throwing
the noexcept specifier which is used to specify whether a function throw or not

27666093
noexcept	throw
the noexcept specifier which is used to specify whether a function throw or not
this form optionally takes one bool constant expression which determines whether the function is noexcept or not

27671100
bash	subshell
for a very brief period the child process is still running bash but we don t consider this a subshell because it s not doing any shell command processing -- that was all done in the original shell and the child is just starting up the external program as if via an explicit exec for commands like ls
in the case of a pipeline if any of the commands are shell built-ins they run in a subshell

27672764
persistent	transient
it has no persistent representation in the database and no identifier value has been assigned
transient instances will be destroyed by the garbage collector if the application does not hold a reference anymore

27673808
lxml	beautifulsoup
what you though can improve is don t let beautifulsoup go searching sections inside other sections by passing aside from that improvement lxml would do the job faster tree.xpath count section
beautifulsoup cannot give you just a count number of tags it found

27674666
prepare	execute
the current mysql 5.7 manual section d.1 restrictions on stored programs states that sql prepare statements prepare execute deallocate prepare can be used in stored procedures but not stored functions or triggers
thus stored functions and triggers cannot use dynamic sql where you construct statements as strings and then execute them

27674666
prepare	execute
because local variables are in scope only during stored program execution references to them are not permitted in prepare statements created within a stored program
prepare statement scope is the current session not the stored program so the statement could be execute after the program ends at which point the variables would no longer be in scope. so you can see that it s not permitted

27676961
move	drag
given that you don t want the finger dragging to do anything to the object in that case anyway it would seem that you should just be checking for platformtouched.startmovex existing in the move and ended phase blocks and ignoring the event if it doesn t exist
i m not sure i fully understand the question and i know i don t know much about corona sdk but it sounds like the problem is that you aren t getting a begin phase event on your object when the drag touch starts outside of your platforma object and are only getting the move phase event when the finger crosses the object

27677551
noexcept	throw
vector is resized sequently grow to different memory location which should have triggered move for first push std vector will utilize a move-constructor during a reallocation only if that move-constructor is declared with a noexcept specifier or if there is no available copy-constructor see std move_if_noexcept for more details by adding the following minor change you will get the output copy constructor move constructor move constructor move constructor the noexcept specifier tells the std vector implementation that it can safely apply a move-semantics to its content
otherwise you wouldn t have a strong exception safety guarantee which basically states that the vector remains intact if the reallocation fails due to an exception 23.3.6.5 vector.modifiers p1 requires if an exception is throw other than by the copy constructor move constructor assignment operator or move assignment operator of t or by any inputiterator operation there are no effects

27678173
memcpy	calloc
you shouldn t just memcpy the cmdline into
allocate the memory for one single argument before memcpy note the +1 and calloc for terminating null character

27678411
serializable	deserialization
employee is serializable but person is not
what that means is that the fields inherited from person are not being serialized that is they are not being written to the objectoutputstream and will not be filled in during deserialization that is reading from an objectinputstream

serializable	deserialization
what that means is that the fields inherited from person are not being serializable that is they are not being written to the objectoutputstream and will not be filled in during deserialization that is reading from an objectinputstream
the easiest way to fix this is to make person implement serializable

swift	objective-c
you won t be able to pass c++ stl containers to swift easily
like it says in the using swift with cocoa and objective-c book you cannot import c++ code directly into swift

27678525
swift	objective-c
like it says in the using swift with cocoa and objective-c book you cannot import c++ code directly into swift
instead create an objective-c or c wrapper for c++ code

27679084
uiview	subviews
in xib set file owner to your custom class but do not set uiview class to avoid recurrency loading problems
just leave default uiview class and you will add this uiview as a subviews of your custom class view

move	drag
interact.js doesn t move elements for you
it only provides the drag data

27682230
implements	extends
basic abstract class first extends class usable for objects that implements comparable second extends class usable for objects that do not implements comparable
when using you have to implements a comparator extends comparatorsorthelper looks like this after using this sorting is easy hope it helps someone

27683612
.htaccess	httpd.conf
take a look at this link you are using suphp so you cannot use the following directives in .htaccess files php_flag php_admin_flag php_value php_admin_value
you also cannot use these directives in the httpd.conf file

27684116
ssl	https
however with the recent attacks in the picture that cannot be prevented by the ssl protocol such as poodle being just one for ssl and cbc ciphers ssl v3 which is the last ssl version in use is being unsupported as i write this or has already been - both by browsers and web servers
if you do not desire to use ssl and use tls exclusively which is the right thing to do in order to be as secure as one can be you would need to configure that in the web server assuming you are using https

27684116
ssl	https
if you do not desire to use ssl and use tls exclusively which is the right thing to do in order to be as secure as one can be you would need to configure that in the web server assuming you are using https
each web server has a way to specify the ssl tls versions to support you would simply disable ssl and enable tls versions exclusively secure cipher suites and so on

altera	xilinx
i m only familiar with altera from a few years ago
but altera doesn t give you an interface like xilinx s fpga editor so you re on your own determining the placement of your flops

27687003
altera	xilinx
but altera doesn t give you an interface like xilinx s fpga editor so you re on your own determining the placement of your flops
i saw a presentation once about a university work group doing tdcs with altera and ultimately it boiled down to measuring the resolution by using input stimuli to check whether the design was routed according to their wishes

27687083
swift	objective-c
last but not least i would recommend you to go ahead with swift
it is a great and powerful language fixing many of objective-c s weak points

27687139
trie	tree
on the other hand some collections as vector are implemented as tree in this case as a trie and insert or delete operations are implemented not by copying the entire tree but just the required branches
from martin ordesky s programming in scala updating an element in the middle of a vector can be done by copying the node that contains the element and every node that points to it starting from the root of the tree

27689239
google-chrome	firefox
i used a empty html5 with tags to test various stuff webm ogg mp4 work on google-chrome as it just does not care about mime types
runs on vlc 2.0.8 twoflower google-chrome version 37.0.2062.120 ubuntu 12.04 281580 64-bit firefox wants the mime type to be correct

27695354
haskell	agda	haskell	idris
here s the indexed state monad for example now i believe this approach is a fair bit more practical than indexing with monoids because haskell doesn t have kind classes or first-class type level functions that would make the monoid approach palatable
it would be nice to have a verifiedmonoid class like in idris or agda which includes correctness proofs besides the usual methods

27695932
required	placeholder
use a local attribute to temporarily store a value live on coliru this required a qi rule declaration to declare the
qi _a is the placeholder for that local attribute initialize the rule as an auto-rule docs with so that semantic actions do not overrule attribute propagation there s a wacky hybrid here where you don t actually use but just refer to an external variable

27698205
ssl	https
if you want to serve both simultaneously spring recommends you configure https ssl via the properties and configure http programmatically
as of spring boot 1.1.7 you can configure both jetty and tomcat to use ssl via three properties in your properties file as shown in the spring boot documentation configuring ssl via these properties will enable https and disable http because using only the properties files does not allow for both

27700196
sudo	passwd
here is a perl one-liner that shows that hobbs is correct that sudo is stripping the passwd
the first try is running with sudo and testy is not printed the second try runs without sudo and the environment variable comes through fine

27706262
sudo	passwd
sudo permissions are about the user group you are changing from not the user you are changing to
so are those permission lines are letting the testuser user and the testgroup group run any command as anyone without a passwd

27708725
consistency	acid
i have used an eventual consistency pattern to work out a ha-solution
the solution does not support acid but that is needed for my requirements

27709396
ubuntu	linux
also note that this fix doesn t attack the root of the problem which i think has something to do with ubuntu 14.10
i found a way to fix this in sublime text go to preferences key bindings - user add the code below to the file that opens default linux .sublime-keymap and save it

27709528
vmware	virtualbox
ex - note - in vmware the nat network allows inter vms communication as well internet connectivity
using nat in case of virtualbox does not allow inter vms communication it only allows internet connectivity. nat network works even in offline mode

27710081
google-chrome	safari
i use a manifest file for my web app which locks orientation for google-chrome on my android
for whatever reason safari gives their users the right to do this but not the designers of the web app.

27712920
inline	inlining
inline source maps should not be used in production
the rational for inlining the source maps with your minified files is that the browser is parsing the exact same javascript in development and production

27712991
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i had the same issue in google-chrome 39 but not in firefox or safari
the problem is that google-chrome 39 will jump to the element with the id of the hash when location.hash is updated

27713765
super	extends
i am not super sure about the issue you were having but editing the system file to fix it is not a great idea
you should never change anything in the system folder the proper way to make your change would be to extends the form helper by creating the file application helpers my_form_helper.php using your own prefix defined in application config config.php and inside the file override the function you want to change

27713918
ioexception	fileinputstream
for example the read method of the inputstream class is an abstract method public abstract int read throws ioexception now a derived class can provide an implementation in any way it sees fit but you are correct that low-level operations such as operations which require access to system calls ultimately need some bootstrapping code which cannot be implemented in pure java alone
for example if you have a look at the source code for fileinputstream you will see its read method is declared native since fileinputstream is a core java class the jvm may be taking some shortcuts but the typical way to implement native methods is through the java native interface jni

27713956
spaces	delimiter
the error is similar to the same problem occurs when you use a spaces in the value this problem is described in logger category cannot have spaces now one option is update to jboss 7.1.2 or higher or create a different nomenclature for the name of queues for example and address-setting the wilcard # only can be use at the end of the match
according understanding the hornetq wildcard syntax a hornetq wildcard expression contains words delimiter by the character . full stop

27716542
profiling	debugging
you re probably not going to have a better time with eclipse either and you ll be sacrificing a lot on the code completion profiling static analysis etc
the best recommendation is to make sure you re in debugging mode so things don t get optimized away

27719158
pdfbox	itext
you also claim that the values returned by itext do not match the values returned by pdfbox
note that the values returned by itext conform with the coordinate system as defined by the iso standard

27719748
implements	extends
if i understand your question correctly you have to do the following which says sessiontreemanager extends implements datamanager ideletable and ianotherinterface and the generic is constrained to dataitem
you can also set the extends to as mentioned in the other comment but then the parent methods will not be constrained to class t and will rather be constrained to its parent dataitem

27720600
daemons	systemd
daemons doesn t have ui so they can t display any alerts to request permission
to solve this systemd daemons use entitlements to access something without user permission like personal info

27720766
wildfly	jboss
the kitchensink sample can be deployed via mvn wildfly deploy not mvn jboss-as deploy
make sure you don t mix wildfly with jboss and don t start the sample twice from eclipse and from maven

27721763
spaces	delimiter
if spaces is a delimiter you can use the import statement
define temp-table tt-employee no-undo field firstname as character field lastname as character field age as integer field emptitle as character. input from c temp indata.dat. repeat create tt-employee. import delimiter tt-employee. end. input close. however if there isn t a delimiter but rather a fixed record with as you mention you can do something like this error checking and correct record lengths needs to be applied

27724580
prepare	execute
i would suggest just splitting up the queries into multiple prepare bind execute statements and it should work as expected
i am not completely sure how running multiple queries in a single query statement works if it works because i typically do transactions by running each query separately in a prepare execute statement

27724775
udp	tcp
udp on wikipedia
in tcp data is not required to be sent and received in the same structure as a block

27725211
spaces	delimiter
as for the heredoc there shouldn t be any spaces or anything at all including tabs or any hidden characters such as unicode etc
see footnotes surrounding the heredoc delimiter

27725432
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i tried a number of the examples above but i could not get them to work with google-chrome
this simple approach seems to work with google-chrome 39 firefox 34 safari 5.1.7 and ie 11

27726463
portrait	landscape
i was able to support portrait for that one view only while keeping my app opening in landscape mode by including the following code in appdelegate
i only want my app to open in landscape mode and not exhibit the problem you describe above on the iphone 6 plus so i set landscape left home button and landscape right home button as the only orientations allowed in my app s plist file

27728185
arc4random	srand
there is a problem with your program such that you are not making new calls to arc4random or the new values are not being used
srand time null is unrelated to arc4random

27728563
implements	extends
clojure s persistent collection interfaces are implements using java interfaces not clojure protocols
therefore it is not possible to extends them using extend-type

27729029
uiview	subviews
i think the trick for this is not to try to present a viewcontroller modally - i just overlaid the entire window with a uiview that intercepts all touches and blocks everything behind it
ordinarily i just program every subviews into a uiview manually

27732400
serializable	deserialization
if you serializable an instance of this object when you deserialize it on the other end the whole canonicalization part will be skipped which can cause subtle problems in application that are really hard to diagnose such as comparisons like resulting in friendly fire and possibly a worldwar iii
note that the problem here is broader than just a constructor not invoked by deserialization the canon.put call could very well be put into getcanonicalinstance instead of the constructor and that would present the problem even if the constructor was invoked

27732495
udp	tcp
the classic standpoint is to consider tcp as safe and udp as unreliable
but when tcp-ip protocols are used in safety critical applications tcp is not recommended because it can stop on error for multiple reasons. whereas udp lets the application software deal with errors retransmission timers etc

27732495
udp	tcp
but when tcp-ip protocols are used in safety critical applications tcp is not recommended because it can stop on error for multiple reasons. whereas udp lets the application software deal with errors retransmission timers etc
moreover tcp has more processing overhead than udp

27732994
tiff	bmp
if you set the renderer of the figure to anything else than painter opengl or zbuffer you will see the line which represent the border of your domain ineq3 which should be hidden under ineq1 when the figure is printed with the matlab engine for png jpg tiff etc ... i couldn t force the print command to use the painter renderer
if you use one of the format rendered with the gostscript engine pdf bmp pcx pcm ... then the proper output is produced

27736283
ssl	https
this is known as the secure referral problem and will likely never be solved because of the business model behind ssl certificates
you also shouldn t really trust cookies from the untrusted http domain in the trusted https domain unless you have a way to authenticate those cookies on the client

27737196
margin	text-align
update if you want to just center all of this in the middle of the page you can add text-align center to the body but i would suggest removing the first div and adding margin auto to the second one which has a defined width fiddle
img tags are inline by default so all you have to do is call text-align center on its parent a few other notes you can remove that s not supported in html5

27738529
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
at present my css for is this doesn t work for google-chrome 39 on mac
known not to work on opera. works for firefox ios safari

27741325
strtol	atoi
the strtol convert the initial portion of the string pointed to by nptr to long int representation
better to not use atoi

27741913
junit	mockito	junit	testng
to fix your issue you just need to add a dependency to junit 4.0 or greater the most recent version is currently 4.12 here are the details testng which is apparently your testing framework declares a dependency to the quite old junit version 3.8.1
mockito does not declare a dependency to junit at all but it uses some junit classes that were introduced in junit 4.0

27742602
client-side	server-side
relying on client-side cookies is not advisable for such scenarios
however if your use-case is just a one-off scenario like this one where you simply want to enhance user experience by providing an extra enhancement over and above the working feature-set without making changes to the server-side code then it makes perfect sense to implement such functionality client-side

27744648
google-chrome	firefox
after doing a little bit of research it doesn t look like this is currently possible using google-chrome devtools
here are some random tidbits of information i ve found as of march 2013 no such feature existed in firefox s devtools although mozilla developers have acknowledged having received requests for this

27745806
primes	modulus
in this code you are trying to determine if i is a primes or not by looking for factors of the number
if i is set to five then the while loop assigns these values to j 2 3 4 5 and we then perform the following modulus operations 5 2 5 3 5 4 and 5 5

27748383
ubuntu	debian
last time i did it like this on ubuntu though # download for other platforms # install packages to transform sudo apt-get install debhelper sqldeveloper-package sudo apt-get install tofrodos # create links sudo ln -s usr bin fromdos usr bin dos2unix sudo ln -s usr bin todos usr bin unix2dos # transform noarch package to deb package # -b workdir make-sqldeveloper-package -b tmp ora sqldeveloper-3.0.04.34-no-jre.zip # install deb package sudo dpkg -i sqldeveloper_3.0.04.34+0.2.3-1_all.deb # after installation maybe you ll have to set jdk path touch .sqldeveloper jdk # usr lib jvm java-6-openjdk found it here
on debian do as the message says not install the rpm

27748747
nsstring	nsobject
objective-c doesn t enforce types so n is actually an nsstring and not an nsnumber as you might suppose
this works because all objects that inherit from nsobject have a description method

27749183
ssl	https
solution alternatives instead you should be sending all traffic over an encrypted channel either https ssl or by using an ssh tunnel and send your browser traffic over that
hadoop at this time does not serve https to my knowledge so what you can do is create an ssh tunnel and browse via that secure tunnel

27750341
implements	extends
adding my two cents here - always whenever possible use implements runnable
below are two caveats on why you should not use extends thread s ideally you should never extends the thread class

27750957
sudo	passwd
you could use processbuilder to exec the sudo command as an external command
however passing a passwd to sudo via its command line is not possible

27750957
sudo	passwd
however passing a passwd to sudo via its command line is not possible
so you would need to either configure the sudoers file to allow the specific command to be executed without a passwd potentially dangerous or figure out a way to use the --askpass hook to request the user s passwd securely from java or use the --stdin option to read the user s passwd from standard input instead of the user s terminal

27751554
google-chrome	firefox
currently only google-chrome and other blink-based browsers support custom elements
firefox supports but not enabled by defualt

27752515
build.gradle	gradlew
check the build.gradle of your module and make sure that facebook sdk is in dependencies
if not add it and sync with gradlew and then try again

27754296
hex	binary
alternatively use blob literals and the hex function to treat blob values as hex strings at the interface between sql and javascript
websql does not support binary data directly

27754948
setinterval	settimeout
we are still using setinterval but even if it s delayed or accelerated for some reason the time displayed is still correct
first of all relying on settimeout setinterval accuracy for displaying time is not a good idea

27755915
equals	compareto
if compareto returns 0 for 2 objects that are not equals then all tree based collections are broken
for example imagine a class query implementing an sql query with 2 fields tablelist list of tables references list of programs using such a query let s say that 2 objects are equals if their tablelist is equals the tablelist is the natural key of this object

27755915
equals	compareto
however whenever is put in a treeset or a treemap it is catastrophic the implementation of these classes consider that if compareto returns 0 then the elements are equals
in this case it would mean that each object with identical number of references are indeed equals objects which is obviously not the case

27756599
ubuntu	linux
if you run nuitka hello.py on ubuntu and thus gcc elf you will create hello.exe but an linux-only elf executable if you run nuitka hello.py on windows and thus gcc pe you will create hello.exe but a windows-only pe executable which could be executed in linux via wine nuitka cython cx_freeze does not produce an os agnostic executable but provides means to build for a particular os you are trying todo one of two things 1 build in linux for windows
if this is the case you need to configure cross compiling or do the final build in wine ie install into wine python nuitika gcc... 2 you build in linux for linux

27756748
setcontentview	findviewbyid
this cannot be done until after your call to setcontentview
in particular you appear to be calling findviewbyid in the initializer of data member

27757818
mp4	h.264
you can use mkvtoolnix mkv l-smash mp4 or gpac mp4box mp4 to mux your stream
your video file is raw elementary h.264 stream annex b and not mp4 as your file name suggest

27757818
mp4	h.264
your video file is raw elementary h.264 stream annex b and not mp4 as your file name suggest
most players can t play raw h.264 streams without muxing to one of containers like mp4 mkv

27760445
swift	objective-c
so you can call the getter like this and you can set the property like this now that s all great but there s a shorter way to call the setter and getter namely dot syntax which looks like this and the getter object.someproperty getter now in swift this implicit generation of a setter in this setsomeproperty way doesn t exist anymore
it had always been a weird quirk of objective-c so swift introduces a unified way to set and get properties

27761396
move	drag
it might also be necessary to remember with a flag if your drag operation has already started so that you know that you have to move your shape while the mouse is moving
it might be necessary to handle the mouse events separately so instead of just checking if the left button is pressed you also have to handle the mouse down up events to ensure that your drag only starts when you pressed your mouse inside of your shape and not before

27762037
equals	compareto	comparator	comparable
the javadoc for java.util.treeset says note that the ordering maintained by a set whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if it is to correctly implement the set interface
see comparable or comparator for a precise definition of consistent with equals. this is so because the set interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a treeset instance performs all element comparisons using its compareto or compare method so two elements that are deemed equal by this method are from the standpoint of the set equal

27762165
equals	compareto
false so to to be consistent you could override the equals method though it is not necessary
the most important point to remember here is a treeset is a sortedset which performs element comparisons using compareto or compare method

27762165
equals	compareto
so if your compareto method returns 0 for two instances of the same class they are considered to be naturally equals by the treeset
the document also says it is strongly recommended though not required that natural orderings be consistent with equals

27762700
google-chrome	firefox
you will need an if-statement to differentiate with google-chrome which doesn t have event.buttons
actually you can check event.buttons on firefox which tells you if left button right button or none are pressed

27763869
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
unchecked-exception the classes that extend runtimeexception are known as unchecked-exception
unchecked-exception are not checked at compile-time but rather at runtime hence the name

27764094
centos	linux
you can define your own pre-processor variable and at compile-time assert or de-assert it according to the kernel version that you want to use standard 3.10 or centos 3.10 but then you have to manage two different binaries
the linux_version_code return the linux version 3.10 and not the centos linux version 3.10.0-123.13.2.el7

27764778
dictionary	map
and last but not least a tip determining the winner can be as easy as a dictionary lookup
map out in a dictionary what hand beats what

27766215
decimal	ieee
binary floating point numbers as defined by ieee cannot represent all decimal fractions exactly
for example the decimal fraction 0.2 in binary is 0.0011001100110011..

27769644
client-side	server-side
having services return data as json makes them more convenient for the client-side javascript to consume
stateless means that the server-side application isn t keeping information about individual clients across calls to it

27769854
inline	inlining
in the definition of c++ if a member function is declared inside the class it is understood by the compiler as being inline notice that inline including the implicit one for functions declared inside class is just a hint to the compiler which may or may not actually inline that function on some or all or none of its call sites
inlining is always an optimization which the compiler is free to implement or not and it often enables other optimizations too

27770904
backgrounding	multitasking
if you don t want to use uilocalnotification there is the option described here in brief if you opt- out of ios s multitasking and you lock your phone with the app running you can continue to run custom code if you do not want your app to run in the backgrounding at all you can explicitly opt out of backgrounding by adding the uiapplicationexitsonsuspend key with the value yes to your app s info.plist file
when an app opts out it cycles between the not-running inactive and active states and never enters the backgrounding or suspended states

27773760
namenode	hdfs
check if you have formatted hdfs before starting hdfs services if hdfs was not formatted format hdfs using the following command and stop and start hdfs service again using the commands stop-dfs.sh and start-dfs.sh hadoop namenode -format
looks like namenode is not running

27773760
namenode	hdfs
looks like namenode is not running
in hdfs namenode is the one which act as master daemon and take care of all requests from hdfs clients

27775346
mathml	mathjax
the reason why the html will render differently is because native mathml support in browser engines is limited to gecko firefox good and webkit safari ok
mathjax would allow you to use mathml across browsers but your sample html does not load mathjax anywhere

27775346
mathml	mathjax
mathjax would allow you to use mathml across browsers but your sample html does not load mathjax anywhere
as for single-file builds there is no official way but if you restrict functionality a little mathjax can be wrapped into a single javascript file

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
users really should not be on os x 10.6 either as its last security update was at the same time as safari 5 s in september 2013 but the good news for those who won t or can t update is that the latest versions of both google-chrome and firefox still support 10.6 and both of those are well supported by the js maps api
for me the changelog was a little confusing the current and previous version of safari mac os x this apparently does not cover discontinued versions of mac os x

sudo	passwd
sudo bin yes will give access denied
if you want to allow it without providing a passwd replace the line with please note that you cannot explicitly deny a parameter

27780933
decimal	ieee
computers use ieee binary floating point which does not really have a given number of decimal places
if you use code like this you will see a value like .099999998 that is because most decimal fractions don t have an exact equivalent in binary notation

27784975
profiling	debugging
i created a profiler.blade.php with the following then any time i want to profiling a function i m building rather than i run something like again not ideal since the thing calling your rest api won t know how to handle this output but it works pretty well if you re developing the api in a browser
so i was frustrated with the solution i described earlier and went ahead and created a fork of laravel-debugbar that did exactly what i was looking for basically i bolted on a debugbar route controller and view that opens a full-screen version of the debugbar making it easy to walk through the debugging files output by ajax queries

27785117
factors	matrix
in this case i would use a factors of 2 to scale up the size and then put 160 pixel black bars on the left and right sides that way i keep the same aspect ratio
afaik sfml doesn t actually have a global matrix you can apply transforms to - i could very well be wrong

27785830
ssl	https
from you should note that oauth2 works through ssl layer
if your server is not parametrized to allow https the fetch_token method will raise an oauthlib.oauth2.rfc6749.errors.insecuretransporterror

27786432
nunit	mstest
plus if you are using mstest rather than nunit then as others have suggested it is better to have a look at tfs
execute nunit with jenkins actually for reporting purposes logging to excel or something similar isn t a horrible idea particularly if your organization uses sharepoint

27786912
rational-numbers	floating-point
the rational type used by default is capable of representing any rational-numbers whose numerator and denominator fall in the range of 64-bit integers. you can use this rational type to carry out exact operations barring integer overflow on rational-numbers moreover if you want arbitrary-precision rational-numbers you can use the type see mr alpha s comment
binary ieee-754 floating-point numbers which julia uses cannot represent numbers such as 0.05 0.85 and 0.1 exactly

27787172
floating-point	fractions
for efficiency reasons floating-point numbers are represented as fractions with a power of two as the denominator
so 1 2 1 4 1 16 can be represented exactly as floating-point numbers but 1 5 cannot there is no power of two that can be used as the denominator to represent 1 5 exactly

27789924
lwjgl	jogl
display class from lwjgl is a static class and i m not sure if you can use it separately for different threads
try using jogl instead

27789993
spaces	delimiter
you can use the octothorpe character which suits the occasion or any other character that is not a for ease of use or this is suitable when the variable does not contain spaces or it is wiser to use the above since we are interested in substituting whatever is in that variable only as compared to double quoting the whole command which can cause your shell to interpet any character that might be considered a special shell character to the shell
using in sed as a delimiter will conflict with the slashes in the variable when substituted and as a result you will get an error

27790476
udp	tcp
dns does not run at tcp ip layer it runs one layer below using udp port 53
as a result dns is tied into the tcp ip stack whereby the stack first looks locally to a local host table and sees is the name is there if it cannot find it the stack will send out the dns request prior to the session start or syn packet flying

27791286
lxml	beautifulsoup
you would also have to remember that you need to have lxml installed
and if you would not have it installed you would not even notice it - beautifulsoup would just get the next available parser without throwing any errors

27798057
sctp	tcp
webrtc uses its own set of protocols based on rtp sctp and others so you cannot implement a traditional http server using webrtc
you can channel http over the webrtc data channel but that s obviously completely different than the traditional http over tcp which is the backbone of the internet

27800310
bufferedreader	bufferedwriter
since java 7 the best way to ensure an autocloseable resource such as a bufferedwriter is closed when it is not longer need is to use automatic resource management arm also known as try-with-resources you must also close your bufferedreader when it is no longer need so you should have nested try-with-resources blocks
you must close your bufferedwriter

27801652
spaces	delimiter
20 x ie spaces is just another character when it s not the delimiter
what ampersand will do is addressed in this article and more specifically if spaces is the delmiiter it allows you to require two consecutive delimiter to end a field

27801998
super	implements
however imagine we wanted to go the other way that is make the parameter type of the bookepipeline.execute a super type of stage such as object
so just to clarify we would have and where conc implements bookpipeline this would in theory be safe because liskov substitutability has not been violated - we could safely pass a stage into any implementation that took a stage parameter or greater

27802054
bash	subshell
since bash functions do not return values and the variables they used are from the global scope that is they can access the variables from outside its scope the usual way to handle the output of a function is to store the value in a variable and then call it
when you define a function with you are right it will create subshell

27807246
octal	decimal	octal	binary
00000011 is the octal value of 9 you can t use the binary representation directly
only decimal octal and hexadecimal representations can be specified for the decimal representation it s straight forward for the octal representation you prefix the value with a 0 so 09 would not be valid and for hex representation you prefix the value with 0x

27807417
swift	objective-c
for ios 8 7 these methods are not available to swift because objective-c varargs methods are not compatible with swift see
i wrote a non-variadic workaround which works in swift i repeated the same method for uibaritem which doesn t descend from uiview just be sure to #import uiappearance+swift.h in your bridging header

27808065
multiplying	division	multiplying	multiplication
refine this argument and show that if you do this thing appropriately you can divide two n -bit integers in time o m 2n assuming you can multiplying two k -bit integers in time m k and m x is an increasing convex function
first of all you can implement division in time o n 2 and with reasonable constant so it s not much slower than the naive multiplication

27808065
division	multiplication
first of all you can implement division in time o n 2 and with reasonable constant so it s not much slower than the naive multiplication
however if you use karatsuba -like algorithm or even fft -based multiplication algorithm then you indeed can speedup your division algorithm using newton-raphson

27809071
rvm	bundler
rvm all-gemsets do gem update bundler installed bundler 1.7.11 and fixed it for me
i had the same problem but i have bundler not rubygems-bundler and my gem doesn t recognise regenerate_binstubs

27809107
rvm	bundler
rvm all-gemsets do gem update bundler installed bundler 1.7.11 and fixed it for me
i had the same problem but i have bundler not rubygems-bundler and my gem doesn t recognise regenerate_binstubs

27814297
persistent	transient
transient keyword is used to denote that a field is not to be serialized and not persistent in database
by default all variable are mapped with database table column so if you want to exception for a column the use transient annotaion

27822911
union	distinct
and if major browsers should ever adopt xpath 2.0 this changes in xpath 2.0 which specifies that path expressions and union expressions return a sequence of distinct nodes in document order
in your case this simply means do not use the | or union operator if the order of the result set and duplicates matter to you

27825285
factors	mean
many factors go into whether to use a given framework or not such as available support documentation future development does it fit needs of project etc
express.js is the most popular node.js web application framework but that doesn t mean it should automatically be your choice

27827879
prepare	execute
the trick with prepare doesn t work since it does not take a text string a value like create function does but a valid statement code
to convert data into executable code you need to use dynamic sql execute in a plpgsql function or do statement

27830690
profiling	debugging
edit in case the link to my blog post breaks the following is a basic description of the steps i took to get asp.net 5.0 running on iis and then azure websites created an asp.net 5.0 site using the visual studio 2015 preview template running on windows 10 technical preview for the local iis i then ensured that iis had all the required features which you can obviously skip for azure i then changed the build settings of the project to enable produce outputs on build for both debugging and release configurations next i updated the project.json file to use the url i had configured in iis again this may not be necessary for azure i then created a publishing profiling to the local iis server which worked nicely
having seen this post i then attempted to deploy to azure by simply creating a new publishing profiling targeting azure websites i came across a similar error at this point as i was targeting the x64 kre and the default azure website had been created as a free site which does not support x64

27834493
octal	decimal
you use octal or hexadecimal because there isn t a way to specify decimal codes inside a character literal or string literal
octal was prevalent in pdp-11 code

27834947
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
this is because uinavigationcontroller uses a dynamic mechanism to manage its stack of view controllers that is not in the scope of storyboards edits
you will have to customize your uinavigationbar programmatically in storyboards this unfortunately not possible at least not if you re using uinavigationcontroller

27835223
swift	objective-c
not sure how active this topic is anymore but in case anyone finds this in the future i d like to announce here that i have started working on a framework for writing fastcgi applications in swift
of course you can use any objective-c web framework though there are rather few and you can certainly use swift as a scripting language to dump out html strings to be regurgitated by cgi

27839616
inline	inlining
if the underlying scheduler refuses to inline task will still be queued for execution and wait for it to complete
taskscheduler.tryexecutetaskinline decides whether the task is a candidate for inlining or not another one parameter deciding the task inlining is the amount of stack available

27843971
exponent	addition
these numbers are represented by a mantissa 0 m 1 and an exponent 0.123 10 3 and 0.456 10 1 which i ll write as .123e3 and .456e1
adding two such numbers isn t immediately possible unless the exponents are equal and that s why the addition proceeds according to you see that the necessary alignment of the decimal digits according to a common exponent produces a loss of precision

27846146
sudo	passwd
if it isn t uncomment it and restart your php process and maybe apache too edit after submitting an edit i noticed that you use sudo in your php exec statement
this doesn t work if your root user is protected by a passwd which it really should

27846210
daemons	systemd
if you don t need real time you can have an external daemons run a search query in netsuite every x minutes through a web service
the daemons retrieves the records that have not been sent yet and sends them to the external systemd

27846210
daemons	systemd
the daemons retrieves the records that have not been sent yet and sends them to the external systemd
i have used a java daemons with the spring intergration framework and it worked well

27848014
bower	npm
sudo npm install -g bower sudo bower cache clean --allow-root rm -rf bower_components sudo bower install --allow-root im still not really sure what went wrong but after those commands i was up and running
im not sure what happened with my project but in order to fix the issues with bower i had to run the following

27850243
setinterval	settimeout
does not return a promise there is no way to know when the function finished running unless it exposes a side effect in which case you can poll inside a setinterval and create a promise - that s very hacky though
also i am not sure what the main difference of the settimeout and the promise would be vs the first scenario

27850857
implements	extends
some of those may not be needed since implements all that for you
you might be interested in guidelines for collections -- for your parts collection class to be a collection rather then be a wrapper for an internal one imports system.componentmodel class parts inherits collection of part already implemeted for you are contains count add clear indexof insert equals item items remove removeat and removeitem as such all you need to do is override those methods which do something differently than you would like or to extends functionality such as a indexofpartname

27852136
setinterval	settimeout
also setinterval takes a function as the first parameter so don t include the at the end this is actually executing the function setinterval countdown 2000 i also wouldn t declare the function inside the onsubmit handler there is no need and you may get scoping issues
also the start of the countdown function always gets the value out if inputmin box so always resets itself to be honest you would be best to change it to a settimeout and call itself recursively

27852324
boost	allocator
this might enable more reduction of dynamic allocator but deviates a bit from the question boost variant update thanks to the comment by 5gon12eder i ve created this more elegant version based on boost variant note that boost variant does also not use dynamic memory allocator
live on coliru the limitations are as with boost optional see below

27852324
boost	allocator
note that boost optional does not use dynamic memory allocator
live on coliru admittedly this has limitations no proper deduction of brace-initialization lists constructor arguments are required to be copyable this restriction could probably be lifted without too much effort when using c++14 the type-erased might still incur a dynamic allocator

27853255
google-chrome	firefox
note that analysing remote streams should work for firefox and it is known to not to work in google-chrome see a possible workaround could be taking the remote audio level value by using webrtc statistics api
if you go to google-chrome webrtc-internals then select your page playing remote stream then one of the ssrc_xxxx_recv will contain dynamically changing audiooutputlevel value which you can use

27853970
bash	zsh
thanks to git-completion.bash script for the hint d read-on for more details on above 3 lines bash has awesome in built auto completion support but the bash autocomplete scripts don t work directly zsh as zsh environment doesn t have the essential bash autocomplete helper functions like compgen complete
it does so in an effort to keep zsh session fast

27853970
bash	zsh
these days zsh is shipped with appropriate completion scripts like compinit and bashcompinit which have the required functions to support bash autocomplete scripts
note that autoload is defined in zsh and not bash

27855559
vmware	virtualbox
or to satisfy the virtualbox zealots ditch vmware instead and run everything in virtualbox vms at the top level
i once ran i kid you not mvs within the hercules mainframe emulator running on linux within vmware on a windows box and it was also slow

27856157
ethernet	wireless
for ethernet adapters this returns ethernet
for a wireless adapter the documentation doesn t specify but it returned wireless80211 for me

27857974
udp	tftp
it has been implemented on top of the internet user datagram protocol udp or datagram so it may be used to move files between machines on different networks implementing udp
this should not exlude the possibility of implementing tftp on top of other datagram protocols. it is designed to be small and easy to implement

27858638
ionic	angular
meteoric is a port of ionic to remove the angular stuff and make some ui parts reactive
edit not being updated now that angular is an option to jam into meteor itself

27859117
hive	hdfs
hadoop fs -chmod -r 777 tmp hive
looks like the hdfs directory tmp hive is missing or doesn t have enough permission to write files inside

27860368
namenode	hdfs
seems like you are using the same user for starting all users so if namenode is coming in the jps output probably namenode daemons might be got killed to not started properly
you may use the following command for ensuring namenode process running or not ps aux | grep -i namenode if not running you may need to format your namenode before starting hdfs service stop all hdfs deamons using stop-dfs.sh script then format your namenode using the below command and start hdfs using the start-dfs.sh script

27860368
namenode	hdfs
you may use the following command for ensuring namenode process running or not ps aux | grep -i namenode if not running you may need to format your namenode before starting hdfs service stop all hdfs deamons using stop-dfs.sh script then format your namenode using the below command and start hdfs using the start-dfs.sh script
hadoop namenode -format go through the below so post if you are hitting the below situation

27860566
client-side	server-side
you cannot do this with javascript because it is run on the client-side and cannot access the files on the server
you need to have a server-side implementation you could do this by using php for example

27861978
ssl	https
forget about ssl v2 and ssl v3 it is not secure but most browsers support tls v1.2 tlsv1.1 and tls v1
you can use nginx as proxy and configure https on nginx

27862765
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome doesn t seem to be limited in such a way however
actually it seems that in your test at least for firefox the maximum height in css px is an issue

27863223
hex	binary
the cpu does not know what a hex or decimal number is
it can only work with binary code

27864822
cassini	iis
i also include the notes in web.config iis s left hand doesn t know what cassini s right hand is doing - and they both screwed it up
if you are running on iis 7 put the module in if you are running on cassini visual studio s integrated miniature web-server put the module in iis will crash if you give it the cassini location

27864983
robocopy	xcopy
if you want to combine it into the robocopy command do something like this and as magoo points out xcopy probably isn t going to go away any time soon
xcopy src dest returns an exit code of 0 on success non-zero on fail

27865038
bash	shellcheck
in the words of shellcheck your error is not a bash error but an xmlstarlet error saying that it doesn t recognize
this makes sense because is a bash expression and not an xmlstarlet expression

27867650
nfa	dfa
an ɛ-transition in a non-deterministic finite automaton or nfa for short is a transition that is not associated with the consumption of any symbol 0 or 1 in this case
once you understand that it s easy in this case to derive deterministic finite automata or dfa for short that are equivalent to your nfas and identify the languages that the latter describe

27867788
mockito	jmockit
differently from mockito s injectmocks jmockit s tested fields get created only after the execution of any before methods
this happens because of the support for mock parameters in test methods which doesn t exist in mockito

27867788
mockito	jmockit
this happens because of the support for mock parameters in test methods which doesn t exist in mockito
arguably tested fields should be set early together with mock fields so this may change in a future version of jmockit

27870184
subtraction	addition
since the subtraction symbol does not have a use with strings in js it assumes 37 as an int and does the subtraction which yields 37 - 7 30
when you look at these two cases the thing to remember is that addition has a different implication when you are working with strings

27871539
ubuntu	centos
the installation process requires nginx php-fpm mysql and apc which are all available on ubuntu as well as centos
i have not but if you need any information while trying to install it you could click on the support tab on the right side of the official website at no centos specific packages or code is actaully used by nginad as nginad is a 100 pure php application which runs on multiple php runtimes on multiple platforms

27872897
swift	objective-c
according to the documentation. core foundation objects returned from annotated apis are automatically memory managed in swift you do not need to invoke the cfretain cfrelease or cfautorelease functions yourself
if you return core foundation objects from your own c functions and objective-c methods annotate them with either cf_returns_retained or cf_returns_not_retained

27872951
subtraction	addition	division	addition	addition	multiplication
incidentally if you did want a boolean expression for ask is not addition subtraction multiplication division then you d want to use instead of || in an expression like because
ask.equals addition ||

27876473
union	distinct
in contrary to union all that can result in duplicate values since all row values are shown not only the distinct values just a little extra if you do want to know the origin of the email address you could do this select teacher origin id email from teachers union select student origin id email from students
use a union select email from teachers union select email from students it concatenates the two results and shows the overall distinct values

27877142
rdf	owl
the variables in swrl rules take on values that are owl individuals and rdf literals
a blank node cannot be an rdf literal although a blank node could be an unnamed owl individual

27883561
punctuation	words
rather it returns a copy of words modified by the .strip i operation -- which removes only from the ends of the string so that s not what you want either unless you know the punctuation occurs in the words in a peculiar order
this assumes it s ok to have all the punctuation one per item after the cleaned-up words independently of where within the words the punctuation appeared

27885148
octal	hex
in order to use string-escape with hexadecimal values we need to use x for the escape indicator rather than just which implies octal values iirc some of our characters are not printable
but the result is that all our characters are hex values characters

27886385
google-chrome	safari
this is what i came up with its pretty long and i wonder if it can be shortened explanation and remarks does not detect any of the mentioned here safari google-chrome different mobile
does detect 19 out of 20 mentioned here android native the one that is not getting detected does not comply with googles instructions google developer if you re attempting to differentiate between the webview and google-chrome for android you should look for the presence of the version x.x string in the webview user-agent string

27886887
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc
you should always check for the return value of malloc realloc calloc functions on failure they return null so to safely use realloc you should use a temporary variable to prevent loosing the original pointer since if you do this and realloc returns null then you lost the rerference to the original pointer so i would recommend so for example you can in handlemallocfailureerrorprobablyretryorexittheprogram
your realloc is not working because it s wrong instead of it should be and also you don t need to cast to

27887381
memcpy	memmove	memcpy	realloc
so the recommended method is so the title of your question contains the answer to it what you need is to move the data from offset bytes to the begining of the pointer for which memmove is the perfect tool notice that you could also think of using memcpy but memcpy cannot handle the case of overlapping data which is your case
you need memmove instead you don t need to realloc because you are not changing the size of the buffer just think about it

27887381
realloc	memmove
you need memmove instead you don t need to realloc because you are not changing the size of the buffer just think about it
if you do this now you lost the reference to the begining of field so you can t even call free on it nor realloc of course

27888416
prepare	execute
you are adding this and this isnt used for prepare statements
you also have to execute and run fetch the result with this it should be like this also prepare statements aren t any faster

27890105
jar	war
add these settings to the activemq_opts variable -dhawtio.realm activemq -dhawtio.role admins -dhawtio.roleprincipalclasses org.apache.activemq.jaas.groupprincipal we did not have to remove the slf4j jar it was not present
as stated in erik williams answer unzip the hawt-io war into the activemq webapps folder ex

27892978
atof	strtod
the reason for this is that the atof function didn t exist before and calls to it were redirected to strtod
if you build your library targeting android-21 it will actually do the calls to atof instead which doesn t exist in the older platform versions

27893588
multiplying	multiplication
asynchronous execution does not affect the program result but offers an opportunity for performance improvement by scheduling the multiplying so that other instructions can execute in parallel. programs that require overflow detection must check for it explicitly. where the size of the operands are known software should place the shorter operand in gpr rt
this may reduce the latency of the instruction on those processors which implement data-dependent instruction latencies. so yes multiplication by an arbitrary number is one of the very few things in mips that can take more cycles than other instructions

27899858
slug	permalinks
it is really troublesome to have the same slug for both custom post type and taxonomy
this does not work by default and completely throws everything off target in your archive-work.php replace your custom query with this code very important - ok now visit settings permalinks in the back end admin area and click save changes

27902337
serializable	deserialization
you have not provided any serializable information for the people -class only deserialization info
the following should work out for you there are multiple ways to provide the serializable info

27904581
inline	inlining
i see no a priori reason why inline code could not contain function calls
argument passing aside inlining inserts the lines of code as they stand reducing call overhead and allowing local ad-hoc optimizations

27905537
uiview	calayer
and because drawrect causes core animation to create useless backing bitmap which must be avoided do not use uiview and drawrect
either use calayer drawing technique or draw text into a bitmap context

27906527
bellman-ford	dijkstra
it does this by cleverly using the bellman-ford algorithm to transform the original graph which can have negative edges into a different but equivalent graph that does not have negative edges
this new graph is now safe to be used with dijkstra s algorithm

27907812
implements	extends
any constructor you create must be called by any class that implements this abstract class so there s not really a need to remind people to implements that constructor
there are a lot of reasons that people extends your classes might want to create their own constructors

27909815
elasticsearch	kibana
not sure if you re still looking for an answer but for future searchers what you can do is download elasticsearch - extract it and create a plugins subdirectory
then within the plugins directory create a kibana _site subdirectory

27911750
swift	objective-c
edit note that starting in swift 2.2 you won t be able to make this mistake
you ll use the new #selector syntax see and the compiler won t let you form a selector for a method that isn t exposed to objective-c

27911750
swift	objective-c
it s merely a question of exposing the swift function to objective-c so that it is visible to objective-c
you have four choices make timerclass descend from nsobject and delete the init implementation declare timerclass with objective-c not in swift 2.0

27911750
swift	objective-c
you have four choices make timerclass descend from nsobject and delete the init implementation declare timerclass with objective-c not in swift 2.0
use the previous choice instead declare the function with objective-c objective-c func timerend declare the function dynamic this is probably the worst choice as it is unnecessary - the function is not dynamic

27911849
lzo	snappy
at this stage map output the compression resultant has no benefit in being splittable so the gzip or snappy codec are worth trying here as well as lzo and bzip2
gzip typically has better compression ratios for most data but heavily consumes the cpu whilst snappy is faster with a lower compression ratio it either has less latency or doesn t consume the cpu as heavily as gzip i m not positive on the reason

27914904
textview	imageview
if you confirm it return a image simply use this method then you get all image in local so you can notify your adapter attached to listview. override your adapter public view getview int position view convertview viewgroup parent according to position update your custom listview item textview imageview also. there is a detail guide about how to create custom listview
android can not use url to set imageview

27915084
swift	objective-c
caveat please pardon any swift errors i make
i am still writing exclusively in objective-c and i ve tried my best to write good swift but i am not yet an expert in the syntax

27920221
fread	calloc
next as others commented increase the string space allocation in addition although you have used the safe string functions you did not check argc or the result of any of fopen_s fread malloc calloc realloc nor have you closed the file or released memory
there are two problems with this line fread buf buf_len 10 fp

27920841
udp	tcp
so you should ask yourself why you can t use udp and if no alternative protocol header is okay like gre or l2tp
first of all you do not want to make a vpn over tcp because you would end up with tcp-over-tcp eventually

27920841
udp	tcp
udp protocol doesn t support retransmission reordering just like ip
so if one udp packet is sent for every received virtual ip packet the kernel tcp ip protocol stack would still see virtual ip packet loss duplication reordering those are required for tcp ip to work well if those features are missing the tcp connection speed on the virtual network would suffer

27921061
swift	objective-c
instead you can forward declare a swift class to use it in an objective-c header
note that you cannot subclass a swift class in objective-c

27921435
fgets	strcpy
you have a lot of errors you allocate extra space for the input string copy you should not multiply by sizeof int because you need l chars s not l int s and that s partially true because you also need the 0 terminating chars so you need 1 + l chars s hence the first malloc line should read you check the success of malloc but still continue to dereference a potentially null pointer it doesn t matter what you do in case of malloc failure but you cannot derefrence a null pointer this should be something like you never copy the data read via fgets to the newly allocated buffer you should copy the bytes to the tab2
strcpy tab2 tab1

27921627
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc
as per the c99 chapter 7.20.3.4 paragraph 3 for emphasis mine if ptr is a null pointer the realloc function behaves like the malloc function for the specified size
otherwise if ptr does not match a pointer earlier returned by the calloc malloc or realloc function or if the space has been deallocated by a call to the free or realloc function the behavior is undefined

27926932
google-chrome	safari
firefox ie and safari arial in google-chrome fonts looks different in firefox and google-chrome sorry i know it doesn t directly answer your query but i just wanted to let you know that it s probably more of a browser issue than a css one
please don t quote me on this but i remember reading something about google-chrome rendering text a little differently to the conventional way other css engines do it

27930310
google-chrome	firefox
with the eventual very ugly solution of simply blacklisting very specific errors from dev tools altogether by the google-chrome team
important note this method will not work in firefox webextensions

27930673
nfa	dfa
edit in the discussion the idea came up that there can be several non-minimal dfas constructed from one nfa that would have different efficiencies in whatever measure chosen not in the implementation but in the structure of the dfa. this is not possible for there is only one optimal dfa
this is the outline of a proof for this assuming that our procedure for creating and minimizing a dfa is optimal

27930910
persistent	transient
that error message means that you have have a transient instances in your object graph that is not explicitly persistent
short recap of the statuses an object can have in jpa transient a new object that has not yet been stored in the database and is thus unknown to the entitymanager. does not have an id set

27933434
ienumerable	icollection	ilist	icollection
in practice that means accepting either ienumerable or ilist depending on whether or not you need to access it by index
avoid using icollection or icollection as a parameter just to access the count property

27935755
apache	nginx
from my understanding nginx needs to be compiled with your chosen modules they cannot be enabled disabled like apache
if the module you want is not installed in the nginx package installed via puphpet then that means it wasn t compiled in

27937786
vbo	vao
the vao is considered a container object for the vbo in this case
so as long as the vbo is referenced in a vao and the vao itself is not deleted the vbo stays alive

27937786
vbo	vao
however if the vao is currently bound and you delete the vbo it is automatically unbound from the vao
therefore it is not referenced by the vao anymore and deleted immediately

mp3	ogg
here is my code that works perfectly if you have all your files in mp3 just download audacity import you mp3s edit away the blank audio and export as ogg
you are doing it correct but mp3s are not good for looping use ogg instead

ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	icollection
no i don t think so for the following reasons inotifycollectionchanged conveys the meaning that classes implementing this interface need to notify their users if its underlying collection was changed whether that underlying collection is an ilist or icollection or even ienumerable we do not know
it s different concept of an ilist interface which is simply an icollection with an exposed indexer you mentioned notifypropertychangedeventargs which i believe you meant notifycollectionchangedeventargs instead exposes properties of the indices indicating at what position the collection is changed

27940055
ilist	icollection
it s different concept of an ilist interface which is simply an icollection with an exposed indexer you mentioned notifypropertychangedeventargs which i believe you meant notifycollectionchangedeventargs instead exposes properties of the indices indicating at what position the collection is changed
however this does not mean these properties necessarily expose the items through the indexers of ilist

swift	objective-c
step 1 openssl library download the library from copy build-libssl.sh to your project folder using terminal run the following step 2 adding openssl copy the include folder from openssl into your project-folder drag-copy the libcrypto .a and libss .a files into your xcode folder open the build settings of your target change library search paths to change user header search paths to include activate always search user paths step 3 signing if you want to use sha256 or any other sha you must change the following alternative step 3 signing swift since swift language isn t a superset of c++ it can t be combined with c++ directly therefore you need to create a objective-c wrapper of c++ code and then call it objective-c from your swift code
step 3.1 create an objective-c class for your c++ code

27945866
listview	gridview
in my app i m using asynctask to load images into gridview and it looks exactly the same way as you described i think this is a nature of a gridview listview to recycle images which are not visible on the screen
if a gridview listview didn t do that while scrolling both up and down the memory allocated to your application would run out very quickly leading to a crash

27948194
clang	llvm
if you want to see your header include paths for libstdc++ and libc++ do this and here s what i get on os x 10.8.5 libstdc++ gnu usr include c++ 4.2.1 usr include c++ 4.2.1 backward usr local include usr local bin .. lib clang 3.5.0 include usr include system library frameworks framework directory library frameworks framework directory libc++ llvm usr local include usr local bin .. lib clang 3.5.0 include usr include system library frameworks framework directory library frameworks framework directory so usr include c++ 4.2.1 is a built-in compiler path when using gnu s libstdc++ but not llvm s libc++
i ll go even further and tell you its hard coded in llvm clang sources i build llvm clang from source often you can add additional include paths when building llvm clang with --with-c-include-dirs

27949468
gulp-sass	gulp-ruby-sass
it seems the solution is to use gulp-sass for this instead of gulp-ruby-sass
i still do not know why gulp-ruby-sass doesn t support this since piping the results of gulp.src into and out of gulp-ruby-sass works like a champ but it doesn t

27949775
floating-point	fractions
the result of power -.2 9.7 would be at best an imaginary number and cannot be represented as a single floating-point number
you could convert the floating-point exponent to a fractions and rewrite it as power -.2 97 10 which is equivalent to power power -.2 97 1 10

27950485
persistent	transient
firstly you cannot use annotations if you want to persistent a field of a class whether embedded or otherwise differently in one place than another since an annotation is specified in one place only or at least i can t see how it would be possible
secondly with xml you could specify an embedded element and under that attributes and for each attribute you could put transient

27950870
client-side	server-side
however if you insist there are several approaches you can take validate client-side and save the errors into localstorage localstorage is kept client-side so only that client will ever see it
note that this doesn t absolve you from validating server-side too it s just that the server-side error handling doesn t need to be as nice use sessions that s what they re for mate

27951238
gradle	ivy
it s not a big deal gradle can handle it easly you just can t declare the repository as maven but as ivy instead
actually it will be easier to use the artifactory plugin for resolution it also supports both maven and ivy layouts

27952357
ssl	https
there is only one plugin i have found which does something similar to this however it doesn t do dynamic detection only gives admin editors a checkbox option to make a page ssl secured
the plugin is called wordpress https dynamic detection and redirection isn t something ssl was meant for anyways it s either on or off and most pages need it that way

27952357
ssl	https
the plugin is called wordpress https dynamic detection and redirection isn t something ssl was meant for anyways it s either on or off and most pages need it that way
i was originally trying to provide both so i could use a self-signed certificate without worrying that users would get the warning unsecured connection messages from their browsers by forcing them to use only ssl connections

27954653
serializable	deserialization
by using a proxy array you can guarantee that your collection is overwritten during deserialization now the collection comes back with only the previously serializable members with all 5 serializable
you are correct that many serializable though not all work this way

27955250
implements	extends
instead of using the annotation your processor can implements getsupportedannotationtypes to provide supported annotation type names at runtime in case you d like to keep using non-standard annotations for this you could create your own annotation that takes a compile time type as argument like k_g suggested
supportedannotationtypes isn t really anything special it is only used automatically when you are extends abstractprocessor anyway

27960917
mongodb	bson
it allows for mongodb to produe a syntax and object rich document beyond what json can
bson normally takes more space than json due to its object usage and what not as such there is no serious performance gain

27961120
portrait	landscape
after long r d and different-different approaches and spending 2-3 days.finally i got an answer with the help of my friend.if our view controller is in portrait mode than the following code is not able to push player view in landscape view
in my case problem is that my uiwebview container view controller very time comes in portrait mode.i do not know after push viewcontroller in the uinavigationcontroller following orientation methods not called for that viewcontroller

27965446
hex	binary
when you then use pack to decode the hex into the binary string you have yet another unnecessary operation
using hex output and decoding it back to binary does not improve your security

27965869
udp	tcp
thus it achieves less overhead by auto-tuning whereas with udp you need an explicit tuning to achieve the same performance
on packet loss tcp backs off with the sending speed so that it will not loose much more packets

27965869
udp	tcp
with udp you either have to be below the maximum connection of the line to be safe or you have to expect lots of packet loss
of course you could implement a similar method to tcp or you could implement an even better method which is not general purpose but fits better in your use case

27966896
ssl	https
1 add in the tarang ssl package meteor add tarang ssl 2 add your certificate and key to a directory in your app private e.g private key.pem and private cert.pem then in your server code then fire up your app and load up
be sure not to mix up your ports with https and http as they are served seperately

27967851
swift	objective-c
it seems like since this is a private helper it is somehow not exposed to swift
it is also not accessible from within objective-c results in a compile time error

27972290
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the feature was previously enabled in google-chrome but then subsequently removed in the interest of re-doing it more efficiently
this answer might not be 100 pragmatic due to current lack of support but soon you will be able to use the position sticky property of css currently supported in firefox and prefixed in safari ios caniuse

27972946
swift	objective-c
shouldn t be a problem because i was not yet calling objective-c from swift
but when i added a bridging header and referred to its path in the build settings swift compiler - code generation - objective-c bridging header it magically fixed the problem - my -swift.h file was suddenly full of swift_class goodness

27972946
swift	objective-c
but when i added a bridging header and referred to its path in the build settings swift compiler - code generation - objective-c bridging header it magically fixed the problem - my -swift.h file was suddenly full of swift_class goodness
so i m guessing the bridging header is fundamental to the process even if you re not using objective-c from swift

27973035
swift	objective-c
if xcode is actually generating your -swift.h header deep inside deriveddata but it doesn t refer to your swift classes make sure you also have a bridging header defined
the way i read the docs implied i only needed that for calling objective-c from swift but it seems to be necessary for calling swift from objective-c too

27973128
dns	spf
first remember that spf is a dns based policy and so evaluation of the policy depends on the dns of the receiving mail server
so because of dns caching policy changes may not take effect immediately or even be consistently for different servers handling inbound email for a single domain

27977097
ssl	https
to verify if nginx is terminating ssl connection well use curl where 8081 is another port set up for testing ssl cert
if you don t care if your docker client connects to the registry over http and not https add options --insecure-registry www.example.com 8080 in etc sysconfig docker or equivalent in other distros and restart docker service

27978757
des	rsa
if your key does not have a password mine did not create a des encrypted version using the same password you plan to use for your keystore.
openssl rsa -in -des -out keyout.pem 2

27979111
google-chrome	safari
known issues google-chrome does not support viewport units for border widths column gaps transform values box shadows or in calc until version 34
ios safari both 6 and 7 does not support viewport units for border widths column gaps transform values box shadows or in calc

27980318
decimal	ieee
dbl_dig decimal digits the exponent part that should not be greater that e+999 the terminating null so the size of buffer should be dbl_dig + 8
according to wikipedia page on ieee floating point the exponent part for a double is at most 2 1023 10 308

27980441
division	addition
except for some degenerate cases where the divisor is a power of the operating base - a power of 2 for most number formats this is just as expensive as int division
i don t have the time or expertise to analyze this mathematically so i m going to appeal to grade school maths consider the number of lines of working out in the notebook not including the inputs required for equality boolean operations essentially none - in computer big o terms this is known a o 1 addition two working left to right one line for the output and one line for the carry

27980441
addition	multiplication
i don t have the time or expertise to analyze this mathematically so i m going to appeal to grade school maths consider the number of lines of working out in the notebook not including the inputs required for equality boolean operations essentially none - in computer big o terms this is known a o 1 addition two working left to right one line for the output and one line for the carry
this is an o n operation long multiplication n n+1 + 2 two lines for each of the digit products one for total one for carry plus a final total and carry

27984038
fuzzy	stemming
the text search feature in mongodb as at 2.6 does not have any built-in features for fuzzy partial string matching
as you ve noted the use case currently focuses on language stemming support with basic boolean operators and word phrase matching

27986533
super	self
see e.g understanding python super with __init__ methods for more about super and the like
the unbound-method call parent.__init__ self ... does not work well in general with multiple inheritance -- just like simply inheriting __init__ if delegating to the parent is all you do in the method in your subclass don t -- just omit defining the method in the subclass so it inherits from the superclass

27987674
gruntjs	package.json
npm is for node.js extensions utilities like gruntjs karma devdependencies
gruntjs grunt-cli is command line task runner not frontend library so installing it via bower is strange but possible due to the fact that bower is using npm as base repository package.json store all tool dependencies in your project - like bower or gruntjs in frontend development bower should be handling css js libraries in your app like jquery angular.js bootstrap

27987872
swift	objective-c
example is describe in objective-c wrapper for cfunctionpointer to a swift closure
you cannot create c function like callbacks in swift as closures are not compatible with cfunctionpointer

27987872
swift	objective-c
you cannot create c function like callbacks in swift as closures are not compatible with cfunctionpointer
you can implement some workaround in objective-c or c

27988155
client-side	server-side
fluentvalidation doesn t do client-side validation for rules like must without implementing a custom client-side provider
generally speaking you should always have server-side validation with client-side being a welcome option because the user can always disable javascript

27990597
retrofit	okhttp
and it works with retrofit out-of-the-box
so if tor-like functions are not so important for you i recommend to utilize okhttp s awesomeness

27994396
prepare	execute
then some best-practice stuff it s minor but you re not using pdo s prepare statements at its best
you do in the loop instead prepare the statement outside the loop and execute it in the loop like this you don t need to prepare it every time again
