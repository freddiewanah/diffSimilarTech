ubuntu	linux
i named it prips after the ubuntu command of the same name
obviously if that command is available use that. note that i assume the redhat linux erik troan preston brown version of ipcalc not the krischan jodies version that is installed on some platforms mac os x

44002215
texreg	stargazer
this needs two steps extend texreg to handle summary.lm objects as of writing texreg cannot natively work with summary objects
instead it wants the lm object like stargazer - although almost all of the information is then taken from the summary object

44009351
kerberos	ntlm
briefly kerberos cannot be used with localhost or 127.0.0.1 or 1 for the remote host name
authentication fails back to ntlm and it has exploit related to loopback ip

44015348
factors	matrix
the nice thing about the tidy function is it ll take care of the pesky issue by not converting strings to factors and it will deal nicely with the sparsity of your dtm
as.matrix is trying to convert your dtm into a non-sparse matrix with an entry for every document and term even if the term occurs 0 times in that document which is causing your memory usage to ballon

44015397
gam	mgcv
mgcv gam is not doing estimation using backfitting but performs a joint estimation of smoothing parameters by gcv or reml
so unlike the legacy gam package where you can specify a df for each spline term you can t achieve this in mgcv

44015455
apache	nginx
unlike apache with .htaccess files nginx does not use any configuration files in wordpress folders
everything is centralized in etc nginx

44017087
ssl	https
so if your website is not having ssl certificate service worker will not work
this is because service worker works either on https or localhost

44021782
csv	tsv
yet another multi-functional csv and not only manipulation tool miller
from its own description it is like awk sed cut join and sort for name-indexed data such as csv tsv and tabular json

44027115
seaborn	matplotlib
i would not recommend to use seaborn here since that makes it more difficult to get the correct scaling for data with units as seaborn uses categorical values on the axes
instead one may use a matplotlib imshow plot

44029212
bower	jspm
in spite of the commonjs bent of the --moduleresolution node settings i still prefer and recommend even though i do not use commonjs webpack or bower in the browser when i can possibly avoid them
my loader of choice is systemjs and my package manager of choice is jspm but i still prefer to use the node resolution scheme because it makes importing dependencies easier thanks in part to jspm s auto configuring of the systemjs loader

44034830
uicontrol	uibutton
the guts of a uicontrol would not have rx in it
taking a queue from uibutton your control should not select itself although it can highlight and unhighlight itself when the user s finger is on it for example. once you have properly created your uicontrol code outside the control can use rx to observe it with no extra work on your part

44046893
symfony	silex
you can also use the csrf protection even without using the symfony form component. at this point you could either create your own twig-helpers and so on or just use and then pass variable to your twig-view and use it in the form like of cource checking if given submitted token is valid - your job each time you ve submited a form with csrf-token see usage part of csrf documentation for silex
i assume you don t use forms from symfony formserviceprovide ins silex world and do not have form twig-helpers like but try first anyway maybe my assumption isn t correct und it works already formserviceprovider try to install forms for silex then look at the usage documentaion-block of csrf for silex when the csrf service provider is registered all forms created via the form service provider are protected against csrf by default

44049204
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
i did not have imagemagick installed
brew list did not show imagemagick graphicsmagick was listed and probably why i thought i had installed imagemagick

git-svn	svn2git
the svn2git tool you use is based on git-svn
for a one-time migration git-svn is not the right tool for conversions of repositories or parts of repositories

44049788
git-svn	svn2git

git-svn	svn2git
it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case
there are plenty tools called svn2git the probably best one is the kde one from

44049788
git-svn	svn2git
even though git-svn or the svn2git you used is easier to start with here are some further reasons why using the kde svn2git instead of git-svn is superior besides its flexibility the history is rebuilt much better and cleaner by svn2git if the correct one is used this is especially the case for more complex histories with branches and merges and so on the tags are real tags and not branches in git with git-svn the tags contain an extra empty commit which also makes them not part of the branches so a normal fetch will not get them until you give --tags to the command as by default only tags pointing to fetched branches are fetched also
with the proper svn2git tags are where they belong if you changed layout in svn you can easily configure this with svn2git with git-svn you will loose history eventually with svn2git you can also split one svn repository into multiple git repositories easily or combine multiple svn repositories in the same svn root into one git repository easily the conversion is a gazillion times faster with the correct svn2git than with git-svn you see there are many reasons why git-svn is worse and the kde svn2git is superior

prepare	execute
in fact prepare statements are not that complex as everyone thinks
quite contrary a prepare statement based code is the most simple and tidy way to execute a query

janusgraph	titan
janusgraph has taken up where titan left off and is being updated and maintained actively
titan 1.0.0 is not compatible with cassandra 3.x titan is also no longer being maintained

44057019
rdf	owl
it is easy to answer the question in this case it cannot be expressed in any of rdf rdfs owl swrl rif sparql spin shacl
the reason is that it is never possible to constrain any class to contain rdf triples in any of these formalisms and languages

44058201
prepare	execute
at the same time it would be more effective to use prepare statements and i don t know why they wouldn t
while i don t know the doctrine library specifically i can speak to mysql logs and what s going on as far as the db is concerned the first example prepare execute uses prepare statements while the latter query does not

44058201
prepare	execute
while i don t know the doctrine library specifically i can speak to mysql logs and what s going on as far as the db is concerned the first example prepare execute uses prepare statements while the latter query does not
prepare statements have a number of advantages primarily performance- and security-related avoiding sql injection as you mentioned and i would personally avoid an orm that did not use prepare statements as they are generally considered a best practice for executing queries from within an application

44059218
decimal	ieee
so you re right to declare a high-precision decimal type for your table
but you have to trick mysql into handling your numbers as if they were strings and not take its favorite ieee 754 shortcut or hack we might say

44060726
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome does not allow you to export the certificate anymore
you need to either use another browser that supports this feature firefox or just simply copy the generated certificate to the shared directory from your homestead machine so then you can import and trust it in the keychain

44061918
google-chrome	firefox
i ve got something that works for firefox though and which will default to download.pdf in google-chrome for some odd reason.

swift	objective-c
a click + button to add sqlite framework then search for sqlite then you can see libsqlite3.0.tbd and libsqlite3.tbd b then select only libsqlite3.tbd don t add both because the compiler can not find sqlite3 stuct when you declare in viewcontroller then add bridging-header.h file because sqlite is not written in swift bridging name should be your projectname-bridging-header.h file just for naming convention not mandatory write in your bridging-header file go to build settings tab a under the build settings tab search for swift compiler - general option and set yes to install objective-c compatibility header b set your name and path for the header file in objective-c bridging header option or you can simply drag the bridging header file

ionic	angular
app module the service tes case the service on ionic page first page second page third page it create new instance if providers added on component make sure to remove the providers on component to make it singleton
im using ionic 3 with lazyload an angular 4 and not having the issues. to make it singleton make sure your app module provide the service

44068586
exponent	addition
whenever you add a very small to a very large number there is a rounding error because the small change cannot be accurately described by the floating point number with a large exponent
the rounding error per addition increases with increasing sum value

44082294
n-gram	words
for a n-gram you want something in between not too short 1-gram naive bayes and not too long 6-gram to avoid much overlaps between the seller and buyer sentences
for the 3rd and last step i cannot think of a straightforward way but i would remove the stop words frequent english words first

44085125
implements	extends
in my opinion using instanceof is a bad practice due to the fact that it makes the code pretty confusing in one hand dog has a fly implementation it indirectly implements the flyable interface via animal class and on the other hand you don t invoke it when you call fly on the interface instance
you have at least 2 ways to prevent dog from having a flying ability these are my two favorites you can create 2 classes flyinganimal and nonflyinganimal which both extends the animal class while the flyinganimal class implements the flyable interface and the nonflyinganimal doesn t. the bird will extends the flyinganimal class while the dog will extends the nonflyinganimal class. in this way you can create a flyinganimal list iterate it and invoke the fly method on each and every one of its flying members the dog isn t one of them

44086215
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
regarding the following statements made by jonathan leffler on the question that gets into a very delicate area of the interaction between delimited identifiers normally case-sensitive and collations this one is case-insensitive
no delimited identifiers are not normally case-sensitive

44086646
hex	binary
it is possible to create a certificate from hex bytes but that does not work with visual studio which relies on msbuild ssdt since using the certificate requires using signtool and msbuild uses sn
in order for this to be made workable such that the visual studio msbuild ssdt publishing process works which in turn would mean that anyone would be able to create a completely self-contained .sql script capable of creating the asymmetric key without relying on an external file the create asymmetric key command needs to be enhanced to allow for being created from a binary string

44087237
octal	decimal
when you reach 08 it is not a valid octal value
it is treated as the string 08 converted to decimal value 8 and decremented to 7

44090068
janusgraph	titan
github hosts janusgraph releases
titan is no longer maintained so it does not support newer versions of storage backends

44092960
bower	npm
bower keeps track of these packages in a manifest file bower.json
more here and the most recent package manager that shouldn t be missed it s young and fast in real work environment compare to npm which i was mostly using before for reinstalling modules it do double checks the node_modules folder to check the existence of the module also seems installing the modules takes less time yarn yarn is a package manager for your code

44110311
opera	google-chrome
ps opera doesn t display any notification when started without web-security
as you can t run --disable-web-security and a normal google-chrome in parallel it s probably a good solution to use opera for --disable-web-security here is how to create a launcher for opera on windows

44112579
serializable	deserialization
if a serializable class does not explicitly declare a serialversionuid then the serializable runtime will calculate a default serialversionuid value for that class based on various aspects of the class as described in the java tm object serializable specification
however it is strongly recommended that all serializable classes explicitly declare serialversionuid values since the default serialversionuid computation is highly sensitive to class details that may vary depending on compiler implementations and can thus result in unexpected invalidclassexceptions during deserialization

44112976
multiplying	addition
in the first example you do not multiplying numerically if you multiplying a string you repeat the string n times like so your first code fragment results in there is no support for addition between str ings and int s so that will error
probably because the only reasonable operation would be to add the number to the end of the string but that is again not numerical addition

44122825
serializable	deserialization
define a class to provide an authentication object like this the key part is here you are telling the serializable to serializable that property with that name which is invalid as a c# variable use newtonsoft json serializable to serializable the body request the body will be like of course you ll have to the same in deserialization phase when receiving the message
since restsharp uses as default json serializable simplejson that for what i know doesn t support attributes to change serializable behaviour i would install as nuget package newtonsoft json in order to use its jsonproperty attribute

44123427
google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome it moves the focus and the text caret appears
in safari on desktop and ios focus is moved to the input but the text caret does not appear

44124204
clang	llvm
if you try to build your code with clang libc++ adding the appropriate includes and using namespace std
you get sources llvm llvm projects libcxx include vector 474 5 error static_assert failed allocator value_type must be same type as value_type static_assert is_same value anyway the standard is really clear on this in c++11 14 1z - but not c++03 so if you try to instantiate you get undefined behavior - and seems to work fine is a particularly onerous version of undefined behavior

44124228
inline	constexpr
since this isn t an integral type you would either have to make the class constexpr and define static constants inline outside of the class or define them outside of the class in an implementation file
either way requires an implementation file the inline constexpr constants version is the one that will cause linker errors

44124603
google-chrome	firefox
there is no setting in safari to make it behave like others and i didn t found a way in google-chrome either
firefox has some flags about color management but i think it s only about images embedded icc profiles not the monitor s one

44124603
firefox	safari
firefox has some flags about color management but i think it s only about images embedded icc profiles not the monitor s one
edit actually ff s flags gfx.color_management.xxxx do also apply to the rendered colors and will provide the same behavior as safari

while not official as a profiling this approach is very popular

44134058
daemons	systemd
the daemons starts automatically if not started on every git push so if git pushes to your repository occur often enough and you don t care much about having new svn changes immediately you can just do nothing and with the first git push the daemons will start
but if it s important for you to have git repository up-to-date you need to run when the systemd starts

inline	inlining
using an inline table valued function will improve performance
if it s not inline it s rubbish. - rob farley inline scalar functions - itzik ben-gan scalar functions inlining and performance an entertaining title for a boring post - adam machanic tsql user-defined functions ten questions you were too shy to ask - robert sheldon here is an inline table valued function version of your scalar function that uses the stuff with select .

44144636
bash	tcsh
it strongly looks like tcsh syntax and not bash
if it is supposed to be bash the syntax is incorrect

44144636
bash	tcsh
if it is supposed to be bash the syntax is incorrect
on the other hand if it is tcsh the line is looping while the file defined by those two arguments and does not exist perhaps 1 defines a folder and 2 defines a file or something similar

44146402
lodash	underscore.js
it seems like you are using lodash and not underscore.js
from lodash documentation the iteratee is invoked with three arguments value index|key collection

44147506
tensorflow	cudnn
it seems that your tensorflow needs cudnn 5.x so install cudnn 5.x make sure you have already installed cuda 8.0 and exported the path and ld_library_path to install cudnn 5.x try the following commands extract tgz files check the files here you will see 2 symbolic link files and just copy libcudnn.so.5.1.10 and libcudnn_static.a to usr local cuda lib64 make symbolic link files copy cudnn.h in include directory to usr local cuda include hope it will help you
i came across the same issue i have installed cudnn 6.0 while it needs libcudnn.so.5 apparently it couldn t find libcudnn.so.5

44149639
ssl	https
you can use ssl labs to test your site s certificates and other tls settings
your node https config isn t sending intermediate certificates

44160063
spaces	delimiter
- match one or more characters that are alpha-numeric underscore or spaces - a positive lookahead doesn t capture what it matches
used to halt the match before final spaces that precedes delimiter dash hyphen whatever - end pattern method demo output cccc cccc if this was my project i would not be using regex i would be using strstr again just be sure you are using the appropriate hyphen character

44161008
azure	hdinsight
you can increase the quota by raising a support ticket from azure management portal
this is not a supported scenario in hdinsight

44165114
mongodb	bson
there is no need to pass through a json representation in order to save a document to mongodb
just do tableb.insert_one docfromtablea mongodb s native data format is not json it is bson a binary structure with many more types than json

44167346
hex	binary
there many benefits your intention is clear so code is less error prone you would not pass your binary buffer as a string to function that expects std string by mistake you can override for this type to print blob in proper format usually hex dump
very unlikely that you would want to print binary blob as a string

44168928
vbscript	vba	vbscript	vb6
not going to repeat what other answers already indicate but the following differences are missing from the other answers scopes vbscript code doesn t need procedure scopes it can be written as a drumroll script that just executes a bunch of procedural operations top-to-bottom
in vb6 vba executable statements can only exist inside procedure scopes

44168989
interpolation	splines
if 0 splines will interpolation through all data points
in my experience when you are using splines you are going for the looks and not trying to fit a function you actually want to use later so you ll probably have to check by hand if it actually does look good

44170526
ssl	https
if it doesn t which is likely if it doesn t have an ssl certificate then you cannot open an https connection to it have to use http and http is not secure
it doesn t matter whether the requester has any ssl certificates stored

44170526
ssl	https
i have a ton of ssl certificates on my machine that still doesn t make all of my http requests secure
the source computer could do a non-secure post to trigger the destination computer with the destination computer responding by doing an https get to the secure source computer s domain to retrieve the data securely that is a decent workaround and in fact preferable even if the target would have https

44174015
comparator	comparable
you need to use java generics to declare the type you want to compare - this says that you want types of node to be comparable and will allow you to do public int comparator node obj if you don t genericise it then you are effectively doing an override then changing the method signature which your compiler will flag as an error because you are doing an override on a method not in the interface
because the interface comparable you have overridden is not typed

44174154
comparator	comparable
in fact for the compiler is the same thing as so the compiler expects to find a public int comparator object obj method in your class
whereas the compilation error message node is not abstract and does not override abstract method comparator object in comparable. specify the class that you want to use in the comparable interface you are implementing here

44174527
rdf	owl
you can implement code with the owl api to do this check but it likely wouldn t benefit from the ability to reason and given that you re working at the rdf level i d think an api like jena might actually work better for you you won t need to worry if your input file is not owl compliant for example
generally speaking owl reasoning is not well suited to finding information that s missing in the input and flagging it up for example if you create a class that asserts that an instance of a has exactly one denote relation to an instance of b and have an instance of a that does not under open world assumption the reasoner will just assume that the missing statement is not available not that you re in violation

44175329
multiplying	multiplication
first of all the above way of multiplying element is not a good idea
because if the number is repeated you will apply the multiplication operation to the element which comes first

44176535
udp	tcp
so moral of the story you can not connect mongodb remote server over udp port through public ip or through the internet
finally i am able to connect to remote mongodb server the issue was with the port i was connecting i was connecting to a port which was open over udp but when i make that port changed over tcp i connect very easily means i talked to my networking team and asked them to make the port 27017 available over tcp

44178367
ssl	https
you would not want to pass credit card data or personal information without at the very least having and ssl certification
you ll sometimes see links leaving out the protocol on css of js libraries like this code.jquery.com jquery-3.2.1.min.js leaving out the protocol and loading in an asset like this just tells the browser to use whatever protocol it is currently using so that if you develop an site on http and then you go to https your https connection won t break from trying to load assets over http

44183058
system.data.oracleclient	odp.net
now regarding your error microsoft .net framework data provider for oracle system.data.oracleclient is deprecated for ages you should not use it in new projects
you should use the oracle provider oracle data provider for .net odp.net so by downloading odac from oracle you have been on the right path

44183058
system.data.oracleclient	odp.net
when you like to use odp.net you also have to install an oracle client otherwise it does not work this requirement is also valid for system.data.oracleclient that s the actual error you get
you can either install oracle instant client and odp.net or download full oracle client where you can make a custom installation

44190727
google-chrome	safari
i used the same approach as kiem nguyen above but google-chrome wouldn t work for me even after editing my .bash_profile as hanshenry90 suggested
to use safari to view the notebook open your terminal and enter jupyter notebook --generate-config cd .jupyter nano jupyter_notebook_config.py ctrl + w notebookapp.browser + enter to skip to that part of the file

theano	tensorflow
the flatten operator unrolls the values beginning at the last dimension at least for theano which is channels first not channels last like tf
i can t run tensorflow in my environment

44192737
swift	objective-c
see importing swift into objective-c at thus you can make swift classes public so they are usable in the objective-c part of your framework but keep methods and properties of those classes internal
since they are not available at compile time you can let the objective-c code know about them by using class extensions a.k.a anonymous categories

44195756
udp	tcp
instead - this technique allows to make several tcp connections to behave almost as if it is unreliable-but-non-blocking udp
short answer tcp is not optimized for latency at all

44201384
factors	matrix
note that the original short answer is hopeless here as f2 is provided as a character variable not a factors variable
now let s see an example with a matrix variable x

44201943
realloc	malloc
so to get memory for the first element the code should be and then when you reallocate the array it is similar with still only using byte size not pointer size and should be although it is better to assign to a temporary variable until you know the realloc was successfull
notice too i am not casting the return value from malloc or realloc

44203280
serializable	deserialization
but when the child is serializable and not the parent we must have a no-arg const in parent to set values as required while deserialization but otherwise we will have default values
we dont need a no-arg constructor while parent is serializable

44205191
super	self
super b self returns a proxy that basically says use an mro of so that when you write super b self .foo python skips right to b if a.foo doesn t exist
in the vast majority of cases super is used to just skip the instance s class itself trimming one class off the front of the mro

44205336
swift	objective-c
consider this objective-c enumeration then consider this swift 3 class the non-optional foo1 will be exposed to objective-c whereas the optional foo2 will not
numeric swift optionals cannot be represented in objective-c and thus will not be exposed to objective-c

44205336
swift	objective-c
numeric swift optionals cannot be represented in objective-c and thus will not be exposed to objective-c
declare abc to not be optional and it should be available from objective-c

move	drag
so make the widgets with the same size and position as you want your shapes to be and then just move the widgets themselves around
observe widget widget # create a specific widget for the ellipse id ellipse # give an id so we can refer to this widget size dp 48 dp 48 canvas color rgba 0 1 0 1 ellipse pos self.pos size self.size scatter size dp 48 dp 48 rotation 45 center_x ellipse.center_x # refer to the ellipse center_y ellipse.center_y image source plus.png if you really need your image rotated it s not the best idea to use a scatter you can drag the plus away from the ellipse for example

caffe	mxnet
so you can convert your tf model to caffe that would work
mxnet doesn t have tensorflow model converter yet

44209812
division	subtract
with division you must never divide unless you know the denominator is not 0
similarly with unsigned integral types you must never subtract unless you know the subtrahend is smaller than or equal to the original value

build.gradle	gradlew
so to apply your arguments add them to the run task via args to modify the arguments for each build without changing the build.gradle file simply use project properties and call
gradlew interprets each argument not starting with a hyphen - as task name to define which tasks will be executed during the build

44217620
coalesce	isnull
coalesce is a part of ansi standards and are available in almost all databases
when deciding between isnull v coalesce there parameters has to be taken care off coalesce determines the type of the output based on data type precedence where as with isnull the data type is not influenced by data type precedence

g++	gcc
i get the same error on my local g++ 5.4.0 installation
i looked at the g++ -e output and it seems the error traces to usr lib gcc x86_64-linux-gnu 5 include ia32intrin.h lines 252 and 254 this can be considered a bug in the compiler-bundled library since non-reserved #define s are not supposed to conflict with them

44218237
linefeed	delimiter
before answering i don t think that the column contains only linefeed because if the row delimiter is crlf it will not consider it as delimiter
so it is probably crlf but i will give a solution for the two cases crlf or linefeed solution you can fix this situation with the following steps first in the flat file connection manager add only one column of type dt_str and length 4000 so you will consider each row as one column

44218690
dictionary	map
an advantage of a dictionary is that you may map several keys to the same value for example if you wanted both 2 and 2 to map to a you could say further there are two reasonable ways of acquiring your value from a key such as 2 to a
the first is convenient because it throws a useful error and can be certain that the key is not in your dictionary while the second has many other conveniences such as being able to return itself if the key is missing

44219240
octal	binary
however it is not so leading zero makes it an octal constant
therefore its binary representation is 01111111 as you can see it masks off all bits except the lower 7

44223034
ssl	https
explanation in january 2017 with the release of chrome 56 a not secure message will be presented on pages with password and credit card form fields that are not protected with an ssl tls certificate
when a page is loaded in chrome 56 google will look for forms that collect passwords and credit card numbers plus check for valid ssl certificates that provide secure https connections

44223622
udp	tcp
i have not used connect under udp
i feel connect was designed for two totally different purposes under udp vs tcp

44224204
realloc	malloc
in this case it s easier to double the n before malloc so you don t have the use realloc because you know that you gonna double the arraysize
using realloc can slow the working of the program because if you make it longer and the adresses after the currently allocated memories aren t free then the whole array will be moved

44229971
pascal	delphi
in delphi and turbo pascal which preceded it run-time error 201 means range check error
i don not still have turbo pascal installed but your program compiles and runs as a console application correctly in delphi with only one minor change namely to insert a semi-colon

44231179
express	node.js
express doesn t have such listener but node.js raw api does have
there is a finish event in node.js http server instances which makes you able to do things after you sent your response to the client

44231748
dictionary	map
if you want to iterate over the dictionary don t bother calling i.keys just use i
that gives you list map int i but it reads more easily albeit slightly longer if you use a list comprehension also you can nest the for loop inside the list comprehension but shorter is not always better so i d advise against that

44232280
ssl	https
approach #2 you can add another nginx container to act as reverse proxy not sure if the application behind will break but it acts as http plainer docker-compose.yml # add this plain_nginx image nginx volumes - . plain_nginx.conf etc nginx conf.d default.conf ports - 8080 80 links - openseedbox plain_nginx.conf then do from . docker directory in that repo docker-compose up then you have acting as reverse proxy of the ssl stuff
you must edit nginx.conf in order to use plain http nginx will never speak http on a https port only for some errors change listen 443

44233188
super	self
the implementation of child then should be as simple as however unfortunately calling clone on super returns an instance that s statically typed as parent rather than self this has been filed as a bug
to workaround this you ll have to do some force casting hackery the nested forcecast _ function is here to workaround the fact that we currently cannot directly cast to self in a method compare return instancetype in swift

44234208
hex	binary
when you don t know how to generate the ascii control characters from the keyboard you could fall back on creating the message in a file using a hex editor not a text editor and then send the file
actually the binary file could be the most reliable method of hand-generation of binary messages

44235779
dictionary	map
ruby has proper dictionary hashmaps you want to use them here
nope this is not the right way and no you shouldn t be using map

44236484
bufferedreader	ioexception
scanner hides ioexception while bufferedreader throws it immediately
though both are meant for standard input but scanner is used for parsing tokens from the contents of the stream while bufferedreader just reads the stream and does not do any special parsing

44239005
textview	imageview
you are giving only third part of view to textview and one other two parts to imageview s parent layout which is not being used because imageview width is fixed
you should t be using weight at all as you are giving fixed width and height to imageview and wrap content for textview

44239255
rsa	aes
you cannot just use an rsa private key with any encryption scheme
for using rsa keys just search the net for example usually how encryption of longer content files is done please note there are multiple options or modes what i write here is a simple suggestion encryption generate a random aes key 128bit will do and nonce iv - for iv do not use the fixed vector as it is in your code use rsa to encrypt the generated key rsa ecb pkcs1padding compute digest hash of the content sha-256 to the output stream write the encrypted aes key iv digest and encrypted content aes cbc pkcs5padding

44239255
rsa	aes

decryption read the aes key nonce and digest from the stream decrypt the key with your rsa private key read the and decrypt the content compute digest of the decrypted content and compare it with the already read hash fail if they do not match it seems complicated but skipping any of these steps may and often will result in encryption being broken

44244727
spaces	delimiter
so the regex would be demo python demo if the spaces are optional the re.findall solution suggested by psidom is the best one i believe
if python supported split by zero-length matches you could achieve this by matching an empty string preceded by one of the delimiter demo unfortunately python does not support split by zero-length matches

44247165
elasticsearch	kibana
my 2 cents i just followed the install procedure on digital ocean apparently the package available in the repos is not up to date i deleted everything and followed the install procedure direct from elasticsearch and everything is working now basically the out of the box behaviour is on a localhost pointing to 9200
same thing issue found with kibana the solution for me was too to remove everything and just follow their procedure hope this saves someone two hours the time i spent figuring out how to setup elk

44247713
move	drag
so there are hidden controls where you have to move your mouse around until the cursor changes only then can you see the control
here you can see that the schema privileges section on the mac doesn t show at all until you drag it up

44252403
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
cannot go full hd youtube only supports high quality videos on certain versions of google-chrome ie safari firefox
below are some browser and operating system combinations that support youtube s high-quality video formats google google-chrome all operating systems internet explorer or edge on windows 8.1 or newer safari on mac os x 10.10 or newer firefox on windows 7 or newer and on mac os x 10.10 or newer cannot go fullscreen it seems fullscreen mode is not supported by javafx webview because of its own limitations

44252816
required	placeholder
i know this from inspecting references to placeholderreplacer but it also makes sense because java migrations may not contain sql and it would required some sort of compiler plugin to work
besides java migrations can do literally anything so if it wants to use the same placeholder as the sql scripts it can

44253306
bash	subshell
newer bash versions also allow the syntax it may be considered more readable and allows for easier nesting of expressions
you ve mistaken single quote character used for escaping strings no variable is expanded backslash doesn t escape character and delimiters are ignored for backtick character that executes the content in a subshell and returns stdout as a string

44253963
jar	war
then your zip file structure should be looking like this your_app.zip | |_.ebextensions | |_ nginx-timeout.config | |_ your_app.jar |_ procfile and your procfile should contain your jar file launching instructions
though since you are not using war packaging you can use procfile-based configuration and archive your jar and .ebextensions into additional zip layer

44255277
google-chrome	firefox
it is because of browser s behaviour in google-chrome when the button is clicked browser will automatically focus out from the button and focus on body
however firefox doesn t exhibit this behaviour it just does nothing when the button is disabled and focusing on same element button

44264100
stateless	stateful
stateless stateful
since it s a stateless component it doesn t have the component lifecycle. therefor you can t specify a constructor

44264100
stateless	stateful
since it s a stateless component it doesn t have the component lifecycle. therefor you can t specify a constructor
you have to extend react.component to create a stateful component which then will need a constructor and you ll be able to use the state

44266100
build.gradle	gradlew
build.gradle integration.gradle still need to figure out how to run them from inside the ide as it s currently not working but at least i can have ci again
after some tips on the gradlew forum i have it working

44268576
implements	extends
a template metafunction that obtains a type representing the class template of its argument type an alias template for ease of use then you can implements your match_class trait just like this demo
here is a general c++14 solution that does not rely on manually specialized type traits or extends foo and bar

44270270
union	distinct
if you don t want the duplicates just use union
union all doesn t take a performance hit that a union does in that the union must execute a distinct

44270270
union	distinct
union all doesn t take a performance hit that a union does in that the union must execute a distinct
union all doesn t execute a distinct thus you keep your duplicates

44271825
lxml	elementtree
the namespace map passed to element and subelement another lxml extension maps that uri to a prefix which is used for the output
python s standard elementtree library doesn t support cdata sections so you ll need to make sure you re using lxml

44272643
move	drag
you will have a more fluid drag as it will detect the drag all around the document and also will detect the mouseup when you move out of the drag area
right now you won t notice the out of the drag area problem because you have not boundaries set but you will notice if you add them

44272684
ssl	https
nginx will terminate ssl and proxy all secure connections to the 8443 port of tomcat via saiku-server-https upstream where https is the value of nginx request variable see location block
actually what i want really is not possible so it s required to have two separate connector tags and two upstreams in nginx like so tomcat s server.xml matching nginx configuration please note that tomcat receives plain http traffic on both 8080 and 8443 ports no ssl there it s terminated by nginx but for connections on 8443 port it will generate links must start with https instead of http via attributes and will insert in links ports specified in proxyport attribute

44274177
implements	extends
go to step #2 as no inner step of the loop takes more than o log n total complexity is java implementation i m too lazy to implements balanced bst myself so i used standard java treemap that implements red-black tree and has useful lowerentry and higherentry methods that correspond to step #4 of the algorithm you may look at the source code to ensure that both are actually o log n
as david eisenstat doesn t have time to extends his answer i ll try to put more details into a similar algorithm

44278421
pyenv	virtualenv
pyenv at the moment only supports posix compliant shells like bash or zsh as well as the fish shell
pyenv is not just a wrapper around python it integrates itself into the running shell session in order to transparently provide the desired virtualenv

44278421
pyenv	virtualenv
pyenv is not just a wrapper around python it integrates itself into the running shell session in order to transparently provide the desired virtualenv
takes the output of pyenv init - and runs evaluates it in the context of the running shell just as if the output was written there instead of the eval command

44282563
rdf	owl
there are few others owl xml functional syntax manchester syntax afaik one can not parse files in these formats using rdflib. you can use this online service to convert owl files between these formats and rdf formats
you are opening rdf files not ontologies

44282563
rdf	owl
you can use this online service to convert rdf files from one serialization format to another
rdf abstract syntax is not the only syntax for owl ontologies

44282652
bower	npm
though you said that having an extra build-modernizr step is not acceptable for you i provided answer for that case but still i want to add another answer for the case when using bower and modernizr with gulp
gulp-modernizr can crawl through specified files find modernizr usages and make custom modernizr build npm install --save-dev gulp-modernizr define gulp task in gulpfile.js this task generates build modernizr.js that contains only tests used in your source code

44284722
cpython	ironpython	cpython	pypy
i assume you re using cpython and not another python implementation
and i can reproduce the issue with cpython 3.6.1 i don t have pypy jython ironpython .

44286756
rdf	owl
you need other namespaces for querying your own ontology rdf rdfs and owl
as an example you can rarely write an arbitrary query without rdf type property which is included under the namespace not your ontology namespace

44290323
ssl	https
step 2 reading this trace.log file we found following endpoint now if you notice here that our soap has endpoint address javax.xml.ws.service.endpoint.address where protocol is still using http which causes to fail ssl handshake
step 3 solution for this is to override endpoint inside your soap stubs which can be implemented by adding following line conclusion so here is what i think even we pass https url while we are creating objects but still does not take this https url on runtime to me this looks like stubs creation issue with jax-ws

44291699
client-side	server-side
packages that can be used client-side typically say so in their documentation so if it isn t specifically mentioned there s a good chance that it s only server-side
i hadn t used browserify in a while so i had to check but it looks like it doesn t warn you if the code you pass it depends on server-side modules

44295908
mongodb	bson
mongodb also uses a binary format of json called bson and rebol has libraries already dealing with json which is not surprising given that rebol was one of the inspirations for json
from here the mongodb wire protocol is a simple socket-based request-response style protocol

44296533
tensorflow	cudnn
if you are running the gpu version of tensorflow it is possible that the cuda libraries or the cudnn libraries cannot be found
tensorflow on windows supports cuda 8.0 download from here and cudnn 5.1 download from here

44300704
required	placeholder
it is not required and you can use other ways to initialize your variables or in case of easy scripts sometimes you do not need to initialize them at all
everything except of variables do not require initialization constants and placeholder

44305283
listview	gridview
when the itemspanel of the listview gridview is neither itemsstackpanel nor itemswrapgrid the ui virtualization will not work and the expanded styles will be applied automatically
when the listview s itemspanel is not an itemsstackpanel the default or itemswrapgrid this template is used to show the data items

44305940
linefeed	delimiter
by default it s linefeed n and you read a file line by line
however you can set it to a reference to a numeric value - it has to be a reference so it doesn t treat the literal string 25 as the delimiter

44307540
swift	objective-c
in a swift language similar to blocks but not equal thing is a closure
would like to add that there is a block-based enumeration approach available in objective-c which is almost as fast as fast enumeration

44312683
ionic	angular
ionic pages will not notify inner components about loading become the active page etc
if you need your inner component to do something based on lifecycle events tie the parent lifecycle event with the inner component using angular s viewchild decorator

44314080
google-chrome	firefox
i tried the following characters in an html email in litmus i found that the html character did not render in gmail desktop for firefox gmail desktop for ie but rendered fine in google-chrome
aol for firefox and ie did not render either

44318527
punctuation	words
it s been clarified in coments that punctuation after the|they isn t allowed and that low case t is
then we need to constrain the match by space not words boundary and use as mentioned now the capturing parenthesis are needed since s does consume unlike b before

44324111
lwjgl	slick2d
slick2d is made to work with lwjgl 2 lwjgl 3 however is way newer than slick2d and therefore slick2d does not support using lwjgl 3
i d recommend you to use the newest 2.9.x version of lwjgl if you want to use slick2d

44324387
comparator	comparable
note that the ordering maintained by a set whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if it is to correctly implement the set interface
see comparable or comparator for a precise definition of consistent with equals. if you have different objects

44326999
ssl	https
my bad but i suppose that is not so uncommon when you work for quite a long time on development implementing several extension. in my particular case implementing google login required ssl to be turned on and a requirehttps attribute in homecontroller
this attribute was accountable for forcing iis to modify config files in order to serve the home page as https

44327492
rethinkdb	couchdb
a realtime hosted database such as rethinkdb or deepstream here it s important to note that deepstream is not a database it s a realtime server that offers pub sub remote procedure calls data-sync as well as providing authentication strategies etc
rethinkdb is more similar to pouchdb couchdb

44328197
implements	extends
in case you can not extends the abstractitem the fastadapter allows you to simply implements the iitem interface
you will have to implements the functions you already know + the ones which would normally be implemented by the abstractitem here is a sample item to simplify it i have removed comments and unnecessary setters

44336032
udp	tcp
siocgstamp only works for udp packets or raw sockets but does not work for tcp
gio mar 17 16 at 9 331 it doesn t make sense to ask for timestamps for tcp because there s no direct correlation between arriving packets and data becoming available

44339214
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome also throws the error when you try and still call preventdefault in a passive event
unable to preventdefault inside passive event listener invocation. firefox has a similar error for this however does not seem to throw a warning like google-chrome ignoring preventdefault call on event of type wheel from a listener registered as passive . warning showcase run the following snippet and view the google-chrome console in verbose mode

44339941
decimal	ieee
for a double we a precision in the neighborhood of twice that 15 decimal digits
-- the ieee floating point isn t unique to mysql

44340775
factors	mean
so then you can just write even if that s not the case you can work it out of course you d factors the instanceof checking into its own method to clean up that code
let me be clearer what i mean with my comment

44341769
factors	mean
upper bound means the algorithm takes no longer than that long as the input size tends to infinity with relevant constant factors considered
it does not mean it will ever actually take that long

44343306
odoo	qweb
it turns out that my qweb template file in static src xml had errors which caused some of the odoo app files to not be found
it might also be the reason why odoo didn t update web.assets_backend.js and the point_of_sale.assets js and css files

44352072
uicollectionview	uitableview
problem you are looking for automatic height and also want to have full in width it is not possible to get both in using uicollectionviewflowlayoutautomaticsize . why you don t take uitableview instead of uicollectionview in which you can just return in the heightforrow as uitableviewautomaticdimension it will be managed automatically
anyways you want to do using uicollectionview so below is the solution for you

44352103
google-chrome	firefox
i then tried google-chrome which doesn t come with a built in parser installed jsonview extension and everything there was fine
did the the same with firefox installed jsonview and

44353556
punctuation	words

so if you expect b to match a words boundary in 1

44354095
swift	objective-c
through much testing i found that for the modules that have been extended from objective-c to swift as soon as i change the class from the objective-c name to the swift name i also had this error unknown class xxx in interface builder file
i found through trial and error that the module has to be specified for the views tableviews with swift files or they will not be found

44354095
swift	objective-c
i found through trial and error that the module has to be specified for the views tableviews with swift files or they will not be found
the module needs to be blank for the views tableviews with objective-c files or they will not be found

44354228
knitr	latex
either way you ll need to tell knitr to use your custom template bookdown pdf_book template mytemplate.tex and you may have to adjust some other parameters since knitr doesn t behave exactly the same when used with custom templates for instance you will probably need to redefine the margin size yourself
one strategy is to edit the latex template so that you call your includepdf is evaluated before maketitle

44355766
addition	multiplication
means not what you want it to mean which is you probably already remember that multiplication is higher precedence than addition
you can remember that and is higher than or because and is the same as multiplication

44356167
comparator	comparable
define your comparator
it s because pair isn t implementing comparable

44357074
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
as for the programmer you need to take into account the extra uinavigationcontroller if you need to find the second viewcontroller programmatically
this situation is common for others who added the uinavigationbar manually not via embedding inside uinavigationcontroller

44357074
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
this situation is common for others who added the uinavigationbar manually not via embedding inside uinavigationcontroller
generic uinavigationbar would have height of 44 points the issue is the 20 points gap above the manually added uinavigationbar

44357461
knitr	latex
to convert an rmd file to md just run knitr knit on it
the only output formats for vignettes are html and pdf and latex but it is converted to pdf not displayed

44359403
swift	objective-c
weakreturn can t be replicated in swift because the objective-c macro is used to insert a conditional return in a function
there are no macros in swift and the swift weakreturn function that you defined does absolutely nothing--it returns whether the object is nil or not

44361851
build.gradle	gradlew
for setup step 1 open the build.gradle file in your base feature module and follow the steps on the public docs site to configure crashlytics as normal
step 2 at the top level of your base feature module build.gradle file add the following crashlytics flag step 3 optional but recommended add the instant app library dependency in your base library project build.gradle if not already there as per the docs compile com.google.android.instantapps instantapps 1.1.0 note to use this dependency you will need to add the newer maven.google.com repository to your gradlew files if you haven t already see here for details

44364910
build.gradle	gradlew
after this steps your project could not compile yet and you need to follow all the instructions here on how to convert your app build.gradle to the new plugin
the main things you need to do are change your project level build.gradle file to change the distributionurl of your gradle-wrapper.properties to the currently latest available release of gradlew

44367161
consistency	acid
some elasticsearch advantages max size of each document it allows is 2g - 2g at lucene level you can have partitions called shards to distribute your documents based on _id field by default supports strong consistency - configurable supports atomic writes with versioning on each document
supports only document level atomicity you can aggregate documents based on criterias - json based queries elasticsearch disadvantages has no atomicity a in acid between multiple documents you might want to check security options last time i used it maybe version 3 did not have good option dynamodb on the other hand is a datastore technically called document-store amazon s version of mongodb

44368093
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome seems to apply it but it s not on the standard specification
so in this case firefox and ie are working as expected

44368147
spaces	linefeed
the following formula will replace the lfcr with a spaces you can then copy paste as values to remove the formula
it seems one can find replace a linefeed but not the combo lfcr

44368797
ionic	angular
update 2 you can no longer create ionic 2 project in ionic 3 cli
as ionic 2 was not updated is rewritten using ionic 3 which uses angular 4

44368797
ionic	angular
as ionic 2 was not updated is rewritten using ionic 3 which uses angular 4
so if you create new ionic project it will use ionic 3 by default

44373760
selenium	appium
the appium .net driver uses the official selenium c# client so its likely not going to change until the selenium .net core pr is accepted
.net core is not supported by selenium at this time but a pull request exists to remedy that

44377893
swift	objective-c
the trouble you are facing is because you are using a recent addition to objective-c designed to improve inter-working with swift and swift does not allow you to mix in nulls in this way into your strongly typed collection
the swift model is generally to replace the reference or null model you are used to with the non-null reference and optional model

44380035
ubuntu	linux
but i ve noticed large quantities of warnings and errors when installing third party packages in l ubuntu
i wouldn t recommend drifting too far away from l ubuntu or other stock distributions with linux as you can loose so much overall compatibility it renders the process almost pointless i think unity is due to be cancelled in ubuntu as of 2017

44380035
ubuntu	linux
i wouldn t recommend drifting too far away from l ubuntu or other stock distributions with linux as you can loose so much overall compatibility it renders the process almost pointless i think unity is due to be cancelled in ubuntu as of 2017
i realise this won t go down well with some linux users but some of the custom distributions are borderline pointless beyond novelty i ve spent years using linux alone

44380407
hive	hdfs
prepared primary keys out of each records and then searched those pk on the hive tables and did head to head match of both result-sets
as i know hive is not a database then why moving data to hive when you move data to hdfs you store the entire dataset into fs that is file system

44380407
hive	hdfs
as i know hive is not a database then why moving data to hive when you move data to hdfs you store the entire dataset into fs that is file system
hive is nothing but a sql wrapper which use the same files and give you an sql interface to read write the same data

44383345
onchange	onblur
if you are using value property then you need to use onchange method to update the state value otherwise it will become read-only you are controlling the value of textarea by state so if state will not update whatever you type in textarea will get reset by state value
if you don t want the onchange method then remove the value property of textarea it will allow you to type then inside onblur get the value by event.target.value

44401539
email	dkim
so the return-path header on isn t the best option for verifying email authenticity
if you re looking for methods of verifying authenticity detecting tampering look into spf dkim dmarc

44401915
inline	constexpr
the definition would look like not in a header file in c++17 there is a new feature inline variables which allows variables to be defined in header files with similar semantics to inline functions you re allowed to have multiple matching definitions across translation units and the compiler linker will select one as needed
constexpr variables will be implicitly inline so your original code will be correct in c++17

44418731
gtk	cairo
instead gtk sets the clip region of the cairo context to the part that needs to be redrawn so everything else you do doesn t have any effect
the cairo function cairo_clip_extents will tell you what that region is

44422478
implements	extends
you ether implements your own logger by extends sl4j api or wrap log calls and do the transformations there
the first way will require some efforts because you ll need to implements batch of classes and make sure that the other parts of log system are not broken

44428832
inline	inlining
without inline this would then lead to multiple-definition errors if the header file was included in more than one translation unit
note that compilation is not the only stage when inlining is possible

44428832
inline	inlining
at this point the inline keyword is totally irrelevant since linking has access to all the function definitions the binary wouldn t link successfully otherwise
this is therefore the way to get the most benefit from inlining without having to think about it at all when writing code

44429633
inline	inlining
it is quite possible that some call occurrence like foo x at line 123 is inline but another call occurrence to the same function foo like foo y at some other place like line 456 is not inline
when debugging you may want to disable inlining because that makes the debugging more convenient

44429633
inline	inlining
if you are curious about what calls are inline and sometimes some won t be look into the generated assembler use g++ -o2 -s -fverbose-asm and look in the .s assembler file or use some internal dump options
the observable behavior of your code except performance should not depend upon inlining decisions made by your compiler

44431051
pandas	dask
you re going to have trouble with a 4gb dataframe using pandas
i recommend you have a look at dask instead which replicates parts of the pandas api but does out of core computation does not load everything into memory at once

44442352
debian	linux
the one in the debian repositories is still being maintained
the fantom sdk doesn t support linux

but if you don t have sudo and you are not root then you can t install it
in this case i recommend switching to the root user with su if you do not have the root passwd and you own the machine you can reset the root passwd with a tutorial such as after you manage to login as root install sudo with apt-get update

sudo	passwd
in this case i recommend switching to the root user with su if you do not have the root passwd and you own the machine you can reset the root passwd with a tutorial such as after you manage to login as root install sudo with apt-get update
apt-get install sudo since you are using ubuntu

client-side	server-side
it s an odd task but it works like this meteor maintains a client-side mini mongo that houses the data published from the server allows mongo-like queries on that data allows crud operations that sync with mongo behind the scenes let s say you define a collection messages in a file that is served to both the client and the server meteor will if not already created create a mongo collection called messages in the database create a minimongo collection called messages on the client define a symbol messages on both the client and the server that has the typical mongo functions find findone insert etc by default any operations you make client-side will be reflected server-side behind the scenes
thus your user can add a message without an explicit server-side call its implicit

44448438
comparator	comparable
2 a priorityqueue can sort its elements either by a comparable s object comparator method or using a comparator for objects that are not necessarily comparable
the siftdowncomparable method is only invoked if a comparator was not provided when the priorityqueue was created

44454452
fseek	fread
to summarize this examples uses rewind to set the file pointer to the beginning you might have to use fseek instead a word of caution to be portable you should not write a struct directly to disk but actually serialize it manually write out every field to the file maybe prefixed with a small header since compiler-specific padding might or will cause problems
you need to open the file for reading too fopen ... w+ and you should open it in binary mode so fwrite fread doesn t do any funky character conversions platform specific line-endings for windows fopen ... w+b if you want to fread directly after a fwrite you have to reset the file pointer position so that fread starts reading from where you have written your data

44456441
namenode	hdfs
the main difference between hdfs high availability and hdfs federation would be that the namenode in federation aren t related to each other
in hdfs federation all the namenode share a pool of metadata in which each namenode has it s own pool hence providing fault-tolerance i.e if one namenode in a federation fails it doesn t affect the data of other namenode

44456441
namenode	hdfs
in hdfs federation all the namenode share a pool of metadata in which each namenode has it s own pool hence providing fault-tolerance i.e if one namenode in a federation fails it doesn t affect the data of other namenode
so federation multiple namenode and no correlation

git-svn	svn2git
for a one-time migration git-svn is not the right tool for conversions of repositories or parts of repositories
it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case

44457344
git-svn	svn2git
it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case
there are plenty tools called svn2git the probably best one is the kde one from

44457344
git-svn	svn2git
even though git-svn or the svn2git you used is easier to start with here are some further reasons why using the kde svn2git instead of git-svn is superior besides its flexibility the history is rebuilt much better and cleaner by svn2git if the correct one is used this is especially the case for more complex histories with branches and merges and so on the tags are real tags and not branches in git with git-svn the tags contain an extra empty commit which also makes them not part of the branches so a normal fetch will not get them until you give --tags to the command as by default only tags pointing to fetched branches are fetched also
with the proper svn2git tags are where they belong if you changed layout in svn you can easily configure this with svn2git with git-svn you will loose history eventually with svn2git you can also split one svn repository into multiple git repositories easily or combine multiple svn repositories in the same svn root into one git repository easily the conversion is a gazillion times faster with the correct svn2git than with git-svn you see there are many reasons why git-svn is worse and the kde svn2git is superior

44459197
set	bag
well you can use a set instead of a list and get the desired result sorted set map lambda x .join x list permutations aabb 4 but be warned that this may not work very well for very large number of elements in the bag
it doesn t scale gives slightly more perfomant perhaps sorted map lambda x .join x set permutations aabb 4 the permutations equivalent python code is listed here the original code is implemented in c so it would run faster

44459745
tabcontrol	tabitem
the engine tries to create views using datatemplate s for the items and suddenly encounters an already specified view a tabitem that is exactly of type of the item container because for the tabcontrol a view for each viewmodel will be inserted in a tabitem container
so wpf simply inserts the tabitem into the tabcontrol and notifies that it has not used any itemtemplate or itemtemplateselector for creating it

44463235
client-side	server-side
you don t need the timezoneoffset cookie at all. the time zone name returned by jstz.determine on the client-side is going to be an iana tzdb identifier such as america los_angeles
these aren t going to work on the server-side with timezoneinfo.findsystemtimezonebyid unless you are running .net core on linux or mac

applied by ionic for .item

44468724
required	placeholder
as a command terminator for passing as many filenames as will fit on a single command line a built-in xargs in a manner of speaking this is not an option here because use of + required that placeholder come last on the command line immediately before +
however since you re on macos you can use bsd xarg s nonstandard -j option for placing the placeholder anywhere on the command line while still passing as many arguments as possible at once using bsd find s nonstandard -print0 option in combination with xargs s nonstandard -0 option ensures that all filenames are passed as-is even if they have embedded spaces for instance now you will at most be prompted a few times one prompt for every batch of arguments as required to accommodate all arguments while observing the max

44469477
consistency	acid
as a non-relational database cassandra does not support joins or foreign keys and consequently does not offer consistency in the acid sense read more
cassandra only support atomicity and isolation at the partition level cassandra does not use rdbms acid transactions with rollback or locking mechanisms but instead offers atomic isolated and durable transactions with eventual tunable consistency that lets the user decide how strong or eventual they want each transaction s consistency to be

44469600
vbscript	vba
if you are using vbscript then vbscript does not know the values of your word enumerated constants
so either assign values to these constants or just use the numbers constants directly as shown below click here -- word enumerated constants also if you are using word vba and not vbscript then you should mention the correct enumerated constant

44478678
interpolation	splines
for example the splines interpolation looks not too bad here s the code
if you want just 1d interpolation interp1 is usually the way to go

44481145
snappy	lz4
as it happens one of the ones you mentioned snappy is not streamable in the sense you ask since the format starts with an uncompressed size
zlib bzip2 lz4 zstd brotli lzma2 and many others all support streaming through the use of an end-of-data marker in the compressed data

44481726
swift	objective-c
the problem is that a swift closure is a different kind of object than an objective-c block so trying to run it as a block crashes
normally if the swift compiler sees that you are passing a closure to an objective-c method with a block type parameter it will convert the swift closure to an objective-c block but in this case it just sees you are putting it in an array and not about what the method will do to it inside the array so it doesn t do any conversion

google-chrome	firefox
the flex 1 shorthand rule breaks down as follows flex-grow 1 flex-shrink 1 flex-basis 0 google-chrome sees this but overrides flex-basis with height 300px
firefox sees this but does not override flex-basis with height 300px

44486562
jruby	mri
what ruby actually does this test code prints true if ruby s sort is stable or false if it is not here are the results for all of the rubies i have installed on my linux box we can see that jruby is unstable and mri before 2.2 on linux is unstable
mri 2.2.0 is stable again on linux

44487738
realloc	malloc
but the string optimizations do not overallocate making cases where realloc needs to copy far more frequent
in the end the platform c allocators like malloc are the ultimate source of memory

44488305
bellman-ford	floyd-warshall
bellman-ford algorithm the slightly modified version that does not use found paths from current iteration on every iteration i can find all shortest paths that use at most i edges
floyd-warshall algorithm is not an appropriate method of solving these type of problems

44489486
stateless	stateful
urlconnection is for http which is a stateless protocol
not for your own stateful messaging protocol

44489744
union	distinct
why the union doesn t contain all items the 1 and true are equivalent and considered to be duplicates
likewise the 0 and false are equivalent as well which equivalent value is used when multiple equivalent values are encountered sets keep the first one seen ways to make the values be distinct to get them to be treated as distinct just store them in a value type pair another way to make the values distinct is to store them as strings hope this clears up the mystery and shows the way forward - rescued from the comments this is the standard technique for breaking cross-type equivalence and

44490707
memcpy	memmove
this is not ok memcpy requires that the source and destination regions not overlap
c specifically provides the function memmove for cases where the regions do overlap

44491199
operands	scalar
the value computations of the operands of an operator are sequenced before the value computation of the result of the operator
if a side effect on a scalar object is unsequenced relative to either another side effect on the same scalar object or a value computation using the value of the same scalar object and they are not potentially concurrent 1.10 the behavior is undefined

44494739
persistent	transient
for example the persistent identifiers are kind of like johnforair jonhforcar johnforhotel they all just for one specified service since it need to link to its local identity in the service
transient identifiers- transient identifiers are what idp tell the sp that the users in the session have been granted to access the resource on sp but the identities of users do not offer to sp actually

44496415
comparator	comparable
you have violated the requirement documented in the comparator method the implementor must also ensure that the relation is transitive x.compareto y 0 y.compareto z 0 implies x.compareto z 0
bottom line comparable is not meant to work with open inheritance

44499695
inline	inlining
thus adding an inline annotation to your method will force inlining
this is a hotspot specific feature because java doesn t allow inlining via the language

44499743
implements	extends
the reason behind the same is that all the browsers have not agreed to implements this that s why polymer has not implements it yet
polymer does not currently support extends built-in elements

44505008
ssl	https
also it s important to know that using ssl means you as the client can be sure you re talking to aws your communication with aws is encrypted so others can t intercept it you have verification that the message received is the same as the message sent in essence you definitely want to use ssl irrespective of whether you want to use client-side encryption or not
quoting from the security section of the s3 faqs you can securely upload download your data to amazon s3 via ssl endpoints using the https protocol

44505008
client-side	server-side
if anyone was to break open your cloud provider s data center somehow and steal the disks that had your data you re making it difficult for them to get hold of your data in plaintext by encrypting it either client-side server-side
doing it client-side gives you the benefit of having more control on the encryption algorithm with the seemingly additional side-effect of your data not being transmitted in plaintext over the wire

44505097
ubuntu	linux
tested in ubuntu 16.04 amd64 qemu 2.5.0 binutils 2.26.1
qemu full system emulation when you boot android in qemu however it is not running an userland binary of course but rather doing full system simulation where it runs the actual linux kernel and all devices in the simulation

44509684
innodb	myisam
unless you have configured a different default storage engine issuing a create table statement without an engine clause creates an innodb table
innodb is the default not myisam innodb is the default mysql storage engine

44516201
implements	extends
any class that implements the declared interface is also considered to implements all the interfaces that this interface extends
this is a common misunderstanding an interface does not implements another interface it extends it as it doesn t provide a body to the functions

44516744
spaces	delimiter
... can t have a spaces between the
within any delimiter for such a construct allowed spaces are not affected by x and depend on the construct

44516744
spaces	delimiter
within any delimiter for such a construct allowed spaces are not affected by x and depend on the construct
for example can t have spaces because hexadecimal numbers don t have spaces in them

44521906
google-chrome	firefox
so this scenario may be left open for interpretation and google-chrome may not be violating any guidelines
however in another scenario where the height property was a factor firefox stuck with flex while google-chrome went with height why is firefox not honoring flexed div #39

44525767
prepare	execute
in your first code block you attempt to prepare a string that contains two sql statements
unfortunately mysql prepare execute cannot have multiple statements

44526685
onresume	onpause
note there are other ways to implement this kind of functionality. if you register in onstart don t also register them in onresume because that would be redundant onresume is never called without onstart being called first
also keep in mind that it s best to keep onpause as light as possible onpause execution is very brief and does not necessarily afford enough time to perform save operations

44527954
g++	gcc
the -static-libstdc++ option directs the g++ driver to link libstdc++ statically without necessarily linking other libraries statically
this makes clear that the option -static-libstdc++ is meaningful only to the g++ compiler driver not gcc or any other

44527954
g++	gcc
this makes clear that the option -static-libstdc++ is meaningful only to the g++ compiler driver not gcc or any other
on the other hand the option is meaningful and means the same thing to all gcc compiler drivers

44527954
g++	gcc
on that basis it is not surprising that gcc file.cc -lstdc++ -static-libstdc++ has the same meaning as gcc file.cc -lstdc++ however that observation does not truly illuminate why the first of those commandlines dynamically links libstdc++ - -static-libstdc++ is meaningful only to g++ because only g++ links libstdc++ automatically
so it is only for g++ that the question arises whether the automatically linked libstdc++ will be the dynamic version or the static version

44533189
uiview	subviews
now you can animate in fade out the uiview containing the visual effects view and any other subviews using it s alpha property and not have to worry about any graphical glitches or it logging a warning message
i just had this problem and the way i got around it was to house the uivisualeffectsview in a uiview and animate that uiview s alpha

44535715
udp	tcp
these effects are exactly why gamedevs often prefer udp over tcp
however when using udp to reduce latencies - it is important to realize that merely using udp is not sufficient to get substantial latency improvement it is all about how you re using udp

44540781
ubuntu	linux
btw i m not certain is such question would be on-topic here on stack overflow but ask ubuntu shall be fine
modern linux systems use dbus messaging system to communicate between application

44543791
strdup	malloc
i m also not sure what the purpose of this is you re preallocating space pointed to by the country pointer in the first array member but in any case readtable allocates space for country with strdup to all array members
you might also want to consider checking the value or n entered by the user or allocating the memory for tab via malloc

44549268
super	self
idk if you tried to set it as class but if this was an intention super doesn t work like this
to set attach descriptor dynamically you need to attach it to class of your instance referred by self inside __init__

44551704
comparator	comparable
from the treeset documentation note that the ordering maintained by a set whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if it is to correctly implement the set interface
your node class comparable implementation is not consistent with equals

44551704
equals	compareto
your node class comparable implementation is not consistent with equals
compareto can return 0 for two node instances wich are not equal

44554758
uicollectionview	uitableview
for a grid layout you ll want to use uicollectionview not uitableview
here s the uicollectionview documentation

44555152
persistent	transient
solution1 problem 2 object references an unsaved transient instances - save the transient instances before flushing you are getting this exception if you are doing the following and in this case you re telling the entity manager to persistent c1 assigning it a new sd1 unsaved instances
now the entity manager has a problem you told it to save the id of the stockdetails in its foreign key field but the object you associated is not saved yet and does not have an id because you are telling to propagate merge but not persistent

viewdidload	viewdidappear
and here is the code and here is the output child viewdidload 240.0 grandchild viewdidload 200.0 child viewwillappear 240.0 grandchild viewwillappear 200.0 child viewdidlayoutsubviews 271.0 child has it s final width now grandchild viewdidlayoutsubviews 200.0 grandchild still has it s original width
by now in most cases all views will have their correct sizes. child viewdidappear 271.0 grandchild viewdidappear 231.0 what you can see from this output is that viewdidlayoutsubviews does not guarantee that anything past the immediate sub-views of the view controller s principal view have their correct size

sqoop	hadoop
please visit sqoop document connecting to a database server section for more information
it s important that you do not use the url localhost if you intend to use sqoop with a distributed hadoop cluster

44562229
inline	inlining
x86 rawmodulo_5 method x86 optimizedmodulo_viamethod_5 x86 mersenne5 method the first big thing i notice is that mersenne5 is not actually getting inline even though it s listed tagged as aggressiveinlining
i m guessing this is because inlining the function inside optimizedmodulo_viamethod_5 would cause horrific register spilling and the large amount of memory reads and writes would completely destroy the point of inlining the method so the compiler elected quite wisely

44563640
innodb	myisam
make sure the tables you are using in deletequery query is innodb
rollback only works with innodb tables not myisam

44564604
mongodb	bson
as described in the mongodb docs on mongoimport warning avoid using mongoimport and mongoexport for full instance production backups
they do not reliably preserve all rich bson data types because json can only represent a subset of the types supported by bson

44566335
implements	extends
i can not believe that there is no some easy way to change date format through the input but let s hope it will be implements in some future version of material 2 currently beta 6
here is the only solution i found for this one first create const then you have to extends nativedateadapter in format function you can choose whatever format you want and the last step you have to add it into module providers and that s it

44567216
postgresql	mysql
where for example in postgresql you can query between multiple schemas in a database but not between databases directly you can query between multiple databases in mysql as there s no distinction between the two
in this light a possible solution to your multi-database query in mysql could be to use a single engine session and base handling both your schemas and passing the schema keyword argument to your tables or reflecting both schemas so that they re fully qualified

ionic	angular
works for me with ionic v3 and also angular typescript apps. on the device ionic cordova run with ionic serve and also with ng s angular apps used dir tree you can see an official example in the ionic conference starter try ionic start ionicconf conference btw same quetiosn answer here
i had the same issue with relative paths does work with ionic serve and also with livereload in the emulator from src pages home home.html but not on the device

44571046
google-chrome	safari
if you want the real size based on the orientation you can use window.innerwidth and window.innerheight i get the same values with or without the viewport meta tag it works fine on google-chrome simulated visualization because it return the screen size of the simulated visualization as it should be but it doesn t simulate the os where it should be running based on the device so you won t get the same values as on a real device in this case in which the real device doesn t return good values
ios used to return the size of the screen as if it was in portrait. they changed it on ios 8 on the native classes but they might have forgotten to do it for safari or maybe they kept it that way for compatibility

wildfly	jboss	wildfly	glassfish	jboss	glassfish
jboss was renamed to wildfly from version 8 wildfly 8 is jboss 8 and red hat supported version of jboss was renamed to jboss eap
so this applies to wildfly any version jboss eap from version 7 first thing to note is that alternate doc root feature in glassfish doesn t work like that

44573179
wildfly	jboss	wildfly	glassfish	wildfly	undertow	jboss	glassfish
so this applies to wildfly any version jboss eap from version 7 first thing to note is that alternate doc root feature in glassfish doesn t work like that
please take a look at this question for an explanation of the behavior of this feature alternate docroot not working on glassfish 4 now to answer this question jboss wildfly is build upon undertow that let you do exactly what you need

44575579
bower	npm
closure will not compile npm modules that are required by your application so you would need to use another tool like bower in conjunction with closure
bower will traverse your npm dependencies and concatenate them into a single file example

44576929
filewriter	printwriter
no need to wrap filewriter in a printwriter if you re only using write method
since you explicitly call filewriter constructor in append mode i d assume you want to write index to file if and only if file doesn t already contain that text

44577459
multiplying	modulo
take a series of bytes interpret them as a float value and multiplying the result with 36
let s see what you got here an alphabet of 36 characters where each character is randomly selected at once by using modulo 36 is indeed not evenly distributed

44582571
margin	text-align
i don t know why the first answer is the best one i tried it and not working in fact as kalys.osmonov said you can give text-align center to header but you have to make ul as inline-block rather than inline and also you have to notice that text-align can be inherited which is not good to some degree so the better way not working below ie 9 is using margin and transform
just remove float right and margin

44585360
apache	nginx
apache switch out for nginx if you want even better performance
apache is like a 4 by 4 contains everything you need nginx is more like a ferrari not much there but it does what you need it to

44596451
mongodb	bson
the decimal type is not native to javascript so decimal values in the shell are strings representing the bson value stored in mongodb
as per discussion on server-19676 in the mongodb issue tracker due to the fundamental problems inherent to doing non-floating point math in javascript there isn t any easy system to hook into to provide arithmetic support for our types

44597554
persistent	transient
the only logical explanation is that you are reading the user graph in the same persistent context session in which you have saved a new transient container instances containing nulls which is assigned to the backpackcontainer reference when loading and assembling the user graph afterwards
hibernate does not populate the associations when saving instances but it does it when loading instances from the db so you created it with nulls and it remained such in the persistent context

jruby	mri	mri	rubinius
and mri never implemented ruby 1.9 only yarv ironruby macruby jruby rubinius opal topaz truffleruby ruby+omr hotruby unholy and mruby implement ed ruby 1.9 or higher
i am not sure about maglev i think the abandoned 2.0 release implemented ruby 1.9. people do sometimes refer to yarv yet another ruby vm as mri matz s ruby | reference implementation | interpreter but that s wrong yarv was written by koichi ko1 sasada not yukihiro matz matsumoto so it simply is not matz s ruby implementation

44599748
uiview	calayer
uistackview is documented to be a nonrendering subclass of uiview
that is it does not provide any user interface of its own. in fact it uses a catransformlayer as its layer and the catransformlayer documentation says the calayer properties that are rendered by a layer are ignored including backgroundcolor contents border style properties stroke style properties etc.

44601797
sse	avx
oh and you have to watch for avx-sse transitions too call vzeroupper when you leave an avx section of code to return to sse code - it can be done but i found that understanding the cpu implications was a bigger battle than i originally envisaged
if you re talking about just getting the compiler to generate sse avx etc instructions and you ve got general purpose code ie you re not explicitly vectorising using intrinsics or got lots of code that the compiler will spot and auto-vectorise then i should warn you that avx avx2 or avx512 compiling your entire codebase will probably run significantly slower than compiling for sse versions

44601797
sse	avx

when avx opcodes using the upper halves of the registers are detected the cpu powers up the upper half of the circuitry which is otherwise powered down

44605027
onresume	onpause
the back button makes the last view to transit from onpause state to onresume and then running state
if you have access to onresume event you can override it or handle it so as this reload doesn t happen when back is pressed

44608479
super	extends
in case of default constructors super is implicitly called and in case parent has its own overloaded constructor we need to call super argument list and not super argument list i hope it solves your problem
there are multiple issues with the implementation parent class name is basetestsuite and you are extends basetestmethod

strdup	memmove	strdup	malloc
the strdup function provides the allocate and copy in a single function call
if you do not have strdup it is a simple function to write using strlen malloc and memcopy use memmove if there is a potential that the strings overlap

44611279
sqoop	hadoop
the active hadoop configuration is loaded from unless the environment variable is set depending on how you setup hadoop hortonworks only has sqoop 1 while cloudera and maybe mapr have sqoop2 and those instructions are probably different since sqoop2 architecture is different
to export data to multiple hadoop clusters if data is going into hadoop that s technically a sqoop import not clear how you currently manage different clusters from one machine but you would need to have the conf folder of all environments available for sqoop to read the sqoop command-line program is a wrapper which runs the bin hadoop script shipped with hadoop

44612893
jar	war
in general if you only generate a simple jar it will not contain the dependencies and it is the responsibility of the runner to supply the correct dependencies
in case of a war for example maven will throw in all dependencies

44614174
jar	war
that s all now run your project it will get all jar s from server and will not include in war file during compilation
what i got the way to deploy jar s on wildfly 10 server rather than making part of the war file is define below 1 put all your jars in wildfly modules system layers base com abcproject main and place a file named module.xml with the following content where resources are all those jars present in your abcproject main folder and dependencies are all those jars on which your jars are dependent and are present in wildfly modules system layers base folders

44616146
swift	objective-c
some have their adoption automatically generated by the compiler when importing objective-c classes in swift
as a result you will not see their adoption in the headers because the headers are just objective-c headers rewritten in swift

44616561
client-side	server-side
there is a big difference between server-side javascript nodejs and client-side javascript
client-side javascript doesn t have a module system yet and you can t import export things in a javascript file

44616754
n-gram	words
first it s important to note that google does not only treat singular words but also n-gram
more or less every nlp problem and therefore also information retrieval from text needs to tackle n-gram

44618131
google-chrome	firefox
the reason the error is caused by google-chrome it does not support ntlm on websocket connections
funny enough ie ms edge and firefox do support it google-chrome is the new ie huh

set	bag
variable is always set
it s a message bag that might or might not contain messages

44621135
d3.js	leaflet
.getbounds will return the leaftlet map extent so you can create a geojson bounding box fairly easily note that winding order is actually important in d3.js - outer ring are counterclockwise then all you have to do is set your projection to fit that extent using a slightly modified leaflet example changed centering point and zoom the whole thing looks like this i have not added the code to update the projection when the map changes but this is simply recalculating the bounding box and re-applying the fitsize method
for comparison with d3.js scales for mercator maps a mercator map uses this formula the scale factor in a d3.js map essentially applies the following transform the default map scale for d3.js mercator projections is 961 2π or 961 pixels by 360 degrees

dictionary	map
a dictionary can map a key to only one value
so you cannot construct a this as a vanilla dictionary

sse	avx
instruction set deprecated for x64 native emmintrin.h sse single-precision 4-wide simd xmmintrin.h sse2 double-precision and integer 4-wide simd after that they started using the code names of the processor architecture where the new instructions were introduced
pmmintrin.h sse3 the p stands for prescott tmmintrin.h supplemental sse3 the t stands for tejas smmintrin.h sse4.1 not sure what the s is here for. they were added for penryn but p was already used for prescott nmmintrin.h sse4.2 the n stands for nehalem wmmintrin.h aes the w stands for westmere these days the new instruction sets tend to end up in either ammintrin.h for amd-originated stuff abm bmi lwp tbm xop fma4 sse4a sse5 or immintrin.h for intel-originated stuff avx fma3 f16c avx2 etc.

44638426
factors	matrix
we need to loop through the dataset and convert it to numeric and then apply the sum we can also do this with tidyverse if we really need colsums one option is to convert the data.frame into matrix so the factors class gets converted to character then change it to numeric assign the dim to the dimension of original dataset and get the colsums
the as.numeric as.character works on vector matrix and not on data.frame

44643134
swift	objective-c
the realm objective c and realm swift apis are not interoperable and using them together is not supported
there is some limited unofficial support for interoperability with objective-c available that may help you but it s really intended for only very narrow use cases primarily to allow writing frameworks that wish to support models written in both realm objective-c and realm swift

44650878
super	extends
i would then apply lag against the unique combination of id and date and join back to the original dataset like this however this is not super performant
if nature of your data is that you have a limited number of timestamps for the same day you might just extends your lag with a conditional statement like this basically you look at the previous record and if it doesn t suit you then you look back to the record before that one and so on until you find the correct record or run out of your statement depth

44652089
ssl	https
- you can check this by running your main domain through the ssl labs testing tool
however the world is moving towards https everywhere and your development environments do not reflect production

44654437
sudo	passwd
problems in your cronjob sudo tries to ask for passwd but fails
giving it a tty will not help because there is no user to enter passwd

44660721
google-chrome	firefox
but is valid for google-chrome will cancel this request and automatically redirect to the latter site
this is not the case for firefox

44662854
viewdidload	viewdidappear
that you cannot show anything in the viewdidload is correct because the view itself is not shown at this point so there is no way itself can show another view
however showing it in viewdidappear should work

44663775
decoder	encoder
if you want it to be asymmetric encode but not decoder or vice versa you have to provide your own implementations of encode with encoder and init from decoder
the list of keys to encode decoder is controlled by a type called codingkeys

44669014
implements	extends
simplified example in this case the list implements icollidable then it forces all the parts to have this behaviors
it might not be true composed objects may then even override the default behavior of their parts or to add extends it the set has often not the same properties of its separate elements

44678349
stateless	stateful
if you mean because of a server crash keep in mind that if the ejb resides in the same server then an ejb stateless stateful singleton etc... cannot survive a server crash
the shopping cart of a stateful ejb hosted within an http session is in my opinion the typical example of something that shouldn t be done for a very simple reason a shop online purpose is to increase traffic and number of paying users

44681816
swift	objective-c
this is currently not possible in swift
as noted by sulthan this is an objective-c category for which you see the swift version which is generated by xcode

44681816
swift	objective-c
as noted by sulthan this is an objective-c category for which you see the swift version which is generated by xcode
now objective-c does not easily support adding properties in categories extensions are called categories in objective-c but you can use associated objects to get what you want

44683762
keystore	jks
just use directly the pfx file as pkcs#12 keystore instead of jks
you would need to import the private key of the certificate into the keystore and not only the public key

44683989
daemons	systemd
first try with sudo as the current user may not have access permissions to communicate to docker daemons var run docker.sock if its still not working then after the installation simply stop the docker daemons as and run the following command to start the daemons in background to make working with docker easier you should add your username to the docker users group
adding a user to the group can be done with the command underneath by adding your username at the end also this step is mention at official documentation of docker post-installation steps for linux the ubuntu 16.04 users can follow these steps inside file lib systemd systemd docker.service change execstart usr bin dockerd fd with execstart usr bin dockerd -h tcp 0.0.0.0 2375 inside file etc init.d docker change docker_opts with docker_opts -h tcp 0.0.0.0 2375 and then restart your machine

44688388
memcpy	strncpy
memcpy only copies memory and has no recollection of strings and null terminators
strncpy will copy the first n characters and will fill the rest with 0s null terminator only if the null terminator was found in the n characters so chances were you gave strncpy the length of the strings you wanted to copy which it did but did not find a null terminator

44692920
spaces	linefeed
makaron you can replace the spaces and underline with a linefeed and carriage return and then re-add the underline
alternatively you can use just the carriage return char 13 or reverse char 13 + char 10 if you do not need the extra line spaces

44694568
floating-point	fractions
for the full read get into this what every computer scientist should know about floating-point arithmetic
we can correct this simply by not using fractions numbers and rounding out to factored integers

44696087
division	subtraction
as z0r explained in the comments since quaternions transform rotations by multiplication the difference between them is the multiplicative inverse - basically quaternion division
now much as for small theta this x is not very different from the result of subtraction as long as the difference is small

44698955
multiplying	multiplication
multiplying the 1d or the 100d data is exactly the same operation
for elementwise multiplication it does not matter and flattening the array does not change a thing

44699412
namedtuple	dictionary
you could create a whole deck as a list not as a dictionary shuffle it draw a card thus removing it from the deck and check its value. defining a new card class isn t too hard with namedtuple and it will make it easier to work with afterwards thanks to maartenfabré for the comment
it s not really clear how you want to simulate a deck with this dictionary

44699789
inline	inlining
inlining one option to solve this problem that i have used for smaller very hot methods and functions is to make them inline-functions with the definition in the header and let them be inline in the calling functions
unless the compiler decides not to inline the function anyway which it may do for various reasons like the function being too large

44707738
swift	objective-c
so really the compiler shouldn t let you mark tr as dynamic i went ahead and filed a bug here which has now been fixed and will be ready for swift 5
tr needs to be objective-c dynamic for you to use kvo on it because kvo requires method swizzling which the objective-c runtime provides and swift runtime doesn t

44710121
stateless	stateful
it avoids the need to call dispose . stateless sessions do not support iterative invocations the act of calling execute ... is a single shot method that will internally instantiate a statefulknowledgesession add all the user data and execute user commands call fireallrules and then call dispose . so basically stateless session is a stateful session used one time
this then imply that stateless session can also do inference unlike many documents and some answers here said

44714694
uicollectionview	uitableview
if you want horizontal scrolling i would recommend using uicollectionview where cells can be added horizontally or vertically or both. still if you want tableview to be scrollable in horizontal direction i would suggest you to check this project to get inspiration or using it
i am not really sure why do you want to use uitableview for horizontal scrolling which lay out there cells in vertical manner

44717021
google-chrome	firefox
i checked ie11 ms edge and google-chrome and this works fine
on bootstrap 4 v4.0.0-alpha.6 the following worked well for me please note as of bootstrap-4.0.0-beta.1 and firefox 56.0.1 this does not seem to work correctly

44727081
super	self
also super has __get__ method which makes it a descriptor i ll omit the details of descriptors here refer to the documentation to know more
this answers your second question as well as to why self isn t passed explicitly

44731715
swift	objective-c
according to the accepted proposal se-0161 smart keypaths better key-value coding for swift you need to use referencewritablekeypath to write a value to the key path for an object with reference semantics using subscript
you need to pass a classic string -based key path to setvalue _ forkeypath not keypath . and some more value and value2 need to be the same for assignment t needs to represent the type of self kvc kvo target properties need to be objective-c bindme.init person needs super.init so your bindme would be something like this for edit the demand to make a bindbase like thing seems very reasonable so i have made some tries

44733211
swift	objective-c
you can put objective-c in front of the method declaration to tell the swift compiler that you specifically want to use a method from objective-c
among other effects this makes the compiler issue an error if the method is not callable from objective-c for some reason it would be nice if the compiler told you which parameter s type is not represented but as of xcode 9 beta 2 it doesn t

44733211
swift	objective-c
anyway the problem in this case is that swift inout parameters cannot be represented in objective-c
if you don t need the parameter to be inout just take out that keyword and the method will be bridged to objective-c

44735003
swift	objective-c
the argued benefit of this approach is that swift value types can be stored in objective-c collections
however the disadvantage is that you cannot convert to an objective-c compatible value on the objective-c side

44739555
udp	tcp
boost does not to my knowledge have any ready-made facilities that would help you to stream data over udp
i think your best bet is to use tcp which handles streaming for maximum speeed and gives you some extra insurance for data integrity

44742855
apache	nginx
check this out apache mod_rewrite to nginx rewrite rules
basically apache rewrite and nginx rewrite do not quite mean the same thing

44742855
apache	nginx
basically apache rewrite and nginx rewrite do not quite mean the same thing
it seems that you are using nginx rewrite where you should be using nginx try_files

44750677
swift	objective-c
basically it is a swift value that is bridged into objective-c
the problem is that the object success points to is not an objective-c block

44750677
swift	objective-c
it is a swift closure and swift closures are not the same as objective-c blocks
trying to use invoke it as if it were an objective-c block causes undefined behavior

44752126
swift	objective-c
the only way i figured out to pass it from swift and work is something like
because swift closures and objective-c blocks are not the same things

44752126
swift	objective-c
because swift closures and objective-c blocks are not the same things
swift automatically converts a closure to an objective-c block if they see that you are calling a method with an objective-c block type but it doesn t do that otherwise

44752126
swift	objective-c
swift automatically converts a closure to an objective-c block if they see that you are calling a method with an objective-c block type but it doesn t do that otherwise
and as crd s answer mentions in swift 3 any swift value can be represented as an objective-c object so even though it sees that it expects an objective-c object it still doesn t know you want an objective-c block because a swift closure can still be bridged to an opaque object

44754105
odoo	openerp
if you use the second way the custom addons directory has to have at least one working module in it or any directory with init .py and openerp .py files inside it or it will give you does not seem to a be a valid addons directory error see section configuring the addons path in the odoo development cookbook book
there is two way to add custom folder to the odoo addons path first the easy one to edit the configuration file of the odoo server and locate the line starting with addons_path and appending comma followed by the absolute path to the directory you want to add to the addons path so if the custom addons directory is home user_name new-addons and the path of your odoo instance is home user_name odoo the line should be like this the second is when calling the odoo.py script and pass the --addons-path command line argument to it like this in this case you must not only pass the path to your custom addons directory but also the paths of the base addons odoo openerp addons and the core addons directory odoo addons and if your put space after the commas between the paths you will need to quote the list of directories

44756162
implements	extends
luckily you can use the outerhtml property it s also possible to implements the tojson method on htmlelement.prototype and then your original code would work as is however extends the prototype of host objects is generally considered bad practice and tojson specifically breaks earlier versions of the prototype.js library as if that matters anymore
an htmlelement is treated as a plain object by json.stringify because it doesn t implements a tojson method

44756250
swift	objective-c
ideally you can simply move the import statement into your .m file however if you need to publicly expose the swift class in your objective-c header then you must forward declare it using class someswiftclass
a circular reference has been created making it so the swift code is unable to compile which leads to the canary error stating that the _swift.h file is not found

44756250
swift	objective-c
long story short the documentation explicitly says not to this to avoid cyclical references don t import swift code into an objective-c header .h file
instead you can forward declare a swift class or protocol to reference it in an objective-c interface

44765217
jar	war
the exact answer it is not possible to get the original source code .java files from a war as opposed to a jar java archive
when you create a jar file you can decide if you want to include the .java files

44766957
implements	extends
note that mypy can theoretically support typechecking arbitrary strings and the core devs aren t opposed to extends the api for mypy in principle -- it s just that mypy is still under active development which means implements an api has been very low priority for a while now
and since mypy is still actively being worked on extended the devs are somewhat reluctant to commit to implements a more complex api that they ll subsequently have to support

jar	war
in order to verify if your gradle job generated the correct jar too extract the gradle-produced plugin jar file and inspect if there s a meta-inf oracle.dbtools.plugin.api.di.providers file with the sole content the fqn of your testservlet
if not then it definitely won t be discovered by ords core in war

44768709
strcpy	strncpy
much of the problem is that you do not allow enough memory for some fields and that will cause problems when using strcpy
protect against that by using strncpy

44776099
client-side	server-side
still don t fully understand the relationship between the client-side session cookie the server-side session file and the way php randomly chooses to remove or keep a session during garbage collection
the client-side cookie does not hold any info about the user

44777374
calloc	malloc
malloc is not required to clear the memory before returning it but some allocators do that basically they behave like calloc
in that case the cost of malloc may go up linearly

44780259
dictionary	map
if the name is not null it will be maintained in the section s dictionary
or entry.getkey has common value for all customproperties in the map

44781332
spaces	linefeed
there are ways to make believe to the program that it s writing to a console but in your case there may exist a simple workaround which would be to replace 6 spaces by a linefeed
of course this isn t perfect if spaces occur somewhere else but that s a start

44782770
octal	decimal
for example will throw error because 08 is not a valid octal number but will not throw error because it is a valid octal number
will produce int 57 because 71 in octal which translates to 57 in decimal

44785870
mp4	webm
but mov files can contain a variety of different encodings they are not all mp4
only mp4 webm and ogg video are supported by the html5 standard

44787417
bluestacks	android-emulator
if that doesn t work try on different android-emulator like genymotion use 10.0.2.3 instead of 10.0.2.2 bluestacks etc
i think something is wrong with your browser on the android-emulator

44788750
prepare	execute
see especially following comment to those wondering why adding quotes to around a placeholder is wrong and why you can t use placeholders for table or column names there is a common misconception about how the placeholders in prepare statements work they are not simply substituted in as escaped strings and the resulting sql execute
instead a dbms asked to prepare a statement comes up with a complete query plan for how it would execute that query including which tables and indexes it would use which will be the same regardless of how you fill in the placeholders

44789659
macports	homebrew
it really was pretty simple the main hassle is that their installer only works with homebrew rather than macports which is what i usually use
i first tried to install homebrew to my home directory but the actual drivers aren t seen by pyodbc that way so did a standard homebrew install then brew install msodbcsql

44792823
ssl	https
no it will not automatically redirect.when you enable requiressl you are just enforcing that the connection should be over ssl
you have to have both http and https binding and do not set requiressl.now we have to configure automatic redirect using urlrewrite module explicitly

44793245
express	node.js
to solve the problem with low level node.js code to solve the problem with express framework
this is because the node.js server does not serve main.js correctly -- according to the browser s resources panel main.js is available but its path is not main.js

44793291
swift	objective-c
updated it ll not add objective-c by default in swift 4
this is because the compiler will add objective-c to nsobject subclasses

44794248
super	extends
that or you may need to declare constructor and then call super props
i believe if you are trying to add proptypes with es7 initializers and using the transform-class-properties you need to do so it would be pretty sure you do not have to explicitly define props as it is part of the react.component when you extends from it

44794680
junit	mockito
but even though junit might report next test as red don t worry about it and just click at navigable stack trace element in the exception message to instantly locate the place where you misused mockito
so to not loosing a potentially misuse for the last one mockito method invoked during a test class you can explicitly invoke mockito.validatemockitousage after each tested method

44795811
jar	war
an executable jar will not work because of a hard coded file pattern in tomcat
with jetty it should work if you use war packaging an executable war will work and will also be deployable to any standard container

44795906
uicollectionview	uitableview
answer there is no need to embed uitableview within uiscrollview since uitableview is inherited from uiscrollview. if you want horizontal scrolling you should use uicollectionview instead
apple you should not embed uiwebview or uitableview objects in uiscrollview objects

44798806
swift	objective-c
this is a specific case of the more general issue discussed in catching nsexception in swift the summary seems to be that swift exceptions and objective-c exceptions are different
in this instance the swift documentation says it throws an exception but this cannot be caught

udp	tcp
note that udp is not as reliable as tcp
you can send a message to a udp port using syb_sendmsg

44801749
spaces	delimiter
p -i file note we use -n to suppress automatic printing of pattern spaces instead printing it explicitly with p command for each line not matched
to delete a sequence of lines delimiter by some patterns you should use an address range two addresses separated by a comma with regexp addresses to select the lines between including the first and the last followed by a delete command sed subgraph edge d -i file use the -i --in-place flag to edit the file in place with an optional backup

junit	mockito
so it can not handle service definition and dynamic condition normally this is done in junit framework without using mocking framework
mock is also dummy implementation but its implementation done dynamic way by using mocking frameworks like mockito

44821354
kerberos	ntlm
also i see that your website is not using kerberos only ntlm token starts with tlrmtv...
normally your application should have a kerberos token unless some basic things are fine edit as suspected before it looks like the website was using ntlm instead of going on kerberos

44821354
kerberos	ntlm
normally your application should have a kerberos token unless some basic things are fine edit as suspected before it looks like the website was using ntlm instead of going on kerberos
this is because kerberos cannot work with external domain or ip address.so it will fall back to ntlm and with ntlm ie might use ntlm pre-auth

google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
also just a note i noticed there was a media only screen and -webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio 1.5 not all not all rule used which effects only the google-chrome safari browsers

44829697
bison	jison
indeed it would be relatively easy to preprocess a bison grammar file but it is easier with jison because you can compute the grammar programmatically and pass it to jison as a json object
this feature is not well-documented but the jison manual contains enough examples that it should be straight-forward to use

44831306
postgresql	mysql
other dbms for example postgresql wouldn t allow this query to execute at all
saying that how it works internally within mysql is just that you get a unique record for each posts.id but random values from potentially different rows for all non-aggregated and non-grouped column

44832175
ssl	https
and origin protocol policy is not applicable to an s3 website hosting endpoint because the s3 static website hosting endpoints do not support ssl connections
cloudfront can still accept https connections from the browser but the connection between cloudfront and s3 will always use http for a static website origin

44835141
google-chrome	firefox
this fixes the issue for google-chrome and ie11 won t fix it for ie10- and firefox as they don t support horizontal scrolling on a element at all
not sure why it does that i can reproduce in google-chrome

44836667
sudo	passwd
most systems will let you do that with a simple command sudo usermod -a -g newgroup username older systems require editing etc group
first try sudo vigr vi group much like vipw for the passwd file and if that isn t present you may edit it directly via sudo vi etc group

44836989
swift	objective-c
check this proposal for swift 4 se-0160 limiting objective-c inference according to the description in the proposal your second code snippet also needs objective-c
in fact swift 4 compiler bundled with xcode 9 beta2 generates this error for the line using #selector tapped error argument of #selector refers to instance method tapped that is not exposed to objective-c note add objective-c to expose this instance method to objective-c maybe your second is a little bit too old to use with swift 4

44837121
hex	binary
md5 e column column calculates the md5 digest of a binary column and returns the value as a 32 character hex string
you could then use it as follows you have to make sure that the column is of binary type so in case it s int you may see the following error org.apache.spark.sql.analysisexception cannot resolve md5 duration due to data type mismatch argument 1 requires binary type however duration is of int type

44837688
super	implements
so here i have two cell prototypes in my dynamic table one for not available and one for available then the code would look at the model to figure out which to instantiate and that would yield now clearly i just whipped up a super primitive model and didn t do any ui design in the available cell prototype other than inserting three labels
but it illustrates the idea if your dynamic table has multiple unique cell designs just implements cell prototypes for each with unique identifiers and instantiate the appropriate one

44837708
swift	objective-c
and to answer your question about why well selectors are actually a way to send messages between cocoa classes not a swift feature
so they are actually based on objective-c thus why you need to keep compatibility between them

44840734
mongodb	bson
change your code to note as mentioned by saghm in the comment the mongodb shell helpers are not exactly the same as the run command equivalents in the drivers
you can use the shell s db.runcommand if you want to try out things with the same bson that the driver requires in database run_command

44841479
rsa	aes
rsa is not ment for bulk encryption as it s quit slow compared to symmetric algorithms like aes it s more than a factor of 1000 slower
the amount of data that can be encrypted with rsa in one block is dependent on the key size and any data that might be used by padding

44841653
jar	war
jar.enabled false if there is already a jar generated and you are not doing a clean build then delete the generated jar or you might wonder that it is still in the war
just disable the jar task then no jar is generated

44841685
xslt	xquery
or consider an xml data base like basex or existdb if you have very large input documents where i am not sure however how good they support xslt they are focused on xquery
there is saxsource and streamsource so you don t need to use dom at all to use xslt with java

44844642
implements	extends
i searched project for didbecomeactive key and it appeared that firebaseplugin was already using this method for some other stuff this plugin was added to project by another person so i was not aware of how it works . what i did is simply moved my code to firebase plugin and implements missing responders because i only had about 10 lines all together
i have found the solution for this problem or at least a reason why some system responders may not fire up in cordova projects if you re using a plugin that extends appdelegate to access lifecycle responders in ios you may not be aware that some other component also extends appdelegate and is already using this responder this makes responder inaccessible in your implementation

44849856
ienumerable	iqueryable
getall returns ienumerable apparently otherwise the groupby overload with a comparer wouldn t work
you don t need any grouping if you query the pages directly and use a navigation property that i assume exist or else should be added i use context.pages because the source of the statement should be iqueryable

44851819
swift	objective-c
you can t do this without doing some rewriting swift structs are simply not visible from objective-c
you need to write an objc-visible swift class to expose the values sort of the inverse of swift foundation s overlay types

44859884
keystore	jks
then you can easily use load and store methods to load it and save changes. in case you manage to get it working with the os specific keystore you actually do not have to create it as it is already there
jks used to be the standard keystore format in java till java 8

44860535
sudo	passwd
so what happens in your example is that sudo tries to read the passwd from the here-document instead of the echo that you tried to pipe to it
in other words you cannot supply the passwd to sudo and at the same time pass a here-document to its shell

44860535
sudo	passwd
in other words you cannot supply the passwd to sudo and at the same time pass a here-document to its shell
what you can do is separate these two actions by taking advantage of the timeout option of sudo . that is once you successfully used sudo it remembers your authenticated state for a while and subsequent calls to sudo will not ask for the passwd again

44862178
shadowing	named
end note 10.2 11 however shadowing is a widely used term for all sorts of named hiding so it is completely fine to use it in a comment
the standard n4141 uses the term hiding for this note the named declared in v and the left-hand instance of w are hidden by those in b but the named declared in the right-hand instance of w are not hidden at all

44862201
shadowing	named
i have also heard the term named masking but not so often as hiding or shadowing
i have came across two terms used to describe this kind of behaviour in a programming language - hiding and shadowing

44863893
swift	objective-c
to make it work with your initial code you should write the first argument of your swift to be without a name like this
taken from the answers at got is not a recognized objective-c method when bridging swift to react-native

44865899
uitapgesturerecognizer	uibutton
to solve my problem i simply set my uitapgesturerecognizer s target to be my stackview instead of the the entire view
original resolved i d be curious to learn why the uitapgesturerecognizer stopped my uibutton from being tapped but not the normal uibutton

44866334
apache	nginx
apache doesn t spawn a new process for each static file
apache keeps persistent processes to handle concurrent and subsequent requests just like nginx

44870203
profiling	benchmarking
moreover it all depends on runtime profiling and the optimisation level of the function and other functions it may call which may change over time and even on when it was compiled optimised deoptimised which can be somewhat non-deterministic
that is all to say that -- as always -- micro benchmarking will not give useful information and at worst be wildly misleading

44870299
comparator	comparable
btw your specific method doesn t require v and t to implement comparable since it doesn t call comparator
however it would be required if you changed the code to then you can call this method only with parameters that implement comparable

44871543
comparator	comparable
perform yourself the sort but you should still do some casts if you want to use the comparator method of the student class as person is not a comparable instance
the teacher wanted us to create a professor class to manage student using arraylist so replace by in this way you could invoke collections.sort students as student refers to a list of comparable elements student implementing the comparable interface

44876029
inline	inlining
it triggers inlining if it results in reduction of code size even if the function is not declared inline
your function apparently does not pass these specific inlining filters active at -o2 level it is relatively large and apparently called more than once

44876029
inline	inlining
for this reason gcc does not consider it for inlining at -o2 unless you explicitly request it with inline keyword
note that explicit inline keyword is basically like -finline-functions setting turned on for that specific function only

44876029
inline	inlining
note that explicit inline keyword is basically like -finline-functions setting turned on for that specific function only
it will make gcc to consider it for inlining but does not guarantee inlining

44879269
odoo	openerp
there are a few things to check if odoo is not showing your module in the modules list
first would be to check if the folder contains the correct files init .py manifest .py for v10 and openerp .py for v9 models views etc

44879269
odoo	openerp
maybe that the module is in a subfolder in this case the module will not be read by odoo
also please note that if you are using odoo v9 and you place a module for v10 which has manifest .py instead of openerp .py the module will not be shown and read at all

44881743
rdf	owl
i played a bit with stardog 5.0 and got some more insights from an owl dl view the ontology is expressive enough to infer that pizza markspizzainstance rdf type pizza interestingpizza . this can be evaluated with protege for example
a sample explanation that can be computed with the pretty cool protege feature would be i could achieve the same in stardog by enabling dl reasoning result +-------------------+-------------------------+ | p | o | +-------------------+-------------------------+ | pizza hastopping | pizza topping1 | | pizza hastopping | pizza topping2 | | pizza hastopping | pizza markspeppers | | pizza hastopping | pizza topping3 | | pizza hastopping | pizza topping4 | | rdf type | pizza pizza | | rdf type | owl thing | | rdf type | pizza interestingpizza | +-------------------+-------------------------+ for the stardog profile sl it doesn t work because the axiom is not in the profile

44881916
implements	extends
you will get an exception object is not an instance of declaring class because the jdk proxy doesn t extends the bean s class it just implements all its interfaces
to get around this you then need to find the method s evil twin on the proxy and invoke it with that this will work - but only if the method you are trying to invoke is declared by one of the interfaces the class implements because the jdk proxies only proxy methods that were declared in an interface implemented by the bean class

44885161
jar	war
we ve recently had a similar requirement where an existing spring boot based project that was originally packaged as an executable jar needed to support tomcat and wildfly deployments
due to some dependencies used in this project for example webjars a simple switch to war package wasn t an option since some of those dependencies were required for wildfly vfs support but not for other deployment

44891780
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome clicking on something like all.css 1 in the styles pane of the elements tab of devtools takes one to the sources tab of devtools
if you re looking at code on remote server the css rules in this source view are not live-editable unlike the live-editing style editor tab of firefox unless you re viewing the inspector-stylesheet -- a temporary stylesheet containing new style rules you created with the + button in the styles pane of the elements tab

44893431
pascal	delphi
safecall - n delphi and free pascal on microsoft windows the safecall calling convention encapsulates com component object model error handling thus exceptions aren t leaked out to the caller but are reported in the hresult return value as required by com ole
when calling a safecall function from delphi code delphi also automatically checks the returned hresult and raises an exception if necessary

44897085
namenode	hdfs
from bpoffsetservice.java the bpservices store the rpc list of both namenode including the active and the standby one.obviously a same request it send to both namenode at least one request will report a category write is not supported in state standby error and the other one will succeed. so no worries about it. in your hdfs ha configurtion if you configure like this and unfortunately if the namenode1 is the standby one then you will receive much info-level log because namenode1 will be requested for some operation and surely the namenode-side checkoperation will throw a info-level exception
i met the same problem below is the stack trace if you are familiar with hadoop rpc you will know that the above error log happends when rpc client datanode trying to make a remote rpc call to the rpc server namenode nodenode throw a exception because it is a standby one.so some of the above stacktrace was the server-side stack and some are the client-side stacktrace

44900216
theano	keras
it appears keras does not include this and perhaps because the feature does not exist in theano
i have written a custom keras layer that does the same

44902997
required	placeholder
and as it s not required makes no sense
i assume its a placeholder for the parameter at point 4 below build the uri create the params dict according to the above reference i recommend to use a listing_image_id as this seems the only way to delete a image afterwards

44904162
swift	objective-c
importing swift file inside objective-c can cause this error if it doesn t import properly
note you don t have to import swift files externally you just have to import one file which takes care of swift files

44905851
mongodb	bson
if you dont plan a high usage to the db you can target m4 or c4 with gp2 maybe start with that and go with other instance type if necessary if you ned to store files within your db host them directly in your mongodb instance access will be much faster it is reasonably cheap and you can benefit from mongodb feature on bson index search etc
tldr you cannot host mongodb database on s3

44909472
uicollectionview	uitableview
implications of cells and recycling in general this is a tricky problem to solve because of the way uicollectionview is designed
the same applies to uitableview . your button is inside of a re-usable collection view cell which means that you not only have to handle taps but you need to know which index path in your data set the button is currently referring to

44911987
gridbaglayout	boxlayout
or to center all use a different layout such as a gridbaglayout
you re setting the x alignment of the buttons but you re boxlayout lays out along the x axis -- doesn t make sense

44913138
sudo	passwd
no answer i guess it is an empty passwd but sudo is not accepting it
what i did to solve the problem was first connect to the docker container using the ssh port user magento2 and changed the passwd to magento2 . after that i executed m2devbox-init.bat again used that passwd and it worked

44913162
erlang	elixir
the erlang mailing list thread you linked to also multiplies the number of bytes with 8 before constructing the binary
elixir just doesn t allow expressions in size like erlang does though

44919294
freebsd	linux
as it is not documented on freebsd this option is also available there the constant is included in the proper include files and some other imprecisions are found in the freebsd manual as the use of s_irown s_iwown s_irgrp s_iwgrp s_iroth and s_iwoth flags to control the permission bits and no inclusion of in the synopsis of the manual page conclussion if the shm_rdonly is available in your system then you can use it as a non-preemptive way to disallow write access to you shared memory but if you want kernel enforced way you have to switch to the user permission bits approach
i have not seen any of o_rdonly or shm_rdonly documented as flags for the shmat 2 system call in the linux or freebsd manual pages

44926921
serializable	deserialization
if a serializable class does not explicitly declare a serialversionuid then the serializable runtime will calculate a default serialversionuid value for that class based on various aspects of the class as described in the java tm object serializable specification
however it is strongly recommended that all serializable classes explicitly declare serialversionuid values since the default serialversionuid computation is highly sensitive to class details that may vary depending on compiler implementations and can thus result in unexpected invalidclassexceptions during deserialization

44929837
rar	zip
if you want to get the file itself you need to use check the link associated with the download button finally unzip doesn t know how to deal with rar archive files
if you created this archive yourself use the zip format instead

44932889
stateless	stateful
also it should be noted that tensors are stateless while the variables are stateful
meaning of the error message - typeerror type variable doesn t implement stateless method nonzero is we cannot use torch.nonzero on autograd.variable but only on simple tensors

44937417
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
firefox google-chrome safari edge and ie11 don t always render images as flex items in the same way
read this post for more details flex in firefox shrinks images automatically but not in google-chrome considering all factors above here s my suggested solution the html width and height attributes map to their respective css properties

44938883
implements	extends
one class can implements several interfaces whereas it can extends just one class abstract or not
therefore when you create a subclass extended an abstract class you need to implements the abstract method that was in the abstract class if any otherwise the subclass would be still an abstract class -- which cannot be instantiated

44945523
elasticsearch	kibana
you can not use them to do the administrative operations to your elasticsearch instance
although kibana does have dev tools that you can use to query elasticsearch and do mappings etc

44949594
decimal	ieee
s weird decimal calculations
javascript uses ieee 754 double precision floating-point numbers see ecma-262 and they cannot accurately represent all decimal fractions

44949594
decimal	ieee
javascript uses ieee 754 double precision floating-point numbers see ecma-262 and they cannot accurately represent all decimal fractions
to get the results that you expect you can either scale the numbers to work on integers count cents instead of dollars or round the numbers to a specific number of decimal digits after you do the calculations

44949970
tcpdf	fpdf
to test this i downloaded pdfmerger note this includes a copy of tcpdf slightly modified the example code and ran it with a pdf that is marked as version 1.7 the result is that in my web browser i get a pdf file of two pages as expected
as far as i can tell fpdf fpdi is not required at all

44955798
directx	gdi
i suggest you should stay away from it and use the superior opengl or directx interfaces i prefer opengl
as taw pointed out gdi and gdi+ is not synced with the monitor and doesn t look nice if used for realtime stuff

44956978
bower	npm
first thing is that i think you do not need switch os to run bower from local dependencies
after you install bower as devdepedency you can set for example script in package.json and then run npm install should work

44957421
postgresql	mysql
support for postgresql is not available
see it says note app maker supports only mysql databases

44957661
clang	llvm
while not a full answer you should be able to compile pony_gp.c directly to llvm .ll using clang preferably the same clang provided with emscripten for example source emsdk emsdk_env.sh cython hello.py clang python2-config --cflags -s -emit-llvm hello.c then the generated .ll file could be fed directly to emscripten
for producing a fully working python - webassembly you should probably also need to link against the python runtime - you could use the one distributed with emcc which is already compiled into llvm bytecode .bc emsdk emscripten incoming tests python python.bc

44959453
bash	zsh
so it like the bash autocomplete not the zsh
in the shell php test.php enter custom command tab a b c custom command tab a b c the code is about runtime autocomplete as suggested by c9s it is possible to obtain this kind of functionality but extending autocomplete functionality of your bash not with php

44966230
cpython	pypy
in pypy files are not as promptly closed as in cpython
for proof the following code also prints 10 on cpython the difference with your code is only that the gzipfile object is stored in a variable f which is still alive when buf.tell is called

44971093
imperative	declarative
you also need to call addmapitem there are alternatives ways to create qml object dynamically and i believe they are better since it involves less imperative javascript and is more readable
the first one is doing it with a declarative created component you can do it directly in your main.qml the other way is to do it with model and views and it s my favorite since you are not directly dealing with component and object instantiation

44971322
octal	hex
a comment notes that es2015 requires a leading 0o or 0o in strict mode for octal literals but that doesn t apply to parseint which in es2015 only overrides the default radix for hex strings
in older versions of the language parseint would cause the function to obey the normal javascript numeric constant syntax rules including the recognition of a leading zero to denote octal constants and a leading 0x to denote hex constants

44975248
memcmp	strcmp
the particular values returned by memcmp are not specified by the standard
the c11 draft standard does say in 7.24.4 1 the sign of a nonzero value returned by the comparison functions memcmp strcmp and strncmp is determined by the sign of the difference between the values of the first pair of characters both interpreted as unsigned char that differ in the objects being compared

44975716
allocator	stl
in fact this is very analogous to the history of allocator support stl containers had support for custom allocator but not for stateful allocator meaning non-default-constructible allocator types
allocator versions at first i tried some of the allocator versions but it had no decisive effect

44979309
g++	gcc
centos 7 had such an old version of g++ i was forced to use dev-toolset-6 in order to get a modern version of g++ ie one that supported c++14
this was unrelated to the current project which i clearly was using c++11 with but the thing about clion is that by default it uses uses the g++ gcc gmake version found in usr bin which is not where the g++ 6.2.1 version is located

44979309
g++	gcc
this was unrelated to the current project which i clearly was using c++11 with but the thing about clion is that by default it uses uses the g++ gcc gmake version found in usr bin which is not where the g++ 6.2.1 version is located
i had already fixed this issue with projects that used c++14 go into settings for the project you want and paste the following line in cmake options underneath build execution deployment this is the correct location of g++ now

44983889
portrait	landscape
here i m saying that view should be presented in portrait this will lead to a nice orientation animation the view can rotate and if landscape flag is active it can rotate in all orientation except upside-down
to intercept orientation changes you can use device orientation changes but only to trigger the presentation of the landscape view controller use the traits variation callback to trigger the presentation but your app is like mine and you have pick only portrait orientation in general settings you will not receive any of those call callbacks inside the orientation changes callback from the vc where you want to present the landscape interface you can present your landscape view controller the landactive is a property of the fullgraphviewcontroller that when is set asks the rotation from port to landscape to begin

44986956
onchange	onfocus	onchange	onblur
i have found that for many years microsoft followed a strategy whereby it didnt follow the w3c standards in its browser but the behavior is correct according to ie s own specification the onchange event does not fire when the selected option of the select object is changed programmatically
reference msdn - onchange event a possible workaround to solve this problem and make your solution cross browser would be onfocus save the input value on a expando property onblur call a js function that compares the old value with the current value

44992111
ionic	angular
it s not a full rewrite like there was going from ionic 1 - ionic 2 and they are now using semantic versioning so major releases will be more regular similar to angular
when using the ionic service your app sends your plain password to the ionic with service when creating and logging into your account

44993641
jar	war
you have to access the resource by class.getresourceasstream since you can t access files packed in a jar if it works with a war it is just luck since your servlet j2ee-container seems to unpack your war.
which is not the case with all containers due to the spec it is up to the container whether it will unpack the the war or not

44994531
ionic	angular
if you are not sure you need ionic consider just using cordova or phonegap to wrap your app for mobile
i managed to switch one of my apps from angular 2 to ionic 2 before and it was really simple

44994572
super	implements
the super object implements a __getattribute__ hook that implements specific attribute behaviour
the documentation tells you that the rules for attribute lookups are the same as for getattr but with the documented mro skip but that does not mean that super returns an ancestor class

44997539
sudo	passwd
1 request passwd using getpass module which essentially hides input by user and then run sudo command in python
2 note for above methods the field where you enter the passwd may not appear in the ipython notebook

45001263
erlang	elixir
the error means that erlang could not find a module named elixir.io
this module is part of core elixir

45001342
super	self
one thing they do not cover at least not explicity from your question is this point however if you comment out the call to super in b s init function neither a nor c s init function is called
to understand that change jacob s code to to print the stack on a s init as below it is a bit surprising to see that b s line super b self .__init__ is actually calling c.__init__ as c is not a baseclass of b

45001342
super	self
to understand that change jacob s code to to print the stack on a s init as below it is a bit surprising to see that b s line super b self .__init__ is actually calling c.__init__ as c is not a baseclass of b
this happens because super b self is not calling the b s baseclass version of __init__

45001342
super	self
this happens because super b self is not calling the b s baseclass version of __init__
instead it is calling __init__ on the first class to the right of b that is present on self s __mro__ and that has such an attribute

45005887
ionic	angular
html5 form validation does not work in ionic
instead you can use angular forms

45009834
serializable	deserialization
the exception message deserialized object with reference id i53 not found in stream can get thrown when you enable the data contract serializable s object reference preservation functionality
it indicates that during deserialization a reference to an undefined object was encountered and so cannot be deserialized

45012375
factors	matrix
should be the way and if we don t need factors class then
creating a data.frame is better done with data.frame call alone and not by converting to matrix with cbind and then converting to data.frame

45014101
mockito	jmockit
you can try to use that experimental feature in mockito 2 that allows mocking final methods
if that doesn t work for you powermock ito or jmockit most likely would do the job

45014949
sudo	passwd
and enabling such transaction by editing or rather adding a permitting line to the sudoers by first calling sudo visudo and adding the following line to the very end of it all i wanted to do was to copy a file and i have been having problems with doing so because of the root passwd problem and as you mentioned i did not want to expose the system to have no passwd for all root transactions
if you are having a small script that you need to run i simply needed to copy a file i found it much easier to call the commands on the php script by calling exec sudo cp tmp testfile1 var www html testfile2

45017157
icmp	udp
in udp the only way an unreachable host would cause socket errors is if the network sends back an icmp packet to indicate the host is not reachable
a connected udp socket will receive such packets internally and start reporting failures on subsequent reads sends with the same peer

45020525
inline	constexpr
as you pointed out c++17 introduces inline class member variables and static constexpr variables automatically qualify
you are not allowed to redeclare inline variables outside the class as you saw in your second example but an exception was made for constexpr because previously you were allowed and in fact required to do so but the syntax is deprecated

45020581
tensorflow	cudnn
tensorflow versions 1.2 and later are compatible with python 3.6
the error message points to the actual problem importerror libcudnn.so.5 cannot open shared object file no such file or directory this implies two things you have installed the tensorflow-gpu package which requires a cuda-capable gpu and a working installation of cuda and cudnn

45022626
tensorflow	tensorboard
this error message has been replaced with a more informative message in the nightly version of tensorflow
the error and the stack trace suggests that this session.run call is failing source looking at the implementation it appears that this is only called when the tensorboard callback is installed and self.validation_data is not none

45027103
serializable	deserialization
output of serializable is binary string which can contain null bytes eg x00
deserialization fails because of you are passing string trimmed of that null bytes so string size of fqcn doesn t match

45027292
aggregate-functions	sum
to correct you need to do one of the following include all non-aggregated expressions listed in select clause in the group by clause remove group aggregate-functions from select clause
if you do groping by virtue of including group by clause any expression in select which is not group function or aggregate-functions or aggregated column such as count avg min max sum and so on list of aggregate functions should be present in group by clause

45028899
strcpy	strdup
allocate memory to pointer x i.e store the returned pointer via memory allocator methods to x then this will be writable and copy the string literal using strcpy
or not strictly standard conforming but shorter strdup

45033968
gridbaglayout	miglayout
there is gridbaglayout in standard library but it is not so easy to understand
i suggest miglayout

45034877
profiling	debugging
for a more in-depth analysis you can use the solver profiling this will give you detailed information as to which components are causing solver resets
such behavior can be difficult to debugging if you re not used to the tool

45035159
profiling	debugging
using the profiling you figure out that there are insert instruction in businesshistory when it should not be any of them
using the debugging you will eventually end in the an insert trigger your are not supposed to be in

45035843
hex	binary
if you view that result in ascii instead of hex you get the token in quotes is hex 0x10 one of the characters you re trying to send. so your serial reception is working fine - you just aren t getting the results you expected
it looks like the other system is at a textual prompt and is not expecting the binary packet you re sending

45041776
super	implements
in a nutshell because javascript isn t a strongly typed language like java you can t get the super granular autocompletion like you get in java unless the developer has included comments that webstorm or any ide can interpret
you can implements those comments using google closure annotation or jsdoc3

45041868
swift	objective-c
this way if there is some feature that does not cross swift to objective-c boundary well it will be discovered as early as possible
your remarks about issues are generally correct with one small exception optionals are not missing from objective-c they appear as nullable nonnull modifiers on variables and method parameters

45044893
persian	farsi
different notation from arabic kaf u+06cc farsi yeh a different notation from the arabic yeh u+200c zero-width-non-joiner so the resulting regexp would be see also the exemplar characters for persian listed here
the named blocks e.g p arabic cover the entire arabic script not just the persian characters

45048317
calloc	malloc
if your compiler supports variable length array c99 extensions the problem becomes simply a matter of declaring the two vlas and letting the compiler handle the work if it doesn t you can always dynamically allocate storage for each of the halfs and if you choose calloc over malloc then your storage is initialized to all zeros providing a nul-byte at the end of each half either way is fine depending on what your compiler supports
you are free to use malloc and affirmatively nul-terminate as was done in the vla example

45049789
lxml	beautifulsoup
if you omit that second argument then the beautifulsoup package just uses the default which is lxml in most cases
to your last question i m not entirely sure but i think there is no fundamental difference between invoking f.read first or having beautifulsoup do that implicitly but that would not always work and is bad practice

45054575
subtraction	addition
for example if reduce is executed in parallel on 6 threads and then the intermediate results are combined you can get a different result 0 - 1 0 - 2 0 - 3 0 - 4 0 - 5 0 - 6 -1 -2 -3 -4 -5 -6 -1 - -2 -3 - -4 -5 - -6 1 1 1 1 - 1 0 - 1 -1 or to make a long example short therefore subtraction is not associative
on the other hand a+b doesn t cause the same problem since addition is an associative operator

45057089
swift	objective-c
let s say you have swift rest service which uses generics
i m using moya framework and that s how my service looks like it s inherited from base service using generics so i can not use it directly in my objective-c code

45057620
gradle	ivy
mavenlocal actually adds your .m2 to your gradle repositories
gradle has its own ivy cache and probably when you migrated the project or had a different project that used some common dependencies its actually faster as all the dependencies been downloaded already before therefore adding maven local repo to gradle repositories makes the fresh project faster as it doesn t need to download them again to its local cache

45057620
gradle	ivy
gradle has its own ivy cache and probably when you migrated the project or had a different project that used some common dependencies its actually faster as all the dependencies been downloaded already before therefore adding maven local repo to gradle repositories makes the fresh project faster as it doesn t need to download them again to its local cache
i would personally have it there as i have some maven and some gradle projects and yes it speeds up the build and it doesn t use as much space to store duplicated dependencies for multiple projects

45058040
qfile	qtextstream
the problem is not that qfile stops reading at nul 0 not the null macro but rather that qtextstream considers a nul to mean end-of-string and thus stops append ing after the first nul it encounters
here is a previous thread on another site discussing something very similar with a suggested alternative which boils down to this you need to replace the nul s before feeding them into the qtextstream as it will not pass them through

45058112
cpython	pypy
in cpython integers are real objects though small value integers are taken from a cache pool rather than created anew
i m not sure what the other implementations pypy and jython do

45063288
division	multiplication
a single instruction might be good for code density when you re optimizing for size and worried about a call to a library function evicting other instructions from your cache but division is a slow enough operation that this usually doesn t matter
in fact division is so slow that compilers try very hard not to use it whenever possible they will do multiplication by the reciprocal which is significantly faster

45063288
division	multiplication
in fact division is so slow that compilers try very hard not to use it whenever possible they will do multiplication by the reciprocal which is significantly faster
and if you re really needing to do multiplication quickly you should look into parallelizing them with simd instructions which all have intrinsics available

45064006
udp	tcp
the browser doesn t have any api s that let you create udp sockets
in fact it doesn t even allow you to create tcp sockets and communicate using arbitrary protocols

45065362
entity-relationship	diagram
in true entity-relationship entity-relationship modeling diagramming methods a diamond is an association relationship type a box is an entity type a line is a participation fk and every box entity diamond relationship type gets a table
your schema does not reflect your diagram

45069417
prng	random
this alone is a good reason not to seed a prng using std random_device since the bytes produced may be deterministic
it unfortunately doesn t provide an api to find out when this happens or to request failure instead of low-quality random numbers

45069417
prng	random
however i would avoid this if possible since various compilers most notably mingw implement it with as a prng in fact producing the same sequence every time to alert humans that it s not properly random
seeding now that we have our pieces with minimal overhead we can generate the desired bits of random entropy to seed our prng

45069423
serializable	deserialization
if that s the case and you cannot modify the receiving code you will need to serializable the message with datacontractserializer on .net core you ll need the nuget package system.runtime.serialization.xml
as far as i know that s the default deserialization method for the full .net framework library

sudo	passwd
open new session otherwise you might simply not be asked for your sudo passwd because it has not timed out stop nginx confirm that nginx has stopped by checking your website or running ps aux | grep nginx start nginx confirm that nginx has started by checking your website or running ps aux | grep nginx ps make sure to use sudo usr sbin service nginx start|restart|stop and not sudo service nginx start|restart|stop
there is a better answer on stack overflow that does not involve writing a custom script the best practice is to use etc sudoers.d myuser the etc sudoers.d folder can contain multiple files that allow users to call stuff using sudo without being root

45071759
sudo	passwd
there is a better answer on stack overflow that does not involve writing a custom script the best practice is to use etc sudoers.d myuser the etc sudoers.d folder can contain multiple files that allow users to call stuff using sudo without being root
the file usually contains a user and a list of commands that the user can run without having to specify a passwd

45071873
sudo	passwd
i am pretty sure it does nothing other than display the passwd as sudo apparently through an appropriate entry in etc sudoers works without you having to give a passwd
what you write to terminal with echo does not get passed to any other process. generally speaking you can use sudo -s to make sudo expect the passwd on stdin

45072668
sudo	passwd
once you break your etc sudoers you won t be able to use sudo including using sudo to fix etc sudoers
is there anyway to have the script enter the passwd putting passwd in script is not a good idea

45081016
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome is somewhat at fault here as it should use the credentials mode of the request as part of the caching key so a non-credentialed request such as those sent by fetch shouldn t match items in the cache that were requested with credentials
i think there are other browsers that behave like google-chrome here but firefox doesn t

45082115
multiplying	multiplication
the next best thing is probably to just multiplying the output of an average pooling by 4
element-wise multiplication is fast enough not to worry about this added step

45085100
multiplying	subtract
the problem is that you are multiplying the htmlelement it self and not its value
so add .value after radius like so unfortunately this will return a string and not a number so to convert it to a number you could either wrap it in a parseint or force it to turn into a number subtract it by 0

45088905
ssl	https
as the setup worked without ssl a scope related issue might not result in 403 error
instead connectivity from client application server to idp server over the idp https port can be tested first can use telnet

45089117
udp	tcp
if you look up the tproxy service for udp sockets in your service database getent services tproxy udp you get no output because tproxy is not an udp service
if you look at all tproxy services regardless of the protocol getent services | grep -e tproxy you ll see tproxy 8081 tcp which means that tproxy service is only defined for tcp protocol

45089117
udp	tcp
this means that if you ask getaddrinfo for an udp socket for service 8081 you will not find anything because tproxy is only defined for tcp and not udp
compare to the case where you ask for and udp socket for xmpp-client service

45089708
onclick	onsubmit
onclick always fires when clicking the submit button even if all fields aren t correct
simply remove the onclick and add onsubmit to the form tag onsubmit only fires once the form is submitted which won t happen if a required input isn t filled in

45091197
noexcept	throw
whether the move assignment operator is noexcept or not is a static property of the operator
and since pmrs cannot know until runtime whether they can propagate storage the container must designate its move assignment operator as a throw move assignment

45091439
dictionary	map
you can for instance define a dictionary and then perform a mapping like or by using map .. in python-3.x this works as a generator thus lazily this will insert none s in case the element in clr is not in the dictionary
this will thus add i to the clr list if it is not in the dictionary

45091754
swift	objective-c
well the second of your two methods can be written this is a lot less complex doesn t read random memory and is easier to convert to swift
following the same approach here is your first method in swift finally you can index the data type in swift lust like an array so the above objective-c line where bytes came from calling nsdata s bytes can be written directly in swift as where data is the data value

45094079
google-chrome	safari
this returns the urls for google-chrome tell application google-chrome to url of tabs of window 1 whose title contains youtube this applescript code will play or paue any youtube video which is loaded in the active tab of a safari browser window this will return the urls of the youtube windows with the videos tell application safari to url of tabs of window 1 whose name contains youtube similar post with xcode example
this applescript code will play or paue any youtube video which is loaded in any google-chrome tab whether the browser is visible or not and whether the tab is visible or not

45096675
postgresql	mysql
why doesn t it work in postgresql -- because the people running postgresql know what they re doing
just kidding but that question would be highly speculative for me without seeing the oracle vs mysql source

45099161
equals	gethashcode
because person does not override equals object obj sequenceequal will perform the default reference equality check when comparing any two person objects and you probably want value equality semantics
to fix this at least override bool equals object obj and int gethashcode it is consider a good practice to also implement if you can t modify person then you can define your own and hand that down to sequenceequals so it can perfom equality checks other than the default reference equality

45107749
n-gram	words
the prediction that occurs during training is sparse and much more efficient - just running enough of the model to nudge it to be better at a single example. if word-prediction is your real goal you may get better results from other methods including just calculating a big lookup-table of how-often words appear near each-other or near other n-gram
while the word2vec algorithm trains word-vectors by trying to predict words and then those word-vectors may be useful for other purposes it is not likely to be the ideal algorithm if word-prediction is your real goal

45109678
mp3	flac
it does not seek correctly in certain mp3 files
as joey mentions the original android class which can be accessed by jnius works better and with most songfiles you throw at it mp3 mp4 flac waves etc. i made two working classes one for android which uses jnius and one for windows of course the android class does not work here

45109934
ienumerable	icollection
that can t happen with ienumerable
you need to use icollection instead also it s not required and some may argue not a good idea anyways but these properties will need the virtual keyword if you intend to employ lazy-loading

45114487
factors	mean
7 or maybe even 6 would be fine too your unroll factors doesn t have to be a power of 2
unrolling by exactly 5 would mean that you re also right at the bottleneck for dependency chains

45115475
google-chrome	firefox
this works in google-chrome but doesn t work in firefox
it appears as if firefox is ignoring the initial transform on the object and transitioning from 0 0 instead

45116418
persistent	transient
but there are some things in your mapping that do not make sense in the role entity the following doesn t make sense because you are using joincolumn even if you do not have any relationship annotation onetoone or manytoone in this case i don t know how the persistent provider has to act
in the auth entity you have the following mapping on one side you re telling the provider that the field should not be persisted transient and on the other hand you tell it to persist column annotation

45118015
move	drag
this allows you to follow the dragged input when it move of the element and page
if you do not do this the drag can get locked if the user drag of the element page and releases the mouse button

45118176
build.gradle	gradlew
modify build.gradle project where it says something like this to this the number in my example 0.9.3 is the latest version of gradle-experimental to be found here
eventually change your gradlew version in gradle-wrapper.properties to the version recommended by android studio if you did not already

45121680
dictionary	map
however what you need j to be in this example is a valid key of the dictionary map
edit that is - of course - assuming that you did not use 0-based incremented integers as the key of map in which cause you might as well have gone with a list

45123704
spaces	delimiter
consider this approach code demo output no values found in string. values found in 1st values found in 2nd values found in 3rd values found in 3rd 4th values found in 1st 2nd values found in 3rd 4th 5th values found in 4th 5th string is full of values. my 3 nested array functions perform like this split the string on each spaces this assumes your values will not contain a space.
if this is not true you should change your value delimiter

45123869
postgresql	mysql
perhaps see also selecting columns whose name matches a regular expression in postgresql and how to have dynamic sql in mysql stored procedure
can t add this as a comment due to not enough rep but perhaps you can do something similar to what fred -ii- was alluding to by getting the column names from the information schema columns table then executed a prepared statement which i think is roughly the mysql equivalent of dynamic sql but i m not certain to create a query that will get you a query result with only those image columns selected

45125579
implements	extends
and here is the same example based on your own code now when i call x.list i expected it to return an because it extends which implements that method but instead i will be getting back an array that will contain an element of type bar which doesn t implements all the functionality i d expect from barplus
t extends foo that means a value of type t is assignable to variable of type foo

45126946
ionic	angular
ionic uses angular under the covers but doesn t use router rather a navigation controller - which just got changed around again to something else
if you need more details i learnt about this stuff in angular university in their rxjs and reactive patterns angular architecture course

45133350
implements	extends
how can you extends it implements onfocus listening and declare onkeyboardshown declare onkeyboardhidden i think that recalculating of screen height is not 100 successfully as mentioned before. to be clear overriding of onkeypreime is not called on hide soft keyboard programatically methods but if you are doing it anywhere you should do onkeyboardhidden logic there and do not create a comprehensive solutions
if you can try to extends edittext and override onkeypreime method

45133529
udp	tcp
if reliability and ordering is important in your scenario you probably should be using tcp and not udp
if the only thing you care about is ordering then udp may still work for you

45137707
build.gradle	gradlew
normally the dependencies would include compile com.android.support appcompat-v7 25.3.1 this line does 3 things it allows your code to use classes and methods in that library it compiles those classes and methods into the library output aar file this means that anyone using your library has access to them without declaring them in the app s build.gradle file the second point is where conflicts can come in
my preferred way is to include the external dependencies into the library module using the provided keyword like this provided com.android.support appcompat-v7 25.3.1 this is slightly different to the above it allows your code to use the classes and methods as above it does not compile the classes into the library output aar file it tells the library s user developer that the classes must be provided in the app s build gradlew file this means that anyone using your library does not have access to the classes without adding the dependency themselves in the app s build.gradle the nice part of this is that the developer using your library can depend on any compatible version of the external framework they want in your case they would include the following in their app s build.gradle compile com.android.support appcompat-v7 26.0.0 some extra links android developer docs on build dependencies gradlew dependencies difference.

45139905
setinterval	settimeout
you need to make an initial settimeout with the difference between the current ms and the next ms ie 1000- new date .getmilliseconds then you can start the setinterval note that settimeout setinterval has a minimum value generally considered 10ms so if it s less than that value to the next second add 1000
also note that settimeout setinterval are not 100 accurate but for the nearest second will likely suffice

45140948
google-chrome	firefox
- google-chrome re-offers with active because that s what the spec says or at least how we interpreted it for a long time - firefox offers with active but with the same dtls fingerprint
google-chrome doesn t like this

45141128
hex	binary
you as the developer decide if the program should output the number in some other representation like hex octal or binary . so if you want you numbers to be outputted in the same representation as they have been entered then you have to provide some information at runtime. the language itself does not support this requirement
java as any other programming language uses an internal number representation which is on base 2 binary

45147067
google-chrome	safari
if i instead first make an ajax request to a url with basic auth headers added and then redirect document.location without the username pass in the url then it worked better for me example unfortunate caveat with safari only if you type your username and password incorrectly then it makes another standard http basic auth popup but this is better than a big red phishing warning that occurs when you make the document.location include username pass google-chrome doesn t have duplicate popup if login credentials are incorrect though
the method of explicitly redirecting document.location with username password in url caused me some problems with safari giving a phishing warning

45155544
keras	tensorflow
the loss used in the code is found here the keras code peforms some pre-processing before calling the ctc_loss that makes it suitable for the format required
on top of requiring the input to be not softmax-ed tensorflow s ctc_loss also expects the dims to be num_time batchsize features

45158355
client-side	server-side
you should handle sensitive personal data from the server-side and not the client-side
this involves server-side encryption and handling requests with ssl exchanges

45159933
ionic	angular
you d need to put all the code that interacts with the tabs in the ngafterviewinit lifecycle hook if you just want to use ionic custom lifecycle events you d need to use the ionviewdidenter hook
just like you can see in angular docs viewchild is set after the view has been initialized and viewchild is updated after the view has been checked so the issue on your code is that the view has not been initialized when the constructor is executed

45161065
debian	linux
don t use it on debian style linux
to clarify it more python-opencv is debian package recommended contains video support opencv-python is external project not recommended integrated opencv lacks video support so for debian .. we have these possibilities install from debian packages sudo aptitude install libopencv-dev python-opencv # usr lib python2.7 dist-packages cv2.x86_64-linux-gnu.so sudo aptitude purge libopencv-dev python-opencv # uninstall install from sources github.com opencv opencv video support by default for details see with_ffmpeg flag for cmake opencv-python project no need to use it

45161918
wildfly	jboss
the one you have selected is for jboss 4.0.x and will not work at all with wildfly
if you re building with maven then you would include the following dependency in your client application being the war project but since you don t appear to be using maven the alternative is to add the jboss-client.jar that you will find in the bin client directory of your wildfly installation

45165391
profiling	debugging
currently the emulator does not provide any options to pass along entities and channeldata with request such as user profiling and contextual information as explained here
you should be able to debugging your cortana skill by using ngrok to create a tunneling to your localhost bot

45169760
ssl	https
when using https aka http over tls ssl the choice of certificates sizes types alogorithms etc and cipher suite selections will impact your ability to connect to that https connector
note that https is tls not ssl and jetty can use the alpn extensions to tls which allow the client to negotiate the next protocol to actually use be it http 1.x or http 2 or whatever your configured next protocol list is here s a few examples of multiple connectors in embedded jetty

45173679
keras	tensorflow
this is rather obvious when one ponders the number of alternative higher level apis built on top of tensorflow such as keras 2 now part of the official tensorflow api slim in tf.contrib.slim tflearn tensorlayer and the likes
finally if i may add an advice if you are beginning with tensorflow and do not have a preference towards a particular api i would personnally encourage you to stick to the api its api is friendly and at least as good as the other high-level apis built on top of the low-level tensorflow api it has a clear namespace within tensorflow although it can -- and sometimes should -- be used with parts from other namespaces such as tf.data it is now a first-class citizen of tensorflow it used to be in tf.contrib.keras and care is taken to make new tensorflow features such as eager compatible with keras

45174069
queue	fifo
secondly it sounds like you might have a workflow around tasks that could extend to more than just a single queue for agents to pick them up
if so you might want to look at simple workflow service or since you are already on microsoft s stack you can look at windows workflow btw sqs does not guarantee only one delivery by default so if duplication is a big problem for you then you will either have to do your own deduplication or use fifo queues which support deduplication but are limited to 300 transactions second aka roughly 100 messages second accounting for the standard send - receive - delete apis

45174848
equals	compareto
they can collide even though the objects are not equals
this means that your compareto method can return 0 when the objects are not equals

45178742
alloca	malloc
this is easy basically just replace malloc with alloca and don t attempt to wrap alloca into another function
however alloca is not a standard function

45185600
gif	png
for images the type is image and there are several subtypes gif jpeg png etc
a correct mime type for an image file looks like image jpeg or image png and not just image

45186615
serializable	deserialization
since asp.net reference source is available we can drill state serializable down to this class altserialization it shows that the following types are natively supported string int32 boolean datetime decimal byte char single double sbyte int16 int64 uint16 uint32 uint64 timespan guid intptr uintptr null not really a type - for all other types the system uses a binaryformatter which is a public .net class. binaryformatter is very easy to use it knows many classes by default so you can do simple benchmarks comparing what binaryformatter will produce versus what you can yourself manually
in general you will always be able to beat binaryformatter s performance because you know your data better but it means you ll have to write additional serializable deserialization code

45186806
prepare	execute
so your first query should look like and your table name should be checked against a white-list if it comes from an unknown source as you cannot prepare a table name
you misunderstand how execute works you need to prepare a statement and then you pass an array with the placeholders values as the parameter

45191689
portrait	landscape
when sitting in portrait mode you will not notice anything because it is 1 1 scale
now you flip it to landscape

45201229
linefeed	delimiter
another potential problem is that since linefeed qualifies as an ifs whitespace character as defined earlier all empty fields will be lost just as in #2 and #3
this would of course not be a problem if the delimiter happens to be a non- ifs whitespace character and depending on the application it may not matter anyway but it does vitiate the generality of the solution

45201229
linefeed	delimiter
we can almost solve this with the manual dummy-terminator trick the problem here is that readarray preserved the trailing field since the redirection operator appended the linefeed to the input string and therefore the trailing field was not empty otherwise it would ve been dropped
we can take care of this by explicitly unsetting the final array element after-the-fact the only two problems that remain which are actually related are 1 the extraneous whitespace that needs to be trimmed and 2 the lack of support for multicharacter delimiter

45207275
fgets	getchar
mixing functions like fgets scanf and getchar is error-prone
the scanf function usually leaves a n character behind in the input stream while fgets usually does not meaning that the next call to an i o function may or may not need to cope with what the previous call has left in the input stream

45209091
jmeter	soapui
soapui proxy configuration lives under file - preferences - proxy settings another option is using taurus tool to convert soapui xml project into jmeter .jmx test script see soapui support and how to convert soapui xml to jmeter jmx articles for more details
itself jmeter cannot however you can record soapui execution through jmeter s http s test script recorder

45211756
serializable	deserialization
therefore sensitive information that should not be serializable can be marked as transient and gson will not serializable to json
gson also provides finer serialisation and deserialization control and filtration

45222492
multiplying	multiplication
conversion between logarithm bases is equivalent to multiplying by some constant
constant multiplication does not affect big o complexity class

45223954
super	self
if you don t want to support speechless people then you can do this but then the parameter can be misleading so you can omit that from this point the parent and child has different constructor parameters which is usually not a problem class person animal def __init__ self name super .__init__ name true
first you should always use the built-in function super and call parent s __init__ unless you are really sure you don t want to do that

45226348
erlang	scheme
i m not sure about erlang
in scheme you could write your code this way some from srfi-1 also called ormap in some dialects define struggle input solutions some lambda f f input solutions it seems javascript got array.prototype.some and erlang has lists any 2 but both are flawed by that they don t return the truthy value but only true so you only get to know if it found an answer and not what the answer was

45226348
erlang	scheme
in scheme you could write your code this way some from srfi-1 also called ormap in some dialects define struggle input solutions some lambda f f input solutions it seems javascript got array.prototype.some and erlang has lists any 2 but both are flawed by that they don t return the truthy value but only true so you only get to know if it found an answer and not what the answer was
in js it s simple to make a version of some that works the same as scheme

45236481
interpolation	splines
if the curve doesn t need to be smooth there is the simpler approx which does linear interpolation
a standard approach is to fit a splines this gives a nice curve that goeas through all points

45238393
comparator	comparable
and you could also replace that max date comparator with max comparator.naturalorder since date is already comparable
it s interesting that you already use a method reference in but failed to see this one max date comparator also you are obviously returning a date but from an you should get a warning if using idea that it s not safe to call get directly on an optional

45238502
express	node.js
in fact it is used together so often that even a special term was coined for that the mean stack it stands for mongo + express + angular + node see another popular stack is the mern stack mongo + express + react + node see there s a nice article on the mongodb website introducing the mean and mern stacks that compares those two stacks
why couldn t we use node.js and nosql like mogodb in the application you could

45238992
ssl	https
you cannot control the tls ssl configuration on the server in azure app service
note enabling https or implementing encryption doesn t warranty a fool-proof solution

45239416
required	placeholder
unfortunately this required a language feature called opening existentials which currently isn t directly available to users
however swift does implicitly open existentials when accessing members on a protocol-typed instance or metatype i.e it digs out the runtime type and makes it accessible in the form of a generic placeholder

45240995
bash	zsh
so with bash a reliable way of removing a utf-8 bom from the beginning of a text file would be this will leave the file unchanged if it does not start with a utf-8 bom and otherwise remove the bom
if you are using some other shell you might find that produces the bom character that works with zsh as well as any shell without a printf builtin provided that usr bin printf is the gnu version but if you want a posix-compatible version you could use the -i in-place edit flag is also a gnu extension

45245832
hex	binary
the hex file has a checksum on each line
the binary may not have any checks

45246516
ssl	https
ced-b s suggestion is wise but i do not think your problem will be solved using a timeout because the real issue is most likely with ssl tls
github is an https website

45247879
stateless	stateful
stateless function components do not have a lifecycle as that would be nonsensical
the react lifecycle is inherently stateful

45250170
decoder	encoder
for each output y i of the decoder network a context vector c i is computed as a weighted sum of the encoder hidden states h 1 ... h t c i α i1 h 1 +...+α it h t the number of time steps t may be different for each sample because the coefficients α ij are not vector of fixed size
in fact they are computed by softmax e i1 ... e it where each e ij is the output of a neural network whose input is the encoder hidden state h j and the decoder hidden state s i-1 e ij f s i-1 h j thus before y i is computed this neural network must be evaluated t times producing t weights α i1 ... α it

45250410
comparator	comparable
comparable can only ever be implemented on the original class and so there can only ever be one implementation for it unless you override comparator using a subclass
meanwhile comparator is not required to be implemented on the original class so there can be many implementations

45251489
multiplying	subtraction
the general formula for generating a random number from 0 to b is this because random.random generates a number in the range so multiplying that by b yields numbers between
now if you don t want to start the resulting range at 0 but at a you do can attempt to write but that yields numbers between which is not what you want that s why we do the subtraction too going step by step in your case and

45255249
decimal	ieee
many decimal numbers cannot be represented exactly in this representation
so the compiler uses the nearest available binary ieee floating point number that is available

45260863
rational-numbers	fractions
idris does not have a built-in type for rational-numbers
the error message you are seeing means that the function which is a method of the fractions interface requires that its arguments be of a type that implements that interface

45262758
qtableview	qtablewidget
i highly recommend you use qtableview not qtablewidget
qtableview is based on model-view programming

45267539
opcache	apc
enabling php7 opcache reference pecl extension
php 7 has a built-in opcache apc is deprecated and will not work

45268848
config	ini
should be path from php.ini if the settings don t match what you set i assumed you restarted apache check the rest of the php.ini as well as apache virtualhost config for another setting that may be overriding yours
when you run phpinfo it will sometimes show a list of ini files that get loaded not just your basic php.ini

45278432
comparator	comparable
so you ll need a vehiclecomparator not a datetime comparator then collections.sort vehicles new vehiclecomparator
update also you don t need a comparator and a comparable

45279059
uiview	calayer
supports animation of all animatable properties of uiview except frame and center
changing these properties or their corresponding calayer version including position is not supported. note that the view behaves as if clipstobounds is set to yes regardless of its actual value

45281443
postgresql	mysql
from the other hand in contrast to some relation databases like mysql postgresql fully acid compliant. in short postgresql is a good choice in the case of highly structured data coming in a table-like form and requiring more complex data types such as arrays
and last but not the least postgresql is free and and open-source software developed by an international team consisting of several companies as well as of individual contributors

45282718
ionic	angular
that being said i also used some angular lifecycle hooks on pages like the ngondestroy i used it to remove all the subscriptions from a page when that page is going to be destroyed but just like you said ionviewwillunload seems to be the right way to do it if we want to use ionic s lifecycle hooks
i guess that most of the ionic lifecycle hooks are more related to the way the user interacts with the page as a whole will enter to a page will leave from a page can enter to a page can leave from a page... and angular lifecycle hooks are more related to the different stages of the life of a single component the inputs has been initialized the change detector has checked if there were changes in this component ... which as you can see may not be directly related to the user interaction at all and usually are things that the user is not aware of

45286461
viewdidload	viewwillappear	viewdidload	viewdidappear
think about what viewdidload viewwillappear and viewdidappear mean
viewdidload means that the view controller has a view but that view is not yet part of the interface

45286461
viewdidload	viewwillappear
viewdidload means that the view controller has a view but that view is not yet part of the interface
viewwillappear means that the view controller s view will become part of the interface but hasn t yet

45288331
ionic	angular
however the current at the time of writing this answer version of ionic is using angular 4.1.3 which uses httpmodule which does not yet implement interceptors natively
the next version of angular 4.3.1 uses httpclientmodule which does have interecptors

45293558
exponent	modulo
here are the explanations for these two properties first for rsa to work the public exponent must be coprime with the cardinal number of the set of integers between 1 and the modulo that are coprime with the modulo see rsa algorithm to understand why
so choosing a prime number is a good way to have a chance for this number to be coprime with the cardinal number of the set described above this is why people choose prime numbers as public exponents most of the time and if it is not the case they compute a new modulo instead of changing the public exponent

45293558
exponent	modulo
so choosing a primes is a good way to have a chance for this number to be coprime with the cardinal number of the set described above this is why people choose primes as public exponent most of the time and if it is not the case they compute a new modulo instead of changing the public exponent
since the cardinal number of the set described above is even you can not choose 2 if the modulo is the product of primes p and q this set has p-1 q-1 elements that is obviously an even number

45299142
ssl	https
is always empty but returns https when i am on https page this tells you that your ssl is managed by a front-end proxy server not your application server
your application server does not appear to have an ssl cert installed and is most probably serving a plain http request over port 80 to the proxy server

45299142
ssl	https
your application server does not appear to have an ssl cert installed and is most probably serving a plain http request over port 80 to the proxy server
the proxy server then serves a secure https response back to the client so the clients request is secure

45301618
vfork	posix
a safe and modern posix replacement for the typical usecase of a vfork directly followed by a is posix_spawn
all in all you really shouldn t use vfork

hash-collision	key
lookdict will use key s hash value to locate the key iterating over a list of possible key with identical hash value comparing first by address then by calling key s equivalence operator s see excellent comments in objects dictobject.c for more details on hash-collision resolution in python s implementation of open addressing
since every float nan has the same hash value yet each one is a different object with a different identity memory address and they re not equal by their float-value when you say lookdict will search for the second nan by looking at its hash 0 then trying to resolve hash-collision by iterating over key with the same hash and comparing the key by identity address they are different then by invoking the expensive pyobject_richcomparebool do_richcompare which in turn calls float_richcompare which compares floats just as c does which behaves according to ieee 754 standard from gnu c library docs 20.5.2 infinity and nan ... the basic operations and math functions all accept infinity and nan and produce sensible output

rdf	owl
from an axiom like a builds only b c you end up with rdf like this so your query would be you can clean that up a little bit with more property paths owl isn t the same as rdf
sparql is an rdf query language

45306814
rdf	owl
sparql is an rdf query language
owl can be serialized as rdf but the serialization isn t always all that pretty so sparql isn t necessarily the best way to query owl even though owl can be serialized to rdf

45309903
build.gradle	gradlew
there were these 3 lines in my main build.gradle in this project the variables are assigned in gradle.properties file not in build.gradle files so they re already accessible in all module gradlew files and the lines above create a circular reference
i m no expert on gradlew that s just a guess i think they were added by the kotlin plugin at some point the configure kotlin in project option and the automated edit messed up our complicated configs

45310998
google-chrome	firefox
speaking only from my observations and investigation google-chrome does not support the image png type and this is not a format that is required by the clipboard api spec
google-chrome bug . firefox will at least attempt to put a datatransferitem with the image png type on the clipboard but i haven t yet figured out what data format to use

45314523
prepare	execute
if the driver is capable of using prepare statements if it doesn t require emulation then the final query execute is the prepare statement
if you want to find out what was execute you need to turn on the general query log on your server

45316284
ssl	https
you can check it with any ssl checker
it doesn t enter as https as default it goes for http you need to add a rewrite rule to force visitors to be redirected from http to https unable to communicate securely with peer requested domain name does not match the server s certificate

45316412
prepare	execute
this usage of the prepare function also is not safe each variable should be a placeholder
to execute you need to use the execute function

45320055
vfork	posix
vfork isn t supposed to do any of the copying and therefore doing anything other than calling _exit or one of the functions in a child created by vfork is undefined behavior
this is a huge source of bugs and was later removed again from the posix standard so you should not use vfork in a modern program

45321332
implements	extends
since the original tensorboard callback does not support this implements a new callback seems inevitable
since it will take up a lot of page space to re-write the entire tensorboard callback here i ll just extends the original tensorboard and write out the parts that are different which is already quite lengthy

45325117
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
this implies that does not retrieve adam s entry and yields the user names in a case-sensitive alphabetic order
you need a case-insensitive collation in order to have the opposite results

45329775
build.gradle	gradlew
try this in the app s build.gradle file in the android block along with this in your gradle.properties file since you only have 8 gb of ram you should not try and dedicate 8 gb to gradlew like you tried to earlier
i have 16 gb of ram and i use 4-5 gb for gradlew and builds are quite fast

45331240
apache	nginx
i will describe the simple apache setup but it should be as easy to configure it using nginx or haproxy
for example purposes let s sat that you have 3 services running on the server jenkins on port 8080 sonarqube on port 9000 rundeck on port 4440 first in order to distinguish between services just by using domain name you will need to create several entries in your dns pointing the names to the server ip address jenkins.example.com a 192.0.2.2 sonar.example.com a 192.0.2.2 rundeck.example.com a 192.0.2.2 next if you have not already done that install apache http server yum install httpd create a file etc httpd conf.d proxy.conf the logic should be quite clear for detailed explanation look at the docs after that just start the httpd service service httpd start

45333842
firefox	safari
it is not possible for firefox to draw scrollbars when the size of the element height is smaller than 34 pixels
i ve tried safari and chrome for macos and they also don t show the scrollbar in the example you posted

45335083
base	fractions
if python were to print the true decimal value of the binary approximation stored for 0.1 it would have to display more specifically about small representation errors representation error refers to the fact that some most actually decimal fractions cannot be represented exactly as binary base 2 fractions
1 10 and 2 10 are not exactly representable as a binary fractions

45335131
memcpy	malloc
assuming this is actually c it would be better style to write this as either or using structure assignment instead of memcpy is the same as dev_probconfig + i but it is clearer precisely because of this trickiness of pointer arithmetic
also do not cast the result of a malloc -like function in c

45335709
keras	tensorboard	tensorflow	tensorboard
so step 1 - get your model predictions for the test set step 2a - build a metadata file with the real labels of the test set step 2b - get the sprite image mnist_10k_sprite.png as provided by the tensorflow guys here and place it in your log_dir step 3 - write some tensorflow code then running tensorboard in your log_dir and selecting color by label here is what you get modifying this in order to get predictions for other layers is straightforward although in this case the keras functional api may be a better choice
so i conclude that what you actually want it s not completely clear from your post is to visualize the predictions of your model in a manner similar to this tensorboard demo

45338990
tiff	png
note i haven t tested this with png but it works with tiff files
this happens because pil does not support 16-bit data explained here i use a work around using the osgeo gdal package which can read png

45340271
bluestacks	android-emulator
2 if your host machine laptop doesn t have more ram then you might want to find alternative android-emulator like genymotion bluestacks which takes less memory than android-emulator
genymotion bluestack here is the picture how you can increase your ram size in your android-emulator

45341166
primes	modulus
secondly when used it is typically much shorter than the bit length of p which is supposed to be the primes modulus not 2 in rfc 7919 appendix a.1
specifies a 2048-bit modulus p and a generator g 2 for which the suggested minimum l value is 225

45341425
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
probably graphicsmagick imagemagick is not installed correctly download graphicsmagick or download imagemagick if your are using ubuntu these commands are useful
sudo add-apt-repository ppa dhor myway sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install graphicsmagick sudo apt-get install imagemagick and i list a few examples of the identify command here to illustrate its usefulness and ease of use

45341677
super	extends
it s not super easy
if you just want your text in pdf s header try but if you want it in the pdf s body i guess you have to extends kartik export exportmenu and override renderpdf like and then you have to use your class instead

45347335
hex	binary
for a very few types of changes one can also use a hex editor only replacing some bytes not inserting or removing anything but you really should know what you are doing
pdf is a binary format

45348255
opera	google-chrome
just don t forget to prevent the default click event to avoid an error in the console in opera browser the url is opera settings configurecommands you can detect the browser using navigator.useragent string in firefox there s no ui to customize webextensions command shortcuts yet
a possible enhancement is to check first whether such url was already opened in some tab by our button however it won t find the dialog invoked manually on google-chrome extensions page because it doesn t change the url

45350006
translation	localization
backend would send ids which client apps then translation to localized text
benefits single source of translation for everything - buttons tooltips etc and the error messages formatting support - you might need to make some parts of the message bold clickable etc which needs to be done on the frontend client-only validation - error messages for client side validation should be the same as the server side ones for the same error with backend localization you might end up duplicating some translations language agnostic testing is possible language agnostic backend is possible - no need for locale on the backend just for the sake of translation in sync with the general recommendation of localizing as close to the client as possible removes the incentive of doing more backend translations in future drawbacks translation for new errors is not possible

45350161
client-side	server-side
if you re client-side you can check your localstorage store instead
of course you can always opt to server-side render your website as an anonymous not authorised user by default

45352296
bash	subshell
for example all of the following will do the exact same thing as it tries to support the native bash syntax with as few gotchas as possible not only are variables supported but the often-undesirable behavior of invalid ranges being supplied as strings is prevented as well
the other answers will work in most cases but they all have at least one of the following drawbacks many of them use subshell which can harm performance and may not be possible on some systems

45352466
accelerometer	gyroscope
not only would you need entire accelerometer history you would also need original location and orientation not to mention all the error extrapolated over such an error a 1 sensor error becomes much greater in this calculation
to get some type of sensor data about orientation gyroscope or maybe compass must be used

45352721
realloc	malloc
just initialize with a null pointer realloc and free wouldn t mind the null pointer
the flexible array member means that the last element in the structure is an array of indefinite length so in malloc you would reserve enough memory for it too the flexible array member is used in cpython for objects like str bytes or tuple that are of immutable length - it is slightly faster to use a fam instead of a pointer elsewhere and it saves memory - especially with shorter strings or tuples

45353386
translation	localization
add a file named resources.en-us.resx if you want to get rid of the error the quick way what i personally do to localize a wpf app is i leave assemblyinfo.cs as it is which means that resource.resx without language id file will be the default which is generally en-us i create additional file next to default like this it is usually the same as resource.resx but translation in the matching language i force the culture at startup typically in the app.xaml.cs with a user settable language id so user can change application language
you re not forced to use code behind for localization you can simply use x static markup extension to bind to static fields just make sure your resource file access modifier is set to public the error message you get typically means you do not have a resource.en-us.resx file because is here to tell your app to use en en-us resource file as default source

45354865
touchesbegan	touchesended
make sure to set this boolean as the last line in touchesbegan just to not exit the first jump
have a boolean called isjumping that is set to true when touchesbegan and is back to false when touchesended

45354877
ssl	https
the great thing about this technique is that elastic beanstalk automatically runs the apache server restart command so after you deploy you do not need to copy anything manually or re-run sudo service httpd restart following the above steps will get your flask running on https with ssl certificates and deploy correctly
in order to get https ssl to work for flask so that flask runs on 2 ports you will first want to follow the tips here https with http in flask python however this will only set up your flask code to run with ssl

45357766
move	drag
assuming you have files a b c in a logical group but want them move into a folder on your hard drive
create a destination folder via finder add the folder in xcode file - add files using the options pane to select a folder reference not a group drag files a b c from the old group to the new folder reference in the project navigator

45358452
g++	gcc
gcc does not link in the standard library by default unlike g++
link with gcc instead of g++

45361124
cpython	pypy
edit looking at the crossbar documentation they do not recommend using apt get at all and also recommend compiling cpython from source which is why there is no mention of the python-dev package
you should not be using cpython headers with pypy so the is wrong

45361124
cpython	pypy
you should not be using cpython headers with pypy so the is wrong
as documented here and here you probably need to install the pypy-dev package so that you can build packages with pypy much as you need python-dev to build packages with python

45363615
rspec	capybara
capybara already includes capybara dsl into feature specs so use feature specs and remove the include capybara dsl from your rspec config shown above
this requires either putting your spec file into spec features my_spec.rb and enabling the rspec config to determine test type by directory or manually specifying that the test is a feature spec feature should utilise capybara to download web content do ... end or it should utilise capybara to download web content type feature do ... end your test is actually using the rack_test driver and not the poltergeist-billy driver

45376166
calloc	malloc
would like to know if it s possible to free a char string allocated with calloc but several times
short answer no long answer one call to malloc calloc realloc null ... 1 allows requires to not leak memory exactly one call to free passing the value to the latter as returned by one of the former

45376617
union	distinct
union is basically select distinct so it would be eliminating duplicate null values but it s not the same as equal operation
using union all would give you all records including duplicating nulls

45377473
lisp	prolog
a list in prolog is like a lisp list actually a linked list every element is either an empty list or a node . h t with h the head and t the tail
lists are not special in prolog in the sense that the intepreter handles them differently than any other term

45378362
super	self
super is a proxy object that uses the method resolution order mro to determine what method to call when you perform a call on super
if we inspect the __mro__ of classfour we get or made it shorter myself not the python output now super t self is a proxy object that uses the mro from but excluding t

45378362
super	self
if we inspect the __mro__ of classfour we get or made it shorter myself not the python output now super t self is a proxy object that uses the mro from but excluding t
so that means that super clsfour self is a proxy object that works with clsthree clsthreee clstwo clsone object # super clsfour self what will happen if you query an attribute a method is also an attribute of a class is that python will walk through the mro and inspect whether the element has such attribute

45378700
implements	extends
they can all be invoked as functions however a long your number zero does not implements ifn hence it cannot be invoked as a function
if you look at the code for apersistentvector you will see public abstract class apersistentvector extends afn ... afn implements ifn which extends java s callable and runnable interfaces which means that a clojure persistent vector can be called as a function with the argument being used as the index to retrieve

45381299
udp	mtu
longer answer i m not sure what sicslowpan uses for transport udp tcp something else... but here s what ipv6 will do in general the node 1 attempts to send a packet with a large size to node 4
the size of this packet is larger than the mtu of one of the segments 1 2 2 3 3 4

45381299
mtu	icmp
node 2 attempts to send the packet to node 3 and realizes that the mtu for 2 3 cannot support the packet size
node 2 drops the packet and sends and icmp message to node 1 letting it know what the required mtu is for that route

45381635
translation	localization
internationalization - it is when developer does not have in code direct messages error messages buttons names labels captions etc in certain language but have a key which is passed to translation function and translation function according to current user s locale will return final text in english france etc... translation function works with storage db files associative array etc . storage contains keys which is ussed in coode and values which is texts in certain language which application supports
localization - it is process of adding new values in new language for example spain appropriate to keys into storage without involving developer in this process

45382080
vbscript	vba
i fixed this issue by running external vbscript contain file path to set it on choose file to upload pop up window using sendkeys method after send enter key to close this pop up and this run successfully because the extranl vbscript run on another process so it will not stuck on vba code
notes 1- i dynamically create the external vbscript from vba code and save it on temp folder after that i run this script using wscript.shell.run to excute it on another thread 1- at the begining of the external vbscript i set 1 sec delay to be sure the choose file to upload pop up window already opened from vba

45382741
aggregate-functions	sum
think about it this way if your base query always returns only one single value per month promocode then it doesn t matter which aggregate-functions you use well except count
with only one value min max sum avg will all simply return that one value

45386798
bash	subshell
there is no concept of returning anything from a bash function except for strings that it prints and the function s exit status 0-255 . there are expected limitations here and a learning curve especially if you re accustomed to functions of higher-level languages. it can be weird at first and if you find yourself in a situation where strings just aren t cutting it you ll want to leverage an external tool such as jq. if jq or something like it is available you can start having your functions print formatted output to be parsed utilized as you would an object array etc
function declarations there are two ways to declare a function in bash. one operates within your current shell we ll call is fx0. and one spawns a subshell to operate in we ll call that fx1. here are examples of how they re declared these 2 functions perform the same operation - indeed. however there is a key difference here. fx1 cannot perform any action that alters the current shell. that means modifying variables changing shell options and declaring other functions . the latter is what can be exploited to prevent name spacing issues that can easily creep up on you

45390526
libsvm	liblinear
svc uses libsvm estimators that do not
liblinear estimators are optimized for a linear special case and thus converge faster on big amounts of data than libsvm

45390587
super	implements
super searches the mro for the next class that has the attribute
that a doesn t implements it doesn t matter as c is still considered

45392171
libstdc++	libc++
this answer shows how to get at the underlying implementation of g++ s libstdc++ but that code doesn t auto-vectorize
doing the same thing for libc++ and tweaking it so it auto-vectorizes might let you get a good fraction of the performance possible with manual vectorization except for transpose but you d probably have to keep your whole matrix in one because a vector of vectors is a bad extra level of indirection

45392911
backtracking	greedy
repetition in regex by default is greedy they try to match as many reps as possible and when this doesn t work and they have to backtracking they try to match one fewer rep at a time until a match of the whole pattern is found
as a result when a match finally happens a greedy repetition would match as many reps as possible

45393167
bash	subshell
note that the point of demonstrating this is to show that if you are using a testing method that s quite easy to fall into the habit of using subshell grep or sed or gawk or a bash builtin like echo which is for me a bad habit i tend to fall into when hacking fast it s worth realizing that this will have a significant performance hit and it s probably worth the time avoiding those if bash builtins can handle the job natively
by carefully reviewing a large programs use of subshell and replacing them with other methods when possible i was able to cut about 10 of the overall execution time in a just completed set of optimizations not the first and not the last time i have done this it s already been optimized several times so gaining another 10 is actually quite significant so it s worth being aware of

45393446
super	extends
while es6 classes that extends other classes will go up the chain and instantiate the base object thanks to super
in other words will actually travel all the way to a and see that s not a class that uses extends and will instantiate that one with a twist the prototype of the object will be the prototype of the c

45393446
super	extends
super calls on c and b will set the this to whatever super returned
this is why this is never set before super because classes that extends something will not create a new object by themselves

45393656
keras	tensorflow	theano	keras
-- instead what helped me was the following how to switch backend with keras from tensionflow to theano code in ipython output in ipython tensorflow change keras backend to theano theano
what works in python 2.7 - dynamically changing keras backend -- not sure how this would help if we are not able to dynamically change the backend

45394497
prng	random
given that op s mcu is actually a cortex m0 so a 32 bit arm it s worth trying to make it even faster using a full 32 bit prng and 32 bit stores
as said above built-in random returns a signed value and it s not exactly clear what range it provides

45399326
erlang	elixir
the other one in your erlang code translates to the following proplist in erlang what you probably mean to match in your erlang code is this although it is hard to guess what exactly you want there in general keyword in elixir can not be translated to erlang proplists since keys in erlang can be of any type but in elixir they have to be atoms
if you have to have more general way of passing erlang proplists from elixir to erlang there is nothing stopping you from constructing them manually in elixir

45399335
comparator	comparable
a natural ordering that uses comparator required to be consistent with equals iff x.equals y is true whenever x.compareto y equals 0
so you have to make your comparable class consistent with equals because some java collection classes may behave unpredictably if the comparator and equals methods are not returning consistent results

45399335
comparator	comparable
so you have to make your comparable class consistent with equals because some java collection classes may behave unpredictably if the comparator and equals methods are not returning consistent results
the following example shows comparator method that is not consistent with equals if we want to sort apple objects by cost but cost may not be unique

45400129
division	modulo	multiplication	modulo
instead of the expression you have really represents the modulo in the first summand is applied before the multiplication and division
it appears that you consider modulo to have lower precedence than multiplication and division when in fact it does not

45402299
udp	tcp
http runs over tcp not udp
punching a udp hole doesn t do you any good -- any tcp connection to the backend http server will still fail

45402363
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication
in your case for subtraction for the number entered 9 6 for 1st input 9 number 9 diff 0 so diff number - diff 9 - 0 9 for 2nd input 6 number 6 diff 9 so diff number - diff 6 - 9 -3 which is not our intention a slight modification in your code
for addition multiplication order does not matter 9+6 6+9 and 3 2 2 3. but not the case with subtraction division 9-6 not equals 6-9

45404450
required	placeholder
since a function can only have a single return type return type deduction required the two return return statements not to conflict
to quote the c++14 standard revision dcl.spec.auto 2 the placeholder type can appear with a function declarator in the decl-specifier-seq type-specifier-seq conversion-function-id or trailing-return-type in any context where such a declarator is valid. if the function declarator includes a trailing-return-type dcl.fct that specifies the declared return type of the function. if the declared return type of the function contains a placeholder type the return type of the function is deduced from return statements in the body of the function if any

45412090
ssl	https
else you can install valid ssl certificate on the server
you server url is https and certificate is already not valid

45412424
retrofit	okhttp
attach an authenticator to an okhttpclient the same way you do with interceptors use this client when creating your retrofit restadapter check this fore more details visit this link
okhttp will automatically ask the authenticator for credentials when a response is 401 not authorised retrying last failed request with them

45412547
express	node.js
but if you re building a restful api from scratch then you can consider using some other frameworks like hapi restify loopback and other frameworks listed on - express is a very solid but fairly minimal framework and it s not the only option out there
for an example see the code in this answer node.js send data to backend with ajax stripping all unnecessary code it would be basically this code is a very simple rest api that exposes one endpoint but you can easily add more

45415508
uiview	subviews
add additional uiview upon of your uiimageview with same frames width height and position
it shouldn t be a subviews of uiimageview

45415851
dictionary	map
you can convert the same using dictionary mapping as other have answered
you can not map list to key value pair

45420252
backgrounding	multitasking
2.16 multitasking apps may only use backgrounding services for their intended purposes voip audio playback location task completion local notifications etc
2.16 we found that your app uses a backgrounding mode but does not include functionality that requires that mode to run persistently

45421360
gif	png
convert a png to gif install pil
the photoimage tkinter module doesn t support png images you need to convert the image to a gif image and then it will work

45426796
ubuntu	linux
given what you ve said i ll assume you already have node and npm already installed in wsl s ubuntu
using your favorite cli editor such as nano vim emacs cat and sed etc open your .profile nano .profile note do not attempt to edit linux files using windows tools

45430035
vsts	tfs
in tfs 2017 and vsts we can specify the absolute path of the vstest.console.exe to let it work see this article for details but in tfs 2015 we can not specify the path in the task it s not support
so if you want to use vstest you can install vs 2015 or upgrade to tfs 2017 or later version

45438134
equals	compareto	comparator	comparable
from the documentation note that the ordering maintained by a tree map like any sorted map and whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if this sorted map is to correctly implement the map interface
see comparable or comparator for a precise definition of consistent with equals. this is so because the map interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a sorted map performs all key comparisons using its compareto or compare method so two keys that are deemed equal by this method are from the standpoint of the sorted map equal

45439308
ssl	https
doesn t support ssl at all gae dev_appserver.py over https for your flexible environment app the local server is your node server
so you could set that up for https

45442398
ionic	angular
from ionic docs out of the box ionic automatically removes the 300ms delay in order to make ionic apps feel more native like
resultingly other solutions such as fastclick and angular s ngtouch should not be included to avoid conflicts

45444117
webclient	httpwebrequest
httpclient is not a replacement of webclient httpwebrequest
httpwebrequest gives you more flexibility but at the same time it makes your code bit more verbose

45444400
constexpr	inline-functions
standard c does not have a direct analog of c++ s constexpr
the closest things are macros and inline-functions and of those two macros can be used in some ways that inline-functions cannot be used -- in particular inline-functions cannot be used where c requires a constant expression hmmm .

45444963
serializable	deserialization
supposedly the team is close to releasing a new remoting stack in the near future that contains the ability to plug in custom serializable and a lot of improvements on the performance side but this is not available yet
in the meantime a workaround not a very nice one mind you is to make all of your proxies receive string or or something like that and take care of serializable deserialization manually using something like json.net

45445291
implements	extends
your usage could look something like this below is how you could implements promise.retry if you re uncomfortable extends a native object this would be the correct way to do so since it is a configurable non-enumerable and writable property you can just implements it as a static function
you could implements a wrapper for promise that automatically chains retries for you allowing you to refactor your code with whatever logic you need and not worry about handling retry logic simultaneously

45446014
set	bag
deleting the tag deletes the name for this set of commits
first a quick note each stash is actually just a set of commits in a particular format a stash bag that is not on any branch

45446120
spaces	linefeed
you could split and then join or yet limit the number of split operations needs strip afterwards or you could use partition which splits according to the first spaces found then strip the result to remove leading trailing blanks with you get
just build a list comprehension using str.split and taking the last element note that linefeed is ignored since split is called without argument splits according to 1 or many spaces characters tabs spaces newlines... result doing that using regex is more complex because regex split doesn t drop empty fields edit another technique is needed if you want to return everything but the first item

45447880
spaces	linefeed
similarly the tag omission rules state that a body element s start tag may be omitted if the element is empty or if the first thing inside the body element is not a spaces character or a comment ... so we are free to assume that the comment is also not the first thing inside the body element
so in fact this document can be unambiguously parsed as equivalent to the parser algorithm for html5 specifies that if we are in the before html insertion mode which is the state the parser transitions to after seeing and we see a character token that is one of u+0009 character tabulation linefeed u+000a ff u+000c cr u+000d or u+0020 spaces then we are to ignore the token. if on the other hand we see a comment token then we are to insert a comment as the last child of the document object

you can see that your issue is base related in the exception message which specifically say the input values are not valid for int with base 10
similarly python won t implicitly truncate the fractions part of the string representation of a decimal value when creating an int

cloudant	couchdb
instead you may want to have a look at cloudant lab s easton and hastings
despite geocouch is part of the couchdb 2.0 documentation its developer s website states it does not yet work with couchdb 2.0

implements	extends
you could create your own component base class extends from react.component which implements this and then derive all of your components from this class instead
live demo typically extends components in react is discouraged as it s not idiomatic

45463852
git-svn	svn2git
but anyways for a one-time migration git-svn is not the right tool for conversions of repositories or parts of repositories
it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case

45463852
git-svn	svn2git
it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case
there are plenty tools called svn2git the probably best one is the kde one from

45463852
git-svn	svn2git
even though git-svn is easier to start with here are some further reasons why using the kde svn2git instead of git-svn is superior besides its flexibility the history is rebuilt much better and cleaner by svn2git if the correct one is used this is especially the case for more complex histories with branches and merges and so on the tags are real tags and not branches in git with git-svn the tags contain an extra empty commit which also makes them not part of the branches so a normal fetch will not get them until you give --tags to the command as by default only tags pointing to fetched branches are fetched also
with the proper svn2git tags are where they belong if you changed layout in svn you can easily configure this with svn2git with git-svn you will loose history eventually with svn2git you can also split one svn repository into multiple git repositories easily or combine multiple svn repositories in the same svn root into one git repository easily the conversion is a gazillion times faster with the correct svn2git than with git-svn you see there are many reasons why git-svn is worse and the kde svn2git is superior

opencv	emgucv
there are no provisions within emgucv opencv that provide for manipulation or even capture of an audio track
emgucv opencv are sdks for computer vision applications are not really intended to to do general purpose manipulation of video audio streams

45464460
opencv	emgucv
emgucv opencv are sdks for computer vision applications are not really intended to to do general purpose manipulation of video audio streams
in general i have found it is better to avoid emgucv opencv for video capture and use these tools strictly for computer vision applications

45466355
keras	tensorflow
so for a typical keras model with one output you would do something like then you can write the graph to a file as usual with tf.train.write_graph
keras does not include by itself any means to export a tensorflow graph as a protocol buffers file but you can do it using regular tensorflow utilities

45466355
keras	tensorflow
keras does not include by itself any means to export a tensorflow graph as a protocol buffers file but you can do it using regular tensorflow utilities
here is a blog post explaining how to do it using the utility script freeze_graph.py included in tensorflow which is the typical way it is done

45468243
rvm	bundler
however bundler is not installed on versions of ruby provided by rvm by default so for after you switch to ruby-2.2.2 install bundler for that ruby gem install bundler then try running bundle install again
you probably had bundler installed for the version of ruby you ve been using until this point

implements	extends
so to solve your problem make your custom custom collection class implements iterable or more simple use jdk java.util.collection subclasses
the collection type referenced here is not the java.util.collection interface that extends the iterable interface

45472116
super	extends
super calls the constructor of the element s superclass parent class
if an element s definition defines a class that extends another class and super is not called explicitly the element calls the constructor of the superclass by default

45472116
super	extends
if an element s definition defines a class that extends another class and super is not called explicitly the element calls the constructor of the superclass by default
the proper place to call super is inside the element s constructor method

45472873
swift	objective-c
nsattributedstringkey as well as all the other new key types in swift 4 exists only in swift and not in objective-c
when a dictionary with nsattributedstringkey keys gets bridged to objective-c all the keys will be turned into nsstrings

45479408
lodash	underscore.js
this aliases are useful in the documentation if you know a function in an other library and you want to find the equivalent in lodash underscore.js
if you want to code pure lodash underscore.js you should not use aliases

45499951
postgresql	mysql
following sequelize docs it seems it s not possible to insert a multipolygon if using mysql and not sure in case of postgresql a column storing geometry information
it is only available in postgresql with postgis or mysql

google-chrome	safari
no matter what size screenshots i uploaded it wouldn t save in google-chrome
i eventually tried the same thing in safari and it saved the first time

45507046
margin	text-align
you can set margin but it s not very clean
if you really don t want a text-align center

45507754
division	modulo
the right result of such division would be 2147483648 but that value cannot be represented in 32-bit so an arithmetic exception is produced
in order to calculate such modulo expression -2147483648 -1 a division is required which in this case seems to be a 32-bit division i guess l and r are defined as int

45509434
setinterval	settimeout
you can cancel timeout using cleartimeout id you can also use setinterval instead
you are actually using settimeout not setinterval

45515697
super	extends
super baseentity will not work because baseentity does not extends childentity in fact the opposite is true
extends baseentity will not work because we don t really know what type of baseentity will be accepted by the function

45520327
hex	binary
if you want to output test x80test2 x81 and have the hex dump look like this 00000000 54 65 73 74 80 54 65 73 74 32 81 |test.test2.| you can do this works because latin-1 is a subset of unicode
here s a quick demo output b 000102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f101112131415161718191a1b1c1d1e1f202122232425262728292a2b2c2d2e2f303132333435363738393a3b3c3d3e3f404142434445464748494a4b4c4d4e4f505152535455565758595a5b5c5d5e5f606162636465666768696a6b6c6d6e6f707172737475767778797a7b7c7d7e7f808182838485868788898a8b8c8d8e8f909192939495969798999a9b9c9d9e9fa0a1a2a3a4a5a6a7a8a9aaabacadaeafb0b1b2b3b4b5b6b7b8b9babbbcbdbebfc0c1c2c3c4c5c6c7c8c9cacbcccdcecfd0d1d2d3d4d5d6d7d8d9dadbdcdddedfe0e1e2e3e4e5e6e7e8e9eaebecedeeeff0f1f2f3f4f5f6f7f8f9fafbfcfdfeff however if you re actually working with binary data then you shouldn t be storing it in text strings in the first place you should be using bytes or possibly bytearray

45522158
multiplying	multiplication
instead you should use public biginteger multiplying biginteger val
java does not support operator overloading so you cannot use the multiplication operator on it

45529639
implements	extends
pojo - plain old java object pojo class is an ordinary class without any specialties class totally loosely coupled from technology framework.the class does not implements from technology framework and does not extends from technology framework api that class is called pojo class
pojo class can implements interfaces and extends classes but the super class or interface should not be an technology framework

primes	palindrome
an emirp primes spelled backwards is a primes whose base 10 reversal is also primes but which is not a palindrome primes
in other words backwards read primes are primes that when read backwards in base 10 from right to left are a different primes

45530230
primes	palindrome
this rules out primes which are palindromes. try this short solution in which i use two helper function reverse and isprime isprime thanks to jeff clayton for his method to test primes for more information click the link below reverse that use the php function strrev 1 this method take a string a reverse it we ll use this trick to reverse a number by converting it to a string reverse it and converting back to an integer
backwardsprime this last function s job is itterating over a range of numbers from min value to max value and test if the number if a primes number and it s reverse is a primes number as well and it s not a palindrome number if all of those conditions are true then we addit to the result array

45538238
oncreate	setcontentview
edit initialize the adapter in oncreate method instead of doing it globally
make sure super.oncreate savedinstancestate is the first thing you are calling in your oncreate and also not trying to access any view from the layout xml before setcontentview

45541218
n-gram	words
fix that by implementing a comparator for these objects sort according to comparator use language detection to determine the language n-gram approach is simple but should suffice dictionary attack
look for all occurences of words that signify sign here in whatever language the document is written in hence step 5 in case of multiple candidates or no candidates use line rendering instructions to look for likely candidate of the infamous dotted line this approach is not easy but there is a lot of research into recognition of structural elements in pdf files

45546012
portrait	landscape
uidevice.current.setvalue uideviceorientation.landscapeleft.rawvalue forkey orientation for more uidevice options see apple documentation to ensure the user cannot get back to portrait you add the code you already had
you are on the right track but when a user is in portrait modus and you want to force the user in landscape because your view is in landscape you must change the uidevice orientation

45546447
rsa	aes
so you need to use a 2-steps encryption scheme use rsa to encrypt a symmetric key and use this symmetric key to encrypt your plain text
simply said rsa is not for directly encrypting plain text it is used for encrypting a symmetric key aes for instance and this is with this symmetric key that you will encrypt and further decrypt your plain text

45546447
rsa	aes
simply said rsa is not for directly encrypting plain text it is used for encrypting a symmetric key aes for instance and this is with this symmetric key that you will encrypt and further decrypt your plain text
since the plain text may have any size it is encrypted using aes with a stream cipher for instance aes-256-gcm or a block cipher for instance aes-256-cbc

45547230
implements	extends
so what helped was to implements a separate class tiptablemodel extends abstracttablemode that receives the tip upon instantiation so instead of serializing the variable of a type that implements abstracttablemodel it seems advisable to separate the data from the table model and serialize the data only
upon debugging i also realized that objects that extends abstractlistmodel list not table also save many fields in addition to the member variables that are declared in the class but serializing these members did not cause any exceptions although it would probably be advisable too to separate data and the list model

45548438
ubuntu	debian
there is also a section in the install documentation about enabling cgroup memory accounting although it only mentions ubuntu and not debian
it is quite possible that memory cgroup accounting is not enabled in your kernel which is a common problem that others have hit as well over time on debian ubuntu based installs

45549633
config	ini
the test s arrange part would be responsible for setting up the config data and when you act you pass the config to your sut and then assert that the resulting state matches the specified config
the code that reads writes the actual ini file would be another concern entirely with its own test code which would also avoid hitting the file system you want to test your code not whether the scripting runtime s filesystemobject does its job

45551321
comparator	comparable
an alternative would be a factory for complete comparator s
to be used like this has the advantage that it also may support properties whose type is not comparable and requires a custom comparator

45554546
jar	manifest.mf
it appears that the apk you re uploading does not contain any jar signature files
typically these are meta-inf manifest.mf and

45555153
rsa	aes
i m not entirely clear on what you need but you can use rsa keys to wrap and unwrap aes keys in bouncycastle
here is a java example that creates an rsa keypair saves the private key to a file and then saves an aes key that has been wrapped in the public key

45555485
dictionary	map
i believe you need to add the uppercase letters to the dictionary
otherwise the program doesn t know what number to map them to. i would recommend setting variable and then at the beginning of the program

45556485
build.gradle	gradlew
to avoid buggy security flawed android.media.exifinterface as well as 3rd party dependencies the best option seems to be a new com.android.support exifinterface library which we add to build.gradle as however for me it led to a gradlew sync error caused by that this specific newest version of the library is not found in google repositories though this version is the latest according to the support library packages page
after an hour of trials i figured out that jcenter repository is not enough and gradlew sync was fixed by adding google maven repository ok now we re able to use android.support.media.exifinterface

45556909
rdf	owl
as far as i can tell the document you re after is this one note that owl xml and rdf xml are very different serialization formats
rdf xml is a w3c standard while owl xml is not

45556909
rdf	owl
rdf xml is a w3c standard while owl xml is not
edit the following paper is by matthew horridge one of the main authors of the owl api and of the current protege code base and points to a w3c recommendation i was not aware of

45557410
charat	indexof
from the documentation string substring int beginindex returns a new string that is a substring of this string. instead use the charat method which returns the chars value at the specified index
you can also cleanup the implementation by using a string with the vowels and invoking the indexof method on it to test if the chars in question is a vowel or not

45557420
prepare	execute
now that i look closer you are using escape_string while this is good the preferred way is prepare statements
this is because with a prepare statement the variables are entirely separate from the query commands and so the db knows not to execute anything in them

45559140
google-chrome	safari
works on phantomjs and google-chrome but not with angular due to the function works with angular on google-chrome but not phantomjs
your safari error is very illuminating and i am kicking myself for not reading it more closely

45559742
super	self
in python2 super takes reference of cls class and self class instance as arguments
take a look here super should not be considered the standard way of calling a method of the base class

45559748
super	self
make sure you use super only when needed and use it properly
the proper way to call super here is with the following arguments super wizard self because super in python2 needs the arguments in python3 it s possible to do just super take a look at the docs for super for more details edit it appears that this mistake is repeated more times in your code keep that in mind that some things will not work because of the same problem

45560283
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome has implemented it but have not yet announced when it will land
it is implemented in firefox 33 but is not enabled by default and has to be toggled via user preference

45560799
factors	matrix
using of chain indexing a .. ... is an octave addition not available in matlab and has nothing to do with use a function while doing matrix multiplication anyway you should use a sparse matrix for creation and storage gives as you can see the speedup factors is 500 and the memory usage only a tenth.
you can use the sparse matrix in almost any computation as you would to use a full matrix

45563702
pdcurses	ncurses
offhand no one s made a complete comparison pdcurses doesn t have a low-level terminfo or termcap interface pdcurses has explicit definitions for alt control keys #define ctl_left 0x1bb control-left-arrow #define ctl_right 0x1bc #define ctl_pgup 0x1bd #define ctl_pgdn 0x1be #define ctl_home 0x1bf #define ctl_end 0x1c0 with ncurses those would be user-defined capabilities
the terminal description would have capabilities for the control cursor keys such as kdn5 control down-arrow and the application find these at runtime using tigetstr to get the values and key_defined to find the coding used by ncurses

45564035
ienumerable	ilist
not sure what you re trying to achieve but if you just want to iterate through elements you could declare your variable as ienumerable
you could also declare it as ilist if you need to know the number of elements in the collection

45569219
inline	inlining
when i did not define b f4 a f4 was inline and still performed the virtual function call
your compiler seems to be unable to reason well about virtual function calls after inlining f4

45570220
inline	inlining
answer the method thread ... is not an inline method so you won t be able to pass f as an argument
answer noinline will prevent the inlining of lambdas

45573367
vb.net	vb6
i ll start with this function vb.net is not vbscript vb6
all functions in vb.net should have a return type

45575605
octal	decimal
your should use numberutils.iscreatable or numberutils.isparsable all of them support a decimal point value numberutils.iscreatable support hexadecimal octal numbers scientific notation and numbers marked with a type qualifier 123l
not valid octal values will return false 09

45580346
swift	objective-c
swift adds a hidden isnil.
field for each optional but it s not a big difference. if you want to define an exact equivalent to your objective-c code you need to use pointers as in the original code

45584335
swift	objective-c
for me it seems to be a bug of swift standard library
it is not clearly described in the documentation of decimal but decimal in objective-c it s nsdecimal is the basis of nsdecimalnumber and its documentation clearly states an instance can represent any number that can be expressed as mantissa x 10 exponent where mantissa is a decimal integer up to 38 digits long and exponent is an integer from 128 through 127

45587505
build.gradle	gradlew
just to explain a bit following dekanszn answer depending on where is the script situated you will need to extend your build.gradle with it
if the script is in the root yes including is going to extend you the script you have applied it to then if your test.gradle is in the root and you want to access the task defined in that script from your project or any subproject you will need to apply it in the build.gradle in this project because otherwise gradlew will not read it automatically and configure the task

45587505
build.gradle	gradlew
if the script is in the root yes including is going to extend you the script you have applied it to then if your test.gradle is in the root and you want to access the task defined in that script from your project or any subproject you will need to apply it in the build.gradle in this project because otherwise gradlew will not read it automatically and configure the task
build.gradle is read automatically therefore extending it with your script is going to configure the task you want to use and have it visible for gradlew

45590307
fileoutputstream	printwriter
constructor you are using to create a printwriter uses new instance of fileoutputstream internally
the fileoutputstream has two general write models overwrite the default append since you did not specify what mode to use your writer will use the default

45594841
dataframe	multi-index
it s hard to tell without seeing your data but i m presuming it is the case since just using would yield a series on a normal dataframe meaning the lambda wouldn t be able to find your columns specified and then there would be an error
i actually found this answer which explains the problem of trying to create columns in multi-index dataframes one confusing things with multi-index column creation is that you can try to create a column like you are doing and it will seem to run without any issues but won t actually create what you want

45600341
allocator	stl
usage in community codes i am aware of at least two hpc application frameworks that uses tbb moose madness i do not know how moose uses tbb but madness uses tbb for its task queue and memory allocator
performance versus other threading models i have personally used tbb in the parallel research kernels project within which i have compared tbb to openmp opencl kokkos raja c++17 parallel stl and other models

45601269
mongodb	bson
mongodb itself has no real way of referring to the value of a previous document and the only way to do that is essentially by coercing the values into an array for processing
so in most real world cases such processing as an array is not actually practical and would in fact exceed the 16mb bson limit by storing the values in an array of any significant size

45602758
super	self
if tester doesn t inherit from object you can t call super on it
just a side note you can t directly assign a method using because some_method_here won t receive a self argument

45604363
hex	binary
decode 63697a61f161 hex produces the bytea value x63697a61f161 if bytea_encoding is hex or ciza 361a if bytea_encoding is escape
either way it s a representation of a binary string not text

45605338
realloc	malloc
and since you are increasing the allocation by 1 with each addfieldtotable you can just use realloc for the first and all subsequent allocations simplifying addfieldtotable
note repeatedly calling malloc or realloc or calloc for every element added is not a very efficient allocation scheme but it is fine for now

45610408
super	implements
if we assume that super.tostring already cares for all properties of the super class hierarchy we can specify our own superclass as stop class to only add properties defined in our class
if all you want to do is to implements a tostring method skipping the class property you could do that straight-forwardly without manipulating the map but to me not being able to exclude the class property in the first place looks like an unfortunate omission

45612632
swift	objective-c
every objective-c file can be used by swift by simply adding its header into bridging header
some code might change substantially when porting to swift such as enumerations and class nesting though this is not mandatory at least in first phase

45616463
interpolation	splines
splines are used for smoother interpolation that ensures curvature continuity
it actually isn t that hard to implement a similar interpolation yourself using barycentric interpolation instead of splines

libstdc++	libc++
this doesn t happen when you use libstdc++ as its implementation of is just see libstdc++ s unordered_map header
this is an implementation detail of libc++ from libc++ s unordered_map header if we assume you are using c++11 or greater then this basically works by clearing the old hashtable then inserting the elements of __u into this vector

45621825
margin	text-align
however navigation can be centered by adjusting margin padding but it s not recommended so you would need to make changes in html code recommended how create 3 separate div s for logo nav and social assign specific width according to your needs add css property to align left float left
finally apply text-align center

45622729
google-chrome	safari
in my case google-chrome tools displayed the file name not just author stylesheet
i m not sure if this is 100 accurate but i believe that safari will not show the name of the css file if it is named default.css

45628450
punctuation	words
in your example you have two non-latin chunks that happens to not contain space or punctuation but many scripts will use space as it is used in the latin script cyrillic
even though a space is classifed as latin you still want a sequence of words in cyrillic separated by spaces to be considered a single chunk using the cyrillic script instead of a cyrillic words followed by a latin space and then another cyrillic words etc

uiview	subviews
2017 swift 4 ios 10.0+ i briefly tried the accepted answer s edited solution but i couldn t easily make an entire viewcontroller for just a uiview banner
however by accessing the statusbar value in uiapplication i was able to add a uiview as a subviews to statusbarview

super	implements
this is how you can call the super implementation hope it helps.
it is not possible to implements an interface default method and use it in fxml apparently fxmlloader uses reflection and doesn t find the method in the class implementation

45649424
rdf	owl
they re part of the current owl2 to rdf mapping
the owl annotation you ve shown is only for annotations on axioms in rdf as described here reasoners are unaware of reified statements as this reification is a syntactic workaround for rdf only - other syntaxes do not reify axioms in order to annotate them or to nest annotations

45650202
viewdidload	viewdidappear
the reason seems that since viewdidload is the first method to be called in the view life cycle adding nib reference there makes sure that when the views are drawn your tables they are available to locate in cellforrow
but if you put the same code in viewdidappear the views are already loaded by that time and your table view is not referenced yet referenced from nib

45650281
n-gram	words
sql in general is not optimized for partial string searches although some databases do have functionality to help postgres has indexes based on n-gram for instance
for your purpose you might start with a full-text index and make sure that the company name has some full words that are correct new york life insurance or company

45652571
build.gradle	gradlew
if you want to change the scope of your dependencies in a project that already contains maven and gradlew look to do so in their respective files pom.xml build.gradle
that particular view is geared more towards projects which lack dependency management from something like maven or gradlew and will not interfere with either

45654396
comparator	comparable
you need to change the sorting method to use explicit comparator
v needs to implement comparable but does not

45654884
wildfly	weblogic
in any case now wildfly is rendering the output of rest calls based on moxy and not based on jackson
this means i will have to refactor my rest client to be moxy based but quite honestly... i am out of energy to struggle against weblogic

45657038
bower	npm
you need a loader that supports commonjs module s like bower or webpack
if the loader doesn t respect commonjs node.js rules then it s unlikely to work with npm packages

45657461
build.gradle	gradlew
instead you can do the opposite using resvalue api you can write a value to resources within build.gradle resvalue string variable_name some value here
afaik as of now it s unavailable to read from string resource files android gradlew plugin does not have such an api

45660753
dictionary	map
so we need to deal gracefully with that situation this uses the default filter to ensure that we start with a dictionary and then we use a few levels of python s .get key default method
checking against the secondary addresses is similar but requires that we use the map filter because ipv4_secondaries gives us a list of dictionaries and what we really want is a list of addresses so that we can check if our target address is in that list putting it all together if i run this on my system the playbook run concludes with if i run i get as you can see from the above this isn t exactly the sort of task that ansible is meant for

uitableview	uipickerview
usually i will create a uitableview with customized uitableviewcell to fulfill dynamic list
uipickerview is quite predefined and not so much dynamic view

45662992
keras	tensorflow
as amd doesn t work yet you have installed the gpu version of tensorflow you have installed cuda installation instructions verify that tensorflow is running with gpu check if gpu is working or from tensorflow.python.client import device_lib print device_lib.list_local_devices output will be something like this once all this is done your model will run on gpu to check if keras 2.1.1 is using gpu from keras import backend as k k.tensorflow_backend._get_available_gpus all the best
yes you can run keras models on gpu

onclick	onsubmit
since any of the following form elements cause a form submit you likely don t need an onclick handler on that button at all
well the documentation for the submit method is pretty clear that it doesn t trigger onsubmit

innodb	myisam
read details here if you really need to ensure that certain tables are not cached in the innodb buffer pool the only certain way is to alter the storage engine for those tables
non-innodb tables myisam are never cached in the innodb buffer pool

45665687
strcpy	strncpy
so when you strcpy back to the original string you are not passing a string to strcpy but an unterminated array
to include the terminator you would have to make the copy length one longer than strlen value -2 with strncpy copy value+2 strlen value - 1

45668670
lxml	beautifulsoup
simply reinstalling lxml as above solved the problem
fwiw i ran into a similar problem python 3.6 os x 10.12.6 and was able to solve it simply by doing first command is just to signify that i was working in a conda virtualenv i tried more complicated things first because beautifulsoup was working correctly with an identical command through jupyter+ipython but not through pycharm s terminal in the same virtualenv

45672217
swift	objective-c
an optional in objective-c would be used like this where it s swift counterpart with extension default would be
the optional directive is an objective-c only directive and has not been translated to swift

45672217
swift	objective-c
the optional directive is an objective-c only directive and has not been translated to swift
this doesn t mean that you can t use it in swift but that you have to expose your swift code to objective-c first with he objective-c attribute

45672217
implements	extends
when we look at the definition of extensions we can see that they are here to add implements new functionalities extensions add new functionality to an existing class structure enumeration or protocol type
this includes the ability to extends types for which you do not have access to the original source code

45672217
swift	objective-c
doing so will work as a swift only alternative to the optional directive discussed above
update while giving a default implementation to a protocol function in switch does make it optional it is fundamentally not the same as using the optional directive in objective-c

45674350
innodb	myisam
the myisam stopword list a list of words that is not included in the fulltext index and thus cannot be found is significantly longer than the default one used by innodb so everybody or unfortunately can be found with innodb but not with myisam
match against mary had a little lamb will usually contain a lot more results as had is a stopword in myisam but not in innodb

45674350
innodb	myisam
innodb supports to match exact phrases words in given order while myisam at least in natural language mode doesn t
so if you use match against mary had a little lamb innodb will only return a row if it contains this exact sentence while myisam will find every row that contains any of these words apart from had as mentioned above and a which is in both stopword lists

45674350
innodb	myisam
if you use match against +about +mary in boolean mode about is a stopword in both engines innodb will try to find that word in the index although it cannot be in there and thus return no results while myisam will ignore that word and can return results that may not contain about only mary
additionally the default values for the minimum word length ft_min_word_len for myisam default 4 and innodb_ft_min_token_size for innodb default 3 are different so if you do not adjust them the innodb index will contain and find more words

45676778
shadowing	named
dr shadowing is about name-lookup borrowing is about lifetimes
from a compiler point of view variables have no named this is not very readable for a human being so the language allows us to use descriptive named instead

45676778
shadowing	named
shadowing is an allowance on reusing named which for the lexical scope of the shadowing variable will resolve the named to the shadowing one __2 here instead of the original one __1 here
however just because the old one can no longer be accessed does not mean it no longer lives shadowing

45677006
uiview	subviews
i realize that this may not be possible in all cases but the regular uiview is much easier to customize to the app s appearance than the toolbar and navigation bar where apple has control of the button positioning
instead of setting our custom button as the custom view of the ui bar button object it was we set it as a subviews of the blank ui buttons in the custom view

45678401
dictionary	map
however i would suggest that it would be better to use an explicit for-loop as a two-liner note that this will add a separate value to each of the entries in the dictionary as this is what i interpret to be what is wanted
to use a true one-liner not writing a for-loop in one line it is possible to use map and exploit the mutability of dicts this will return but the dictionary will be updated

45679602
opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
very big but it s currently only supported in google-chrome and opera although polyfills do exist
microsoft edge lists the functionality as under consideration and firefox does not indent to implement it in its current state

45681747
stateless	stateful
instances of ejb s stateless and singleton are not passivation capable beans
stateful may be stateful is the only ejb session type which it makes sense to let cdi manage the life cycle of - never put a cdi scope on a stateless or singleton

45681835
google-chrome	firefox
i m working on a solution but currently haven t found one here s info audio from icecast server not playing in google-chrome
try playing it in firefox

45682129
treemap	linkedhashmap
and as you want to get the map sorted by the comparator create an instance of the treemap with the comparator and put all elements in that are contained in linkedhashmap
you cannot with a treemap

45682129
treemap	linkedhashmap
you cannot with a treemap
a workarround would be using a linkedhashmap to keep the insertion order

45686661
odoo	openerp
odoo 10 source code does not contain an import openerp anywhere maybe you have downloaded from the wrong source
import openerp won t work in odoo 10 because openerp is replaced with odoo

45690941
vb6	vba
because of this pointer-safe types are not needed use the 32 bit convention long in vb6
vba needs to be able to deal with 64 bit windows when its run within a 64 bit application such as one of the programs from the 64 bit office suite

45691088
pandas	seaborn
we can use seaborn.heatmap method yields or transposed first check pandas visualization online docs - whether it can cover your needs
seaborn module is pretty useful when working with pandas data sets - check seaborn gallery - it has couple of methods that are not implemented in pandas another greate visualization module is bokeh especially when we need to produce html reports

45693086
floating-point	fractions
with floating-point values we can t do that there a minimum exponent that we can t go below
in order to allow smaller values the ieee requirements say that when the exponent is the smallest representable value the fractions doesn t have to be normalized that is it doesn t have to have a 1 in its high bit

45695502
bash	shellcheck
as for programmatically determining what version of bash is required to run a specific script i m not aware of any tool that does that
shellcheck comes somewhat close in that it can warn about bashisms when your script starts with #

45698468
sudo	passwd
do not execute this command with sudo as that will attempt to change the shell for your root user rather than your current user
2 alternatively you can manually edit the file etc passwd on linux

45703099
.htaccess	httpd.conf
otherwise make sure the use of .htaccess files is enabled on the server as georgeos already suggested
note that httpd.conf is not always used ubuntu indicates it is deprecated but the official apache docs still says it is often the main configuration file

45703119
innodb	myisam
if you use innodb with single data file innodb_file_per_table setting is not enabled then all data will be stored in a single file anyway
with innodb separate file per table mode or with myisam table engine the only difference between one or multiple databases is really the directory where the database files are stored

45706221
verilog	vhdl
delay statements #100 are usually ignored during synthesis in verilog
so in synthesis it is the same as xlinx synthesis and simuation design guide states delays in synthesis code do not use wait for xx ns vhdl or the #xx verilog statements in your code

45706221
verilog	vhdl
... wait for xx ns statement verilog coding example #xx
do not use the after xx ns statement in your vhdl code or the delay assignment in your verilog code ... delay assignment verilog coding example xx specifies the number of nanoseconds that must pass before a condition is executed

45708544
ssl	https
https you should wrap your socket in ssl tunnel not sure if correct term in order to connect using https and get method is ready to use right after connection response
http in your original connection to port 80 you are just using wrong host response http 1.0 200 connection established or use get method right away response is the same as to https request google.com host doesn t work for some reason

45710370
hive	hdfs
joining in hive is not bad per se but if the two tables being joined are large may result in slow jobs
if one of the tables is significantly smaller than the other you may want to store it in hdfs cache making its data available in every node which allows the join algorithm to retrieve all data locally

45710552
profiling	debugging
use profiling based properties file
in application-dev.properties logging.level.com.acme warn and in application-prod.properties logging.level.com.acme debugging fyi when spring boot doesn t find a propertie in a profiling based file it use the value in the default one

45711306
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
in case 2 connect segue with uinavigationcontroller not with uiviewcontroller.
in case 1 make sure the visibility on uinavigationbar

45716107
phong	shading
while gouraud shading calculates the light in the the vertex shader phong shading calculates the light in the fragment shader
the standard opengl light model is a gouraud shading model with a blinn-phong light model do not confuse with phong shading

45716110
vb6	vba
note that registration-less com at least in theory can be used for all com related conflicts whether they are vb6 executables vc++ applications that use com etc.
i am honestly not sure if it works properly for office com addins dlls and vba forms

45717874
google-chrome	firefox
thus sometimes firefox throws cors while google-chrome does not
so i did 2 tests running your code snippet from the console and requesting from i think what happens in the 1st case is the fact that the request is done from the client next request headers are sent since google does not reply with - client and in the request i have origin google-chrome in my case throws cors error

45717957
fread	read.table
the multiple failures have various reasons fread doesn t work with unz
it does work with read.table

45718210
virtualenv	conda
although it is certainly not a good practice it is useful to know that you can add system-side packages inside virtualenv by symlinking them like this
it is not a good practice to mix packages managed by conda and native python

45721102
daemons	systemd
this specific actor will not be directly instantiated but instead the remote daemons of the remote systemd will be asked to create the actor which in this sample corresponds to sampleactorsystem 127.0.0.1 2553
once you have configured the properties above you would do the following in code the actor class sampleactor has to be available to the runtimes using it the classloader of the actor systemd has to have a jar containing the class

45721258
swift	objective-c
i believe the mangling format is undocumented as well so you can t rely on this not changing in some future swift release
if you need to be able to access a class using its name in the objective-c runtime you can use the objective-c attribute to give it a custom objective-c name

45721964
ionic	angular
angular 4 or simply angular is the next logical version of angular2 but it has nothing in common with angular 1 also called angularjs angular is written in typescript and so it comes with all the capabilities that typescript offers angular is also utilized in the cross platform mobile development framework called ionic and so it s not limited to web apps only to keep upgrading angular angular community has announced angular releases every 6 months here s the source for this answer and a beginner friendly tutorial on angular 4 angular 4 tutorial
angular 4 is an open source web development framework written and maintained by angular team at google

45722338
junit	mockito
and finally to cleanup the thread just call notify on the runnable instance of course the thread will end when junit finishes too anyway
as others have pointed out thread s isalive method is final and therefore cannot and probably should not not be mocked using mockito

45722854
factors	mean
either way i don t think this should be a deciding factors
i m not sure what you you mean by the normal approach - modular jars are the normal approach to create artifacts that the module system will create a module for

45725483
sum	coalesce
probably the safest method is sum coalesce revenue 0 - coalesce cost 0 over partition by year as totalprofit
here is one way sum revenue - cost over partition by year as totalprofit or sum revenue over partition by year - sum cost over partition by year as totalprofit these are not exactly the same -- and either could be off due to null values

45727917
virtualenv	conda
create conda virtualenv activate conda virtualenv source activate yourenvname install ipython notebook in this virtualenv if you have already user python virtualenv and installed ipython for that you can skip this step if you have multiple ipykernel here testenv should also be changed to another name install ipywidgets install catboost turn on jupyter notebook jupyter notebook and create a new notebook under python2 yourenvname then it should work note if doesn t work before step 8 try this pip install widgetsnbextension jupyter nbextension enable --py widgetsnbextension --sys-prefix
finally i solved the problem and now i can see this plot in my case the solution is to install conda and create a conda virtualenv then install ipywidgets through conda. let me write down all the details here hope it will help

45731838
bower	npm
npm was originally to get node module but with the essort of the javascript language and the advent of bower webpack etc it has a bit grown up
in fact you can even download bootstrap on npm that is not a server side framework

45732290
spaces	delimiter
incidentally isql would only recognise go in lower case only and not proceeded by any white spaces
the so-called delimiter go isn t any of part of sap sybase transact-sql language syntax

45748567
namedtuple	dictionary
therefore further manipulation of those objects will not have access to your __add__ method because they are not row s they are namedtuple s
as a user2357112 mentioned it seems like you re making things difficult for yourself and may be better off simply using dictionary

45748805
google-chrome	firefox
before you init three.js put some code like this then just selectively disable extensions until firefox google-chrome look the same as ie edge
the first thing i d test is disabling every extension that s in google-chrome firefox that s not in ie edge just to verify that turning them all off reproduces the ie edge behavior

45749160
firefox	safari
and the reason we have the html checker emit that warning is isn t supported in desktop safari or internet explorer nor in versions of firefox before firefox 57 nor on android before android 4.4
for the exact details about browser support see so that warning s purpose is to give you a heads-up that your document has a feature that doesn t work as specified for users of internet explorer safari and older versions of firefox and android

45751589
spaces	delimiter
if c is not empty then make the directories . a and . a b quoted because any spaces in the name would otherwise be seen as create two directories then move the file again quoted for the same reason
note that each character individually between and the close-quote is a delimiter - a delimiter-string is not supported

45753855
sudo	passwd
if you followed the steps correctly your user keshav should now be able to run sudo sbin somecommand without a passwd prompt
you can configure sudo to do not require passwd for a certain combination of user and command

45753855
sudo	passwd
you can configure sudo to do not require passwd for a certain combination of user and command
for instance if the username that needs to run the command is keshav and the command is at sbin somecommand first create a copy of your sudoers file just in case sudo cp etc sudoers etc sudoers.backup then edit the etc sudoers sudo visudo that command will open the etc sudoers file in your default editor

45759539
dictionary	map
the second part is normal dictionary literal syntax the magic bit is that dictionary map unique keys to some value so this is essentially a copy the row dictionary and replaces the dba name key with the new value
that works because literals are interpreted from left to right normally you would just create a copy of the dictionary and replace the key but that doesn t work in comprehensions assignment inside comprehensions is a syntaxerror so you need some magic or invoke special methods

45761287
neo4j	janusgraph
for personal learningk i d say that neo4j is the easiest to set up and learn - you download and run it and open a web browser onto their web-based console which only takes a few minutes
that being said if you re comfortable on a command line janusgraph only took a half hour to install and get running for me so it s not too hard

45761487
inline	constexpr
summary in c++17 the easiest way to define a global constant or a global variable is usually with an inline variable
you create one by simply putting a line like the following into your header file if the global constant is of literal type prefer using inline constexpr the inline is optional if it s a static class member instead of inline const this also works for variables but many of the advantages no longer apply so you might want to use another method details first the two main dis advantages to this method are it doesn t work before c++17 so if you need c++14 compatibility or earlier you ll need to do something else

45761487
inline	constexpr
you create one by simply putting a line like the following into your header file if the global constant is of literal type prefer using inline constexpr the inline is optional if it s a static class member instead of inline const this also works for variables but many of the advantages no longer apply so you might want to use another method details first the two main dis advantages to this method are it doesn t work before c++17 so if you need c++14 compatibility or earlier you ll need to do something else
the template trick vtt suggests is compatible with older standards and should have similar semantics to inline variables but it s a hack which is no longer necessary if you only need c++17 support

45761487
inline	constexpr
for example is possible with constexpr but not with just inline because with constexpr it knows that greeting.size is a compile-time constant and can be used as the size of an array.³ with optimizations this could compile to a just a single mov instruction and ret without including any copies of the string or array because it s unnecessary
with the new inline semantics everything before main could have been in a header file included in multiple places and there would still have been at most one copy

45766543
inline	inlining
not only is return apple illegal just plain return is also illegal because the non-local return requires inlining - see the answer by hotkey make dostuff inline and then it works .
note that such non-local returns are supported only for lambda expressions passed to inline functions. this section of the kotlin documentation covers returns at labels

45767223
boost	stl
you can also make your own implementation of the class though boost is an existing cross-platform implementation that you can use
because the specifics of how the classes are implemented is up to the compiler platform you re really not going to achieve what you re looking for with the stl

45767840
exponent	modulo
exponent the scalar arguments to ecpoint.multiply are most definitely not to be handled using ecfieldelement
scalars should be added to each other modulo the group order which is available via eccurve.getorder

45769913
implements	extends
you have to implements file validation in get_file_extension method and set allowed_types list
you use the default base64filefield that s why you receive exception value notimplementedtype object is not callable in this case you need to extends the default base64filefield and make your custom field along with validation method get_file_extension and set allowed_types list as a property

45771833
queue	fifo
if you want a queue the runs jobs in fifo order you want a serial queue
i see what you re saying about the docs claiming that the jobs will be submitted in fifo order but your test doesn t really establish the order in which they re run

45774898
swift	objective-c
because of these spurious objects the array cannot cross the bridge from objective-c to swift
the returned array is typed in swift as but the array contains things that are not uidynamicitem objects

45776937
hex	binary
assuming your variable s name is myvar if you would anyway use something external then use a hex editor or a language with commands to read and write binary not notepad
notepad has nothing to do with a mem file which is a binary file

45777348
ubuntu	linux
but windows server comes packaged with base image of ubuntu os after september 2016 beta service pack
that is the reason you can run linux on windows and not other wise

45777887
factors	matrix
library matrix # ok for this example sparsematrix seq_along x x # but if x does not contain sequence numbers use this instead sparsematrix seq_along x as.numeric factors x giving
here are some ways 1 outer this gives a matrix result giving 2 model.matrix this also gives a matrix result

45779696
factors	matrix
if the view matrix is scaled then you have to normalize the axis vectors or you have to take in account the scale factors in the side length of the quads the drawing of the rectangle should look somehow like this see also the answers to the following questions opengl billboard matrix billboard with math how to create billboard matrix in glm solution by using the model view matrix but the much more elegant solution would be to use the model view matrix to achieve the billboard effect
to do this you first have to apply the translation to the model matrix and not to the mesh and second you have to apply the inverse view rotation to the model matrix note for any solution you have to know the current model view matrix and you have to calculate the inverse modelview matrix

45780235
google-chrome	firefox
cross origin requests are only supported for protocol schemes http data google-chrome chrome-extension https. it s about browser politics
it works in firefox but not in chrome. if you want it to work you may run a web server on your local machine to serve the files

45782338
build.gradle	gradlew
this happens when build.gradle is not found for one of your package dependencies
to debug this issue inside your react native project run cd android . gradlew clean --info after running this command you can see where the building stops

45783910
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
i had the same error and installing of graphicsmagick not imagemagick helped me
i ve downloaded and installed graphicsmagick-1.3.26-q8-win64-dll.exe from ftp ftp.graphicsmagick.org pub graphicsmagick windows

45785774
required	placeholder
to create a variable just write your query and define placeholder for your variables in the format variablename when you do this metabase will automatically show the variables panel on the right and you must choose the type of this variable you can also mark the variable as required if you provide a default value
you should not escape the variable placeholder in your query that is why concat variable does not work and you can mark a whole expression as optional surrounding it with double-brackets

45788066
tensorflow	tensorboard
i tried tensorflow debugger tfdbg though this did not provide any further details as the problem was the graph did not initialize
i started to think the graph structure was incorrect so i dumped out the graph structure using tf.summary.filewriter . logs traing_graph graph i then used up tensorboard to inspect the resultant summary graph structure data dumped out the the directory and found that the tensor dimensions of the fully connected layer was wrong having a width of 15million

45789055
ubuntu	debian
in fact debian ubuntu appear to have the non-standard directories of questionable utility called etc nginx sites-available and etc nginx sites-enabled which by default must contain a default file with a presumptuous listen 80 default_server effectively taking precedence over any other listen of the same port in the absence of a more specific server_name
as such there are multiple independent solutions do not use fundamentally broken packages like those offered by debian ubuntu

45789055
ubuntu	debian
as such there are multiple independent solutions do not use fundamentally broken packages like those offered by debian ubuntu
i once spent a good amount of time pulling my hair trying to figure out why my configs don t work only to notice that even the backup files from emacs like test.conf get included in debian through debian s default . sites-enabled is evil

45794415
inline	inlining
assertions prevent optimisations like inlining as the method is larger and size is a factor in determining whether to inline a method
typically inlining improves performance but in some cases it doesn t as it can cause the l0 or l1 cpu caches to become inefficient due to larger code being generated

45794500
swift	objective-c
you seem to e comparing ignoredproperties with these two things a swift property without dynamic a property that is of a type not supported by realm for the first kind realm seems to still store these in the database
and the database this is because dynamic is just a way to tell swift to use dynamic dispatch in the objective-c runtime which allows the properties to be updated dynamically at runtime

45795116
keras	tensorflow
installed keras conda install keras best thing was it even installed tensorflow as it s dependency
np_utils is a separate package and a keras dependency - which doesn t get install with it

45795116
keras	tensorflow
np_utils is a separate package and a keras dependency - which doesn t get install with it
can be installed using pip pip install np_utils using - keras 2.0.6 suggestion for some odd and still unknown reasons even after installing the import from keras.utils.np_utils import to_categorical didn t work - i had to restart the notebook first restart even didn t work and once it worked i got stuck again for same import call gave exception for no module named tensorflow - as in utils there s another import from

45795626
swift	objective-c
you should not ignore any warnings displayed with recommended settings. seconde in swift 4 you need to explicitly annotate methods invoked through selector with objective-c
in very limited cases swift implicitly applies the notation but not many. so your code shown should be this is not critical but you should better follow a simple coding rule of swift -- only type names are capitalized

45797344
punctuation	words
a major benefit to this function is that it seamlessly omits punctuation -- for instance if the the op s sample string had a period at the end this function would omit it from the array
furthermore it is important to note what is considered a words for the purpose of this function words is defined as a locale dependent string containing alphabetic characters which also may contain but not start with and - characters

45802643
jar	war
i suggest using the jar because it does not make sense to use a war file as a dependency it doesn t really make sense to use a springboot executable jar as a dependency either
steps make the packaging value equal the packaging type of the main artifact jar

45805334
debian	linux
ref how to know distro name execute command it is also possible your system administrator does not permit you or did not put you in the group of users who have sudo permissions to execute apt-get but if you have sudo access try to execute with if debian or if you are using fedora
check the linux distribution apt-get works in debian based distro whereas yum works in fedora based distro

45806404
rdf	owl
it provides limited inference over the rdf graph
for example if you had ex ispartof owl inverseof ex haspart . ex apartment1 ex haspart ex room1. then a query rdf_has x myont ispartof y will return a result with and even though it is not explicitly stated it is entailed by the semantics of owl and by your inverseof declaration

45812107
pdcurses	ncurses
most notably ncurses is available for many systems even including windows but for windows you also have pdcurses
there s even an extended pdcurses for windows that implements its own console window so you can use features the native windows console doesn t have

45817710
required	placeholder
i really recommand you to choose one of those two approach since i can t figure out a case which required to display 40 videos on one page with one load
i don t know why you need 40 videos in the same page but i would not at all recommand that youtube youtube doesn t display 20 videos per page but 20 placeholder images that are used as link to click on in order to display the video

45817955
translation	localization
you than provide a target translation string for this unit and it will be used in place of all the source strings
the ids should not change between multiple runs of the localization tool since they are based on the content of the strings themselves

45825531
bash	subshell
then i used advice elsewhere on backgrounding and pushd popd spawn a background process in a bash function
what works nicely for me is with a subshell as above actually one does not need pushd adir

45829993
super	implements
you need two-argument super explicitly providing the name of the current class you re trying to bypass looking for superclasses then self e.g
since you re not doing anything in basemodel.__init__ the correct approach is to not implements it at all

45837940
inline	inlining
currently functions with loops are not inline
go wiki compileroptimizations function inlining only short and simple functions are inline

45837940
inline	inlining
go wiki compileroptimizations function inlining only short and simple functions are inline
to be inline a function must contain less than 40 expressions and does not contain complex things like function calls loops labels closures panic s recover s select s switch es etc

45842716
cdr	cons
racket prints cons cells as dotted pairs if their cdr isn t a list
examples from drracket foldr op z ls takes ls and replaces nil with z and cons with op

45842775
namenode	hdfs
so find the hostname of the namenode and use that in the path so instead of .option path hdfs hdfs_path you should be using .option path hdfs hostname port hdfs_path
the error suggests that you are not using hostname and port after hdfs but you are giving path as hdfs user .

45843356
ionic	angular
watch the talk of the ionic team members at polymer summit it explains the purpose of stencil pretty good
basically it is not a framework like angular or react it is a compiler which helps you creating spec conform web components which run in every browser that supports web components or almost any browser using polyfills

45843480
matlab	simulink
i had the same issue with the matlab help browser running on manjaro linux with gnome
these instructions from the mathworks site solved the problem for me simulink welcome page doesn t open on linux in your matlab directory usr local matlab r2017a bin glnxa64 delete libfreetype.so.6 and libfreetype.so.6.11.1 after backing up these files than create a symbolic link with the following commands ln -s usr lib64 libfreetype.so.6 usr local matlab r2017a bin glnxa64 libfreetype.so.6 ln -s usr lib64 libfreetype.so.6.13.0 usr local matlab r2017a bin glnxa64 libfreetype.so.6.13.0 look for your version of libfreetype.so..

keras	tensorflow	theano	tensorflow	theano	keras
disclaimer i m very new to keras but have a lot of experience with theano and blocks
further i tested this only with theano as a backend but not tensorflow

implements	extends
the android vm is not a standard vm and only implements a subset of the java specification
as long as google does not choose to extends its jvm i am afraid that this feature will not work

45855518
xmltype	clob
almost all xml functions return varcahr2 values not nvarcahr2 also most of xmltype member functions work with clob not nclob
if you just read and store your xml documents as xmltype in your database it should be fine however as soon you start any operations with these data sooner or later you will hit a conversion error

45858175
postgresql	mysql
the mysql data source plugin has just been added to grafana and the postgresql plugin is on the grafana roadmap and should be released later in the year
if you are wondering why there are so many data sources supported but not postgresql it is because relational databases are not traditionally what grafana is used for

45858184
super	extends
from django.core.management import commanderror from django.core.management.commands.test import command as testcommand class command testcommand def __init__ self from django.conf import settings try if not settings.test_setting raise commanderror command error except raise commanderror command error super command self .__init__
you can creat your own test command by extends django s test command

45858357
punctuation	words
in order to account for punctuation numbers and other non-words you need to extract all sequences of lowercase letters as words instead of splitting the input string on spaces only
the statement of the problem says that the words will consist of lowercase letters only but it doesn t guarantee that the input string will contain only words and spaces

45860162
swift	objective-c
you cannot add associated objects to a swift array or any swift value type
objc_setassociatedobject and objc_getassociatedobject are from the objective-c runtime they expect an instance of nsobject as first argument

45865567
virtualenv	conda
the thing is unless you specify to conda that you want to install something specifically to a virtualenv it will end up in the root env i m not sure if this is by design but this is what happenes on my machine
so if you want to install to a virtualenv conda install -n env_name package_name if it s a conda install

45868275
express	node.js
you don t need a framework to write a node.js server but a framework like express makes your programming job much easier
whether you use express or not makes no difference to how you start your node server

45868275
express	node.js
whether you use express or not makes no difference to how you start your node server
simple node.js server without express launch this server by running node index.js

45868356
spaces	delimiter
the part before read prevents spaces from being stripped from either end see the comments below. we can then unzip just the file we re iterating on again using unzip -p to get it printed to standard output so it can be stored in the inner while loop as
experimental simplification i m not sure how reliable this would be but you might be able to do this more simply as this should work because unzip -p archive spits out the contents of each file in the archive all concatenated together without any delimiter or metadata like the file name and because the gzip format accepts concatenating archives together see my notes on concatenated archives so the gunzip -c pipeline command sees raw gzip data and decompresses it out on the console which is then passed to the shell s while loop

45872631
postorder	inorder
it is true for a postorder traversal because that s just the reverse of the preorder traversal of the reversed tree
it is not true for an inorder traversal which would always start with null end with null and alternate between nulls and nodes

45873816
punctuation	words
this beginning is defined as various factors like being at the start of a line having a space or other punctuation etc and similarly says match the end such as the next character being the end of file or end of line space or punctuation etc
so if you have a line like user1 user2 user3user4 and would match as there are words start and end points surrounding them but fails because there is a u after user3 which is not an end of words character and fails because there is a 3 before user4 which is not a start of words character

45878051
prepare	execute
if it is not then consider using mysql prepare statement for this process
prepare the query before the loop and then in the loop just adjust the parameters and then execute the prepare statement again

45878118
inline	inlining
you can do the binary search yourself if you are able to use c++14 and can use auto for return type deduction and auto for generic lambda expressions you can go even further i guess this is harder to inline for the compiler but much more compfortable to use and also it is not impossible
to check for inlining i modified the c++14 version to this objdump delivers the following output the calls to and je .

45882036
serializable	deserialization
it s up to the implementation of the serializable
sodiumoxide has chosen to implement all serializable by converting the types to a slice and then serializing that since slices do not have a size known at compile time serializable must include the length so that deserialization can occur

45884362
super	implements
but if you implements viewdidload you should always call super
this is correct that if you implements loadview you should not call super

45884362
super	implements
this is correct that if you implements loadview you should not call super
as the documentation says your custom implementation of this method should not call super

45886545
vsto	add-in
though many vsto collections use 1-based index selecteditems is not one of them
also note that you should never ever use new application in a vsto add-in

45886545
vsto	add-in
all vsto add-in by default get globals.thisaddin.application or this.application if you re already in thisaddin class that you can use to access current application instance
so your original code should be like this method 2 all vsto and other winforms wpf apps since filedialog is not available in outlook an alternate way is to use microsoft.win32 dialogs for the same purpose

45887106
google-chrome	firefox
indeed it seems in google-chrome some of the clicks do not generate the change event
i could not reproduce it in firefox

45889698
udp	tcp
udp is not practical for receiving data from the server because it s connectionless and doesn t guarantee the packets will be received in order or received at all
with tcp it s all or nothing - either you will receive all the packets in order or the socket will be closed at some point as the sender s buffer gets filled with unacknowledged packets

45890370
super	self
create method receive a dict as parameter and you should call in this way self.create vals if you already being in the model that you want create for if you are not you should call create method with super something like this super class_name self .create vals vals it s the dict
edit the definition of create method is def create self vals you could see in this link as you can see it reviced two parameters self vals when you call this method i.e super class_name self .create vals self is implicit like passed self thats why you get the error typeerror create takes exactly 2 arguments 5 given couse self contains cr uid ids .

45894759
email	dkim
below is my email sender using java mail if it s going to help anyone out there
solved the issue. i am not sure exactly what was happening but when using the springboot javamailsenderimpl to send emails using aws ses all emails were not being signed using dkim no dkim headers on the outgoing email messages

45894759
email	dkim
solved the issue. i am not sure exactly what was happening but when using the springboot javamailsenderimpl to send email using aws ses all email were not being signed using dkim no dkim headers on the outgoing email messages
this was causing some smtp servers to treat our email as spam

45895447
implements	extends
when you create an object which implements an interface curly braces is not needed since interface does not have a constructor
on the other hand when you create an object which extends a class curly braces is needed

45895947
seaborn	matplotlib
this somehow renders the use of seaborn obsolete but for completeness here is the facetgrid solution
before we start let me mention that matplotlib requires the errors to be relative to the data not absolute boundaries

45895947
pandas	seaborn
let s start with a solution which does not use seaborn but the pandas plotting wrapper the reason will become clear later
not using seaborn pandas allows to plot grouped barplots by using dataframes where each column belongs to or constitutes one group

45896960
strcpy	malloc
you need to malloc a buffer and strcpy said string prior to returning it
the result of -string must not be treated as a malloc d pointer

45898204
rvm	bundler
here is an example that looks similar to your case where bundler was installed but path wasn t correct and bundler versions were mixed cannot load such file -- bundler setup loaderror if you are using rvm you might want to take a look at loaderror cannot load such file -- bundler setup
few steps to solve this type of issue make sure that bundler is properly installed

45899081
udp	tcp
of course http protocol has more overheads comparing to udp websockets or protocols upon them but it doesn t need additional security configurations easy to use and scale
websockets require keeping tcp connection all the time and is harder to scale

45899202
multiplying	division
integer division is microcoded as multiple uops on intel so it always has more impact on surrounding code that integer multiplying
there s less demand for high-performance integer division so the hardware support isn t as fancy

45899202
multiplying	division
but with multiple accumulators that you divide or multiplying at the end you can hide the latency and still saturate the throughput
note that bottlenecks on add latency or div throughput but not div latency because the division isn t on the critical path the loop-carried dependency chain

45902173
nfa	dfa
it s not very difficult to convert from nfa to dfa
but to directly approach dfa is very tough

45903853
octree	quadtree
quadtree depending on the dimensionality you could also use quadtree octree but standard implementations are not good for more than 10 dimensions or so
in the reference above i tested a quadtree with a special hypecube navigation approach

45907049
sqoop	hadoop
2 the documentation states where configurations are loaded from sqoop will fall back to hadoop_home
if it is not set either sqoop will use the default installation locations for apache bigtop usr lib hadoop and usr lib hadoop-mapreduce respectively

45907351
addition	multiplication
it s more like then the output is completely equal with repeated addition you would accumulate floating point rounding errors
the multiplication is still affected by rounding but the error doesn t accumulate

45908816
uilabel	uibutton
you have to define height width x and y positioning for both the name uilabel and the info uilabel
font size places a dominant role for height with uilabels and width can be based on the number of characters in the uilabel x font size so you do not have to explicity express height and width constraints for a uilabel but for a uibutton you would have to explicitly define constraints for x y width height

45908816
uilabel	uibutton
font size places a dominant role for height with uilabel and width can be based on the number of characters in the uilabel x font size so you do not have to explicity express height and width constraints for a uilabel but for a uibutton you would have to explicitly define constraints for x y width height
for uilabel we only have to define x and y constraints

45912122
uilabel	uitextview
another suggestion is to make invisible uilabel with properties set like below then inside textview s delegate method update label s text and i m not sure either of these will actually work since i haven t tested them for myself but i hope this may help you to set a start point for this problem
i believe you have a great reason to use uitextview and thus i think this can be little tricky and needs a lot of testing to see it actually works just as you expected

45912948
daemons	systemd
note when a daemons process is started from systemd the systemd can arrange everything described above so the process does not have to
calling setsid is usually one of the steps a process goes through when becoming a so called daemons process

45914475
google-chrome	firefox
you can observe that in google-chrome the first container snaps to the bottom while the other divs has a scroll relative to the top
in firefox or ie 11 you cannot observe this behavior

45918740
opencv	emgucv
in opencv c++ i declare my flow matrix such as then convert it to an image by mapping the magnitude and the orientation of the flow to the color space
i m not an emgucv expert but if i remember correctly image can only store integer values. if you define flow as an image you will lose information because disopticalflow should return a float matrix

45920195
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this is the one that works on firefox google-chrome opera and edge not tested on safari
some parts are useless on some browsers of course and tests should be made for attribute existence for old browsers support but this works for firefox the blur is useless but necessary in google-chrome

45921471
jmeter	blazemeter
most probably your issue is due to missing correlation not detected by smartjmx wrong correlation done by some extractor added by smartjmx you can debug this using jmeter view results tree and debug sampler or debug postprocessor and comparing a recording with a play of your script to see what differs
smartjmx is a commercial third party tool by blazemeter and its code is non public

45924232
serializable	deserialization
to have the execution continue to the next de serializable eg
note that the code examples are just off the top of my head you are not limited to using the apparently builtin deserialization of the orm odm of your choice

45924232
serializable	deserialization
note that the code examples are just off the top of my head you are not limited to using the apparently builtin deserialization of the orm odm of your choice
thus you can do any custom logic you need in the serializable functions

45926995
profiling	instrumentation
however you can still get to paint instrumentation in the performance tab of the developer tools developer tools - performance - settings - enable advanced paint instrumentation this will not enable continuous repaint since as far as i can tell chrome no longer does that but will allow you to see a profiling of how your page actually worked during recording and can be very useful for tracking down performance problems
it is integrated with other performance profiling data as well

45927652
persistent	transient
solution2 you can just cascade the payments so when the bill is persistent the payments will be persistent as well
you are trying to persist an object which has relation to a transient object your payments are not managed so when you try to save your bill you will get this exception

45929176
swift	objective-c
i am very late to this but i want to mention that that new is actually unsafe in the objective-c with swift world
swift will only create a default init method if you do not create any other initializer

45929503
swift	objective-c
as a result you cannot implement a hidden singleton in swift by returning some other object
in objective-c an initialiser is just like any other method that is called on an instance you first alloc an instance and then explicitly invoke its initialiser

45929983
ng-show	ng-class
basically what i did was remove things like ng-hide ng-show from the elements that were supposed to have animation and instead i ve put ng-class to manipulate the visibility while maintaning the animation
the reason that ng-hide ng-show aren t the best ideas for animation is that they apply display block property to your element thus any transition applied to them will not work

45932007
inline	inlining
and as you stated it is up to the compiler to actually inline the asm or not
if it states that inlining won t make any benefit it may even be slower than a sub-function it won t inline the function

45933599
calloc	malloc
if you want to initialize the memory then either do it explicitly or use calloc to allocate and clear zero the memory it s equivalent to malloc followed by memset
the malloc function only allocates memory it does not initialize that memory in any way

45933790
ubuntu	debian
i got in touch with google cloud support who gave the following response script definition is kept under var run google.startup.script if the script does not run initially you can force it manually with sudo google_metadata_script_runner --script-type startup # for debian or # sudo usr share google run-startup-scripts # on ubuntu and older images i m posting this information here because it is not in their documentation as of august 2017
i m not sure how helpful it is since the google.startup.script didn t exist in my case using the latest debian image on gce but i did run the other commands

45939831
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
when you extend runtimeexception you are creating an unchecked-exception that is all there is to this
and yes you are correct it is a bit awkward that runtimeexception extends exception but is not a checked exception

45942373
tvos	ios
according the charles proxy page for setting up ssl certificates as of tvos 10.2 it is no longer possible to trust the charles root certificate so it is not possible to use ssl proxying with tvos 10.2
this appears to be because the certificate trust settings menu is not available see ios devices above

45945948
google-chrome	firefox
in addition google-chrome uses the os keychain while firefox provides its own
so you may have marked the generated server certificate as trusted within firefox but this would not translate to google-chrome

45947584
haskell	scheme	scheme	racket
thus it has more in common with haskell than scheme which is an applicative order evaluating language
in racket you have a dialect #lang lazy which is as close to scheme you get but since its lazy you have normal order evaluation if you cannot change the language you can just wrap it in a lambda to get it delayed

45961669
spaces	delimiter
to allow spaces you have to use quotes leading to regsvr32 c program files x86 pfps blahblah.dll where the path to the file is handled as single argument for regsvr32
it s explained here on ss64 about cd chdir if command extensions are enabled default the cd command is enhanced as follows ... cd does not treat spaces as delimiter so it is possible to cd into a subfolder name that contains a space without surrounding the name with quotes

45961851
retrofit	okhttp
edit above mentioned case makes sense if you have multiple retrofit instances
you should explicitly provide an okhttp instance to retrofit otherwise retrofit would implicitly perform .client new okhttpclient thus you d not get a lot of smart things disk caching connection pooling

45961851
retrofit	okhttp
you should explicitly provide an okhttp instance to retrofit otherwise retrofit would implicitly perform .client new okhttpclient thus you d not get a lot of smart things disk caching connection pooling
see how jake wharton clarifies the case in making retrofit work for you talk

45962084
retrofit	okhttp
retrofit does get an instance of okhttp by itself but does not perform any customization of the okhttpclient
in a lot of cases you might need to customize you client to take advantage of the flexibility of okhttp

45962963
noexcept	throw
b s destructor will destroy m which is not a noexcept operations
you can t be sure that b won t throw so it is also noexcept false

45968064
uiview	subviews
the uiview flag for that is
you could also check if your developers set this to true and then set accessible subviews if you re concerned that the hierarchy might not be getting refreshed you could try telling it to refresh after your error view appears via uiaccessibilitypostnotification uiaccessibilitylayoutchangednotification myerrorlabel

45977761
google-chrome	firefox
i tried in google-chrome 60 on linux and it worked
seems not to work in firefox though

45989142
hex	binary
if you want it to be padded to the nearest nibble you can do which will have the output 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 as demonstrated both of these work on arbitrary length hex strings not just single digits
both of these work by first parsing the hex-string into an integer using the int function and then formatting that integer as binary

45990055
inline	constexpr
lib.cpp in c++17 there is a new feature inline variables which lets you say and this is an inline definition that can appear repeatedly and each definition defines the same entity just like all the other inline entities in the language
in your current example there is no difference on variable declarations constexpr implies const and a const variable at namespace scope has internal linkage by default so adding static does not change anything

45991173
implements	extends
and either a or b would be a union type . when thinking about it i couldn t see any immediate reason that theoretically the compiler couldn t say at that line okay from now on i ll check everything added to this list has inherited from that object class and implements these interfaces. objects are instances of classes
classes extends classes not objects. you are correct

45991491
cdr	cons
setting car and cdr doesn t work for changing an empty list into a one element list with a given value
all variables pointing to nil will not have changed thus the method of using rplacd setf cdr var ... works if your data structure had a head element that is never used defun make-stack list stack-head defun push-stack element stack assert eq car stack stack-head setf cdr stack cons element cdr stack stack defun pop-stack stack let popped cadr stack setf cdr stack cddr stack popped this however doesn t work unless you specifically design it so so push really needs to alter the variable and not the value since then it works always

45991530
division	exponent
the double operation 1.0 x rounds to +inf if and only if the mathematical result of the division is above the number 1.fffffffffffff8p1023l
this number is not representable as a double but it is exactly the midpoint between dbl_max and what would be the next double value after dbl_max if the double exponent had a wider range

45994113
required	placeholder
you re measuring not only the execution time of tf.subtract but also the time required from transferring the input data from the cpu memory to the gpu memory this is your bottleneck
to avoid it don t use placeholder to feed the data but generate it with tensorflow if you have to randomly generate it or if you have to read them use the tensorflow input pipeline

45995078
dictionary	map
one problem you will face is that dictionary s are inherently unordered
so first enfore the order by putting the values in an ordered container a list works fine now the essays then a simple loop building a map from mylist to each essay weights and using the statistics package for a mean function honestly not sure if pandas is the best tool for this but i suppose you could use a dataframe like this then make a grouper-mapping then use pd.dataframe.groupby edit after the comment the fix is quite simple you just materialize the weights into a list filter for 0 like so and then take the mean of that list

45995121
viewdidload	viewdidappear
in certain situations setting the uicollectionviewflowlayout in viewdidload or viewwillappear may not effect on the collectionview
setting the uicollectionviewflowlayout in viewdidappear may cause see the changes of the cells sizes in runtime

45996352
required	placeholder
the error says that you are not feeding a placeholder that is required for running the optimizer tensor
from the placeholder name in the error message placeholder_150 you can tell that you have created many placeholder
