ienumerable	ilist
ienumerable does not allow indexed access to the collection whereas ilist does
thus ilist is more than ienumerable and you won t be able to get away with it

2000456
ienumerable	ilist
if you need to go from ienumerable to ilist you may try a cast first if you get lucky it will work
if not you ll have to foreach over the ienumerable collection and build a new ilist

2002620
struts	stripes
reason i am asking is i am looking at a web application and they seem to be using both spring and struts
using struts 2 or stripes doesn t exclude using spring for dependency injection and other services

2003499
innodb	myisam
for example innodb stores multiple tables in its tablespace and the data file timestamp does not apply
for myisam the data file timestamp is used

2005181
udp	tcp
the dangerous part of udp is that unlike tcp ip it doesn t do any handshake
effectively this means that an attack app could be built that floods a local network with udp packets

2005181
icmp	udp
the external server doesn t have to send anything at all back only nice boxes will send back icmp errors
i also imagine there could be some pretty creative ways to overwhelm a firewall that supports udp traversal

2005516
implements	extends
of course you you can specialize once you have these types but this has to be done by someone who implements these types
2 do not provide default one and specialize for basic types it s not ideal too depends on how many basic types you expect to use 3 use isderivedfrom trick calling test outputs as i understand that s your goal extends it to work with more types like wrap is possible but messy too but it does the trick - you don t need to do a bunch of specializations

2005786
vb.net	vb6
vb6 created the .exe in the same directory as the project vb.net doesn t
vb6 s app.path really does do the same thing as application.executablepath it is just that the .exe is written to a different directory

2006682
spweb	spsite
found a solution myself the trick i did not know is that if you use a long url in the constructor of the spsite it gives you the spweb object with the deepest possible address that matches your url described here still i have to loop through all the lists to find out which list has the required url
a simple function that does what i need update 2012-08-01 no need to loop through list collection there is a getlist method in spweb object

2008353
punctuation	words
a valid name in javascript must start with a unicode letter dollar sign or underscore then can contain any of those characters as well as numbers combining diacritical accent characters and various joiner punctuation and zero-width spaces
additionally it cannot be a words reserved by the javascript language abstract as boolean break byte case etc

2008613
client-side	server-side
you cannot access it from client-side code javascript
the repeater and the dataitem s are server-side control which is available from the code-behind of your pages controls

2009535
firefox	safari
update you can see your code working here if you visit the page in firefox 3.5
known bug this does not work in safari 4 but it has been fixed in the yet unreleased at the time of this writing 1.8 version of jquery ui

2010807
dictionary	map
however you can iterate over the dictionary noting which keys map to the desired value obviously this is not efficient for large dictionary though
yes the dictionary is basically a one way street

2010813
dictionary	map
dictionary do not work like this nor are they intended to
how would you resolve the following you could do this but if you really need to go back and forth between keys and values you should consider encapsulating the problem into a two-way map

2012554
multiplying	multiplication
execution time is not used to multiplying those values
instead multiplication is done at compile time

2012976
udp	tcp
but for handling udp broadcasts you should have a look at jgroups jgroups is a toolkit for reliable multicast communication
note that this doesn t necessarily mean ip multicast jgroups can also use transports such as tcp

2014241
apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx
even with the most lightweight apache however the cost is about 2-3mb per worker so with apache alone you might be talking 3gb+ of memory just to handle the connections not to mention other possibly limited os resources like process ids file descriptors and buffers and this is before considering your application code
for lighttpd nginx they can handle a large number of connections thousands in a tiny memory footprint often just a few megs per thousand connections depends on factors like buffers and how async io apis are set up

2014241
apache	nginx
for a production deployment we have been very happy with nginx in front of apache with mod_wsgi in this instance
the apache does not do any access logging nor does it handle static files allowing us to disable a large number of the modules inside apache to keep it small footprint

2016745
dictionary	map
dictionary can t be used as keys because they re not hashable
this doesn t make any less meaningful practical necessary to map dictionary to other objects

2016745
dictionary	map
this doesn t make any less meaningful practical necessary to map dictionary to other objects
as i understand the python binding system you can bind any dictionary to a number of variables or the reverse depends on your terminology which means that these variables all know the same unique pointer to that dictionary

2017193
client-side	server-side
why this works you do not start the timer before they see the quiz the network delay is factored in because the timer does not start until the ajax request comes in if they have a slow connection the ajax request will be slow ping is not spoofable because you make sure the session variable does not exist before storing edit i wanted to add that you could continue to keep client-side time and include it in the final post
then you can compare it with your server-side calculated time

2018943
jar	manifest.mf
an executable jar has a main class defined in the jar s manifest.mf file and the manifest also allows the definition of a class path to include libraries that the code in the executable jar will need
the class path definition in the manifest must enumerate every jar or folder to put on the class path relative paths are relative to the location of the executable jar - not to paths contained inside the executable jar

2018943
jar	manifest.mf
any libraries your code needs is placed as jar files in the final jar s lib folder
and last but not least the final jar s manifest.mf file tells one-jar what your main class is

2021306
inline	inlining	inline-functions	inlining
one way to find out if the function is inline is to use -winline gcc option -winline warn if a function can not be inline and it was declared as inline. even with this option the compiler will not warn about failures to inline-functions declared in system headers. the compiler uses a variety of heuristics to determine whether or not to inline a function
for example the compiler takes into account the size of the function being inline and the amount of inlining that has already been done in the current function

2021600
opera	google-chrome
if it works in safari and opera you can t be too far off
i would suggest double-checking wherever you ve made browser checks - particularly making sure things you do for ie aren t getting applied to google-chrome

2022006
nfa	dfa
if you do not count the starting state then you can do the following construction create n nodes and for each set out of 2 n create a unique label and in the nfa add a transition with this label to each node of that set
this gives you a nfa with n+1 states 1 being the starting state where the dfa requires 2 n +1 states

2022410
realloc	malloc
it is possible to realloc a non null malloc 0 pointer
having a malloc 0 verbatim is not much use though

2023448
udp	tcp
uhh jason tcp does not use udp
tcp uses ip which is why you often see it referred to as tcp ip

2024372
queue	fifo
since disabling interrupts is like owning a lock in this context you could implement the queue as contiguous memory or ontop of a slist
the former means copying out the memory to the stack of the main-loop on pop which might be slower -- however provided your fifo has enough memory you should not have to allocate slist nodes from a heap -- which means no memory management headaches

2025113
ssl	https
therefore if you have ssl enabled for the webserver simply adding https to the url will encrypt the connection and whatever page the url points to will be encrypted while in transit
so is encrypted and is not encrypted i prefer for that to never happen so i always put my encrypted pages in a subdomain eg. ssl comes with a couple of gotcha s 1 a basic ssl certificate will only be valid for a specific domain name so if the certificate for is www.website.com and someone follows a link for website.com a warning will be displayed

2025182
jsf	stripes	jsf	wicket
personally i m a jsf 1.x skeptic so i would not go in this direction there isn t lots of demand for jsf in my country anyway but rather choose an alternative
i think that struts 2 spring mvc stripes this one is my preferred one wicket this one is getting more and more attention are all decent choices they ll all get the job done the 2 first one being i believe more asked on the job market but not the smartest

2025423
inline	inlining
you are not seeing any error because some violations particularly those that span translation units are not required to be diagnosed what going on under the covers is that the compiler is not inlining those functions many compilers will not inline a function unless the code is compiled with the optimizer
since the function is inline and can appear in multiple translation units the compiler will mark the function as link-once which tells the linker that it not treat multiple definitions as an error but just use one of them

2026688
uiview	subviews
create a uiview containing a date picker and a toolbar with a done button on it
in code or use interface builder doesn t matter. add the popup view as a subviews of your main view

2027842
division	subtraction
gcd can of course be done much faster if you use division rather than subtraction o n 2
so when we say that testing primality was proved in 2002 to be done in polynomial time that s the technical definition of complexity and we mean polynomial in the number of digits which is the tricky part not polynomial in the input number itself which is trivially easy to do in sub-linear time using trial division

2027842
division	subtraction
again this is not ambiguous once you know what the terms of reference are but beware of incorrectly comparing the first analysis i gave of euclid s algorithm with division o n 2 against this analysis of the algorithm with subtraction o n
n is not the same in each and subtraction is not faster

2027872
google-chrome	safari
for example i have noticed that onclick attribute doesn t work in google-chrome when onclick is typed
safari nor google-chrome doesn t respect some attributes

2028408
factors	mean
these factors are sometimes mutually exclusive in terms of standard definitions of efficiency one would often utilize big-0 notation however in the real world outside academia normally one would profiling benchmarking both equations and then compare the results it s often difficult to make general assumptions about big-0 notation as this is primarily concerned with looping and assumes a fixed cost for the code within a loop so benchmarking would be the better way to go one caveat to watch out for is that sometimes the result can vary significantly based on the dataset size you re working with - for small n in a loop one will sometimes not find much difference
firstly one would need to define what more efficient means does it mean quicker uses less system resources such as memory etc.

2029978
interpolation	splines
b interpolation if you have a function where some points but not the whole curve
are given and you need a function to get through this points you can use several methods newton-gregory newton with divided differences lagrange hermite splines c curve fitting you have a function with given points and you want to draw a curve with a given

2031456
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
unchecked-exception -- runtimeexception and subclasses -- are not declared and may be thrown by any method
that said if your method commonly throws an unchecked-exception it s a good idea to document that fact in javadoc

2031555
allocator	stl
with stl containers you can provide your own allocator via an optional template parameter
i wouldn t recommend writing an entire allocator from scratch but you could write one that s just a wrapper around new and delete but ensures that the returned memory meets your alignment requirement

2034768
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i did not want any of the uiviewcontroller included in the more tab to rotate
my solution was to create my own uitabbarcontroller which i called mytabbarcontroller then i implemented the shouldautorotatetointerfaceorientation method i needed to discover if the more tab was selected

2035852
lisp	scheme
it is relatively common in the lisp community
some university classes will use scheme to write a language subset this is not a compiler class activity

2035917
ssl	https
serving static content on a cloud like amazon is an option and some of the cloud providers let you use https as well as long as you are fine with using a subdomain of their domain name due to technical limitations in ssl
while serving pages over http may be faster though i doubt https is not monstrously slow for small files a good lot of browsers will complain if included resources such as images and js are not on https url s

2040311
plone	buildout
buildout works just fine with plone 3.1.2
i ve also done buildouts for plone 2.5.5 and even one for plone 2.1 although this last one was a bit tricky because the required python for that version doesn t do buildout

2040311
plone	buildout
i ve also done buildouts for plone 2.5.5 and even one for plone 2.1 although this last one was a bit tricky because the required python for that version doesn t do buildout
so if you prefer the buildout route just do it

2042154
git-svn	svn2git
this is similar to so question cloning a non-standard svn repository with git-svn and i am not sure there is a process to fix the git repo after that initial clone
the deep clone is the official way but i like the encapsulation provided by svn2git

2044311
awt	swing
i have used both and i prefer swing over awt
also you do not need to learn awt to learn swing basics

2044870
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox
here are where we stand so far test page firefox 2.0 -- pass grey 1px line firefox 3.0 -- fail firefox 3.5 -- pass shadow internet explorer 6.0 -- pass grey 1px line internet explorer 7.0 -- pass grey 1px line internet explorer 8.0 -- pass grey 1px line safari 3.0 -- pass shadow safari 4.0 -- pass shadow google-chrome 3.0 -- pass shadow opera 10 -- fail
this will not cover all scenarios and i think it fails in opera but i would do this test results apparently rgba was introduced in firefox 3.0 but -moz-box-shadow was introduced in 3.5

2044870
opera	firefox
this will not cover all scenarios and i think it fails in opera but i would do this test results apparently rgba was introduced in firefox 3.0 but -moz-box-shadow was introduced in 3.5
so firefox 3.0 fails the test

2046095
google-chrome	firefox
here s a few links to get you going in the right direction google-chrome mozilla firefox i can t seem to find any for internet explorer i m sorry i cannot give you a definitive answer but hopefully this should get the ball rolling for you at least
the best solution would be to develop a plug-in for the browser used by your user whether it be for internet explorer firefox or google-chrome etc

2046585
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
uiviewcontroller by does not support push pop of view controllers
you need to replace your use of uiviewcontroller with a uinavigationcontroller

2049361
aggregate-functions	sum
it does not shrink several records into one instead it returns the total value along with each record -- this is an aggregate-functions
it shrinks all records into one record and returns the total sum with q name number as select test1 0 union all select test2 22 union all select test3 28 select sum number from q -- 50 -- this is an analytical function

2051963
onclick	onsubmit
you are assigning submitsearch to the onclick event for the submit button and the onsubmit event for the form
since the onclick event is fired before the onsubmit event the onsubmit event will not even fire if the onclick event didn t return true

2054971
jlist	jtable
jlist is not yet editable and might never be
jtable would handle the layout problems for you and you can easily access the values via the table

2055664
set	bag
the asset is a way to explicitly change your hasmany to a set in situations where fnh might not be able to determine it by type for example if you re exposing your collection as an ienumerable it would default to a bag and calling asset would override that
assuming your type is an iesi set then there s no difference

2058304
fixed-point	fractions
for performance you wouldn t actually do this but instead use clever fixed-point math an implementation matter i leave to you
first to get the edge effects between different colored areas add or subtract some fractions of the r g and b channels to the texture image you could get fancier with with nonlinear forumulas thresholding the r g and b channels or computing some mathematical expression involving them

2059183
bash	tcsh
bash is one shell
technically linux is not a shell but in fact the kernel but many different shells can run on top of it bash tcsh pdksh etc.

2060188
sudo	passwd
be sure to completely lock down the commands that that user can run via sudo
you should set up your sudoers not to require a passwd nopasswd for the user that your php is running as

2060801
profiling	instrumentation
obviously this isn t programatically but you only need to worry about the cpu of a single app at a time if your developing and using this you can profiling the app in question very easily
you can use instrumentation to do this open up instrumentation developer applications instrumentation and choose iphone - activity monitor and hit record it ll give you all the applications running and how much cpu ram and everything else they are running

2062470
g++	gcc
and in a round about way if you had used the c++ compiler driver or g++ in your original example you wouldn t have encountered this problem shell g++ -m64 hello.cc shell . a.out hello world the reason for this is gcc essentially says use c rules when driving the tool chain and g++ says use c++ rules when driving the tool chain
g++ knows that to create a working executable it needs to pass -lstdc++ to the linker stage whereas gcc obviously doesn t think this is necessary even though it knew to use the c++ compiler at the compile the source code stage because of the .cc file ending

2062961
profiling	debugging
now i wouldn t do this because there s great profiling tools out there already jetbrains dottrace to name one and with intellitrace in vs2010 all these headaches will simply go away.
intellitrace will let you do time traveling debugging

2067735
g++	gcc
not helpeful but perhaps informative on a fresh install of opensolaris and g++ i see the same results
in the man page for gcc ++ on opensolaris it notes the default level of debuging information is 2 .

2067789
junit	testng
se seems to work flawlessly with junit
probably testng as well but have not tried that yet it s on my todo list

2072623
dictionary	map
original post python allows you to use a translation dictionary to map characters to a replacement string
a simple version for you case would be and then you can call print u những-viên-kẹo .translate vietnamese_map to get u nhung-vien-keo for more advanced use ie a dynamic dictionary see eg note that the above is just to show you what the map needs to look like it s not a particularly convenient way of entering the data

2073928
base	fractions
the log of 1 for any base is 0 which means we don t need to add any more
if result + fractions is not greater than result then we ve hit the limits of precision for our numbering system

2075114
queue	fifo
the stack and the queue are more advanced ways to handle a collection that the array itself which doesn t establish any order in the way the elements behave inside the collection
the stack lifo - last in first out and a queue fifo - fifo establish and order in which your elements are inserted and removed from a collection

2075264
inline	inlining
these are good candidates for inlining whether it be as #define macros or inline-functions
yes i know inline is only a suggestion but in this case i consider it as a reminder to the compiler. remove dead and redundant code if the code isn t used or does not contribute to the program s result get rid of it

2075657
implements	extends
if your delegate interface has a lot of methods and it would be convenient to make some of them optional you could define an adapter class that implements the delegate interface providing a default implementation for each of the methods
to use it your delegate class must either extends the adapter class or if that is not possible define a private inner class that extends the adapter class

2076951
postgresql	mysql
so i suggest you might want to take a look on how the database.yml is configured with mysql and also try that out with the postgresql gem
also make sure that you compiled postgresql with ssl support. see if that all does not work maybe you can try to monkey-patch the database connection from rails and add connection_parameters to the ssl connection

2078368
lisp	scheme
i think lambda is simplest in lisp since it was designed for that kind of thing and of the dialects scheme tends to be the simplest
not coincidentally the greatest computer science book ever written uses scheme

2079490
vb.net	vb6
you can utilize the vb upgrade wizard but that will only get you to vb.net potentially as there as some things that cannot be upgraded
or you can compile your vb6 app to a com dll.

2080152
gmail	hotmail
pop3 available for all users of gmail but not recommended because of pop3 inherent limitations no folder no get new messages
hotmail pop3 available for all users but again pop3 inherent limitations no folder no sent mail no get new messages in addition to hotmail limitation called 15-minutes-delay-necessary for pop3 access

2080528
ati	nvidia
the support has been added very recently this generation and not everywhere ati hd5870 and hd5850 have it at decent speed not as fast as single though hd5770 does not have it despite being in the same generation as the hd5870
nvidia gt200 based cards have double support but at a double single ratio that is very low

2081470
profiling	instrumentation
a profiling will not be a solution to a coding style that is x slower than optimal however you still need to spend time fine-tuning those parts of your code that are used more often than others
because of instrumentation profiled code on average will run slower than non-profiled code

2081561
profiling	instrumentation
i m not surprised by the fact that you get worst results when profiling your application as instrumenting java code will typically always slow its execution
this is actually nicely captured by the wikipedia page on profiling which mentions that instrumentation can causes changes in the performance of a program potentially causing inaccurate inaccurate results and heisenbugs due to the observer effect observers affect what they are observing by the mere act of observing it alone

2082570
inline	inlining
the compiler will make up its own mind whether to inline a function or not - it might take the programmer suggests inlining this into account but on most compilers simply declaring a function as inline doesn t guarantee it will be
inline is a suggestion to the compiler to inline the function - instead of generating a block of code for the function and call instructions wherever it s used it effectively cut-and-pastes the generated code wherever that function is called

2085082
udp	tcp
if you are using udp you are going to lose data
the way that you avoid losing data is to use tcp not udp

2087943
inline	inlining
btw inlining is of significant value only if the routines being inline are small and don t call functions themselves and if the lines where they are being called are active enough of the time to be significant
as for the order of magnitude performance ratio between debug and release build it may be due to a number of things maybe or maybe not the inlining

2088188
daemons	systemd
alternatively you could further raise the technological stakes by having the daemons return not the password but rather the open socket ready to be wrapped in a db-api compliant wrapper
some unix systemd allow open file descriptors to be sent between unrelated processes a prereq for this approach -- and of course you d have to substantially rework the mysql-based db api to allow opening a connection around an already-open socket rather than a freshly made one

2088482
firefox	safari
unfortunately it seems safari also doesn t implement the onpagehide function firefox introduced to go with the bfcache so you can t catch that
another option would be to browser-sniff for safari and when found disable the bfcache by setting a window.onunload function even one that does nothing

2088992
client-side	server-side
you cannot do it with 100 client-side javascript with the default security settings
you ll need to implement some server-side logic

2089174
awt	swing
awt is not the newest technology on the block
so unless you have a specific requirement to do work in awt i would recommend you to check out the modern replacements swing or swt - much more comfortable flexible customizable and predictable in their behaviour than awt

2091238
innodb	myisam
see when you delete the parent row users you can declare your desired behavior in foreign key constraints in dependent tables restrict meaning don t delete the parent if there are dependent rows cascade meaning delete any dependent rows automatically and atomically set null meaning change the value in the foreign key column in the child table to null set default meaning change the value in the foreign key column to the default defined for that column of course these constraints work only in innodb
foreign keys are not supported in myisam

2094126
svg	vml
there s a few to choose from in this blog post canvas svg vml drawing roundup
you can just make a call to that function provided by google and it will return true if vml is supported and false if not

2097573
allocator	stl
when there is expansion it will try to reallocate in place but this is a bit silly and doesn t normally work think windows 98 heap compaction but usually will end up making a whole new allocator and copying over
a standard stl vector is always all together but not all implementations work like that i know having written some of them

2099773
explode	substr
explode the string then use two nested loops along with array_slice to get the relevant elements
substr are not permutations

2099844
ubuntu	linux
moblin is produced by the linux foundation and is not based on ubuntu
ubuntu netbook remix unr is produced by canonical and based on ubuntu

base	fractions
just like some fractions like 1 3 cannot be represented precisely in base 10
in python explain how some fractions cannot be represented precisely in binary

2101311
postgresql	mysql
thus for purely functional reasons because postgresql supports a feature which most databases do not ddl in postgresql must be different than in other databases
a similar situation arises in mysql because it allows the use of different isam engines with different capabilities

2102517
firefox	safari
this happens with webkit - it seems to display the images as they are and doesn t apply automatic scaling like firefox and ie do
it probably looks like that in safari as well

2102528
jfreechart	jchart2d
i did a live plotter application over the summer and used jfreechart for that
the guy who had started the project had used jchart2d but i found that it doesn t have enough options for tweaking the chart look and feel

2103392
lisp	scheme
here is an example for sicp exercises in common lisp
sicp is more a general book about programming and computer science not so that much about scheme or lisp programming

2103619
punctuation	words
words selection provides correct interpretation of punctuation marks within and following words
characters that are not part of a words such as symbols or punctuation marks have word-breaks on both sides

2106329
innodb	myisam
for myisam if the value is less than or equal to the maximum value currently in the auto_increment column the value is reset to the current maximum plus one. for innodb if the value is less than the current maximum value in the column no error occurs and the current sequence value is not changed
i ran a small test that confirmed this for a myisam table

2108433
allocator	stl
also in the setstring method you re not allocator enough space for the trailing 0 in the array
if you want to do correct oo-oriented programming in c++ you should maybe stay away from direct pointer management but use the stl string class and use references instead of pointers

2109036
firefox	safari
work well with firefox

wicket	seam
for those interested in looking at code i re-implemented the seam hotel booking demo in scala + wicket here browse | svn - the java + wicket version is here browse | svn i used the not yet final scala 2.8 and the netbeans plugin
was meaning to blog in detail about it there s even a groovy + wicket implementation in place but a few high-level impressions below

2110069
jar	war
however this support is limited to the ejb3 mbean and the jar files it manages
any jar files which are loaded from a war such as servlets jsf backing beans and so forth do not undergo this processing

2110069
jboss	weblogic	jboss	glassfish
in fact jboss 4.2.2 is a transitional version that doesn t claim full java ee 5 compliance
consequently either stick with you actual version of jboss but use a jdni lookup to get your bean - or - swith to jboss 5 as that fully supports the entire java 5 enterprise edition specification but has horrible startup performances - or - swith to another java ee 5 application server like glassfish v2 or even v3 or weblogic 10

2112356
memcpy	malloc
these versions will implement a shallow copy much like what memcpy would do in your case the array contents would not be copied only the pointers
1 incidentally the same goes for malloc and free

2113301
oncreate	onstart
so the problem is that askthetime might have already been created when the widget is pressed so the oncreate isn t called again
what you could do is try doing your logging in onstart or onresume instead of or in addition to oncreate inside your activity

let the transfer object implements a method that returns an object of the original third party class and you re done pseudocode you just have to make sure that the members are serialized correctly if you got any special member objects
alternatively if the third party class isn t final you could just extends it have that implements serializable and write your own writeobject and readobject methods

2114597
client-side	server-side
no it is not possible to do that directly with javascript on the client-side
sessions are handled on the server-side

2116517
lisp	scheme
then there are some who don t like commmon lisp too big too old not functional enough not object oriented enough too fast not fast enough ...
some don t like scheme too academic too small does not scale too functional not functional enough no modules the wrong modules not the right macros ...

2120637
config	ini
this is not answering your question but in my opinion a better way to deal with config is actually to use a real config file like an ini or xml file
you could use the zend config class to read and write such files and this class can even deal with a plain php array as config

2123649
nunit	mstest
normally with nunit i d use a generic or parametrised fixture but i m not sure whether mstest has similar capabilities
in light of this here s how i d do this with nunit in a form that should be reproducible using any unit test framework via the template method pattern

2124973
implements	extends
a single abstract class is subclassed by similar classes that have a lot in common the implements parts of the abstract class but also have some differences the abstract methods
not always a class can extends only one class a class can implement more than one interface sun docs make a more detailed comparison abstract classes versus interfaces unlike interfaces abstract classes can contain fields that are not static and final and they can contain implements methods

2125429
strcpy	malloc
strcpy name fortran
we called malloc to allocate a memory block for 20 bytes no it is not 21 the reason i added 1 on to the size is for the 0 nul terminating character

2126324
inline	inlining
in case anyone else is wondering what the actual .net implementation looks like here is the .net 4 code that attribute indicates the method will also be inline in ngen that is native images
as others have said isnullorempty is superior to the manual checks for purposes of maintainability and isn t likely to suffer in performance thanks to the jit compiler s runtime decisions about inlining see eric gunnerson s comments

2128919
cpython	ironpython
one thing i know is that django has no official support for ironpython - just cpython and jython
in addition pil - which provides django s support for image fields - does not natively support ironpython though the ironclad project could help with that

2133429
client-side	server-side
the client-side here is generated based on the dc to also include databinding-helpful aspects like inpc and observablecollections that s it no magic
eg if there were some calculated properties on your server-side object that logic will not be present on the client

2133562
inline	inlining
from the compiler s point of view the added variables from the inline procedure may consume additional registers and in an area where register pressure is already high this may force spilling which causes additional ram accesses. languages with jit compilers and runtime class loading have other tradeoffs since the virtual methods aren t known statically yet the jit can collect runtime profiling information such as method call frequency design implementation and evaluation of optimizations in a just-in-time compiler for java talks about method inlining of static methods and dynamically loaded classes and its improvements on performance
practicing judo java under dynamic optimizations claims that their inlining policy is based on the code size and profiling information

2133562
inline	inlining
to avoid code explosion we do not inline a method with a bytecode size of more than 25 bytes
to avoid inlining along a deep call chain inlining stops when the accumulated inlined bytecode size along the call chain exceeds 40 bytes. although they have runtime profiling information method call frequency they are still careful to avoid inlining large functions or chains of functions to prevent bloat

2134494
aggregate-functions	sum
there s a full definition on what is and isn t allowed within an indexed view here sql 2005 . quote the avg max min stdev stdevp var or varp aggregate-functions
if avg expression is specified in queries referencing the indexed view the optimizer can frequently calculate the needed result if the view select list contains sum expression and count_big expression

2135261
bazaar	cvs
since you describe the problem as emacs-specific it might be something wrong with the emacs mode you are using for driving bazaar
generally vc does not do what you would expect because it s designed for centralized version control systems such as rcs sccs cvs and subversion

2135302
realloc	malloc
in this case malloc 0 and realloc malloc 0 0 are not equivalent
note that there is an interesting case here in the second case when malloc 0 returns non- null on success it may still return null to indicate failure

2135302
realloc	malloc
this will result in a call like realloc null 0 which would be equivalent to malloc 0 which may or may not return null
i am not sure if the omission in c99 is an oversight or if it means that in c99 realloc ptr 0 for non- null ptr is not equivalent to free ptr

2135302
calloc	malloc
also the return value from malloc on the lhs hasn t been free d yet so any other malloc calloc or realloc may not return that value
this means that if you wrote your condition as you won t see possible on the output unless both malloc and realloc fail and return null

2136650
setinterval	settimeout
setinterval will call the function at your specified interval
use setinterval not settimeout

2137078
uiview	uiwindow
each of these also has such an array and can contain uiview
i assume you mean not full screen generally the topmost view is a uiwindow and to this you add any uiview subclass you like such as uislider

2137078
uiview	uiwindow	uiview	subviews
i assume you mean not full screen generally the topmost view is a uiwindow and to this you add any uiview subclass you like such as uislider
your uiview has a subviews uitabview i don t know specifically but i would guess it has two subviews one of which is visible at a time and one of these is the uitableview

2141319
ssl	https
my task is to make it secure using https ssl or tsl
if it s just about one-way ssl then this question doesn t have much to do with web services actually

2141379
force.com	salesforce
force.com fails to deliver on one of the key cloud promises scalability
it is a very resource-constrained environment and developing even crm products on it can be a trial if your customer s model of their business is not in line with salesforce s

2141456
jlist	jlabel
you could just override tostring and display them in a jlist
btw this will not solve your problem but javadoc for equals says note that it is generally necessary to override the hashcode method whenever this method is overridden if a card extends a jlabel and you create an instance for every card you have you should not have to override equals at all

2146219
persistent	transient
i think this is the wrong approach for data whose lifespan is not expected to be persistent .
transient data if data is useful only for one request then it is typically stored in the httprequest fine

2146921
ssl	https
because ssl operates below http and has no knowledge of higher-level protocols ssl servers can only strictly present one certificate for a particular ip port combination
this means that in most cases it is not feasible to use name-based virtual hosting with https

2147601
keystore	jks
in java there is a keystore class obtained with a given type one of them being pkcs12
you may then find in the jca documentation in key management the following as of jdk 6 standards for storing trusted certificates in pkcs12 have not been established yet and thus jks or jceks should be used for trusted certificates

2148492
vim	emacs
vim may not be
you may want to try both vi and emacs

2148517
persistent	transient
you are also right to note that the default json marshaller only renders persistent fields
when rendering my domain objects i ve found it useful to create json object marshallers so that unwanted properties are not rendered but it would also solve your transient issue too

2148932
lisp	smalltalk
try the common lisp object system clos
it is not pure oop like smalltalk but the type hierarchy in lisp is at least complete which is more than can be said for java and most other languages even oo languages don t have generic methods multidispatch method combinations esp before after and around

2150027
xsl-fo	xslt
but as we have in several scenarios if you already have an application that works with xml structured documents and information and have a requirement to generate pdf files then xsl-fo is a very good way to achieve this
in that case you probably have already some developers with xml and xslt knowledge for whom it is not a big deal to set up templates that generate the xsl-fo structure that can be parsed by a generator

2150888
ubuntu	linux
copy this code my solr startup script into that file then run chkconfig --add solr or on ubuntu update-rc.d solr defaults .
or if your linux distribution doesn t have chkconfig or update-rc.d link etc init.d solr to etc rc3.d s99solr and etc rc5.d s99solr and etc rc3.d k01solr and etc rc5.d k01solr ln -s etc init.d solr etc rc3.d s99solr ln -s etc init.d solr etc rc5.d s99solr ln -s etc init.d solr etc rc3.d k01solr ln -s etc init.d solr etc rc5.d k01solr now on reboot solr will startup in run levels 3 and 5 console with network full gui

2151030
prepare	execute
given they are all similar you might want to use prepare statements
ado does not support multiple statements to be execute in a single operation you will need to execute them sequentially one after the other

2152230
udp	tcp
remember udp is datagram oriented all operations are on those packets not on bytes.
a different scenario would be faced if you used tcp sockets..

2154165
factors	matrix
first of all the complexity does not give the factors
some linear or subquadratic algorithms are simply not useful because they are eating so much time and resources that they are not adequate for the problem on hand coppersmith-winograd matrix multiplication . then your computation may have all kludges you can only detect by experiment

2154778
persistent	transient
consider this short example when this class is fed to the jpa it persistent the gender and id but doesn t try to persistent the helper boolean methods - without transient the underlying system would complain that the entity class person is missing setmale and setfemale methods and thus wouldn t persistent person at all
as others have said transient is used to mark fields which shouldn t be persisted

2155406
gtk	gdk
if your version of gtk pygtk is recent enough key events have a attribute
it s not documented in the pygtk reference but it s in the gdk api documentation and is exposed through pygtk

2156046
uiview	subviews
edit with thanks to cocoafan this situation is muddled up by the fact that nsview and uiview handle things differently
for nsview desktop mac development only you can simply use the following for uiview ios development only you can safely use makeobjectsperformselector because the subviews property will return a copy of the array of subviews thank you to tommy for pointing out that makeobjectsperformselector appears to modify the subviews array while it is being enumerated which it does for nsview but not for uiview

2156344
client-side	server-side
while you can place controls on the page that will emit javascript control validation and there are a variety of ways in which javascript is employed to simplify webforms development asp.net it isn t really about client-side programming in the same way that jquery is
honestly i wouldn t want asp.net to wrap jquery as it would just lead to impedence mismatches between how you handle client and server-side processing

2156899
inline	inlining
i wouldn t rule it out though as compiler optimization has gotten pretty advanced. one way to tell that this code doesn t quite do what we want is is still legal and clearly this is not getting inline
to get full inlining we need to template by value so the function is fully available in the template

2157486
cruisecontrol	teamcity
in addition you cannot lose by looking at cruisecontrol which is free
teamcity from jetbrains is also a great option

2163381
client-side	server-side
the cachingallowed attribute actually configures the server-side caching not the client-side caching as you seem to expect
client-side caching is to be done with appropriate response headers

2164883
firefox	safari
i m trying to do something similar and i just discovered a trick that works with firefox
if you combine it with the trick for ie you can have one that works on both main browsers i m not sure if it works in safari and i know it doesn t work in chrome in order for this to work you also need to have a hidden link somewhere on the page like this it s a bit hacky but it works

2165677
allocator	stl
on the other side if the caller does already have a c-string no temporary or unneeded std string needs to be constructed which can be costly for longer strings it s a heap allocator
also i once used it to resolve the following case my interface took std string s but had to be implemented in an external module thus the stl binary versions of both the module and the caller module had to match exactly or it would have crashed not really good for a portable library

2167139
allocator	stl
if this option does not fill well alternative is to could be to define dedicated allocator
here is a good paper about it creating stl containers in shared memory there is also excellent ion gaztañaga s boost.interprocess library with shared_memory_object and related features

2168000
gtk	cairo
if you re not on linux unix you may need a diferent gtk library since gtk-x11-2.0 is specific to the x window system
just successfully compiled your code after doing the following add the following two includes and compile with gcc pkg-config --cflags --libs gtk+-2.0 test.c -o test the pkg-config gives the following output -i usr include gtk-2.0 -i usr lib gtk-2.0 include -i usr include atk-1.0 -i usr include cairo -i usr include pango-1.0 -i usr include glib-2.0 -i usr lib glib-2.0 include -i usr include pixman-1 -i usr include freetype2 -i usr include libpng12 -lgtk-x11-2.0 -lgdk-x11-2.0 -latk-1.0 -lgio-2.0 -lpangoft2-1.0 -lgdk_pixbuf-2.0 -lpangocairo-1.0 -lcairo -lpango-1.0 -lfreetype -lfontconfig -lgobject-2.0 -lgmodule-2.0 -lglib-2.0 so you need to link with the following libraries gtk-x11-2.0 gdk-x11-2.0 atk-1.0 gio-2.0 pangoft2-1.0 gdk_pixbuf-2.0 pangocairo-1.0 cairo pango-1.0 freetype fontconfig gobject-2.0 gmodule-2.0 glib-2.0 you may be able to leave out a few if you want to try just start with gdk_pixbuf-2.0 and see if you still get any undefined references when you link

2168223
pascal	delphi
the next code does not produce wrong additional zero since all that staff is just a legacy in delphi i think it must work in turbo pascal
i have tested the problem on delphi 2009 console applications

2169107
strcpy	strncpy
strncpy is perfectly safe if you read the manual strcpy strcat use strncpy and strncat and read specifications
strncpy may be not null terminated so.

2169619
passenger	thin
it s fast faster than passenger doesn t use much memory less than passenger and isn t too hard to set up and maintain
i m a big fan of thin

2170377
openmpi	mpich
i read your post again you will use openmpi you still have to supply machines file to mpiexec command but you do not have to mess with mpdboot
couple things you need to tell mpi where to launch processes assuming you are using mpich look at mpiexec help section and find machine file or equivalent description

2172461
operands	scalar
that is if the left operands is true the right operands is not even evaluated
scalar or list context propagates down to the right operands if it is evaluated

2172876
vb6	vba
i have no personal experience doing this although i have used vba vb6 and have written vb6 dlls that are add-ins for other 3rd party software although not office
the easiest way would be to convert your vba code to a vb6 com add-in

2172876
vb6	vba
the easiest way would be to convert your vba code to a vb6 com add-in
then you shouldn t have to change the guts of your code since vba is 99 identical to vb6 and you can code against the same office object model

2173286
super	self
here is actual example where super dealloc must be last otherwise the call to removefromrunloop will cause crash
i m not sure what happens inside nsoutputstream s removefromrunloop but it seems to access self in this case

2173615
division	modulo
i added a gltranslatef method right before entering the loop first i was unsuccessfully trying to translate the scene using a brute cameraposx tile_height division didn t work
we have to translate the offset by which the tile extends beyond the screen not the total cameraposx offset so we re using the modulo instead of division

2173869
profiling	benchmarking
iow in the end if you truly care about performance you must carefully benchmarking and separately profiling your actual program s not just toy micro-benchmarks in the general case
when essentially unlimited memory is available which will invariably be the case in tiny benchmarking although often not in real-world problems

2176431
inline	inlining
in my experience bloat hasn t been a problem header only libraries give compilers greater ability to inline but they do not force compilers to inline - many compilers treat the inline keyword as nothing more than a command to ignore multiple identical definitions
compilers usually have options to optimize to control the amount of inlining

2176673
punctuation	words
the example uses standardanalyzer which removes punctuation and breaks words according to white space and some other more elaborate rules
it does not however break words into characters

2176706
comparator	comparable
and then since item is itself comparable you don t need an external comparator unless you want one
assuming that you re using this comparator to sort a treemap then this isn t going to work

2177059
firefox	safari
the ideal would be to be able to get the pasted content via the paste event which is possible in recent browsers but not in some older browsers in particular firefox 22
when you need to support older browsers what you can do is quite involved and a bit of a hack that will work in firefox 2+ ie 5.5+ and webkit browsers such as safari or chrome

2178048
apache	nginx
if the problem does not persist apache is either doing something weird or wsgi django isn t getting all the information it needs to determine the port number. make sure that the wsgi script and the django app can both see the port number in the environment
if the location header has a port in it nginx is stripping it off for some reason

2178324
vb.net	vb6
yes the vb.net data types are not compatible with the vb6 ones
a vb6 integer is now a short aka int16

2179742
boost	stl
there is an extension to the boost range library called rangeex which contains range wrappers for all stl algorithms plus some new ones
it has recently been accepted into boost and so it s not yet in the current official release 1.41

2179866
datalist	checkboxlist
you may need to custom-bind a repeater or datalist with a checkbox control in the itemtemplate in order to achieve the functionality you re looking for
checkboxlist s templatecontrol property does not actually allow you to modify the template of the checkboxlist

2181727
cvs	svn
subversion does not have real tags the way cvs does
however you can tag using svn copy which really makes a branch

2183250
.htaccess	httpd.conf
for example if you want to have php files ending with .html or .htm most people will tell you to create an .htaccess and put in it the line addtype application x-httpd-php .html .htm if you re a developer and this is annoying you you may want to edit the file and change the line allowoverride none to allowoverride all this will allow your local .htaccess files to override various global defaults that they couldn t before
to clarify neoryder s post edit etc apache2 httpd.conf find the line #loadmodule php5_module libexec apache2 libphp5.so and remove the hash sign from the beginning to enable php in your web server

2184340
clang	llvm
i would expect it to be available soon with a new release of the iphone sdk given the rapid pace of improvement with the llvm compiler and clang parser
as i respond here to this question llvm is not yet ready to compile applications targeted at the iphone for any version of the sdk

2184746
content-length	content-type
section 4.4 describes how to determine the length of a message-body if a content-length is not given
note that the meaning of this field is significantly different from the corresponding definition in mime where it is an optional field used within the message external-body content-type

2187462
gdi	direct2d
however it does use the gdi for font rasterization not hardware accelerated and there is a significant performance hit try it its actually very noticable
as of directx 11 though fonts will be rendered with direct2d and be hardware accelerated

2187874
glut	glfw
never since i discovered glfw have i had a need to switch back to glut
note that glfw is not thread-safe in the sense that it is unsafe to call glfw functions from different threads faq entry

2188765
g++	gcc
you should also use not the old iostream.h use g++ to compile c++ programs it ll link in the standard c++ library
gcc will not

2189414
postgresql	mysql
there is a clever solution here with cte s and rank over date_added in postgresql 8.4 but because you re using mysql the only thing i can think of of involves a very computationally complex query -- select the top date for each site_id select distinct id from site_text group by site_id date_added order by site_id date_added union -- select the top date for each site_id select distinct id from site_text group by site_id date_added -- excluding the top date. where id not in select distinct id from site_text group by site_id date_added order by site_id date_added order by site_id date_added
moral of the story use postgresql

2191447
jar	war
new in v0.9.7 quick-start guide there is also a info in the jython-wiki not jump related in brief jar file run where file is the name of the python script file and main is the application s main method entry point war file run the various options available for jump can be shown by outputting help usage information run jump --help
have you tried jump jump homepage features distributing jython applications into a single independent jar file

2196210
vb.net	vb6
first even if you migrate from vb6 to vb.net there are several language specific features in vb.net that will not translate directly to c#
so even if you re using a vb.net to c# converter you ll have to handle these special cases or find a tool that handles them for you

2196500
rar	zip
zip with -e option and rar with -p
if python is not a must and you can use system utilities tools like zip or rar provides password encrypted compression

2197303
innodb	myisam
of note as of mysql 5.1.38 the innodb plugin is included in mysql as of mysql 5.1.43 the innodb plugin is not only included but is the default engine for mysql
on my server with your configuration my base performance is as follows innodb 5.71s myisam 2.50s this is not bad in my book but it can use some tweaking

2197303
innodb	myisam
on my server with your configuration my base performance is as follows innodb 5.71s myisam 2.50s this is not bad in my book but it can use some tweaking
your innodb performance can be improved on several fronts increase innodb_buffer_pool_size this is the single most important innodb configuration variable

2198243
required	placeholder
it will not work as the first redirection parameter the redirection required a filename and the at the end
you re effectively trying to redirect stderr but there is no placeholder to store the stderr messages hence it failed

2199036
content-length	content-type
set http header values like content-length content-type and user-agent
do not forget to set content-length value as it is a mandatory

2199485
cdr	cons
3 usually it is a good idea to avoid improper lists where the cdr of some cell is not a cons or nil
nth returns the car of the nth 0 1 2 ... cons cell

2201829
haskell	ocaml
we use haskell ocaml and now f# so for us it has nothing to do with lack of c-like syntax
rather we skip erlang because it s dynamically typed we re fans of haskell s type system doesn t provide a real string type i understand why but it s annoying that this hasn t been corrected at the language level yet tends to have poor incomplete or unmaintained database drivers it isn t batteries included and doesn t appear to have a community working on correcting this

2202835
punctuation	words
as pointed out in the comments below this doesn t take punctuation into account but easily can edit for languages that don t support look-behind like javascript as long as you replace all the front-facing ones first you have two options i ve left the original solution above in case this is helpful to someone using a language that does support look-behind
you could replace all that preceed a words character with the left quote and all that follow a words character with a right quote

2205970
ssl	https
here s a good tutorial on how to set up a self-signed certificate for iis enabling ssl on iis 7.0 using self-signed certificates do i need to make all my pages secured or only the login page
use https for everything not just the initial user login

2206001
union	distinct
dbcc freeproccache dbcc dropcleanbuffers if you run with the union all first and then run the 2 selects separately afterwards the data will already be cached in memory making performance much better therefore giving the false impression that the subsequent approach is quicker when it may not be
if you used a union then that may well be slower as it has to apply a distinct but union all doesn t have to do that so it should be no different

2209850
move	drag
when the user begins to drag the original item isn t actually move it s just hidden
ui.helper is a separate object that the user drag around

2214120
firefox	safari
if firefox has more properties then they will be mozilla s own extensions but generally the spec provides everything you could need
anyway the problem is that you need to reselect the range after altering it note that this will not work in early versions of safari prior to version 3 i think because its selection object does not support getrangeat

2215111
g++	gcc
also it was offered to me as an explanation that the x86 has very few registers and g++ was not good at allocating them
update for a more thorough comparison of microsoft and gnu compilers go to this c compiler benchmark . according to how i read these figures the difference between microsoft and gcc for 32 bit are on par with each other although gcc is tested with profile guided optimization pgo and microsoft isn t there s no pgo in vs express

2215348
subtraction	modulo	addition	modulo
in python though you will always get a positive number which is often more useful because it means you can do modulo addition and subtraction
if negative modulo were to give you a negative it would not work properly

2217346
uiview	subviews
thus no need for another uiview to encapsulate both and you re not putting it in the table which isn t supported unless you put it within a cell within the table view
the reason is because uitableview expects to be in charge of all of every one of its subviews for layout purposes

2218593
trie	tree
for variable-size keys like strings a trie might be a good idea
for a 2-3-4 tree it does not really matter

2218733
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome
some modern browsers firefox safari and opera but not google-chrome support the special back forward cache i ll call it bfcache which is a term invented by mozilla involved when the user navigates back

2219118
apache-poi	docx4j
apache-poi s support for word documents isn t very good
also unlike aspose.words docx4j is an open source library

2219207
union	distinct
you want to use the union operator | which behaves kind of like an and and kind of like an or depending on how you think about it
it will give you a distinct list of both sets of nodes and will return them in the document order that it finds them not all instance and then all result elements

2220989
udp	tcp
what i can suggest you consider packing whatever you like into udp packet
i am not sure how easy is to initiate routing of unpacked tcp packages on remote side

2221847
postgresql	mysql
but that s shouldn t be a reason to use mysql over postgresql since you can still inject by using subqueries
the mysql client library seems to limit to one statement per call by default i encountered it with php

2223874
postgresql	mysql
otherwise you re just exploiting that postgresql can prepare multiple statements and that isn t something negative
i believe mysql can probably do this too the only difference here is dbd mysql is claiming that c api issues preclude the use of the server-side prepares so they re relying on some other source as being authoritative for the server

2224816
firefox	safari
i found a solution that works in ie and firefox at least on the current versions
on safari chrome the iframe is resized to 75 of its original size but the content within the iframe is not scaled at all

2224939
punctuation	words
you could use lookaheads lookbehinds to see if you are bounded by spaces but to check against punctuation could be difficult considering your smileys are made of punctuation
the reason your smiley example doesn t work with regex is the b refers to a words boundary

2225651
google-chrome	safari
it appears that google-chrome can handle more values at the moment but safari can t
see this post for a good explanation or have a look at mdc hmm it doesn t mention google-chrome

2226501
allocator	stl
it s a detailed article but the most important reasons were stl allocator are slow bloated and inefficient compilers aren t actually very good at inlining all those deep function calls stl allocator don t support explicit alignment the stl algorithms that come with gcc and msvc s stl aren t very performant because they re very platform-agnostic and thus miss a lot of microoptimizations that can make a big difference
some years ago our company made the decision not to use the stl at all instead implementing our own system of containers that are maximally performant easier to debug and more conservative of memory

2227092
allocator	stl
and all stl container have a template for the allocator
for exception stl doesn t throw many exceptions in generally the most common are out of memory in your case the system should reset so you can do reset in the allocator

which can be handy like when you re working with other developers fd doesn t have a profiling but this has not prompted me to stop using it
when i need some debugging and trace isn t enough i add the demonsters debugger class it s pretty powerful but you still can t step through your code. update - flash develop has had a profiling for a few versions now it s good for watching memory use but i still end up using monster debugger a lot

you can use debugging in flash develop as-well and step through your code

implements	extends
implements all this may seem to be a lot of work for the convenience logic and also a potential for several bugs issues however provided that the buffer s is are adequately sized and that the logic using these convenience methods understand the rules of the game this pattern supplies a simplistic automated heap management system which is a nice thing to have in c which unlike with java .net and other systems does not offer a built in gc-based heap management
so long as you understand this to be thread-unsafe and so long that your logic expect the values returned by the convenience methods to only be valid for the duration of a few calls to possibly various methods you can maybe extends this convenience in two unrelated and possibly complementary ways

2231855
comparator	comparable
so try or depending on whether you need to be able to compare instances of t in order to implement your comparator method
when appears it means you have an instance of comparable that can be compared to one unknown subtype of t not that it can be compared to any subtype of t

2232268
richfaces	icefaces
see the richfaces developer guide page for this tag 6.14.9
rich jquery available since 3.0.0 while icefaces doesn t integrate natively with jquery you can at least make jquery not clash with icefaces s own javascript framework prototype

2233311
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	mp3	ogg	mp3	wav
well firefox and opera do not support non-free codecs such as mp3 as with the opera 10.5 alpha firefox 3.5 and later supports only pcm wav and ogg vorbis for audio
i believe google-chrome and safari do support mp3 however

2233500
dateadd	strtotime
if you re certain that those are the only two date formats you ll possibly have as input then you can explode it on the forward slashes then if strlen returns 1 on the month or the dateadd a 0 as you re creating your yyyy-mm-dd string
however if you re not guaranteed that those are your only two input formats then i would use strtotime to convert it to epoch then use date to format it as you desire

2233896
datamapper	activerecord
the datamapper pattern is not very popular in the php world in favour of activerecord and certainly much of that favour is attributed to the fawning of ruby on rails in the php framework community although there exists one notable project -- and it looks promising
outlet orm follows the datamapper pattern although i am not sure if it would be sufficient for your needs

2234749
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i was having this problem in safari and google-chrome mac and discovered that .scrolltop would work on but not firefox and ie however works the other way round
a simple browser detect fixes the issue the jquery browser value for google-chrome is safari so you only need to do a detect on that

2235940
opera	firefox
one of those features is the text-overflow property which is now in css3 and has implementations in safari and opera
however firefox still does not support this feature

2235961
vb6	vba
vb6 vba - 147 chars i m not allowed to leave comments but it is possible to shorten the previous answer somewhat by not having option explicit
taking advantage of some of the more dangerous features of vb6 vba you can use the one below

2237274
xslt	schematron
the rules are comiled into xslt and can run in any environment that can invoke xslt transformations
the schematron differs in basic concept from other schema languages in that it not based on grammars but on finding tree patterns in the parsed document

2237627
serializable	deserialization
untested then serializable list instead
this isn t going to create a lot of overhead if foo is a reference type and you don t care about the fact that insertions deletions are now more expensive b c you re only using the to hold references to the data for serialization and deserialization purposes

2237879
lisp	scheme
i learned all of them to a diffeent degree and would advise starting with scheme a lisp dialect - simply because it is easiest to learn
haskell and f# are statically typed which is a big advantage for real-life projects but imho they have a little too much syntax and are not as easy to pick up as scheme

2237879
haskell	scheme
haskell and f# are statically typed which is a big advantage for real-life projects but imho they have a little too much syntax and are not as easy to pick up as scheme
there is a nice scheme implementation for .net - ironscheme

2239978
dictionary	map
unfortunately r doesn t have a good dictionary map type
the closest i ve found is using lists as a map from string-to-value

2240078
udp	tcp
yes udp just returns what data got transmitted in that one datagram
udp is not stream-oriented like tcp

2240771
recvfrom	datagram
provided the buffer is large enough the standard berkeley sockets recv and recvfrom functions will never return a partial datagram
the datagram is not available to the application until the kernel has completely received and reassembled the datagram

2244962
profiling	debugging
red gate s memory profiling is an amazing tool for this
this may not help with your particular problem but snoop is a great tool for debugging wpf applications

2246242
sctp	tcp
you are relying on tcp s half-closed state which is not available in sctp
using tcp will send a packet with the fin bit set closing the sending side of the connection but still allowing new data in the receiving direction

2246628
profiling	debugging
a compiled list of possible sources of improvement are below general make use of a profiling to discover memory leaks and performance problems in your application
personally i suggest dottrace run your site in release mode not debugging mode when in production and also during performance profiling

2250895
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
put your code that modifies the view in viewdidappear
the view is not yet visible when viewdidload and viewwillappear are called

2250978
udp	tcp
maybe you ll need to come up with a compact binary format for your messages and drop http in favor of a custom protocol - maybe even revert to udp the above points generally don t apply but they do if you need to provide a smooth experience over high latency low bandwidt flaky connections
at the very least make sure you re not setting up a new tcp connection for every request

2253602
codeigniter	cakephp
i totally enjoy codeigniter
it doesn t have the magic functions of cakephp rails but it automatically comes with a good mvc setup and a good basic library for forms activerecord implementation dealing with post data sanitization and other nice things that i just don t prefer to deal with every project

2254590
udp	tcp
there are downsides - udp transmission is not reliable or guaranteed in the same way as tcp
you might consider udp for this

2255222
actionscript	mxml
in my experience there s not much of a difference whether you write a component in actionscript + mxml or solely in actionscript
personally if i m writing something that s layout heavy with a little logic i ll do it in mxml

2256282
calloc	malloc
if you belong to the second camp which apparently you do then you prefer malloc over calloc
now there are two exceptions if you belong to the initialize everything camp you don t calloc but malloc because you are initializing floating-point numbers or pointers and you know that all bits zero doesn t necessarily mean 0 for them

2256583
cairngorm	puremvc
in all honesty the only other one i ve given a good amount of time to is cairngorm
but i like puremvc because it feels right to me but also it s generally not dependent on so much on the built-in actionscript classes

2257704
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the following example works in google-chrome 4.0 firefox 3.5.7 safari 4.0.4 and ie 8 unfortunately as noted by balusc in a comment to one of the answers the above will not work in versions of firefox older than 3.5
since the population of users using old firefox versions seems to be below 6 as noted by t.j

2258600
skip-lists	tree
concurrentskiplistmap is a sorted map backed by a skip-lists a self-balancing tree-like structure with o log n performance
generally the bounds on cslm are tighter than treemap which is a self-balancing red-black tree impl so it will probably perform better with the side benefit of being thread-safe and concurrent which treemap is not

2259180
single-quotes	double-quotes
first single-quotes strings behave differently than double-quotes string
when using single-quotes strings escape sequences other than and are not interpreted and variable are not expended

2259180
single-quotes	double-quotes
when using single-quotes strings escape sequences other than and are not interpreted and variable are not expended
this can be fixed as such removing the quotes or changing them to double-quotes php documentation strings secondly your condition will never evaluate to true as hey is never equal to a single letter of the alphabet

2259649
equals	gethashcode
you haven t posted the code for your word class but my guess is that it doesn t implement equals with a value comparison so you get the default implementation of equals which just checks the object references
note that if you decide to implement your own version of equals you also need to correctly implement gethashcode

2259719
vmware	virtualbox
i am not 100 sure if you can actually hook into the vm unless there s an sdk that you can download to intercept it remember the vmware is simulating a separate machine but a logical one alright...the downloads are available here from vmware
i can only guess i use virtualbox myself that a virtual machine vmware virtualbox seizes control of the hooks for the keyboard i would imagine the host system would not see them...but it would be interesting to try out.

2260656
prepare	execute
prepare statements are meant to be used as a kind of statement template which is bound to values before it execute
to quote the javadoc this has two big advantages over your current usage of preparedstatement one preparedstatement can be used for multiple execute it prevents a possible sql injection attack the second one here is the biggie if for instance your variables first and last are collected in a user interface and not reformatted you run the risk of parts of sql being input for those values which then end up in your statements

2261979
implements	extends
i d hesitate to call this a multiple inheritance issue because interfaces merely describe well interface--a set of methods an implements class must define--rather than any implementation
extends an interface with other interfaces doesn t really mean the subinterface inherits from the superinterface but rather that the subinterface is in essence a concatenation of the methods defined in the two

2266868
comparator	comparable
if it is the latter odds are every future sorting use case would require a comparator at which point the implementation of comparable may slow down users of the class not speed them up
i would say that an object should implement comparable if that is the clear natural way to sort the class and anyone would need to sort the class would generally want to do it that way

2269313
haskell	ocaml
secondly the haskell ffi is more powerful that is it does more with less code than ocaml s and more libraries are avaliable via hackage so i don t think foreign interfaces will be a deciding factor
the only problem i can see is that ocaml doesn t really support multicore parallelism while ghc has excellent support and performance

2270284
setinterval	settimeout
after sending the email or tapping cancel the timer is left paused and the settimeout setinterval functions will not fire
this will break any thing that relies on settimeout setinterval such as jquery animations and any async ajax calls since jquery uses setinterval to poll until the request returns i ve hit this problem myself

2270366
kde	gnome
that is for kde i do not know how it would be done under gnome.
you may also be able to do this independantly of either gnome kde by using dbus although i cannot say 100 confidently on that either.

2270366
kde	gnome
you may also be able to do this independantly of either gnome kde by using dbus although i cannot say 100 confidently on that either.
just be aware that for a truly cross-platform job you have to take into account of the different gui s such as under linux x is the main window manager interface and either gnome kde sits on top of it..i am not singling out other gui s such as fluxbox windowmaker to name but a few and that there will be a lot of platform dependant code and also in conjunction you will be dealing with windows clipboard as well..all in all a big integrated code.

2270366
kde	gnome

maybe that might be better as i would imagine gnome kde etc are using the x s api to do the clipboard work...if that is confirmed then the work would be cut out and be independant of the major gui interfaces... i hope that would be the case as it would make life easier for your project

2270405
mvp	presenter
while there are pre-tailored mvp frameworks for winforms mvc# comes to mind if you re not developing large-scale apps then you may want to start gently and implement some of the concepts using your own code
jeremy miller s excellent build your own cab series of articles is a great resource here as you can take some of the first few ideas out of there and get some separation of concerns between your forms presentation and business logic presenter and service classes

2271622
profiling	debugging
6 when you re ready just click run for a lot more info on sql profiling see msdn if this is something you want to keep an audit table then you ll need to insert records into your own audit table yourself
if this is not something you want to leave in permanently it s just for debugging performance analysis purposes then your best bet is to use sql profiling and monitor the sp stmtcompleted event which will record the stats for each statement within a sproc

2272341
bazaar	git
i would recommend using git bazaar or another vcs which doesn t require you to tell it when you move sources around
i know git best so i ll say regarding it that you don t need to tell it when you ve moved files and you don t need to maintain vcs-specific directories in each of your own directory

2273448
boost	allocator
if your compiler doesn t support std tr1 alignment_of you can use boost alignment_of instead
the standard containers use allocator to seperate allocator deallocation from construction destruction

2274382
onresume	onpause
but keep the following in mind i would strongly advise you to set up the first timer event in the activity s onresume method and not in its oncreate method
also remove cancel your handler in onpause

2275042
mtu	icmp
tcp will try to not send packets that gets fragmented but slice the data up in segments fitting the mtu
the icmp reply should contain all the data

2275309
delphi	oxygene
it is unicode and works before d2009 it s memory is managed in ole32.dll so no dependency on either delphi s memory manager or the clr gc
you do not have to directly deal with pointers in oxygene you could write it like so marshalas tells the clr how to marshal strings back and forth

2275965
awt	swing
although awt is supposed to be thread-safe it isn t really
so i suggest like swing do all the gui manipulation on the awt event dispatch thread edt

2277303
ecj	javac
eclipse has its own built-in compiler called ecj which is probably the reason you could get away with not having the jdk installed to use it
it does not use javac

2277708
rvm	bundler
my other question is whether you re using rvm or not
gem install tzinfo builder memcache-client rack rack-test rack-mount erubis mail text-format thor bundler i18n gem install rails --pre if it still doesn t work make sure you drop the rack-mount gem

2278321
sudo	passwd
you can t invoke sudo this way
it reads it s passwd directly from the keyboard via dev tty not from stdin

2280574
serializable	deserialization
this attribute affects only deserialization and prevents the runtime from throwing an exception if a member is missing from the serializable stream
a member can also be marked with the nonserialized attribute to indicate that it should not be serializable

2281782
innodb	myisam
if you need transactions you should switch to the innodb table type
mysql doesn t support transactions on the myisam table type which is unfortunately the default table type

2282144
implements	extends
the documentation explains which interfaces to implements and which classes to look at
this doesn t seem possible out of the box but it should be by writing your own parser for the access log sampler or by extends it

2283670
rational-numbers	fractions	rational-numbers	floating-point
-p therefore absent a decimal floating point or rational-numbers type outputting it as a string is the only way to get it trimmed to exactly the precision required for display
it returns a string because 0.1 and powers thereof which are used to display decimal fractions are not representable at least not with full accuracy in binary floating-point systems

2285452
swt	swing
swing swt works on ubuntu but not nearly as well as on windows that s at least my experience
the main reason to choose swt is if you want to build your application on the eclipse rcp framework where you get a dockable views editors plugin mechanism automatic updates user roles

2287637
persistent	transient
the base class has overriden equals gethashcode methods etc... in my implementation of the equals method in the base class i check whether the entity is transient not yet persistent
an entity is transient when the id that has been assigned to it is still the default value

2288489
postgresql	mysql
what is called a database in mysql is sort of a schema in postgresql
imho it doesn t make sense to create a postgresql-engine in mysql if you want to use postgresql

2288951
serializable	deserialization
any class that can be serializable implements serializable should declare that uid and it must be changed whenever anything changes that affects the serializable additional fields removed fields change of field order ...
the field s value is checked during deserialization and if the value of the serializable object does not equal the value of the class in the current vm an exception is thrown

2290573
concave	convex
this seems a specific case of the concave hull problem
many algorithms do exist to solve the opposite convex hull problems jarvis march wikipedia o n 2 graham scan wikipedia o nlogn these are simplest ones there are at least 3 more but they just optimize performance that is not one of your primary goals

2290818
intersect	contains
insert into mystagingtable select col1 col2 col3 from myrealtable rt where not exists select rt.col1 rt.col2 rt.col3 intersect select col1 col2 col3 from mystagingtable this will handle all duplicates including null note that is will insert the duplicates from the real table is any
say if the real table contains 1 1 1 1 1 1 and the staging table contains 2 2 2 both records with 1 1 1 will be inserted

2294219
client-side	server-side
i would encourage you to consider it for if you decide to tackle client-side validation
important client-side validation is not a substitution for server-side validation

2294322
memcached	apc
if and only if you have a web application which has to live on different webservers loadbalancing you have to use memcached for distributed caching
if not just stick to apc and its cache

2296111
nunit	mstest
also you can try to convince your company to buy you a copy of resharper preferred or testdriven.net - so you can easily run nunit tests from visual studio
i am not sure how to run unit tests without visual studio but i had moved to nunit from mstests and its reasonably easy - as long as you don t use the test context from mstest can t remember the real name all you have to do is to rename the tags testclass - testfixture etc there is always 1-1 mapping and change the usings

2296111
nunit	mstest
i am not sure how to run unit tests without visual studio but i had moved to nunit from mstests and its reasonably easy - as long as you don t use the test context from mstest can t remember the real name all you have to do is to rename the tags testclass - testfixture etc there is always 1-1 mapping and change the usings
running nunit tests on the build machine is trivial

2299778
perforce	svn
not free perforce is okay but whatever you do don t use visual sourcesafe and risk your entire repository getting corrupted at some point in time and not realizing it until much later
short answer is svn

2300769
punctuation	words
s + b | .join re.split r w+ needle re.i splitting on w+ removes all punctuation as well as whitespace so there s no need to escape anything
my results seem to match the ones you wanted except the parentheses in video are not highlighted only the words video is

2300995
eventlet	gevent
this is doable in eventlet but it s not very straightforward here
i recommend using gevent where all you have to do is from gevent import monkey

2301056
punctuation	words
note this will return punctuation attached to the last words which may or may not be desired
it d be simple enough to replace any punctuation characters at the tail of the string in php but if you want to stay completely within sql i think you can use trim

2301329
implements	extends
the following query would return all persistent objects from java.lang.object o the interface named might be implements by various persistent classes but because the interface is not mapped and thus unknown you need to use the fully qualified name in your hql query this will return instances of all persistent classes that implements your transaction interface
indeed according to the hibernate documentation on polymorphic queries hibernate queries can name any java class or interface in the from clause. the query will return instances of all persistent classes that extends that class or implements the interface

2301637
udp	tcp
but when you use udp connection you may recieve datagram and you will be informed about senders ip and port but in common case you cannot respond on it
when you talk with client via tcp connection you maintain tcp session

2302260
vmware	virtualbox
also there are tons of features in vmware such as ace to lockdown virtual machines that just don t exist in virtualbox
i found that ubuntu 3d graphics work out of the box in virtualbox 3 where vmware 7 doesn t support out of the box at least

2302260
vmware	virtualbox
vbox doesn t support multiple monitor spanning if you have a 3-monitor setup as transparently as vmware
because of compatibility with vmware infrastructure esx i would prefer vmware for headless server operations and virtualbox for anything that requires user interaction photoshop gui etc

2303985
prepare	execute
which means that if you want to see an sql query you have to use well sql queries and not prepare statements
using prepare statements when you prepare the statement it is sent to the mysql server when you bind the variables + execute the statement only the variables are sent to the mysql server and the statement + bound variables are execute on the mysql server -- without it re-doing the preparation each time the statement is execute which is why prepare statements can be good for performance when the same statement is execute several times there is no building of an sql query on the php side so there is no way to actually get that query

2304794
oncreate	onstart
also these pairs oncreate ondestroy onstart onstop onpause onresume are intended to be the proper pairs for acquiring and then releasing resources such as binding to service s registering receivers etc to ensure that they are correctly acquired prior to being needed and released and not leaked when no longer needed
i would generally recommend doing this in either oncreate ondestroy or onstart onstop depending on the semantics that you want if your activity wants to be interacting with the service the entire time it is running for example maybe it can retrieve some data from a network for you and will return the data when ready and you want to allow this to happen while in the background so if the user returns you will have the data ready then oncreate ondestroy is probably appropriate

2306209
client-side	server-side
your javascript code is running client-side and so it s subject to the same origin policy
your asp code is running server-side and so it isn t

2306211
google-chrome	firefox
if you don t google-chrome treats it as an empty element and does not render it
whereas firefox does

2306275
swt	swing
heavy components native awt hide swing components not a problem most of the time as as use of heavy components is rather rare pros swt uses native elements when possible so always native behavior supported by eclipse gui editor vep vep also supports swing and awt large number of examples online has an integrated awt swt bridge to allow use of awt and swing components cons swt requires native libraries for each supported system may not support every behavior on all systems because of native resources used hint options managing native resources while native components will often be disposed with their parent other resources such as fonts have to be manually released or registered as dispose listener to a component for automatic release
pros swing part of java library no need for additional native libraries works the same way on all platforms integrated gui editor in netbeans and eclipse good online tutorials by sun oracle supported by official java extensions like java opengl cons swing native look and feel may behave different from the real native system

2307380
factors	mean
but what exactly is o log n what it means precisely is as n tends towards infinity the time tends towards where a is a constant scaling factors
or actually it doesn t quite mean that

2310282
ireport	subreports
try using ireport if you are not
when viewing a report within ireport you can select the properties of the subreports within the main report

2310912
required	placeholder
define a class like roundy-corner and use the jquery corner plugin like so you will need the jquery roundy corner plugin i like to use javascript here because it doesn t required any additional markup in the source document
the script will insert placeholder elements as needed

2313549
serializable	deserialization
once all custom code has finished it will deserialize all automatically serializable objects like your myclasswithnvc class in the sample
if you let myclasswithnvc inherit from iserializable then it runs your custom deserialization code and myclass.nvc is not null in the wrapper deserializer method

2316935
firefox	safari
i had the same problem and found that whilst i couldn t inspect hover objects in firefox with firebug safari s web inspector would freeze the current state and allow inspection
to activate safari s web inspector just enter the following line into the terminal and restart safari defaults write com.apple.safari webkitdeveloperextras -bool true activate the hover element in the browser then right click and select inspect element

2317989
n-gram	words
an n-gram index used by lucene produces better results for longer words
the approach to produce candidates up to a given edit distance will probably work good enough for words found in normal text but will not work good enough for names addresses and scientific texts

2320072
portrait	landscape
when that is all said and done in portrait orientation android will use main.xml found in res layout and in landscape main.xml found in res layout-land
assuming you do not have a separate xml file dedicated to landscape format you might need to create one and specify the landscape-layout look

2320556
google-chrome	firefox
watin does exactly that and i believe they recently added google-chrome support update 6 22 2011 currrently watin only works on firefox 2 and 3 not in firefiox 4 and almost certainly not in firefox 5 which was released today
also the time of this answer google-chrome support was supposedly being added but it looks like that never got fully baked and now is not listed as a suported platform on their home page

2320841
kerberos	ntlm
this negotiation attempts to use kerberos but if that doesn t work it ll fall back and use the older ntlm protocol
kerberos is a great choice if you re in a domain environment

2321916
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
it pushes uiviewcontroller not views
so when something happens in your second tab where the uinavigationcontroller lives you will push a uiviewcontroller onto the stack

2322091
swt	swing
also pivot swt etc
pro swing the biggest advantage of swing imho is that you do not need to ship the libraries with you application which avoids dozen of mb

2323582
implements	extends
as a rule of thumb a list implementation should implements this interface if for typical instances of the class this loop runs faster than this loop as of java se 6 the implements classes are arraylist attributelist copyonwritearraylist rolelist roleunresolvedlist stack vector
get n for linked lists is not a constant operation for classes that extends abstractsequentiallist

2324076
postgresql	mysql
i don t know postgresql at all but there must be some significant misconfiguration in steven s example to not show similar results
given postgresql s reputation for doing things better than mysql or at least as good as i daresay that postgresql would demonstrate similar performance if properly used

2324328
equals	gethashcode
i d change your equals method to something like the following which isn t a major change - i think it takes care of the above mentioned bug and changes a couple other things that are strictly style-related so may not have any interest to you
also note that i haven t actually compiled and test my equals method so there s a nearly 100 chance that there s a bug or at least a syntax error note that strictly speaking the original gethashcode method isn t bugged even though it has the same flaw because even if you don t properly mix in the last element when the bit-length is a multiple of 32 equal object would still return the same hashcode

2324542
client-side	server-side
you cannot affect client-side print settings with a server-side language not even vb.net
the web server and the browser run in different machines and neither html nor client-side javascript define such features

2325449
g++	gcc
edit the following code compiles correctly with g++ 3.3.6
i am not able to test it on gcc 3.3.3 and suse linux at the moment

2325783
phpunit	simpletest
which also means it s harder to install configure selenium allows you to test rich dynamic javascript-based applications much better that only fetching and parsing html if you are testing a php application phpunit is generally considered much better it s activelly maintained and developped at least that simpletest
and phpunit has support for selenium tests i would recommend a combinaison of both if you can test html-related stuff with simpletest or zend_test if using zend framework it ll be faster those tests will not depend on a browser test dynamic pages with selenium use the best of both tools

2328239
postgresql	mysql
the query you use was often used as a replacement for a left join for the engines that lacked it most notably postgresql before 7.2 this approach has some serious drawbacks it may fail if table2.id is not unique some engines will not be able to use anything else than nested loops for this query if you need to select more than one column you will need to write the subquery several times if your engine supports left join use the left join
in mysql however there are some cases when an aggregate function in a select-level subquery can be more efficient than that in a left join with a group by

2328284
nexus	artifactory
i m not familiar with nexus but artifactory installation is dead simple - just unzip and you re good to go since it comes with an embedded jetty
repository managers employ more sophisticated caching than the maven core itself at least with artifactory you can restrict which maven repositories are queried for which group ids

2329726
pbkdf2	md5	scrypt	md5
use scrypt bcrypt or pbkdf2
md5 was found to be weak back in 1996 and should not be used anymore for cryptographic purposes

2329839
kerberos	ldap
in addition ldap makes for a good way of abstracting authentication over lots of different means active directory kerberos even normal sql-based authentication
ldap is certainly not a dead technology

2330644
cassini	iis
i think that this is not cassini s doing this is asp.net using .net shadow copy to prevent locking your dlls
so using iis should not change anything

2331878
serializable	deserialization
as for serializable deserialization i doubt it is possible to get original object
i don t know what type of serializable powershell uses but if you consider simple xml serializable then you can realize that you can serialize only properties and nothing else. you can t serialize bodys of its methods. you can t serialize all it s event s subscribers or maybe in some cases it would be possible but i m not such a .net expert . and because the type as in my example may not be available the assembly is present only on the remote computer all the type information would need to be transmitted

2333207
uiview	subviews
the correct way is to make a uiview that contains both the background image and the text view
uiimageview by default has userinteractionenabled set to no so scrolling or any interaction wouldn t work by default as a subviews of uiimageview

2335270
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
if google-chrome does not recognize the url scheme it defaults to a search
this is what i see in safari alt text and in firefox alt text i believe the reason why google-chrome defaults to search is that there are special google searches that use the colon

2335270
firefox	safari
e.g define dictionary filetype pdf google chromium this is one of the annoyances i have with firefox i have to jump to the search box rather than the address bar to execute these types of searches
since chrome does not have a separate search box like firefox ie and safari have this functionality is required

2335628
oncreate	onstart
the method will call the oncreate method of the service if service is not already created
else onstart method will be called

2336546
gif	png
so basically here is a way to decide the image format gif if needs animation or transparency that works on ie6 note png transparency works after ie6 jpeg if the image is a photograph
png if straight lines as in a comic or other drawing or if a wide color range is needed with transparency and ie6 is not a factor and as commented if you are unsure of what would qualify try each format with different compression ratios and weigh the quality and size of the picture and choose which one you think is best

2336552
gif	png
png has a wider color pallete than gif and gif is properitary while png is not
gif can do animations what normal-png cannot

2336574
gif	png
the main difference is gif is patented and a bit more widely supported
png is an open specification and alpha transparency is not supported in ie6

2336575
gif	png
gif is limited to 256 colors and do not support real transparency
you should use png instead of gif because it offers better compression and features

2336582
tiff	png
digital photographers use image file formats capable of reproducing a greater range of colors such as tiff raw or the lossy jpeg which is more suitable for compressing photographs
the png format is a popular alternative to gif images since it uses better compression techniques and does not have a limit of 256 colors but pngs do not support animations

2336738
ssl	https
https certificates can be obtained for free using let s encrypt or start ssl there is no legitimate reason not to support https
https vital because it does lot more than just encrypt passwords

2337686
bash	subshell
i would normally write or even more likely note that the version with a pipe will not necessarily be suitable in bash
the bourne shell would run the while loop in the current shell but bash runs it in a subshell at least by default

2338917
google-chrome	firefox
doesn t seem to be a problem for me in google-chrome 5
edit ah i got it in firefox

2339243
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
my xib has - file s owner descriptivenamenavviewcontroller - first responder - view uiview - navigation controller uinavigationcontroller - navigation bar uinavigationbar note that there isn t anything in the view
see viewdidload below for where the uinavigationcontroller gets attached to the uiview

2339291
onclick	onfocus
i guess safari doesn t like onclick event on select elements
replacing the onclick event with onfocus solved the problem

2340166
firefox	safari
here are my findings when using or for submitting the form same result firefox win - when tabbing the focus does hit the button firefox mac - when tabbing the focus is not hitting the button
safari mac - when tabbing the focus is not hitting the button

2341310
ssl	https
export compliance specialist that sending information over https is forcing the data to go through a secure channel from ssl therefore it falls under the u.s
government requirement for a ccats review and approval. note that it doesn t matter that apple has already done this for their ssl implementation but for the government if you use encryption that is the same to them as you would ve coded it yourself

2341396
ubuntu	debian
i also verified that on my local ubuntu machine and which gave me some more output in the not working case than the debian machine
when it was not working under ubuntu i got something like this . eclipse . 26981 glib-gobject-warning invalid null pointer instance . 26981 glib-gobject-critical g_signal_connect_data assertion g_type_check_instance instance failed . 26981 gtk-critical gtk_settings_get_for_screen assertion gdk_is_screen screen failed . 26981 glib-gobject-critical g_object_get assertion g_is_object object failed . 26981 glib-gobject-warning value true of type gboolean is invalid or out of range for property visible of type gboolean . 26981 gtk-critical gtk_settings_get_for_screen assertion gdk_is_screen screen failed . 26981 glib-gobject-critical g_object_get assertion g_is_object object failed . 26981 gtk-warning screen for gtkwindow not set

2344388
ssl	https
the player supports digest authentication but not ssl client authentication using client certificates
this pretty much nails how to handle encrypted streaming also the app should connect to the https domain before running the movie so that it can pass its credentials and these credentials can be cached for mpmovieplayer

2346216
implements	extends
normally of course interfaces aren t empty so there s a specific maybe small cost in implements one and or the other different multiple methods will need to get implements
if say ifirst has a method foo and isecond has a method bar it makes perfect sense to extends both into an iboth even if that doesn t add further needed methods -- it allows a method to clearly express that it needs an argument that has both methods foo and bar

2346466
vmware	virtualbox
the .vmdk files are vmware images - you should be able to load them fine using the vmware tool virtualbox supports these too but the converse is not true
.vdi is a virtualbox supported format but not supported by vmware

2348006
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
it should be called on the displayed view controller itself not the navigation controller like this on the other hand if you want to display a toolbar at the top under the navigation bar you should use a uiviewcontroller that has a uitoolbar and a uitableview as its subviews instead of a uitableviewcontroller
the toolbar included in uinavigationcontroller is as you observed displayed at the bottom above the tab bar

2350480
serializable	deserialization
it is not considered when the xmlserializer builds its serializable assembly
therefore xmlignore-d properties are not populated during deserialization and will be left with their default value

2351231
stateless	stateful
when the app server fetches a stateless session bean out of the object pool it knows that it can be used to satisfy any request because it s not associated with a particular user
a stateful session bean has to be doled out to the user that got it in the first place because their shopping cart info should be known only to them

2351487
stateless	stateful
in other words although stateless beans may have instance variables these fields are not specific to one client so don t rely on them between remote calls
in contrast stateful session beans sfsb are dedicated to one client for their entire life there is no swapping or pooling of instances it may be evicted from memory after passivation to save resources but that s another story and maintain conversational state

2352357
client-side	server-side
i would recommending learning the distinction between server-side tags and client-side tags because while similar in syntax they can have very different results for example self-closing script tags in browsers typically don t work when using third-party libraries
either way is acceptable and it doesn t affect browser output because the asp scriptmanager tag is processed on the server-side

2353374
ilist	icollection
first does not implement ilist either probably for the same reasons
implements some parts of icollection just aren t necessary but changing an interface after it s out in the wild is breaking at best

2354248
udp	tcp
udp isn t considered for game servers as much mainly out of the scenario above and real time combat systems such as first person shooters where a message can be dropped and the new message to come will invalidate the dropped message anyways
world of warcraft can get away with using tcp since they don t have to be as precise with timing and likely have some good logic that makes it more difficult for you to tell the difference anyways

2354248
udp	tcp
here s a list of things tcp ip can now do that you d loose by going udp - in order arrival to you re program - retransmission now with fast retransmit selective acknowledgement and other features - maximum segment size - path mtu discovery - black hole detection extension of path mtu - congestion avoidance because of this i d highly recommend sticking with tcp ip if it suits you re needs
also not to nit pick but you re comment about the internet running on tcp ip is wrong there are in fact dozens of internet routeable protocols check them out here

2358574
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
opera 7.10 will not understand document.cookie so it is not reliable. try using this one instead it is compatible with most browsers and the ones which will not work with it are not used anymore
i have tested it with internet explorer 8.0 firefox 3.6 google-chrome 4.0 opera 10.10 both within html and xhtml

2360509
lxml	celementtree
object models such as lxml s objectify or amara might be more natural for python developers when speed is not a consideration
celementtree is faster when only parsing is required

2360927
subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication
it s not random its pseudorandom from this lagged fibonacci generators have a maximum period of 2 k - 1 2 m-1 if addition or subtraction is used and 2 k-1 if exclusive-or operations are used to combine the previous values
if on the other hand multiplication is used the maximum period is 2 k - 1 2 m-3 or 1 4 of period of the additive case

2361547
oncreate	findviewbyid	setcontentview	findviewbyid
this is probably the case because this does not refer to the activity or you re not assigning the view to the activity in oncreate you have to call setcontentview in oncreate
well seems that findviewbyid returns null

2362600
udp	tcp
udp should not be used for bulk data transfer file transfers since you would have to build in all the functionality arleady in tcp to make it work right
udp should be used for real time data where speed of delivery is most important and some data loss is not an issue such as real time sensor data live multimedia streams real time stock quotes etc

2364018
viewmodel	caliburn
the module is responsible for instantiating any views necessary at the start and contributing back to the shell during initialize and that s typically it so when you attack this problem you ll want to focus on your views viewmodel and not the module classes
options off the top of my head adopt a complimentary framework like caliburn that has support for application events like this as well as some mdi events like viewclosing that kind of thing

2365928
allocator	stl
more tasteful would be to initialise a stack with a reserved vector at the cost of an extra allocator
and don t try to use this class polymorphically - stl containers aren t designed for that

2366670
udp	tcp
many audio video protocols are built on top of udp since missed re-ordered packets once in a while are not critical
in short your server is probably only listening on tcp port and not on udp

2366781
implements	extends
also since you can implements many interfaces but extends only one class you can only provide your own superclass if you implements runnable
if you extends thread you can not have any other superclass

2367471
union	distinct
union means union distinct and this is relatively slow as it will check for duplicates even though there will not be any
you want union all i would imagine that after this change there is not much difference in performance between the three queries

2367759
nunit	mstest
you can t run mstest on computer without vs on it not 100 sure about 2010 but with 2008 it is so not sure sorry yes you can from visual studio my recommendation is following if nunit satisfies you - use it forget about mstest
list item speed is same but mstest may be a bit slower because it creates folder for test run every time msbuid and cc.net is big pain

2368310
wma	speex
general-purpose compression schemes such as wma or mp3 are likely to cause more delay and they also may not be able to operate well at very low bitrates
speex is free open-source codec designed for encoding speech in realtime solutions that need low latency

2369259
ienumerable	icollection
every icollection is guaranteed to be ienumerable so icollection derives from ienumerable
if it was legal or made sense to be a collection but not be enumerable then implementers of icollection wouldn t have to implement ienumerable also

2372712
vsto	add-in
assuming that you are referring to an add-in created using vsto
when you create an add-in for office 2007 the referenced interop assemblies will be the ones associated with office 2007 and this is the main reason for your add-in not to work on office 2003

2375395
realloc	malloc
if you dynamically link with the crt you can redefine malloc realloc and free like this #define malloc s mymalloc s #define realloc p s myrealloc p s #define free p myfree p the implementations of mymalloc myrealloc and myfree can then simply use malloc realloc and free be sure not to use the #define in the source file that implements mymalloc ... or you could use the native windows functions
if you statically link with the crt you can overrule the implementation of malloc realloc free in fact all functions that appear in malloc.c realloc c free.c and or dbgheap.c in the crt

2376021
variance	kurtosis
your goal apparently is to determine whether the data could plausibly have come from any normal distribution not one with a pre-specified mean and variance
probably the best way to do this is with d agostino test which is based on measuring the skewness and kurtosis of the distribution and comparing these to what s expected under normality

2377486
awt	swing
which are not available in awt
also swing is meant to be portable while awt in theory will match more of the system s look and feel

2381490
prepare	execute
when using prepare statements you should not do like you are doing
you should one and only one time prepare the statement using placeholders for the data for each line bind the values and execute the statement you should not prepare the statement for each line inject your data into the sql query instead of using placeholders

2382923
kerberos	ldap
all information is visible via kerberos authenticated messaging - if you join a unix server to the domain via samba then the samba tools have full visibility
if communicating via ldaps the directory may provide more information not verified however but under straight ldap none of the foreign directory samaccountnames are accessible

2385126
comparator	comparable
in conjunction with a simple mru cache you could keep some number of keys in memory using another hashmap which is keyed on the same keys but which uses a custom comparator which compares just the offset and length values not the file data
you could use java s hash map and write a filekey class that takes a randomaccessfile offset and length precomputes the hash at construction and which implements comparable by reading the data from the file just for the compare

2385623
octal	decimal
octal values go to 0 to 7 your code seems to prove that certain javascript engine convert 8 and 9 to invalid characters and just ignore them
yu shouldn t prefix by 0 your numbers if you don t want to use the octal like using the normal decimal numbers

2387551
jruby	mri	mri	rubinius
so if you use ffi you won t have to write a single line of c and your library will automatically work on mri yarv jruby and rubinius and in the future also on ironruby macruby and maglev
in the past the go-to method for binding ruby to c or c to ruby it doesn t really matter was writing an mri c extension by hand

2389238
gtk	cairo
if you report is mostly text i d render to the cairo context with pango yet part of the gtk stack
cairo is the way surely it is not inefficient.

2390601
nunit	mstest
nunit contains a testcase attribute that allows implementing parametrized tests
this does not exist out of the box in mstest - it can be done via extensibility though

2390601
nunit	mstest
nunit ships with an assert.throws api to allow testing an exception on a specific line of code instead of the whole method
a similar feature exists for mstest implemented by the same person who did it for nunit but does not ship with mstest

2390601
nunit	mstest
a similar feature exists for mstest implemented by the same person who did it for nunit but does not ship with mstest
nunit contains a fluent version of assert api out of the box

2390673
google-chrome	firefox
edit also true in google-chrome
well when i go there in firefox i get an error saying no posts match my query which make me wonder if your server isn t set up right

2390947
uiview	subviews
in this i have the method i also added the views i wanted to auto-rotate as subviews to this root uiviewcontoller s uiview
these subviews also have view controllers but do not override shouldautorotatetointerfaceorientation

2392343
factors	matrix
you can see in help to apply why apply and as.factor doesn t work in all cases the result is coerced by as.vector to one of the basic vector types before the dimensions are set so that for example factors results will be coerced to a character array
why sapply and as.factor doesn t work you can see in help to sapply value ... an atomic vector or matrix or list of the same length as x ... if simplification occurs the output type is determined from the highest type of the return values in the hierarchy null raw logical integer real complex character list expression after coercion of pairlists to lists

2392570
margin	text-align
text-align center will center the contents of the container while margin auto will center the container itself
you should be careful with margin auto because it is not supported in ie6

2392756
profiling	debugging
you can use the profiling from flashbuilder not free to see where things can be improved
you can optimise at the bytecode level without touching your source using tdsi for example still in development and more optimisation will come if you want to see what s going under the hood and understand more the compiled code look at the tamarin source code adobe vm use in the flash player and learn the abc bytecode or write multiple function and measure their performance do small refactor step by step to see what are the gain you can use gskinner library for the measurement don t use the debugging player since some function are slower int it

2393129
wxpython	pyqt
to my tastes it seems that wxpython s tutorial the new one in wiki form is what i m pointing to and recommending is really good and pyqt s not bad at all
pyside s docs don t include a good tutorial that i know of i believe pyside s intention is that you first learn pyqt with the reasonable available materials then apply these few differences to be programming in pyside instead of pyqt

2393989
nunit	mstest
nunit contains a testcase attribute that allows implementing parametrized tests
this does not exist in mstest this can be implemented using unit test extensibility in 2010

2393989
nunit	mstest
correct thats still there nunit has an assert.throws api to allow testing an exception on a specific line of code instead of the whole method you can easily implement this one yourself though jim implented a version of assert.throws for mstest at the same time as he did the original implementation for nunit nunit has included in subsequent releases mstest has not its still possible to use though
nunit contains a fluent version of assert api as already mentioned - assert.that.. there are several of these implemented by 3rd parties for mstest nunit is much faster see jamie s comment he has managed to get mstest running faster - nunit can run tests in 32 and 64 bit mstest only runs them in 32 bit iirc not in 2010 64 bit support is built in

2393989
nunit	mstest

nunit allows abstract classes to be test fixtures so you can inherit test fixtures

2393989
nunit	mstest
nunit allows abstract classes to be test fixtures so you can inherit test fixtures
mstest does not

2395371
zlib	libpng
so when the linker handles -lz first there are not yet any calls to it so it doesn t pull in any of zlib
next when the linker handles libpng it sees that there are calls to it from your code

2395432
lisp	scheme
for example a double linked list data structure is circular in the scheme lisp point of view if you try to print the cons-structure out you get backreferences cycles
so it s not really about having data structures that look like rings any data structure where you have some kind of backpointers is circular from the scheme lisp perspective

2395432
lisp	scheme
so it s not really about having data structures that look like rings any data structure where you have some kind of backpointers is circular from the scheme lisp perspective
a normal lisp list is single linked which means that a destructive mutation to remove an item from inside the list is an o n operation

2395918
udp	tcp
generally socks requires configuration on each client and isn t transparent to applications system-wide socket socksification isn t installed enabled by default on windows while nat even without upnp mostly works transparently and without any additional client configuration for outgoing tcp sockets and outgoing udp
nat with upnp also supports server tcp sockets better than socks socks can only accept a single connection with its bind request which is okay for receiving a single tcp connection in a protocol like ftp but useless for running a server that needs to accept many connections from many clients

2395959
postgresql	mysql
i don t know enough about the internal row-versioning mechanisms of mysql or indeed if there is one but other databases oracle postgresql and more recently sql server have invested a lot of effort into allowing writers to not block readers in so far as readers have access to the version of the rows that existed immediately before the update write process started
once the update is committed that version of the row becomes the one made availabe to all readers thereby avoiding a bottleneck that the above behaviour in mysql will introduce

2398273
implements	extends
there are however automatically implements properties in c# 3.0 and higher which you declause in the following way
please be also aware that the c# compiler will create a backing field automatically so basically both ways are the same but you gain more flexibility with the first because with automatically implements properties you cannot add more complex behaviour than just simple setting and retrieving of values at least in the class where you declare it making it virtual opens possibilites to extends property logic in subclasses..

2398619
comparator	comparable
that s not a comparator class
that s a name class that implements comparable

2399385
super	self
if you want to know the nitty-gritty of what super does the best explanation i ve found for how super works is here though i m not necessarily endorsing that article s opinions
one way is to call a s constructor and pass self as an argument like so class b a def __init__ self a.__init__ self print hello the advantage of this style is that it s very clear

2405055
equals	gethashcode
if they are equals the hashcodes should match however if they are not equals they could still have the same hash however small that possibility might be
from the article if two string objects are equals the gethashcode method returns identical values

2406255
html5lib	beautifulsoup
the main alternative i think would be html5lib -- i haven t tries it on app engine but i believe it does run there quite slowly -- if that s a problem i think you need to stick with beautifulsoup this service runs on app engine and is based on html5lib
beautifulsoup runs fine on app engine just make sure to use 3.0.8 not the iffy 3.1.0

2407018
serializable	deserialization
there are free serializable libraries for delphi also for free pascal json superobject and lkjson xml omnixml and nativexml json and xml are cross-platform cross-language which might be helpful for future interfaces to other systems like php-based web shop for example
they are also free and open standards no vendor lock-in update i would not use the constructor-based approach while maybe looking trivial in the beginning deserialization can become a complex process which would add more and more non-class-specific code to the classes which need serializable

2409146
allocator	stl
as for memory allocator you use existing memory allocator such as hoard or ned allocator which is quite high performance and good for embedded system
why not use stl but provide your own allocator and deallocator for example stl vector is defined as you can create and set your own allocator that request memory space from your memory pool

2411869
udp	tcp
and udp doesn t guarantee packets delivery
so probably tcp protocol will be a better choice

2413158
persistent	transient
the entity instances that you get back from the jpa api are hydrated containers representing the persistent data
the java objects themselves are not special they re just transient data holders

2413592
shadowing	named
one last note the public strings and the jtextfields have the same named this creates a problem for the computer as it does not know which one you are referring to this is called shadowing
define unique named for each variable within a class so you do not confuse the compiler or yourself

2415200
inline	inlining
with normal inlining all kinds of effects on register usage local variables etc are there that the compiler cannot do with inline assembly
you cannot inline hand crafted assembly code

2415200
inline	inlining
you cannot inline hand crafted assembly code
it would be very hard to allow inlining of these pieces of assembler

2415238
bazaar	git
this type of flexibility is what draws me to bazaar despite the fact that git is wildly more popular and faster
this is one of the way cool features of bazaar that doesn t get enough press the ability for people to work the way that makes them comfortable even on the same shared repository

2418327
ilist	icollection
you can access elements in an ilist by index but their position is not stored in the database
you can t access an icollection by index without using extension methods but it does have an addat method to add an object to the collection at an index

2418540
intersect	contains
your code isn t working becasue using multiple from clauses creates a full outer join you need to use intersect although it doesn t show in intellisense string implements so you don t need to call tochararray
note that this will only count each character once so if both strings contains the same character twice this will only count it once

2420605
thunk	trampolines
see for an example of how you could go about generating thunk
there is a non-portable and pretty hackish solution that has the advantage of at least being thread-safe which the trampolines methods are not

2420716
vim	emacs
i m not familiar with how the emacs integration works but in vim it works pretty much like a regular tag-stack in that you can jump to symbol and then pop back to a previous symbol
here s some information on the vim integration

2420868
division	multiplication	division	subtraction
if multiplication is not allowed then there also seem to be plenty of integer division algorithms which just use shifts bitwise operations and add subtract first hit on google www.bearcave.com software divide.htm
there are various methods - i would suggest newton-raphson which is simple and fast and uses only multiplication and subtraction

2421692
invalidoperationexception	argumentexception
throw invalidoperationexception if the call was invalid for a reason not pertaining specifically to a value of an argument
in this particular case i d probably choose argumentexception

2422401
nunit	mstest
if you re not using tfs as your ci build server you may want to seriously consider nunit or one of the other open source projects
see msbuild nant nunit mstest and frustration

2422410
nunit	mstest
nunit is an older more established unit testing framework designed to do exactly one thing - unit testing
mstest is newer so it does not have the same level of maturity in its api

2422410
nunit	mstest
it does not contain a standalone test runner like nunit
mstest provides test results and code coverage results directly within visual studio

2422859
inline	inlining
i think the first optimization above might be warning - speculation ahead allowing that insertion delegate to be inline - it s a known fact that the jitter can t inline virtual calls - but there s still something else that s not being inline and that s where i m presently stumped
my next step would be to selectively disable inlining on certain methods via the methodimplattribute and see what effect that has on the runtime - that would help to prove or disprove this theory

2423765
ienumerable	iqueryable
you already noticed this because the object it returns is an ienumerable of user and not an iqueryable of user
for this reason you are converting it to an iqueryable of user by calling asqueryable

2425769
implements	extends
implements the interface is considered better but not because of anything specific to threads
in general implements an interface gives your code more flexibility because you can implement multiple interfaces but only extends a single class

2427119
opera	google-chrome
disclaimer i work on video for opera
to the best of my knowledge google-chrome doesn t support wmv

2428941
openmpi	mpich
mpich has built-in debugger while openmpi does not last time i checked
in production openmpi most likely will be faster

2429803
google-chrome	firefox
i ve also tested it in the latest versions of firefox 3.6 and google-chrome whose version escapes me
google-chrome will not allow you to enter a custom protocol into the address bar but it will launch applications from links using custom protocols

profiling	instrumentation
you can take a look at open source profiling as well though i have not used any of these and can t say how good or bad they are
edit i assume you understand how profiling works the profiler will do some instrumentation and attach an agent to the jvm all this affects performance

2432558
opera	firefox
this only seems to happen on windows not just in the browsers you mention but also in opera 9 and ie6
not in firefox 2.0 though

2432986
awt	swing
i believe the reason is because swing was built off of awt and container is a top level awt object
it really isn t the greatest design choice though since you generally don t want to mix awt heavyweight objects with swing lightweight

2433962
floating-point	fractions
bear in mind when you get the result that floating-point numbers cannot in general represent decimal fractions precisely
so once you have the mathematically correct answer it will not necessarily give you an integer answer when you do a floating-point multiplication

2434001
xna	spritebatch
keep in mind that if you are changing the blend modes your spritebatch should be performing in the immediate mode i forget the xna term but the one where it doesn t do ordering of sprites for efficiency else it will be reset unexpectedly
i see you have tagged this with xna so assume that is your api though this answer could well be applied to any opengl d3d approach with appropriate calls

2436304
haskell	scheme
if you re interested in functional programming haskell is the only purely functional language on that list
common lisp is a weakly functional mixed-paradigm language and scheme is more strongly functional but still not pure

2436597
implements	extends
implements this using a template for the derived classes would be difficult and the template metaprogramming to handle it would probably be unreadable unmaintainable and very fragile
implements the dispatch using non-template methods then using a mixin template a template class that takes its base class as a template parameter to extends that with additional features may not be so bad though

2437114
youtube	vimeo
why aren t you using video hosting service free like for example youtube vimeo for this which are way better prepared for handling this then you could ever be
youtube has an api for all kinds of stuff

2437122
google-chrome	firefox
on the other hand the reason why ie safari and google-chrome were working is because they still had x-request-with set to xmlhttprequest in redirected request
it is still a mystery to me as to why firefox and opera didn t but i am not going to worry about it at this point

2439888
equals	compareto
the recommended language is note this class has a natural ordering that is inconsistent with equals. and a class whose compareto method imposes an order that is inconsistent with equals will still work but sorted collections containing elements of the class may not obey the general contract of the appropriate collection interfaces collection set or map
this is because the general contracts for these interfaces are defined in terms of the equals method but sorted collections use the equality test imposed by compareto in place of equals

2441756
innodb	myisam
first make sure you are using innodb or another engine that supports foreign keys
myisam does not

2446749
viewdidload	viewdidappear
if you want it to start when the view is first created and keep ticking firing even when the view is not shown then you need to create it during init or viewdidload and then be sure to stop it when you dealloc or viewdidunload
if you want your timer to only tick fire when the view is the current view then you need to ensure you re managing stopping and starting the timer appropriately on viewdidappear and viewwilldisappear

2448017
ssl	https
you don t get any opportunity to influence ssl negotiation and you don t get the ability to make a request to a different domain than the one you re running on for very good security reasons
you could get around that and use a low-level socket with complex libraries to implement https over the top of it except that js doesn t give you any access to low-level sockets either

2448719
icmp	tcp
isreachable will use icmp echo request s if the privilege can be obtained otherwise it will try to establish a tcp connection on port 7 echo of the destination host
thus your problem is probably a configuration issue of not enough permissions to do this on the client machine or a port 7 issue on the server if your client doesn t have permission to do the icmp echo request

2449849
prepare	execute
for each parameter that has a variable length data type you must set the size property to the maximum size needed. prepare returns an error if these conditions are not met
if you call an execute method after calling prepare any parameter value that is larger than the value specified by the size property is automatically truncated to the original specified size of the parameter and no truncation errors are returned

2450068
factors	mean
you should choose the scale factors along both axises to max dx dy
if you mean that you are not keeping aspect ratio just scale to the minimum bounding square instead of minimum bounding rectangle

2451173
google-chrome	firefox
you ll see the error if you open the google-chrome javascript console
firefox 3.6 also raises an error but seems to silently discard it it s not visible in the error console

2451775
portrait	landscape
reports are portrait by default though - if yours are showing up as landscape and nobody has changed the height and width of the page then i m not sure what s happening
to change my reports to landscape i simply swap the pagesize property s height and width values on the report itself

2452043
profiling	benchmarking
i m not a yaml parser implementor so i can t speak specifically to the orders of magnitude without some profiling data and a big corpus of examples
in any case be sure to test over a large body of inputs before feeling confident in benchmarking numbers

2453997
config	ini
if there s just one possible config for one user or such maybe you should just put everything in a text file the extension doesn t matter ini cfg txt lol anything you want just simplify your life by using standard java config access using the properties class
if this config is user-related maybe you want to keep separate config for each user serialized on a database so you can load them dynamically when a user loads the form that displays the checkboxes

2456606
prepare	execute
if you method is actually calling pdo prepare make sure that you don t pass that argument as a second parameter to pdo prepare judging from the documentation the second parameter that pdo prepare expects is an array of options -- not an array describing the type of data for each placeholder
and you try to execute this portion of code var_dump pdo attr_statement_class

2457342
postgresql	mysql
postgresql has namespaces which is definately the most efficient way of handling that sort of thing just create a new namespace for the old database and you re done
the way most php mysql solutions solve it specific prefix per app is also an option but not one i d recommend

2458334
implements	extends
simply implements comparable myabs on class b which if i interpret your question correctly extends myabs
that way objects of class b can be compared with any objects whose classes extends myabs but not vice versa

2459269
jpql	hql
so i don t think that you can do it in jpql
however it would be possible in hql the order by clause in hql is passed through to the database so you can use any function but i repeat this may not work with another database

2459886
boost	allocator
this is wrong and is exactly why boost interprocess vector needs a shared memory allocator
in its ctor buf itself allocates a private boost interprocess vector data member this doesn t make sense to me

2460291
dictionary	map
i currently can t see a way to directly convert a dictionary using this method other than f# to c# what is weird here is that fsi will report the type as for example but if you feed back in fsi reports
f# map - c# dictionary i know i know system.collections.generic.dictionary isn t really a c# dictionary c# to f# from brian here with improvement proposed by mauricio in comment below

2460291
dictionary	map
f# map - c# dictionary i know i know system.collections.generic.dictionary isn t really a c# dictionary c# to f# from brian here with improvement proposed by mauricio in comment below
|keyvalue| is an active pattern for matching keyvaluepair - from fsharp.core - equivalent to interesting alternative to get all of the immutable goodness but with the o 1 lookup speed of dictionary you can use the dict operator which returns an immutable idictionary see this question

2460910
setinterval	settimeout
if you loose the brackets it will pass a function not a result of it to setinterval and you won t have any issues
settimeout this.poll this.interval

2462172
serializable	deserialization
or the class can simply not support serializable
which is not unusual classes often depend on state that cannot be faithfully reproduced at deserialization time because it depends on global program state

2464777
uiview	subviews
and when you need duplicate cell create another instance of same uiview and use it in your animation
if you need only duplicated image of your cell for animation not a real view with all subviews you can simply copy cell image or if you need real view create it

2464975
ssms	sqlcmd
ssms on the other hand does not by default interpret the sql for variable substitution
ssms can be made to do this by checking the option open query widows in sqlcmd mode

2465203
cifs	smb
we did extensive trials with the source stored on a smb cifs mounted disk in the enterprise software company where i work and the conclusion was that it is not possible to tweak this to any acceptable performance since cifs performance for handling big amounts of small files is so poor
in our scenario the terminal server using with the ide was in the same data center as the app servers serving the cifs so the network was comparable performing as local disks

2465470
viewdidload	viewwillappear
the viewdidload is call when the initialisation of the viewcontroller is finished. i should you to call it in the viewwillappear method like that
the urltoget is null into your readfeedwebviewcontroller in the viewdidload method because when this method is call this variable is not yet affected

2466295
namedtuple	dictionary
but if employee object is just a structure which you can access with dot syntax .name instead of dictionary syntax you can use namedtuple like this you do have _asdict method to access all properties as dictionary but you cannot add additional attributes later only during the construction
i think that answer using settattr are the way to go if you really need to support dictionary

2467700
swt	swing
i recently 4 weeks ago switched from eclipse swt to netbeans 6.8 swing after being fed up with some plugin licensing issues in eclipse
i came in cold not being familiar with either netbeans or swing and was quickly impressed

2470305
boost	stl
but you can use boost regex library
stl till c++0x does not supports regular expressions

2470363
dictionary	map
it s not bad but the various implementation are horribly inefficient it s ok for small dictionary but it s an amazing waste when you have several hundred thousands of words
now if you just want to solve the specific problem you describe you can parse the dictionary file and create a map letters in sorted order set of matching words then for any number of random letters sort them see if you have an entry in the map if you do the entry s value contains all the words that you can do with these letters

2471150
implements	extends
the abstract plugin class will implements the greetinterface so we can make sure all subclasses implements the interface too
since dude already implements the interface as well we could have the plugins extends dude but that would be conceptually wrong because extends creates an is-a relationship but a plugin is not a dude

2471669
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
so to me this sounds more like a case for runtimeexception unchecked
callers of this method can still catch an unchecked-exception if they really want to but they are not forced to

2478364
allocator	stl
if you need to get this values regularly in your application and if you are not able to implement the whole solution using allocator you need to start with a few small steps
read about allocator c++ standard allocator an introduction and implementation allocator stl try to implement std vector with your own allocator as an exercise try to add counting bytes to your allocator try to build the boost graph with allocator customizing the adjacency list storage do something to count bytes in std string members of your containers

2478364
boost	allocator	allocator	stl
read about allocator c++ standard allocator an introduction and implementation allocator stl try to implement std vector with your own allocator as an exercise try to add counting bytes to your allocator try to build the boost graph with allocator customizing the adjacency list storage do something to count bytes in std string members of your containers
by default they will not use the allocator of their container

2481073
dns	spf
not having reverse dns properly configured is a great way to have your mail rejected
use spf senderid domainkeys and dkim

2481567
google-chrome	firefox
if your application only uses something that supports some of the html5 spec webkit-based safari 5 google-chrome chromium for instance you can do a lot ahem guessing your question stems from steve jobs mentioning html5 in a keynote ...but will struggle with cross-platform support
many of the major players in the browser market haven t even agreed on a common codec for video yet h.264 for many not supported currently by firefox opera etc

2483480
cpython	ironpython
using multiple processes lets you exploit multiple cpu cores at the same time while in cpython using threads doesn t threads take turns using a single cpu core -- so if you have cpu intensive work and absolutely want to use threads you should consider jython or ironpython
with cpython this consideration is often enough to sway the choice towards the multiprocessing module and away from the threading one they offer pretty similar interfaces because multiprocessing was designed to be easily put in place in lieu of threading

2483789
sudo	passwd
instead of sudo you may want to use a graphical frontend like gksu gksudo kdesu or kdesudo
i wouldn t try to implement secure passwd input myself

2484042
serializable	deserialization
the serializable form does not contain the inter-element links
but those links are reliably remade upon deserialization

2484569
awt	swing	swt	swing
first is the listener interface here is the class which is a custom awt component--it should be fine in either swing awt probably even swt
in answer to your question i would definitely do what you describe as an awt solution--that way you can track the objects created and be able to allow the user to reload them onto an edit canvas and more than likely each of the shapes the user creates would be a layer not the layer swing container but an object that would store and track what shapes are drawn and be able to redraw them--the main thing to keep in mind is draw order

2484569
awt	swing
swing is built over the awt and adds a great deal of complexity that an application like this doesn t need
over all you are going to be creating a class custom component that is exactly what the canvas object was mean to provide and if sun would have kept this tact earlier on they would not have gotten into the mess that swing turned out to be.

2485486
spaces	delimiter
in addition you will be able to index by fruit type search more easily use less disk spaces validate fruit names and not have any arbitrary limit on the number of fruits that fit into the database that said if you absolutely cannot fix the database structure you might try something like this replace replace concat fruits apples oranges this monstrosity first converts the fruits field to begin and end with commas then removes any spaces before commas
this should give you a string in which fruit names are unambiguously delimiter by commas

2486522
nsstring	nsobject
nsstring is a common target for that
it s also interesting to point out that most if not all of nsobject facilities are in fact declared in a nsobject protocol

2486635
client-side	server-side
php itself does not handle client-side events
and php paradigm slightly differs from asp.net where client and server-side scripds bound together in the same page of code

2491013
asp.net-mvc	html.actionlink
as far as asp.net asp.net-mvc application goes it doesn t really matter where your application is located and how iis is configured
if you d call html.actionlink the way you ve written there should be no myapp in generated paths

2492547
apache	nginx
i think one solution could be using a combination of php as apache module or through fastcgi and use mod_proxy apache module to do some reverse proxy to access your administration app running with gunicorn you can have a setup like front http server apache on port 80 www.host.com 80 backend http server gunicorn on another port other.host.com 8080 or localhost 8080 publicly accessed with mod_proxy and url like www.host.com admin media http server media.host.com if it has to be on the same system you can use mod_proxy and run the nginx server on another tcp port
note that you should not be able to get the best performance with the nginx as a media server hidden behind apache with mod_proxy

2492585
vsto	add-in
managed com add-in made without using vsto on the other hand can be made compatible for excel 2000 and above with no difficulty
lastly vsto does not support the creation of udfs and therefore you d have to either create a managed automation add-in for that or utilize a vba front-end which calls your vsto functions

2492585
vsto	add-in
lastly vsto does not support the creation of udfs and therefore you d have to either create a managed automation add-in for that or utilize a vba front-end which calls your vsto functions
overall i would go with vsto if you can limit yourself to excel 2007 and above

2494726
spaces	delimiter
it s a different character from the ascii 32 regular spaces
you can let the tokenizer which is obsolete as others have said to include ascii 160 as delimiter or you can filter it out from the input string if it s not supposed to be there in the first place

2495288
prefuse	jgraph
for the conceptual graph i think prefuse will do the job
jgraph abugraph prefuse it seems the link is not working now try later

2495367
vb.net	vb6
but this is basically vb.net vb6 difference not especially vba
since i ve been writing vb.net for a while it is always a problem for me to prefix object assignment lines with set like instead of just which the ide would not complain about but you get a runtime error object reference not set

2496733
realloc	malloc
i have fixed up the code above to reflect the fixes...of course in a real-life situation perhaps the fixed value of 100 could be changed to perhaps a #define to make it easy to expand the buffer by doubling over the amount of memory via realloc and trim it to size.
the problem here is that you are referencing a pointer variable that no memory allocated via malloc hence the results would be undefined and not alone that by using strcat on a undefined pointer that could be pointing to anything you ended up with a bus error

2497183
ubuntu	linux
if you re not running linux i recommend booting a ubuntu live cd just for the wealth of simple-yet-effective command line utilities
the easiest way to get strings out of a pe by far is the strings utility that comes standard with every linux distro i ve ever come across even uclinux

2500044
innodb	myisam
for example myisam uses one file for data rows and another for index records. in innodb the records in nonclustered indexes also called secondary indexes contain the primary key columns for the row that are not in the secondary index
innodb uses this primary key value to search for the row in the clustered index

2503365
freebsd	linux
freebsd does not have this license limitation
many appliances are based off of stripped down linux or freebsd kernels running apache or a lightweight httpd

2504813
comparator	comparable
if you don t pass an explicit comparator to a treeset it will try to compare the objects by assuming they are comparable
and if they aren t comparable it cannot compare them so this exception is thrown

2505102
ecj	javac
1 error update based on op s edit eclipse uses its own java compiler called ecj
it does not use the jdk compiler javac

2505194
apache-fop	xhtml
apache-fop other respondents have suggested apache-fop which in the context of pdf to pdf a conversion has the following advantages and disadvantages advantage less moving parts than an openoffice jodconverter combination comparing in-process apache-fop with daemonized oo disadvantage you are responsible for converting from pdf to xsl-fo or otherwise rendering to apache-fop more coding and or integration work required of you whereas openoffice jodconverter and ghostscript can require less additional coding
however if i am not mistaken it appears that you are using pdf as an intermediate format that what you are trying to achieve is xhtml to pdf to pdf a conversion

2505946
coldfusion	railo
coldfusion exists now also opensource something not many seem to know railo
it is possible to have all of those technologies installed on a windows server it is possible to make a connection to both ms sql and mysql via both php and coldfusion

2506389
freebsd	linux
if this doesn t work the easiest solution would be to recompile your program on freebsd
you can run a lot of linux programs on freebsd see

2509310
cvs	svn
you could be making multiple changes in hg which add up to just one change in cvs svn so that history will not be kept in cvs svn and you ll have to summarize your commit messages
you have to manually manage keeping cvs and your readonly repository in sync

2513463
namedtuple	dictionary
a namedtuple is a tuple whose slots can also be addressed by name
the namedtuple should not require any more memory according to the documentation than a regular tuple since they don t have a per instance dictionary

2515457
pascal	delphi
if you are looking for cross platform development and you don t like the idea of java then perhaps the pascal language in the shape of the freepascal lazarus combination will be your best bet
if you want to develop applications rapidly like to utilize databases want to have a fancy gui window and don t really mind some code overhead then i guess your bet on the vcl framework might be the best choice for you and to be honest all things considered it doesn t really matter whether it is bcb or delphi you use in that case

2516834
queue	fifo
an alternative would be to use a queue which the queue is a fifo fifo data structure now it is not thread-safe for access so you would have to lock it but your locking time would be very minimal to put the item in the queue
there are also other queue classes out there that are thread-safe that you could use

2518338
ienumerable	iqueryable
it makes sense seeing that an ienumerable can t be further filtered but an iqueryable can
just a thought not directly related to the question but it might help other viewers i was getting the same error message as you even though i was using the contains method correctly and it took me quite a while to figure out that the root of my problem was returning an ienumerable to something that needed to further filter the results of the l2s query

2518338
ienumerable	iqueryable
just a thought not directly related to the question but it might help other viewers i was getting the same error message as you even though i was using the contains method correctly and it took me quite a while to figure out that the root of my problem was returning an ienumerable to something that needed to further filter the results of the l2s query
once i changed the function s return type to an iqueryable the problem went away

2519245
jsf	stripes
i think the main advantage of struts2 compared to jsf is its simplicity it is much easier to grasp
specially for beginners in web programming or those familiar with action based web frameworks struts 1 webworks spring mvc stripes . but lars tackmann s points are valid though struts2 does not force you to use jsp

2521183
rsa	3des	rsa	aes
the problem is that rsa is not used like a typical block cypher like aes or 3des that encrypts 8 bytes at a time all day long
rsa is a math operation that returns the remainder of a division the modulus

2522382
mp4	h.264
checkout flash video you will need converter to convert them to correct mp4 format since mov etc formats can have video as h.264 and audio as mp3 flash will not play it flash only needs video as h.264 and audio as aac only
current version of flash can play mov m4v and m4a provided they are only of type container mp4 all quicktime files have litle variation of mp4 but if they contain pure video of type h.264 and audio of aac only then flash can play it

2524920
multiplying	addition
however in this case the compiler will simply pass 35 to process and not even code the multiplying
in addition if the compiler knows that process has no side effects ie is a simple calculation then it won t even call process

2526685
udp	tcp
you must not write programs that expect udp datagrams to always get through
packets are dropped all the time in tcp too but your program does not need to care because tcp applications cannot process packets

2527837
implements	extends
the cross-process support was the basis of ole2 a gimmick that every application rushed to support in the early 1990s most of them implements the very complicated interfaces wrongly and so crashing all over the place
far more successful were ole controls which were technically a lot simpler not using the marshalling and which offered a way to extends visual basic

2530655
rvm	bundler
so i suggest you install rvm as root and set up still as root a default rvm that will be the default for all the system users. and of course you can override this per user
i think it s not so you can just execute rvm --defaults ruby-1.9.1-p378 if this doesn t help are you sure bundler has been installed when ruby 1.9 was used

2531558
prepare	execute
prepare statements created by mysqli_prepare are server-side prepare statements
when you execute such a prepare statement only the statement id and the parameters are transferred not some query string as if you would replace the placeholders by the actual parameters on the client-side your php script

2531558
prepare	execute
when you execute such a prepare statement only the statement id and the parameters are transferred not some query string as if you would replace the placeholders by the actual parameters on the client-side your php script
but you can see the result in the general log of the mysql server see prepare statement logging edit in your case the preparation of the statement fails because desc is a reserved keyword

2531667
google-chrome	firefox
both ie8 and google-chrome do not show that behavior
that seems to be a firefox related issue

2531990
oncreate	onstart
however oncreate will indeed be called and your application can call onstart from there
as revealed by chistopher s comment above even though the log purports to be scheduling restart of crashed service this does not actually mean that the onstart method will be called

2533044
monodevelop	sharpdevelop
note that mono support in sharpdevelop does not provide any integrated debugging with mono s debugger and there is no gtk# designer compared with monodevelop
whilst sharpdevelop 3.2 does not support mono out of the box but if you download the source code for sharpdevelop you can find a code sample that contained the original code for mono support

2533313
cassini	iis
this is not a ninject problem really it seems to be an issue with cassini the web server built into vs2k8 which handles these requests differently than iis would handle them
the basic reason is that the app gets a request for favicon.ico which cassini sends to mvc and ninject didn t know how to handle it

2534851
jar	war
you can get the x.jar will not be available on the server s classpath if you are referencing the jar via eclipse s java build path outside of the war web-inf lib directory--and it looks like from the error that you are
copy gwtext.jar to the project s war web-inf lib folder and tell eclipse to find it there instead

2535143
jar	war
i m using indigo it seems eclipse only support jar comparison hence i have to rename the war extension to jar to get eclipse to do the structural comparison
you can use eclipse to compare jar war files. the link does not mention war file

2535829
ubuntu	linux
i used virtualbox + ubuntu + eclipse for several projects i worked on
if you decide that linux is not for you and your project was in eclipse then you will have no problem switching back to windows since eclipse is available for both operating systems

2536212
union	distinct
in the specific case of the question the error reported by sql server and preventing the completion of the query is that sorting is not possible on rows bigger than... and the distinct keyword is the only apparent reason for the query to require any sorting btw many other sql constructs imply sorting for example union hence the idea of removing the distinct if it is logically possible
in fact you should remove it for test purposes to assert that without distinct the query completes ok if only including some duplicates

2541362
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc
if ptr is a null pointer the realloc function behaves like the malloc function for the specified size
otherwise if ptr does not match a pointer earlier returned by the calloc malloc or realloc function or if the space has been deallocated by a call to the free or realloc function the behavior is undefined

2541369
realloc	calloc
if ptr is a null pointer the realloc function behaves like the malloc function for the specified size. otherwise if ptr does not match a pointer earlier returned by the calloc malloc or realloc function or if the space has been deallocated by a call to the free or realloc function the behavior is undefined. if memory for the new object cannot be allocated the old object is not deallocated and its value is unchanged
returns the realloc function returns a pointer to the new object which may have the same value as a pointer to the old object or a null pointer if the new object could not be allocated

2541369
realloc	malloc
returns the realloc function returns a pointer to the new object which may have the same value as a pointer to the old object or a null pointer if the new object could not be allocated
a very simple conforming implementation of realloc would be this under low memory conditions or any conditions under which malloc would return null this would return null

2542426
allocator	stl
while the iterator syntax isn t friendly for people coming from other languages it gives you the builtin data structures that you generally use in java s collections or php as builtin maps hashes lists stacks vectors without writing funky pointer code with dynamic allocator that so often sidetracks beginners into reinventing the wheel and messing with memory bugs
also if you write platform specific code a qt or microsoft mfc app for example you ll often see examples using framework specific containers where the stl would be a wiser choice

2544301
rdf	owl
for example uniprotkb one of the biggest biomedical resources are offering their data in rdf
for advanced querying we re not quite there yet as performance and availability of good rdf data and owl ontologies is still a bit lacking

2545205
serializable	deserialization
if you don t use the type argument for sgen.exe then it will generate deserialization code for all public types in the assembly
note that the serializable attribute is not used in xml serializable

2546762
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc
if ptr is a null pointer the realloc function behaves like the malloc function for the specified size
otherwise if ptr does not match a pointer earlier returned by the calloc malloc or realloc function or if the space has been deallocated by a call to the free or realloc function the behavior is undefined

2548550
innodb	myisam
innodb supports transactions and row locking whiles myisam doesn t
if i remember correctly myisam also doesn t support foreign key relationships so if you depend on them in your table structure myisam is out

2549128
cvs	svn
to clarify the fundamental difference between svn and git let me rephrase svn is the third implementation of a revision control rcs then cvs and finally svn manage directories of versioned data
svn offers vcs features labeling and merging but its tag is just a directory copy like a branch except you are not supposed to touch anything in a tag directory and its merge is still complicated currently based on meta-data added to remember what has already been merged

2550383
bitarray	bitset
look up each value in the first bitarray
if it is not set then set the bitset it to 1

2552512
opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
not sure if ie supports anything like that but firefox google-chrome and opera all support userscripts
use greasemonkey for firefox for example i wrote this script for myself to highlight code on the bytes forums which i can use in all three browsers

2553172
opensuse	debian
i m not sure the name of the package you need in opensuse
whatever opensuse s package manager is called... for something like debian s build-essential package

2555546
jqgrid	datatables
or maybe jqgrid or third-party grids like telerik will help you because they have subgrids and all this stuff
i would say if you don t like domain-driven design if your application is not object entity driven but highly based on raw datatables then mvc might be not what you need

2556123
bash	subshell
you can use the variable check out the bash documentation for this it stores the exit status of the last command
also you might want to check out the bracket-style command blocks of bash they are always executed in a subshell thus not altering the current environment and are more powerful as well

2556123
bash	subshell
also you might want to check out the bracket-style command blocks of bash they are always executed in a subshell thus not altering the current environment and are more powerful as well
edit for instance when using -style blocks as compared to bash -c command you don t have to worry about escaping any argument strings with spaces or any other special shell syntax

2556403
rsa	aes
a rsa key as its name says is for rsa not for aes
aes uses a symmetric key namely an array of arbitrary bytes of length 16 24 or 32 bytes

2557673
invalidoperationexception	argumentexception
otherwise you should probably either throw an invalidoperationexception or create your own exception like this
if obj is an argument to the method you should throw an argumentexception throw new argumentexception type + obj.foo.gettype + is not handled. obj

2559895
prepare	execute
i think you have not to really execute nothing just prepare the statements resources and whatever you want. this way whatever would be the order the user invokes the methods the actual execution would be assured to be ordered
simply because you have the total control over the real execution just before execute it

2566288
strcpy	strncpy
it is easy however to use strncat as a replacement for strcpy the if test can obviously be dropped in the common case where you know that dest_size is definitely nonzero
it is probably worth adding again that strncpy is not the general-purpose replacement for strcpy that it s name might suggest

2566510
trie	tree
you can build the trie as a tree of directories on your file system obviously not the one which the data is coming from
you should use a trie aka a prefix tree to build a tree-like structure that allows you to easily walk through your strings in an ordered manner by comparing their prefixes

2571087
shadowing	named
as gabe said f# interactive uses shadowing of values when you enter a function with a named that already exists for more info on shadowing see for example this so question
this means that the f# compiler sees something like this when you run your code f# uses some mangled named like that you cannot use directly to distinguish between versions of the value

2572489
boost	allocator
if you don t need your allocator to call a constructor you can also use boost pool which i think may deallocate faster because it doesn t have to call deconstructors at all and just deleted the chunk of memory in one free
i can t imagine how you d use enough memory for it to matter but one way i sped up a program was to use boost object_pool to allocate memory for a binary tree

2573706
vb.net	vb6
for vb6 if there is any chance it will be converted to vb.net using call means the syntax doesn t change
parentheses are required in vb.net for method calls. i don t personally think this is worth the bother -- any .net converter will at least be able to put in parentheses when required

2574874
notepad	textpad
programmer s notepad on windows might work
textpad it s nagware runs on windows i m not sure which of these will show the hidden characters out of the box but they re all made for nerdy stuff so i assume that they would work at least with a little tweaking

2575151
udp	tcp
udp is a bad idea for transferring files as you cannot guarantee the order in which packets will be received or whether they will be received at all
if you are thinking to build a fault tolerant transport layer on top of this you should just use tcp ip instead as that s exactly what it does

2575401
lisp	smalltalk
the interactive environment i m most familiar with and one that i have found among the most congenial of all the free environments for interactive programming i ve tried not that i ve tried them all is slime a mode for emacs that allows interaction with a running common lisp and can also be used with clojure a lisp for the jvm
if lisp isn t your cup of tea a variety of smalltalk environments are worth mentioning

2575401
lisp	smalltalk
if lisp isn t your cup of tea a variety of smalltalk environments are worth mentioning
one of the interesting things about many smalltalk systems is that they expose almost all of the code that implements the system in the programming environment- if you want you can browse or even rewrite parts of the programming environment as you are using it just as you would write new code

2575690
udp	tcp
so yes using udp to transfer files is not the best but workable option
one just have to reinvent a part of tcp and weigh that re-invention s overhead against the one of tcp

2576095
persistent	transient
a new instances of a persistent class which is not associated with a session has no representation in the database and no identifier value is considered transient by hibernate a persistent instances has a representation in the database an identifier value and is associated with a session
you can make a transient instances persistent by associating it with a session now if we close the hibernate session the persistent instances will become a detached instances it isn t attached to a session anymore but can still be modified and reattached to a new session later though

2576097
udp	tcp
if you can stand to lose plenty of sensor data go with udp but i conjure that isn t what you want at all
i also would go with just tcp

2576613
memcpy	memmove
as brian noted there are problems there too you either want or you want or indeed finally dealing with the array assignment in c you can reasonably use memmove to do this the similar function memcpy does not have reliable semantics if the areas to be copied overlap whereas memmove does
it is simpler to always use memmove because it always works correctly

2577160
serializable	deserialization
you can even serializable non-public members such as private or protected members
and you dont need a set on a property either however without a setter you can serializable but not deserialize is about 10 faster than xmlserializer to serializable the data because since you don t have full control over how it is serializable there is a lot that can be done to optimize the serialization deserialization process

2577875
persistent	transient
after that my understanding is that the object would be considered detached meaning you could modify it to your wishes and merge it with a new session the difference is that persistent modifies the object you provide as a parameter and is meant to initially persistent a new object while merge returns a modified instances rather than modifying the one passed as a parameter and is ment to allow updating
from the hibernate documentation transient - an object is transient if it has just been instantiated using the new operator and it is not associated with a hibernate session

2577875
persistent	transient
it has no persistent representation in the database and no identifier value has been assigned
transient instances will be destroyed by the garbage collector if the application does not hold a reference anymore

2578794
icmp	udp
the problem with these icmp port unreachable errors is that they re reported via the winsock code by failing a pending udp recv recvfrom call
as i explain here and question here the udp stack obviously knows the address that generated the port unreachable but it doesn t pass that information on to the caller so there s nothing that you can do to map these messages to something useful

2579759
uiview	subviews
your main view is now a type of uiview and not uitableview. so your file s owner will not show datasource or delegate
for them to appear you have to drag a table view and add it as a subviews of the only view present

2579837
union	distinct
the second issue to union is knowing the difference between union and union all
union will remove duplicates if they exist equivalent to using distinct which is not desired in the given scenario

2581782
postgresql	mysql
we knew that we wouldn t get to that number of records for at least a couple of years and we had experience with postgresql while mongodb wasn t very mature at the time so we went with postgresql
my point is that you can probably look at mysql benchmarks do some performance tests yourself estimate the size of your dataset and how it s going to grow and make an informed decision that way

2582228
persistent	transient
the semantics of transient are precisely that the data is not persistent
the entity returned from entitymanager.merge obj is in fact an entirely new entity that maintains the state of the object passed into merge state in this context being anything that is not part of the persistent object

2582228
persistent	transient
there are essentially two things you can do decide to persistent the transient field
it doesn t really seem to be transient if you need it after merging the class into the persistence context

2582228
persistent	transient
it doesn t really seem to be transient if you need it after merging the class into the persistent context
maintain the value of the transient field outside of the persistent object

2583420
nunit	mstest
adding the reference to nunit is fine but you need to make sure that the attributes you put on the class and test methods are those of nunit and not mstest
i guess this is what is happening and explains why the nunit gui does not find the attribute it is expecting

2584676
ubuntu	linux
i believe it also plays a central role in the ubuntu one cloud storage service
there is also the desktopcouch project which aims to provide a storage backend for not necessarily linux desktop applications for things like preferences and bookmarks

2585728
imperative	declarative
here is an excerpt from my article most c# developers are very familiar with writing imperative code even though they may not know it by that name
in this article i will introduce you to an alternative style of programming called declarative programming

2585975
inline	inlining
for example the compiler takes into account the size of the function being inline and the amount of inlining that has already been done in the current function. therefore seemingly insignificant changes in the source program can cause the warnings produced by -winline to appear or disappear.
with gcc you can use -winline compiler option -winline warn if a function can not be inline and it was declared as inline. the man file for gcc goes on to say even with this option the compiler will not warn about failures to inline functions declared in system headers. the compiler uses a variety of heuristics to determine whether or not to inline a function

2586814
serializable	deserialization
but as far as i know there is no default implementation of serializable for qtextdocument
i saw a request for this feature but who knows when it will be implemented edit 1 implementing serializable deserialization of qtextdocument should not be way to complicated because all the building blocks of qtextdocument are serializable

2589042
cassini	iis
the visual studio development server is codenamed cassini
from asp.net 2.0 a getting started guide cassini doesn t support virtual directories security settings or any of iis s other fancy features

2589042
cassini	iis
from asp.net 2.0 a getting started guide cassini doesn t support virtual directories security settings or any of iis s other fancy features
it s just a very simple web server that gives you the basics you need to get up and running. i am using the iis which is included with windows xp pro

2592142
realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
then #define malloc x mymalloc x #define free x myfree x #define realloc x y myrealloc x y #define calloc x y mycalloc x y #define valloc x myvalloc x you can #define and #undef the macros as you want throughout your code
make a wrapper malloc and free you can put your own logic there for when it fails and when it doesn t

2594911
keystore	jks
note that jks is a keystore type not the name of a file
it looks like you ve skipped the first step which is to create the keystore

2595884
qthread	qobject
both qwidget and qthread inherit non-virtually from qobject
you therefore do not have virtual derivation thus two copies of qobject which confuses the compiler

2595935
config	ini
its familiar indented outline and lean appearance makes it especially suited for tasks where humans are likely to view or edit data structures such as config files dumping during debugging and document headers the advantage over xml is that it doesn t use tags which might confuse users
and i think it s cleaner than ini which was also mentioned because it simply uses colons instead of equals signs semicolons and quotes

2599155
uiview	calayer
you way want to just use uiview here which will not by default animate transitions such as this
not sure what you mean by slow but setting the frame of a calayer in this way uses implicit animation

2600115
factors	mean
two possibilities are bcrypt - a modified form of blowfish that increases the work factors pbkdf2 - a function from the pkcs#5 spec that uses hmac with a hash function and random salt to iterate over a password many times
however this will not work with your requirements support remote password retrieval i am hoping you can convince the client that what they really mean is to reset the password in which case you can still use a password hash

2601015
punctuation	words
this is the explanation for the tokenizer in lucene - splits words at punctuation characters removing punctuation. however a dot that s not followed by whitespace is considered part of a token
- splits words at hyphens unless there s a number in the token in which case the whole token is interpreted as a product number and is not split. - recognizes email addresses and internet hostnames as one token. found here this explains why it would be splitting your words

2601666
implements	extends
so you re not worried here about packaging issues and you avoid the headache of having to implements methods even to throw an exception that you don t want to
the component constructing it will create a say configurableport extends port and pass this to the node but pass the port back to the client as a mere port

2604030
vb.net	vb6
here s an interesting discussion regarding exactly this topic about 1 3 of the way down someone explains that it uses double because the vb.net functions were implemented to work exactly the same as vb6
vb6 doesn t have a decimal type which is why it uses double

2604518
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
because unlike unchecked-exception runtimeexception error and their subclasses you are required to catch them
inversely the point of using unchecked-exception is that you re not required to catch them and the common scenario it to let a piece of software above your application typically a framework a container or the jvm handle them

2607727
udp	tcp
udp is not
to create a udp socket to create a tcp socket there are two common ways to send discrete chunks of data across the wire

2609146
equals	compareto
the recommended language is note this class has a natural ordering that is inconsistent with equals. to fix the findbugs check override equals - and hashcode - if it makes sense which is generally the case or exclude the check for this class and document that your class violates this condition using the suggested note
this errors means that you re not overriding equals in foreignkeyconstraint and thus inheriting the equals from object so the following is not true from the javadoc of compareto it is strongly recommended but not strictly required that

2609146
comparator	comparable
this errors means that you re not overriding equals in foreignkeyconstraint and thus inheriting the equals from object so the following is not true from the javadoc of comparator it is strongly recommended but not strictly required that
generally speaking any class that implements the comparable interface and violates this condition should clearly indicate this fact

2611782
octal	binary
your best bet here would be either octal 07777 of hexadecimal 0xfff
c does not have native notation for pure binary numbers

2612197
vb6	vba
i believe the same was true of vb6 but that was many moons ago
granted this is taking the way back machine but when i did extensive vba development i always named my modules with a prefix of something like bas because the names of class modules and global modules in combination had to be unique you couldn t have a global module named foo and class module named foo

2614454
imperative	declarative
all of this work was done in the context of simple imperative languages with structured control flow and classic side-effecting procedures
so there is not any connection with declarative programming of necessity

2615034
cvs	svn
so repo-wide merges don t cause the same disruptions as they would be in svn cvs where one repo often contains many unrelated modules which need to have separate merge histories. cvs svn allows different files in the working directory to come from different revisions while dvcs es usually have one revision for the entire wc always even if a file is be reverted to an earlier version it will show as modified in status as it is different from the file in the checked out revision
svn cvs does not show this always. mixing these concepts as subversion does is i belive a big mistake

2615343
division	multiplication	division	subtraction
i think one can get the exact result of 64 bit by 64 bit division
not the remainder directly but also the remainder using multiplication and subtraction like in the msvc procedure

2616624
cvs	svn
i have not really used it but it seems subversive supports check out as just like the built-in cvs support does
like to take a project from svn and be able to run it as a web project one might be able to do so in one go

2617242
client-side	server-side
on non-public parts of a website that s okay as is for a webapp used by a known user group but you should not depend on client-side scripting for public parts of a website
another solution to simplify that is by using a php framework so you can write the server-side frontend easier

2617298
awt	swing
swing supplanted it entirely eleven years ago building on top of it to correct flaws in the awt 1.0 design
swing isn t the only way that professionals make java uis

2617438
glfw	sdl
so beyond those you cited i add these 2 glfw sfml
i ve used sdl for long time but it still doesn t support multiple windows and version 2.0 officially supports multiple windows

2618983
portrait	landscape
if you mean how to switch during runtime switch to previous layout orientation for example portrait landscape keypad_7 ctrl + f11 switch to next layout orientation for example portrait landscape keypad_9 ctrl + f12 from docs
not sure about your question - sideways is the same as landscape

2620878
uiview	uiwindow	uiview	subviews
touch events propagate like this uiview get sent -hittest withevent recursively until some uiview decides that the touch is inside its bounds and not inside any user-interaction-enabled subviews
uiwindow sends -touchesbegan withevent and friends to the uiview returned in step 1 ignoring any view hierarchy

2623362
gridbaglayout	miglayout
if like me you are allergic to builders then you d better use one 3rd-party layoutmanager that is intended to be use programmatically i would not consider gridbaglayout to be in this category although i have already used it that way in the past
miglayout as suggested by skeptic is one option

2623806
udp	tcp
since you mention wow they use udp not tcp
tcp offers stream guarantee semantics with order guarantee and no duplicates

2626541
tiff	png
the quicktime plugin is a free tiff viewer but it is not very flexible
where i work we use atalasoft s dotimage which converts tiffs to tiled png on the fly but it is not free

2631247
hex	binary
not sure if it s standard sql but in mysql you can read blob into hex like this select hex image from table
you can write binary data as hex in sql like x 1234abcd

2632426
comparator	comparable
if the type would have to be comparable you couldn t create a treeset with a non-comparable type and a comparator which you can as it is now
one way to fix this while still being type-safe would have been to have two classes one with a comparable type parameter and one with a non-comparable type parameter and no default constructor only the constructor that takes a comparator but i suppose the java devs didn t want to introduce two classes that basically did the same thing though one could easily be implemented as a wrapper around the other

2632433
comparator	comparable
you can pass the set a comparator object explicitly in which case the element type does not need to be a comparable
that s because the value does not necessarily have to implement comparable

2633028
rsa	dsa
in some cases rsa there exist digital signature schemes with many similarities to encryption schemes
in other cases dsa the algorithm does not resemble any encryption scheme

2633329
vb.net	vb6
i am making the move towards vb.net and have the feeling that bound controls are not so evil after all
things have changed dramatically for the better in .net data binding vs manual population vb6 programmers have stayed away from the ado data control and bound controls because of some performance reasons

2634128
updatepanel	scriptmanager
it doesn t matter that the updatepanel is on a masterpage
same goes with the scriptmanager

2635092
punctuation	words
why not run your line through the java stringtokenizer then you can get the words broken up by not just spaces but also commas and other punctuation
just run through your tokens and count the occurrence of each the or any words you would like

2637849
moq	typemock
rhinomocks and moq are both open source free to use projects that can create fake objects by inheriting the type - which means that they can not fake static methods structs and sealed classes
typemock isolator uses the clr profiler to intercept .net calls and change them during runtime and can fake virtually anything

2638300
moq	justmock
its api is more similar to moq s api than rhinomocks so if you re familiar with moq you shouldn t have problems learning justmock. what we ve tried to do better in justmock is to have a better story when mocking sequential calls for example. additionally as someone already mentioned justmock makes it possible to mock static classes and methods properties sealed classes non-virtual methods and properties and so on using the same moq-like syntax. also thanks to this in justmock it s possible to do partial mocking
btw the black magic that dror mentioned is also possible when using justmock if you reference directly the telerik.codeweaver.hook assembly but unfortunately that s not documented at the moment. should someone want to do that he could open a support ticket and we ll be glad to help

2638485
g++	gcc
so for example to compile main.cpp with a maximum template recursion depth of 2000 g++ -ftemplate-depth-2000 main.cpp or convert the code to this but i will admit the above code doesn t help you learn about template metaprogramming
i assume with gcc and by extension g++ the default maximum template recursion depth is 500 as at least on my machine i managed to reproduce your problems with a slightly better warning message

2638719
backgrounding	multitasking
check out this excellent msdn magazine article discover mighty instance management techniques for developing wcf apps by juwal lovy for more backgrounding on the various options you have
the best practice for most cases is this your client calls a wcf service with a per-call pattern each request from a client gets its own pristine server class instance that handles the request and gets disposed after it s done the server class is therefore single-threaded non-reentrant and doesn t have to deal with any multitasking issues the server class is stateless and doesn t hold on to any server resources or anything any state or data that needs to be persisted between calls is stored in a suitable location a database this is by far the easiest setup and should be the best choice for at least 80 of your cases

2639245
pascal	delphi
both delphi and the latest free pascal versions implement widestrings as bstr - a string data type that is used by com
widestrings are allocated and freed by windows not by delphi or free pascal memory manager

2639641
stateless	stateful
in fact it has absolutely nothing to do with it you can modify entities in stateless sessions
a statelesssession does not keep track of entities which results in big performance improvements both in memory usage and execution times when you don t need the features that a stateful session provides

2641628
cvs	svn
git svn clone ourrepo then using the following guide to export back to cvs not entirely sure this will work git cvsexportcommit 4a20cbafdf25a141b31a8333284a332d1a4d6072 there s also git cvsserver
no idea why you d want to do this but going from svn - git - cvs might work you d run

2642528
factors	mean
factors it is not known to be np-complete
no reduction from an np-complete problem has been found. it is not known not to be np-complete either if we knew the latter about some nontrivial problem in np it would mean p np so the latter is not surprising

2643339
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
i ve learned the hard way that uinavigationcontroller and uitabbarcontroller aren t very accommodating when you try to use them in nonstandard ways
uinavigationbar and uitabbar weren t designed to coexist as siblings in the view hierarchy

2645895
shadowing	named
named shadowing i also couldn t help but notice how you rather awkwardly named chewyo and squeekyo
the following is an excerpt from java puzzlers glossary of named reuse

2646012
system.data.oracleclient	odp.net
the system.data.oracleclient has been discontinued and is not recommended by microsoft
i would say to go get the odp.net dlls here

2647313
google-chrome	firefox
for firefox file- work offline google-chrome doesn t appear to have this feature edit also another alternative is slightly more time-consuming to setup in the beginning but might be worth it
for firefox google-chrome there should be proxy plugins set up a fake bad profile for each so that you proxy to something that doesn t exist.

2649267
vsts	tfs
i say think because i ve moved projects back and forth between the two without any issues but i haven t used projects that utilise all the additions of vsts so can t confirm categorically that everything works - code analysis settings and unit tests were fine i just couldn t analyse or test in vs
the absence of tfs source control was reported with the usual option of working offline or removing the bindings from the project

2649931
jar	war
war files are the standard war - stands for web archive you can deploy a jar file into a war file or you can deploy a jar file into the classpath of the server or still yet you can deploy a jar file into lib folders of most servers
not sure why you would not want to deploy a war file for a web application

2650141
boost	stl
take a look at boost interprocess for a way to deal with this situation in c++
you don t want to store stl containers in shared memory at least not share them

2650359
jboss	glassfish
now a quick summary of the various versions jboss 5.1 java ee 5 certified
supports ha clustering comes with an admin console if you re xml averse but doesn t support cluster setup through console yet glassfish v2.1 java ee 5 certified

2661346
selecteditem	selectedindex
i don t know much about using datatables but i suspect you can get some kind of row object that represents a row from the datatable by using selecteditem which you can then use to get each of the columns you want--which is just like binding to a collection of objects works
if that doesn t work try the selectedindex property

2661515
perforce	svn
the one cvcs centralized version control system i know being much faster than svn is not a freeware one perforce i detail perforce in this so answer
you can see a comparison between perforce and subversion in this document

2663746
uiview	subviews
uiwindow inherits from uiview so although i don t have much personal experience with this exact thing you should still be able to get it to draw to a bitmap context of some kind and then use two different uiwindows each with only an image view on a them pushing the actual pixels to their respective screens
this is considerably easier if you only want to mirror one specific custom view and not including it s subviews because you can have that view on the device screen to capture any input and then design it in a way that you have a method to call to draw it in whatever context it s in some drawrects might work fine as is and the call that from a super special awesome custom subviews on the other screen which would implement drawrect to just call the method on the actual view

2664490
xna	slimdx
so long as you stick with managed directx or slimdx and not one of the newer frameworks like xna then the api translates fairly directly from managed to unmanaged
i d recommend using slimdx as it is a very thin wrapper over the directx api

2665840
moq	typemock
it offers all the features of the free mocking frameworks like rhinomocks and moq plus some more powerful options
whether or not you need typemock is highly debatable - you can do most mocking you would ever want with free mocking libraries and many argue that the abilities offered by typemock will often lead you away from well encapsulated design

2665997
multiplying	subtract
so conversion of a string to a number might entail performing a mathematical operation on the string representation of the number that would not affect the resulting number such as subtract zero or multiplying by one
this also reveals that subtract is a better search term than minus

2667581
lisp	smalltalk
for example almost all smalltalk environments and many lisp environments are lively while i know of not a single lively c or c++ environment
there used to be a lively java environment called ibm visual age for java which was actually written in smalltalk by ibm s smalltalk division and based on ibm visual for smalltalk so there s not really a surprise there but when it was rewritten in java as visual age for java micro edition which you probably know better under its current name eclipse it lost its liveliness

2667767
interpolation	splines
i guess you want to do the following take a 16x16 pixel image and interpolation it to a 160x160 pixel image
here are three sample outputs you only said you want to use splines interpolation but not which one nearest neighbour bilinear applying linear splines interpolation in both x and y direction bicubic applying cubic splines interpolation in both x and y direction original img linear interpolation img cubic interpolation img the .net framework provides those and a few more methods see msdn interpolationmode enumeration

2669388
jsf	seam	jsf	wicket
each jsf view tree is stored on session - you can store on client side but be aware bandwidth issues
but it has some advantages typically web application uses the following path with seam you can get or even by using mediator pattern provided by seam framework besides that jsf 2 supports jsr 303 - bean validation you can use wicket instead of jsf if you want conversation and business process management support use can use spring di if you want spring-mvc it has a powerful web-tier infrastructure handler mapping it chooses which controller should handle the request view resolver it chooses which view should render the response it can be used for large applications powerful data-binding spring 3.0 supports annotation-based controller jsr 303 - bean validation coming soon but i still not use spring 3.0 because by using and extending when needed multiactioncontroller i can get convention over configuration without no xml settings to define your controller you just need to set up your multiactioncontroller as component simpleformcontroller provides similar behavior found in spring 3.0 annotation based controller .

2671620
opera	firefox
when testing this in firefox chromium and opera the debugging tools show that after invoking removeallranges in reselectfunc both savedrange and origrange are reset
invoking addrange with such an object causes an exception to be thrown in firefox uncaught exception exception... could not convert javascript argument arg 0 nsiselection.addrange nsresult 0x80570009 ns_error_xpc_bad_convert_js location js frame file home mk tests addrange.html anonymous line 19 data no no need to say that in all three browsers no text is selected

soappy	suds
that is it s hooking soappy in to twisted in just the way i described above
ideally suds would provide some kind of api along the lines of soappy.buildsoap and soappy.parsesoaprpc perhaps the apis would be a bit more complicated or accept a few more parameters - i m not a soap expert so i don t know if soappy s particular apis are missing something important - but the basic idea should be the same

2671843
soappy	suds
ideally suds would provide some kind of api along the lines of soappy.buildsoap and soappy.parsesoaprpc perhaps the apis would be a bit more complicated or accept a few more parameters - i m not a soap expert so i don t know if soappy s particular apis are missing something important - but the basic idea should be the same
then you could write something like twisted.web.soap.proxy based on suds instead

2671923
innodb	myisam
use innodb tables if you need transactions
myisam does not support transactions

2674067
onclick	onchange
however you will typically see onclick used instead because there s a bug in ie where it doesn t fire onchange until you unfocus the checkbox
you can keep it in the onclick attribute but it s usually easier to manage broken out into a separate script i used this.parentnode to get the wrapper span around the object being clicked to remove the need for the extra id

2675313
google-chrome	safari
of command line options for google-chrome here
not sure about safari but google-chrome has a command line switch for this chrome.exe --disable-web-security you can view a full list as of when it was posted

2676201
implements	extends
note your mysim class must implements this and explictily narrowcast it to it s type parameter
edit another approach is to use a static method in your sim base class it is not however possible to make this an instance method since passing an instance of sim to something of type t extends sim is not typesafe

2681920
datamapper	activerecord
also datamapper is much more ruby syntax friendy and features like lazy loading when doing chainable conditions like activerecord in rails 3 are there from the beginning
datamapper also has a feature that every record in the database maps to one ruby object which is not true for activerecord

2682873
firefox	safari
they are all modeled after firebug an extension for firefox and the existence of which is why firefox doesn t have one built in
opera internet explorer chrome and safari all come with good debuggers built in links go to information about the debuggers

2686004
haskell	scheme
in haskell you can and it isn t by monkey patching like in ruby
haskell has a good name-spacing scheme that means that two type classes can both have a function of the same name and a type can still implement both

2688071
serializable	deserialization
making this work across multiple platforms can be tricky because you need to make sure you serializable into a specific format and that each platform knows how it should read from that format
for example a big-endian platform might always convert to little-endian before sending and likewise convert back to big-endian when receiving. you cannot treat non-pod types as a stream of bytes such as std string so you need to write serialization functions for those to transform their data into a stream of bytes and deserialization functions to transform it back

2688071
serializable	deserialization

i particularly like that way boost does this and if you can i d use their serializable library

2688335
daemons	systemd
the folks at github built resque as a job processing daemons for ruby
if you re language flexible you could just use that but if you re not you could emulate it in as much or as little depth as you like making use of redis as your queue systemd

2688522
calloc	malloc
in other cases calloc can even cheat and not allocate any memory
however malloc +memset will always do the full amount of work

2688522
calloc	malloc
this is an enormous amount of extra work and explains why calloc is faster than malloc and memset
if end up using the memory anyway calloc is still faster than malloc and memset but the difference is not quite so ridiculous

2688552
inline	inlining
if the operations are inline and optimised well by your compiler you shouldn t usually see any difference between writing the code well using operators to make it readable and maintainable and manually inlining everything
manual inlining also considerably increases the risk of bugs because you won t be re-using a single piece of well-tested code you ll be writing the same code over and over

2688976
trie	tree
on the other hand trie are not meant for requests like all words between xx and zz
note that the branching factor of the b+ tree affects its performance the number of intermediary nodes

2690307
ilist	iqueryable
the initialization occurs the first time you access any of the ilist t members
example usage would be the system.lazy t class works with any type and is not limited to iqueryable t

2691242
calloc	malloc
try using calloc instead or memset ing your buffer so that it starts out clear
you need to clear out your buffer - malloc doesn t do so

2691567
trie	tree
from your description i m not entirely sure if it could fit in your design but one way you could improve on memory usage without suffering a huge performance penalty is by using a trie
advantages relative to binary search tree the following are the main advantages of tries over binary search tree bsts looking up keys is faster

2692816
serializable	deserialization
json lightweight serializable of json data rjson serializable to json via built-in metaprogramming hexpat-pickle combinators for serializable to xml using the hexpat package regular-xmlpickler serializable to xml of recursive data structures using the regular package the only other problem is that inevitably not all types will be serializable--if nothing else i suspect you re going to have a hard time serializing polymorphic types existential types and functions
i can t speak to ocaml but i d say that the main difficulty in haskell is that deserialization requires knowing the type in advance --there s no universal way to mechanically deserialize from a format figure out what the resulting value is and go from there as is possible in languages with unsound or dynamic type systems

2694591
equals	compareto
in order to make it work right you must follow the consistency with equals rule the ordering imposed by a comparator c on a set of elements s is said to be consistent with equals if and only if c.compare e1 e2 0 has the same boolean value as e1.equals e2 for every e1 and e2 in s
i guess you are not following this rule you didn t provide the implementation of the compareto method

2694739
postgresql	mysql
postgresql seems to have full support for utf-8 encoding hence for all unicode characters
mysql does not have full support for unicode eg chinese characters outside the bmp see

2694945
config	ini
if it doesn t you ll need to run this first before importing your models again this works in 0.9.6 from paste.deploy import appconfig from pylons import config from yourproject.config.environment import load_environment conf appconfig config + wherever your config.ini load_environment conf.global_conf conf.local_conf import yourproject.model as model source ben bangert
maybe this could be interesting to you you ll need to know where your config ini file is and load your app from the script

2695906
junit	testng
when i explain unit testing i like to describe them as a list of phases test setup define and create all the data and objects you need for the tests expectations say what methods and parameters you expect to be executed during the test test the actual behavior method call you want to test assertions statements that make sure the outcome of the test were successful test tear down destroy any side effects that occurred during the test junit is a unit testing framework and provides all but the expectations phase of testing
alternatives in the java space include testng jtest jbehave sort of jdave sort of other language equivalents include php - phpunit ruby - test unit flash - flexunit the concept of mocking is what added the new phase of expectations and since junit saw most of it s major development prior to the mocking movement those features were not incorporated into the core and a set of tools to fill that gap in the java space have opened up

2695906
junit	jmock	junit	testng	junit	jmockit	testng	jmock	testng	jmockit
alternatives in the java space include testng jtest jbehave sort of jdave sort of other language equivalents include php - phpunit ruby - test unit flash - flexunit the concept of mocking is what added the new phase of expectations and since junit saw most of it s major development prior to the mocking movement those features were not incorporated into the core and a set of tools to fill that gap in the java space have opened up
those libraries include easymock jmock jmockit all of these libraries are compliments to any of the above unit testing frameworks i listed including junit

2697165
glassfish	weblogic
i tried it with glassfish and it works perfectly
searching for some info i found an useful entry in the next blog adding the next line in the config.xml from my weblogic server section weblogic will not catch the basic authentication credentials again so it will be your authentication-manager who will handle it

2698109
translation	localization
if you have manuals help text and other collateral that also needs to be translation then the software cost might not be such a large proportion of the total budget
also if you have plans to perform localization for any far eastern languages japanese chinese korean ... you might consider sharing the cost across those projects since many of the issues will be similar

2699569
dictionary	map
dictionary actually does its job really well
i definitely wouldn t try introducing a new general-purpose type for use in python based on std map which has worse algorithmic complexity in time for many important operations and in at least some implementations leaves some optimisations to the user that dictionary already has

2699569
dictionary	map
i definitely wouldn t try introducing a new general-purpose type for use in python based on std map which has worse algorithmic complexity in time for many important operations and in at least some implementations leaves some optimisations to the user that dictionary already has
if i did want something that worked a little more like std map i d probably use a database

2700121
division	multiplication
that is the purpose of the division step it cuts off the bottom chunk of the result where there was not as much interaction
the top chunk is not usually chopped off because the computer drops the upper bits when the multiplication do not fit into a machine word any more

2700131
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
to summarize runtimeexception are a subset of unchecked-exception for exceptions from which recovery is possible but unchecked-exception is not a synonym of runtimeexception as many are answering here
as stated by their name unchecked-exception are not checked at compile-time which means that the compiler doesn t require methods to catch or to specify with a throws them

2700366
uiview	uiwindow
the code is trying to send a uiwindow message to a uiview which does not have the method
uiwindow is a subclass of uiview. i don t see the immediate cause but this his app shows severe design problems

2700948
phpunit	simpletest
simpletest - the answers to that question notably gordon s managed to convince me of phpunit
unit testing frameworks like phpunit are built more for testing the functionality of separate logical units classes not so much the behaviour of entire live sites

2702001
mdpi	hdpi
if your app does not say it supports densities then android will run in compatibility mode where it makes the screens look like an mdpi screens scaling all coordinates and drawing to match the real screens density
running in an hdpi screens like droid this is a 1.5x scaling so every other pixel will be mapped to two pixels on the screens

2704007
google-chrome	firefox
mozilla is working on it google-chrome as well
no firefox doesn t support sqlite databases on web pages

2705077
client-side	server-side
as php runs on the server-side you cannot access the client-side time from php php doesn t know much about the browser -- and you can have php scripts that run without being called from a browser
but you could get it from javascript which is executed on the client-side and then pass it to php via an ajax request for example

2706703
super	self
performance is 5 times worse than super call but we are talking about 200k calls vs a million calls per second if this isn t in your tightest loops - no reason to worry
found a shorter way to do super b self .test - bubble from below

2706703
super	self
found a shorter way to do super b self .test - bubble from below
works with multiple inheritance doesn t require arguments correcly behaves with sub-classes the solution was to use inspect.getmro type back_self where back_self is a self from callee then iterating it as cls with method_name in cls.__dict__ and verifying that the code reference we have is the one in this class realized in find_class_by_code_object self nested function

2712513
hex	binary
if you cannot access the delphi code or compile it yourself just ty to check the data with a hex editor you should see the boundaries of the records clearly since they start with integers and only floats follow
please note that when you define a record in delphi like struct in c the fields are layed out in order and in binary given the current alignment eg bytes are aligned on 1 byte boundaries words on 2 byte integers on 4 byte etc but it may vary given the compiler settings

2715717
jquery	curvycorners
jquery corners has trouble to handle background images
here is the reason why none of them is a proper solution in my opinion curvycorners dom messing screenshot curvy dom mess nifty dom mess nifty dom mess there are a few other but i think they are not mentionable at this place

2715856
webkit	gecko
and here is some direction toward using gecko if you prefer that. webkit2png provides instructions for os x but there s really no reason it shouldn t work on nix being that webkit itself is cross-platform
figuring that out can be left as an exercise to the reader but it may be worthwhile as khtml has historically lagged behind webkit for new html5 css3 etc features

2716553
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
a custom controller object would probably be more appropriate unless you need specific non-view functionality in uiviewcontroller and i don t know why you would
edit again i m not sure why uinavigationcontroller would be a better fit

2717108
boost	stl
using boost bind you d do it like this using a lambda function it s something like this i haven t checked that this compiles sorry
i m not sure how to do this using just the stl binders but i think your main problem is that what s being passed into the functor you give to remove isn t just an int but a

2720865
jar	war
which package archive should i use jar war the packaging will depend on the type of application you ll write it s not something that you choose upfront it s just a consequence
ejbs are packaged in an ejb jar and typically deployed inside an ear

2721305
lisp	scheme
the consequence it is theoretically not really satisfying and makes it impossible to statically parse source code if the code transformations are based on arbitrary lisp functions
the lisp community struggles with this for decades see for example the myriad of approaches that the scheme community has tried

2721391
dictionary	map
the stl std map can be used to build a dictionary
std map is usually implemented as a search tree not a hash table

2722538
vmware	virtualbox
still i m not sure if you could have vmware run off of a usb drive
maybe virtualbox

2723538
super	extends
if you are only stuffing items in it is a consumer and you should use super
if you do both with the same collection you shouldn t use either extends or super

2724792
onresume	onpause
then in onresume you can just move your cursor back to that position
if you aren t familiar with onpause onresume read up on the activity lifecycle

2725000
boost	allocator
when you do care about allocator behaviour you should always use a special purpose allocator boost pool something you write yourself etc. the exception is if you are studying allocator in which case you could do worse than pick up your copy of k r for a simple allocator which might help you understand how new gets its memory
this isn t fragmentation it s just rounding up the size of your allocator to a round block size

2725119
floating-point	fractions	decimal	ieee
read what every computer scientist should know about floating-point arithmetic +1 to mindstalker s answer -- use numeric or decimal if you need exact numeric data types
float data types have rounding effects because not every fractions base-10 number can be represented in the base-2 format of ieee 754

2725309
fgets	fread
well its the fastest way to retrieve data but often it is the most wasteful way when looking at memory usage since it reads all of the file at once into memory while fgets does not need to keep more than one line in memory
you use fread as well which is faster than fgets and which reads the file in chunks of a specific size that you can define

2725717
implements	extends
i m not clear if hibernate implements java ee 5 persistence implementation or if it is a totally different approach to data representation over back-end systems
yes hibernate provides an implementation of jpa and also extends it hibernate is a superset of jpa via the hibernate entitymanager project that relies on hibernate core

2726809
aggregate-functions	sum
when you do use nosql you would have to do the aggregate-functions in code or store them seperatly in its own columnfamily but this makes it all quite complex and reduces the performance that you gained by using nosql
another situation that makes the choice easier is when you want to use aggregate function like sum min max etcetera and complex queries like in the financial system mentioned above then a relational database is probably more convenient then a nosql database since both are not possible on a nosql databse unless you use really a lot of inverted indexes

2727853
qplaintextedit	qtextedit
so the clearest explanation i see is this qplaintextedit does not inherit from qtextedit
they both inherit from qscrollablearea and i can only assume that qtextedit does not respect the visibility of its document s blocks

2729339
udp	tcp
i don t know web services enough and don t even know if using udp for your webservice is an option or if it is even possible
using the same technique for directly tcp is likely to fail tcp connections aren t stateless - that causes a lot of problems here

2731114
updatepanel	scriptmanager
anything within the updatepanel will update through ajax not a full page refresh
use the ajax.asp.net library - then you add a scriptmanager item and an updatepanel

2731321
delphi	oxygene

daemons	systemd
from the daemons 3 man page the daemons function is for programs wishing to detach themselves from the controlling terminal and run in the background as systemd daemons
should this function not exist for you or should there be instances where your program does not run as a daemons your forker program can also be modified to daemonize your other program

2732777
g++	gcc
the short answer without patching colorgcc.pl itself the easiest way to fix this is to write yourself a simple wrapper script for each command calling ccache with the appropriate arguments for that command and passing along the arguments the script received effectively currying the call to ccache . e.g. for gcc usr local bin ccache-gcc.sh .colorgcc gcc usr local bin ccache-gcc.sh and for g++ usr local bin ccache-g++.sh .colorgcc gcc usr local bin ccache-g++.sh there are ways to clean this up so that you only use a single script with symlinks for each variant but those are beyond the scope of this answer and i leave them to you as an excercise - the long answer the problem is that the script treats everything to the right of the colon in the prefs file as the command passed to exec not as the command and extra arguments
i.e. in your case the script ends up trying to do this incorrect exec ccache usr bin g++ --version ccache usr bin g++ is a single argument. but it should be doing this correct exec ccache usr bin g++ --version ccache and usr bin g++ are two separate arguments. perl s exec ultimately calls execvp after possibly applying some do what i mean logic to its arguments

2733365
factors	matrix
edit in case you re asking if there is an algorithm faster than the factors solve gaussian elimination method no there is not
a specialized factorization routine for a banded matrix takes about 4n k 2 operations k is the bandwidth while the backward substitution takes about 6 n k operations

2734177
apache	nginx
modify wsgi script file to fudge script_name although it may work is not generally recommended as not allowing apache mod_wsgi to do the proper thing which may have other implications
change wsgiscriptalias home dreamiurg webapps pinfont myproject.wsgi to wsgiscriptalias myproj home dreamiurg webapps pinfont myproject.wsgi then change the nginx front end configuration of webfaction to proxy to myproj on back end instead of

2734809
youtube	vimeo
youtube with an estimated 40 of the web s video shines in an app bundled on all apple mobile devices with the ipad offering perhaps the best youtube discovery and viewing experience ever
add to this video from vimeo netflix facebook abc cbs cnn msnbc fox news espn npr time the new york times the wall street journal sports illustrated people national geographic and many many others. iphone ipod and ipad users aren t missing much video

2736247
vsto	add-in
this informs the vsto runtime that it is locally installed and to not invoke the clickonce installer
this is caused by an issue with clickonce. i found a workaround by installing the add-in using msi. this guide was a lot of help

2736444
entity-relationship	diagram
the classic entity-relationship entity-relationship model identifies relationships but does not implement them as foreign keys
in an entity-relationship diagram relationships appear as lines between boxes

2738559
fileoutputstream	filewriter
to specify these values yourself construct an outputstreamwriter on a fileoutputstream
usually better than filewriter already suggested is to use fileoutputstream which also like filewriter has an append parameter in one of its constructors and which unlike filewriter does not silently assume the default charset encoding slightly bad practice imo

2738559
fileoutputstream	filewriter
usually better than filewriter already suggested is to use fileoutputstream which also like filewriter has an append parameter in one of its constructors and which unlike filewriter does not silently assume the default charset encoding slightly bad practice imo
from the filewriter doc convenience class for writing character files

2738604
cvs	svn
i can not recommend cvs which is outdated
also svn is not the latest generation of distributed version control system i would not recommend to use it if there is not a specific reason and it will pollute all your subdirs with special subdirs which can be annoying

2738654
appfuse	spring
appfuse - not really a framework but it might be worth a look if you re looking for something to ease the initial ramp up effort on a java ee project
it provides a bunch of maven 2 archetypes that will create a ready to run application based on any of struts 2 jsf tapestry 5 spring mvc struts 2 is also very much worth a look

2740341
nsmutablestring	nsstring
you should do this the error says that you re sending the message bytes to an instance of nscfstring which is a nsstring even though you declared it as a nsmutablestring because this is a dynamically typed language but the class types are not automatically converted if you try to cast it to something else
you should not be passing in a nsstring into initwithdata

2742616
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
no runtimeexception and its subclasses are unchecked-exception
jls 11.2.5 why runtime exceptions are not checked the runtime exception classes runtimeexception and its subclasses are exempted from compile-time checking because in the judgment of the designers of the java programming language having to declare such exceptions would not aid significantly in establishing the correctness of programs

2743133
client-side	server-side
i believe it s the same with databases on client-side
i m not sure about html5 and local databases but on server-side it s better to use prepared statements rather than escaping

2744693
boost	allocator
although there are smart pointer classes such as boost shared_ptr which provide you with these same safety guarantees and where you would still need to use new so he still isn t quite right
note that if you have only one object array that you are allocator then this is not an issue.

2745290
calloc	malloc
you seem to want tot int s so using calloc the correct statement is something like or
no cast is required in c it is required in c++ but you usually wouldn t use malloc or calloc in c++ and the only thing it can do is cover up a possible mistake leaving out to be specific

2746348
ssl	https
ssl tls isn t used nearly often enough
https must be used for the entire session at no point can a session id be sent over http

2748064
realloc	malloc
do b use realloc rtm to make it bigger
a you did not use malloc to create it so you cannot expand with malloc

2748392
xsl-fo	xslt
generating xsl-fo and xhtml from xslt is not necessarily an either-or choice
xsl-fo is generally used to generate pdf

2748392
xsl-fo	xslt
however you can convert xsl-fo into xhtml and then render in the browser
generally it wouldn t be worth the hassle to have your xslt create xsl-fo and then convert into xhtml just generate xhtml directly unless you want to create both output formats pdf and xhtml with reduced effort

2748392
xsl-fo	xslt
generally it wouldn t be worth the hassle to have your xslt create xsl-fo and then convert into xhtml just generate xhtml directly unless you want to create both output formats pdf and xhtml with reduced effort
it is possible to create both xsl-fo and xhtml at the same time without maintaining two complete sets of stylesheets to create similar output in different vocabularies

2748887
apache	nginx
unfortunately nginx does not support byte-range requests but apache does
so i tested this out on apache and it worked

2749069
inline	inlining
if it decided not to it won t inline
inlining is controlled by compiler-specific heuristics

2749636
base	fractions
in fact for any fixed base there will be fractions the result of dividing one integer by another that cannot be represented exactly as a finite precision floating point number in that base
the number will have a recurring part ... when you do financial calculations involving division you have to consider the what to do with a recurring fractions

2750492
glassfish	weblogic
check the following links and see yourself embedding glassfish v3 in unit test - two jars three lines of code and five seconds start with deployment embedding ejb 3.1 container into your unit tests - boot time 5 seconds using the ejbcontainer api with or without maven but with glassfish v3 totd #128 ejbcontainer.createejbcontainer embedded ejb using glassfish v3
weblogic doesn t provide an embedded api so even if it s a pure java server and if you can thus call weblogic.server from java code you will have to handle everything yourself starting the container waiting until it s started deploying things waiting until they are deployed etc

2751094
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
if you want to force the caller of a piece of code to handle an exception use a checked exception the subclasses of exception other than runtimeexception are all checked exception classes
per language specification unchecked-exception are not checked at compile-time which means that the compiler does not require methods to catch or to specify with a throws them

2751636
fgets	fread
speed is not a reason to use one over the other as those two functions just don t do the same thing if you want to read a line from a text file then use fgets if you want to read some data not necessarily a line from a file then use fread
fgets reads a line -- it will stop at a newline

2751636
fgets	fread
fgets reads a line -- it will stop at a newline
fread reads raw data -- it will stop after a specified or default number of bytes independently of any newline that might or might not be present

2752090
punctuation	words
i would first turn each string of characters into a set or multiset of words ignoring punctuation and differences in lower upper case
if that s not powerful enough in a second pass i could try pairs or even triples of adjacent words known as bigrams and trigrams

2752761
fgets	fread
you can just as easily open up the content when needed using fopen fgets fclose
or fread or file_get_contents instead of storing it into the database why not store it as a file on the server using file_put_contents

2755829
union	distinct
if your engine s optimizer doesn t do an efficient job with that i might look deeper but anything else would probably involve a lot of left joins since it looks you are joining two distinct uses of annotations for the same reason your inner join attempt failed all join criteria must be satisfied you would have to change almost everything to left join or left join to a nested inner join - i think the union is simplest
union is the simplest

2757425
implements	extends
you cannot access any attributes using the dynamic proxy because it implements the interface it does not extends the handler class
you cannot access any methods not declared in the interface using the dynamic proxy because it implements the interface it does not extends the handler class

2757616
innodb	myisam
database performance of the innodb is not necessary faster than the myisam engine
most important difference between them is that innodb is transactional and offers referential integrity

2757869
phpunit	simpletest
phpunit is more popular and up to date as simpletest hasn t had a new release for some time though for testing webforms it s still very useful as phpunit does not have good support for that
it s also said that simpletest has better support for some of the more advanced techniques called mocking replacing part of a class to test with something under your own control

2759719
client-side	server-side
client-side sorting work for example with datatype xmlstring and datatype clientside but not with datatype xml or datatype json and datatype jsonp
parameters like sorttype works only with client-side sorting and will be ignored with server-side sorting

2762741
pascal	delphi
use lazarus free pascal if you want a free ide that supports multiple platforms and has a delphi-ish syntax
well a delphi programmer cannot use lazarus to write delphi code because lazarus is not delphi

2762741
pascal	delphi
lazarus is actually an ide and a bunch of delphi-ish class libraries for free pascal
but note things like delphi s vcl is not there and to be perfectly blunt the ide and debugging experiences in lazarus are pretty spotty however it is free so that counts for a lot

2763468
awt	swing
if you use swing i recommend working with the awt internal drag and drop system
as sun mentions on their guides we do not recommend that you create your own drag and drop support using the awt classes

2764361
noexcept	throw
a similar issue is if you have a function which is not specified with noexcept ie
can throw exceptions which you want to call from many functions some noexcept some not

2764361
noexcept	throw
can throw exceptions which you want to call from many functions some noexcept some not
you know the function will never throw in the circumstances called by the noexcept functions but again the compiler doesn t more useless warnings

2766529
client-side	server-side
another difference is that hiding content client-side does not remove it from the dom - the content is there just hidden
hiding controls server-side prevents their content from even being emitted to the html

2766972
nsmutablestring	nsstring
you would definitely want to use nsmutablestring for something like this nsmutablestring is designed for this kind of sequential concatenation where the basic nsstring class is really not meant to be used in this manner
your original code would actually allocate a new nsstring every time you called stringbyappendformat and then procede to copy into it all of the thousands of characters you had already appended

2767144
exponent	modulo
exponent crypt openssl bignum- new_from_bin decode_base64 xmlexponent
# you can reading in the remaining parameters is the same as the first two # dq dp and inverseq are not needed privatekey crypt openssl rsa- modulo exponent d p q # outputs it in a standard binary form der which php should support. print privatekey- get_private_key_string # if you need pem openssl can definitely convert it

2767692
udp	tcp
also many games use udp for this sort of data transfer instead of tcp
udp is unreliable so you may not get all of your packets

2767962
udp	tcp
also use udp and not tcp
the game will be a lot more responsive with udp in case of packet loss

2770491
gridview	repeater
if you want more flexibility in the output than gridview provides take a look at repeater
since the repeater doesn t directly implement paging you ll have to supply your own next and previous buttons

2770891
queue	fifo
if the queue has a large-ish number of messages on it then enumerating those messages will become a serious bottleneck
msmq was designed for fifo kind of access and anything that doesn t follow that pattern can cause you lots of grief in terms of performance

2771062
uiview	caanimation
every uiview has a calayer that also has a few properties that can be animated the most interesting of which is the 3d transform property
if the basic animation is not sufficient for you needs you can either look into caanimation and related classes or look to a third party animation library

2772013
equals	gethashcode
the default implementation of equals tests object references which will probably be fine in most cases for your dictionary
the base implementation of gethashcode is fairly naive in fact even the documentation states the default implementation of the gethashcode method does not guarantee unique return values for different objects

2772491
firefox	safari
it looks like it is some kind of extension in firefox
this will not work in opera ie or safari

2772641
typemock	moles
but if you absolutely must you can use typemock isolator to mock just about anything
also just so it doesn t get lost in the din thomas linked a good article on using the free ms moles to mock non-public members

2772672
moq	moles
not with moq
but you can use the free moles framework from ms to do such things

2773226
udp	tcp
for udp this is not the case i am assuming you are using datagramsocket
since udp is asynchronous as opposed to synchronous like tcp to recieve data you are not creating a binding to another specific machine so for example if you were to try the udp socket does not know where the data is coming from so there can not be a unique mapping like tcp also unlike tcp the port you specify is your machine s port not a remote machine port

2773226
udp	tcp
since udp is asynchronous as opposed to synchronous like tcp to recieve data you are not creating a binding to another specific machine so for example if you were to try the udp socket does not know where the data is coming from so there can not be a unique mapping like tcp also unlike tcp the port you specify is your machine s port not a remote machine port
another way to think of it when you create a udp socket it is like creating a tcp server socket

2773408
content-length	content-type
rfc2616 the content-length entity-header field indicates the size of the entity-body in decimal number of octets sent to the recipient or in the case of the head method the size of the entity-body that would have been sent had the request been a get
it doesn t matter what the content-type is

2773412
content-length	content-type
any content-length greater than or equal to zero is a valid value. section 4.4 describes how to determine the length of a message-body if a content-length is not given
note that the meaning of this field is significantly different from the corresponding definition in mime where it is an optional field used within the message external-body content-type

2773413
content-length	content-type
section 4.4 describes how to determine the length of a message-body if a content-length is not given
note that the meaning of this field is significantly different from the corresponding definition in mime where it is an optional field used within the message external-body content-type

2773953
division	subtraction
i don t know if this is faster or not it depends on whether or not you can do division and multiplication faster than a lot of subtractions
another way to speed up the subtraction approach is to use binary search

2774319
multiplication	modulo
0 result + a if result m result - m a a lt lt 1 if a m a- m b b 1 return result this is just modular multiplication result a b mod m
the modulo operations at the top are not needed but serve a reminder that the algorithm assumes a and b are less than m

2775017
daemons	systemd
this allows a form of error recovery in that when the service starts and detects that a pid file exists instead of just quitting outright it can check whether a process with that pid actually exists and if not which implies that the service daemons has crashed start and try to recover from the previous crash
traditionally on unix systemd this is done by creating a file var run nameofservice.pid

2778756
ironruby	ironpython
and i m pretty confident that it wouldn t be too hard to add ironruby support to netbeans it already supports jruby mri and yarv
ironruby has been out for 4 weeks ironpython for 4 years

2780518
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this does not work in firefox 3.6 ie 7 safari 5.1.7 or google-chrome 4.1
setting the page margin does have effect in ie 8 opera 10 google-chrome 21 and firefox 19

2782557
perforce	svn
my previous employer was using perforce linux servers mac windows clients my new employer is transitioning to svn
here s what i ve run into i do not miss perforce s branching

2784576
comparator	comparable
since date implements comparable it has a comparator method just like string does
so your custom comparator could look like this the compare method must return an int so you couldn t directly return a boolean like you were planning to anyway

2785006
inline	inlining
the jit compiler will not copy code from another assembly to inline it into the code of this assembly
c# the language doesn t do inlining but the .net clr jit compiler can

2786896
profiling	debugging
if you re more interested in features .net framework client profiling on msdn lists the following as being included common language runtime clr clickonce windows forms windows presentation foundation wpf windows communication foundation wcf entity framework windows workflow foundation speech xslt support linq to sql runtime design libraries for entity framework and wcf data services managed extensibility framework mef dynamic types parallel-programming features such as task parallel library tpl parallel linq plinq and coordination data structures cds debugging client applications and the following as not being included asp.net advanced windows communication foundation wcf functionality .net framework data provider for oracle msbuild for compiling
a list of assemblies is available at assemblies in the .net framework client profiling on msdn the list is too long to include here

2788890
icmp	tcp
a typical example of a misconfigured device is a router or firewall that s been configured by an inexperienced network administrator to drop all icmp not realising that fragmentation needed packets are required by tcp pmtu-d
the df flag is typically set on ip packets carrying tcp segments

2788890
mtu	icmp
this process is called pmtu-d path mtu discovery
if the icmp fragmentation needed packets aren t getting through then you re dealing with a broken network

2790537
nunit	mstest
note i have not verified the nunit implementation
mstest open your .testsettings file and check the enable deployment under the deployment section

2790916
cassini	iis
i think cassini does not produce log files
if you need log files just use iis

2791743
strcpy	strncpy
using strcpy without testing the length using strlen of the string you are copying to be sure it will fit in the destination buffer is a very bad idea
you should use strncpy which is length-checked and will not overrun the destination buffer

2792918
comparator	comparable
but even then creating a comparator isn t that much extra work and it leaves things flexible in case you decide you want to make that tree node a protected or public class some day
i think that a bigger question here is whether it is appropriate to implement comparable on these objects

2792918
comparator	comparable
it may be more appropriate to use a comparator for the operations that work on height and not embed ordinal computation in the class itself
my general philosophy on this is to only implement comparable if there is a truly natural ordering for the object

2793137
jquery	scriptaculous
and the reason i m using them is animation smoothness - i ve written my own functions when i couldn t include jquery
hey it uses scriptaculous which on its behalf is based on prototype

2793153
ssl	https
in that case you may likely face a javax.net.ssl.sslexception not trusted server certificate on some https sites who doesn t keep their ssl certificates up to date or a or javax.net.ssl.sslprotocolexception handshake alert unrecognized_name on some misconfigured https sites
the following one-time-run static initializer in your web scraper class should make httpsurlconnection more lenient as to those https sites and thus not throw those exceptions anymore

2794106
bash	zsh
i tested it in bash 3.2 4.4 and 5.0-alpha
but it doesn t work in zsh 5.2 or ksh 93u+ because random only gets evaluated once in the brace expansion in those shells

2795178
memcached	apc
memcached does not do opcode caching like apc eaccelerator xcache etc
just to add memcached is only going to benefit you greatly if you are running multiple servers which need to access a shared data cache

2795246
cpython	ironpython
as far as i know you can access .net libraries within ironpython so you could try importing a .net library and catch the exception it throws when .net is not available as in cpython
the cli common language infrastructure .net ironpython is probably reliable

2795896
required	placeholder
it was built-into vs 2008 but did not required the ajax control toolkit it isn t related to the toolkit
the ajax webform is identical to a regular webform except that it has a script manager and a placeholder javascript function for pageload

2795906
serializable	deserialization
serializable formats may be opaque or transparent
for example java serializable is opaque - the data is not used for purposes other than for deserialization

2797482
move	drag
when you start dragging a window the system enters a modal move resize loop
it does not return to your own message loop until the drag action has finished

2797973
client-side	server-side
your problem is javascript does not have an input output i o api as it is a client-side scripting language and consequently has no access to the file system via the server
you would need to use a server-side scripting language to save data to a server

2798617
inline	inlining	inline-functions	inlining
even with this option the compiler will not warn about failures to inline-functions declared in system headers. the compiler uses a variety of heuristics to determine whether or not to inline a function
for example the compiler takes into account the size of the function being inlined and the amount of inlining that has already been done in the current function

2798821
inline	inlining
use ìnline rather than __inline__ and respect the compilers decisions on what should or should not be inline
don t try to force it unless you ve already profiled the code found it to be a bottleneck and verified that inlining would actually speed up rather than slow down the code

2799298
appfuse	spring
check something like appfuse which will give you an application skeleton you can enhance
if not i would start with that learning sql using jdbc with spring jdbc for example

2799543
intersect	contains
distinct groupby join and i believe also the set-aggregation methods union intersect and except use hashing so they should be close to o n instead of o n²
contains checks for an icollection implementation so it may be o 1 if the underlying collection is also o 1 such as a but this is depends on the actual data structure and is not guaranteed

2799546
ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	icollection
it depends on what type the underlying ienumerable is
i know that for some collections like collections that implement icollection or ilist there are special codepaths that are used however the actual implementation is not guaranteed to do anything special

2802304
primes	modulus
in particular a primes p such that p+2 is also primes will almost never be selected
with a proper modulus size this should not be an issue that special kind of bias was studied and found out not to be a big issue but it is bad public relations nonetheless

2803098
jsf	stripes
it provides an excellent templating fit for jsf sun s mvc framework the java counterpart of asp.net mvc
if you don t go for jsf then facelets has not much benefit for you and you could just continue with legacy jsp probably with a 3rd party templating framework on top like freemarker or velocity and or a 3rd party mvc framework like spring mvc struts2 or stripes

2803540
move	drag
what you describe is a bit weird - the maximized window can t usually be move
in particular it occupies the whole desktop area and afaik the system doesn t drag it when its caption - the area for which hit test was ht_caption is dragged

2804311
django	web2py
this is because web2py was made long after django and has learned from django s mistakes though it makes all new mistakes
main difference and what is keeping me in web2py django has incredible documentation...web2py is so intuitive that it doesn t need as much.

2804311
django	web2py
biggest drawback of web2py is its age and smaller code base...this is not unreasonable though considering django is like the first python web framework to implement rails style rad ideas and is like twice the age of web2py
web2py is still in its early adopter portion of its life...django is in the beyond critical mass part coming up to decline.

2807637
jboss	weblogic	glassfish	weblogic
open source implementations of the ejb spec would be glassfish from sun geronimo from apache jboss from jboss.org the open source version not the red hat one or openejb running under tomcat
if you have cash to burn on licenses try weblogic from oracle bea or websphere from ibm

2807717
haskell	ocaml
the program works fine and fast in haskell even when using foldl and not foldl but stack overflows in ocaml and f#
your haskell is using lazy lists but your ocaml f# is using strict lists so your programs are incomparable

2808982
rdf	owl
if you d rather not write any java code at all to do this you could write some xslt or xquery to transform your rdf xml directly into the required xml but this sounds like it will be more work than the aforementioned option given what you ve got already
what isn t clear from your post is any mapping between the xsd components and the particular resource data you have in rdf or schema thereof such as rdfs or owl or both

2808982
rdf	owl
what isn t clear from your post is any mapping between the xsd components and the particular resource data you have in rdf or schema thereof such as rdfs or owl or both
if you understand this mapping then given you have a jaxb implementation to create java objects already with a view to populate them with the data represented as rdf and a jena implementation to parse the rdf xml in java then i suggest that you can implement a java bridge - effectively custom code that queries the jena model of the rdf data to map it into new objects of the classes as generated by jaxb which can then be marshaled to the required xml

2809992
cassini	iis
this is based on the cassini code and there is an extended version - ultidev cassini 2.0 free but not open source
like iis it is just a web server

2810202
des	aes
you certainly should not be using any of the des based algorithms these days assuming you have a free choice
aes rijndael is the current standard for nist and other bodies

2811244
icollection	iqueryable
i try and keep all the query logic in my repositories and try to only pass back the icollection from them
in your situation i d pass in some parameters to determine if you want to eager load roles or not and construct the iqueryable that way

2813473
junit	cactus
i wouldn t call it a test framework it is really just a handful of classes providing the glue between junit and embedded glassfish
the general idea is similar to cactus your tests run in the container and get triggered by a servlet from outside

2815604
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
you should not attempt to catch a nullpointerexception
instead the best way to avoid null pointers is in any function that takes parameters where you assume that the parameter is non-null always check that the parameter is non-null and throw an illegalargumentexception if it is null

2816277
vsto	add-in
for example my latest project requires the following assuming but verifying .net framework 3.5 is installed vsto runtime 3.0 vsto runtime 3.0 sp1 microsoft office 2007 primary interop assemblies hotfix for office kb976477 - all users get the application-level add-in
i also remember reading that vsto was not ideal for commercial software

2819517
innodb	myisam
this tutorial should help some more note you can t use fulltext queries with innodb tables
the default mysql table type is myisam which doesn t support transactions

2825900
mp3	wav
from the livedocs - basics of working with sound ... although there are various sound file formats used to encode digital audio actionscript 3.0 flash player and air support sound files that are stored in the mp3 format
they cannot directly load or play sound files in other formats like wav or aiff. ... but apparently there s a workaround

2826886
google-chrome	firefox
i would suggest starting with the documentation for the google-chrome labs
the bad news for you is that mozilla firefox plugins cannot be developed in .net managed code but the good news is that they can easily be developed with xml javascript and css

2827616
super	implements	super	extends	implements	extends
without the super signature sortedlist would not be able accept the type of java.sql.date because it doesn t implements a comparable of itself but rather of a super class of itself
super in generics is the opposite of extends

2828941
junit	testng
in testng this would be equivalent to for teardown for the testng equivalent of junit 4 s before and after you can use beforemethod and aftermethod respectively
if you don t want to set up static initializers for one time initialization and are not particular about using junit take a look at testng

2828941
junit	testng
if you don t want to set up static initializers for one time initialization and are not particular about using junit take a look at testng
testng supports non-static one-time initialization with a variety of configuration options all using annotations

2829666
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
i have read that domattrmodified is supported by opera and safari not sure about firefox so you could use that in combination with ie s onpropertychange untested
an effective way is to use a combination of onkeydown and onpaste which will work in ie firefox google-chrome and safari

2829965
union	distinct
the union david m
suggested does not double count as union implies a distinct if a row exists in one half of the union ignore it in the other

2829965
union	distinct
suggested does not double count as union implies a distinct if a row exists in one half of the union ignore it in the other
if you used union all you would get two records

2830913
awt	swing
new java programmers not conforming to this rule and executing tasks on the awt thread is almost certainly the biggest reason people think java is slow
there is a single thread used for all swing activity

2830965
pthreads	fork
on pthreads systems spork uses kernel.fork
on windows fork is not an option so spork creates a pool of preloaded processes which avoids the huge rails start up time

2831042
g++	gcc
use this as a test case g++ on macosx doesn #39
t work with -arch ppc64 it will report multiple errors with gcc 4.2 missing c++ includes missing c includes missing libs

2831737
postgresql	mysql
what i usually do for such migrations is two-fold extract the whole database definition from mysql and adapt it to postgresql syntax
go over the database definition and transform it to take advantage of functionality in postgresql that doesn t exist in mysql

2831737
postgresql	mysql
go over the database definition and transform it to take advantage of functionality in postgresql that doesn t exist in mysql
then do the conversion and write a program in whatever language you are most comfortable with that accomplishes the following reads the data from the mysql database

2832033
allocator	stl
moreover under debug builds the low-fragmentation heap is disabled up to a 10x overall slowdown in memory allocator no code optimizations are performed which may result in further stl performance degradation stl relying many a time heavily on inlining loop unwinding etc. with 1000 iterations you are probably not affected by the above not at the outer loop level at least unless you use stl the heap heavily inside foo
i very very strongly doubt that your performance problem is coming from the stl containers

2833377
jlist	jtable
your custom renderer is simply governing the appearance of the jlist contents not adding any functionality such as the ability to modify the components check box - imagine it simply as a rubber stamp used to display each list cell in turn
i d recommend solving the problem by use a single-column jtable instead of a jlist

2834627
postgresql	mysql
all of this is not a problem in postgresql
by default mysql created myisam engine tables which does not support transactions or foreign keys you need to explicitly force transactional innodb engine while creating a table

2835723
lwjgl	jogl
for example when i last looked lwjgl and jmoneyengine were both restricted to a single viewport per app which works for games but might not for data visualization
jogl is a very thin java wrapper around opengl

2836563
haskell	scheme	ocaml	scheme
just for example i can write scheme quite reasonably as well but that s of little use in reading ocaml or haskell for only a couple of examples
even within a single family scheme vs. common lisp familiarity with one doesn t seem to translate nearly as well to the other

2839150
comparator	comparable
the two overloads for collections.sort are different sorts comparable objects using their natural ordering sorts whatever using a compatible comparator you re confusing the two by trying to sort a comparator which is again why it doesn t make sense that
again to use collections.sort you need one of these to be true the type must be comparable use the 1-arg sort a comparator for the type must be provided use the 2-args sort related questions when to use comparable vs comparator sorting an arraylist of contacts also do not use raw types in new code

2839552
hex	binary
if you will use hex format for packing than use somethong like this to unpack data
the reason is that on silverlight side you have not only to unpack binary data that packed with php function but also have a knowlege how data sructure packed in php script represented in binary data

2840153
bufferedreader	fileoutputstream
don t use the bufferedreader for binary streams it doesn t make sense
just write the obtained inputstream to an outputstream of any flavor fileoutputstream the usual java io way

2840412
postgresql	mysql
so far no one has mentioned postgresql as alternative to mysql on the relational side
be aware that mysql libs are pure gpl not lgpl

2841746
prepare	execute
the prepare only sees a string it doesn t know whether you wrote it literally or if parts of the string came from untrustworthy sources
you can use a parameter placeholder in the sql query and then when you call execute on the prepared statement you supply the dynamic value

2842970
comparator	comparable
you should make but not itself implements comparator
a comparable type defines the natural ordering for the type and a comparator for a type is usually not the type itself and defines their own custom ordering of that type

2842970
comparator	comparable
a comparable type defines the natural ordering for the type and a comparator for a type is usually not the type itself and defines their own custom ordering of that type
can i use a comparator without implementing comparable

2843907
mp3	wav
one thing that needs to be recognized about wav files are is that it is a container format -- it can hold data in many different formats including uncompressed pcm to mp3
in this case i am going to guess that the library that is being used is hooking into the java sound api and the implementation of the api does not support the format of the data contained in the wav file leading to an unsupportedaudiofileexception exception

2844560
actionscript	mxml
there are some syntax definitions and omnicomplete plugins for actionscript that work pretty well -- not full autocomplete like you ll find in many graphical ides but enough to make vim a very good option for flash and flex development
for a graphical interface you can create mxml layouts with the designview air app it s a basic alternative to the design view in flex builder

2845437
innodb	myisam
or you can select omc_category.name and shortdesc in the above query too to get them at the same time though you might not want to do that if the descriptions can be quite long. also consider using an innodb table with proper foreign key references between your tables
there s little good reason to be using myisam today except for fulltext

2849255
serializable	deserialization
it would be better since memory isn t an issue you say to tweak the serializable and have the speed critical part of your code be as simple as possible
after deserialization just go through and convert the lists to sets should do it

2851498
ironruby	ironpython
also ironruby will run rails just fine but you don t get visual studio support
out of the box visual studio doesn t contain ironpython or ironruby

2851523
subtraction	addition
computer does not do a subtraction
it does the addition of a negative number

2852150
ethernet	wireless
your physical hardware running the data link protocol on wired ethernet can detect when the cable is pulled
your wireless hardware and corresponding protocol probably not so much

2856618
setinterval	settimeout
if you want an easy to use slideshow take a look at - it has a demo here by the way do not use a literal as the first argument to settimeout setinterval use a function reference setinterval poladroid 3000
there is no substitute for setinterval settimeout - these are the only ways of timing events in browser based ecmascript

2856618
setinterval	settimeout
there is no substitute for setinterval settimeout - these are the only ways of timing events in browser based ecmascript
its not easy to grasp the real issue here but i m guessing the whatever you are triggering using setinterval is heavier than it has to be as it is jquery - you should try to make this more efficient

2857522
floating-point	fractions
this can be done in java in a number of ways string.format .2f 1.2399 returns 1.24 new decimalformat 0.00 .format 1.2 returns 1.20 new decimalformat 0.## .format 1.2 returns 1.2 read the floating-point guide for more detailed information
you can t really round double values to decimal places since double is a binary format not decimal and will internally be rounded to binary fractions

2857614
ienumerable	ilist
databinding cannot be used with ienumerable s
you can only bind to an ilist or better

2857614
ienumerable	ilist
add .toarray to turn the ienumerable into an
the reason it works the first time is probably because your getallorderitems doesn t perform any linq calls and ends up returning an object that implements ilist

2857928
vsto	add-in
vsto presumes you are using visual studio as your development platform thus mainly targeting professional and corporate developers
power users who create macros and add-in with vba seem not to be the the target audience for vsto

2857928
vsto	add-in
power users who create macros and add-in with vba seem not to be the the target audience for vsto
if you are interested in add-in for excel the native .xll add-in have some specific advantages over vsto in particular they support creating high-performance user-defined functions

2858329
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
neither is supported in opera
warning in ie6 7 at least and possibly ie8 but not firefox google-chrome etc onbeforeunload and onunload are triggered when anchors javascript links are clicked on

2858691
comparator	comparable
support it or not depending on what you want your comparator to do
comparable doesn t allow null simply because for all objects a and b where

2859737
jsf	stripes	struts	stripes
i ve used struts and jsf in the past but not recently so at best i have vague notions and feelings about them
we are intimately familiar w stripes use it for most everything now and really enjoy it

2860323
content-length	content-type
here s what one of my iis servers says about a pdf file http 1.1 200 ok content-length 127791 content-type application pdf ... however anything that s not delivered directly by the web server a file served by php or asp.net for example won t work unless the script specifically handles head requests
some web servers may give you a content-length header in response to a head request

postgresql	mysql
from what i understand postgresql doesn t provide the syntax to force index use like you see in mysql oracle or sql server
you can look at using set statistics this value can be a number between 0 and 1000 and helps postgresql determine what level of statistics gathering should be performed on that column

profiling	instrumentation
with instrumentation the profiling will show you data for any binaries you instrumentation as well as one level of callees if you call string.concat directly from your instrumented binary the profiling will show you how many times you called it and how long in aggregate the calls took
the profiling will not show you data for binaries that you don t instrumentation

2862094
profiling	instrumentation
still you should at least be able to use the profiling to collect data against your managed code
for instrumentation you will want to go with your second option an executable and in the performance explorer you will want to have two targets sidebar.exe not instrumented since you don t have the pdb - you can right-click the target and uncheck the instrumentation option to suppress instrumentation foo.dll whatever your gadget dll is called instrumented - you might have to manually add this target right-click on the targets folder select add target binary... but be sure to enable the instrumentation option and ensure that its pdb is sitting next to it to understand more about performance targets see this blog post

haskell	ocaml
i think jon harrop has a serious downer on haskell for some reason
it s simply not true that it is not used outside of academia in fact it is widely used in investment banking and far more so than f# and ocaml are and for good reason

2864543
uiview	subviews
after thinking about graham s answer i came up with the following solution i drag a new uiview - lets call it sub uiview in interface builder in my main uiview i give this sub uiview the correct size because i cannot resize the main uiview which is always 320x460 i drag all my other elements in this sub uiview so that all elements are attached to my sub uiview i give my sub uiview a tag number interface builder - view attributes 300 in the code i do now the following within my -initwithframe nsarray nibobjects nsbundle mainbundle loadnibnamed commentbox owner self options nil
uiview subviews nibobjects objectatindex 0 viewwithtag 300

2866133
mongodb	bson
i see no mentioning of the mongodb php driver returning objects in either the api documentation or the tutorial
this is not really surprising as the official drivers stay close to the native bson document type used to represent documents

2867632
cassini	iis
i think this is a cassini issue that doesn t occur under iis
i too see these leaky system.runtime.remoting namespace instances when i am running under cassini only

2867632
cassini	iis
i too see these leaky system.runtime.remoting namespace instances when i am running under cassini only
i do not see them if i set the handler up to run under iis

2867632
cassini	iis
this reminds me of some other remoting cassini issue i ve seen
iirc having an instance of something like an iprincipal that needs to exist in the beginrequest of a module and also at the end of the module lifecycle needs to derive from marshalbyrefobject in cassini but not iis

2868981
strncpy	fread
also initializing a pointer is not the same thing as allocating memory for it finally please get in the habit of using strncpy over strcpy its much safer
there are actually three segmentation faults here the first one is fread which is attempting to write to memory that does not yet exist as far as your process is concerned

2868981
fread	strcpy
there are actually three segmentation faults here the first one is fread which is attempting to write to memory that does not yet exist as far as your process is concerned
the second one is strcpy expounding on the first you are attempting to copy to a pointer that points to nothing

2869462
google-chrome	firefox
elements defined inside the firefox extensions are part of the browser user interface google-chrome
since web pages run javascript with restricted privileges they cannot do a lot of things and among them they cannot reference or interact directly with the google-chrome elements

2870270
nunit	mstest
for example mstest uses and to specify a test fixtures and tests while nunit uses and
also nunit s equivalent to is and it isn t static

2872864
xna	slimdx
slimdx supports directx10 and 11 while xna only supports directx 9
xna is a cross platform between windows xbox 360 zune and windows phone 7 while slimdx is not

2872864
xna	slimdx
xna is a cross platform between windows xbox 360 zune and windows phone 7 while slimdx is not
xna has a strong community creators.xna.com with tons of tutorials and help materials

2876709
kerberos	ntlm
but wait you says i use sql authentication and sql authentication is not an ntlm kerberos resource
true says i but you also use named pipes and named pipes are an ntlm kerberos resource therefore delegation does occur

2877619
ienumerable	ilist
then you call it however i suggest you use this code this way your function can take any ienumerable this include ilist or anything we can enumerate through your function is simpler it may not be efficient for large data-sets though however that is subject to your average data-size
if you desire efficiency over large data-sets you can simply take the ienumerable component and go from there

2882325
erlang	ocaml
erlang is more practical but not quite as amenable to metaprogramming
ocaml is another possible choice but suffers a bit on the practicality front as well

2883063
profiling	debugging
it s quite plausible that profiling in a multithreaded process requires additional locking which slows the multithreaded version down even to the point of making it slower than the non-multithreaded version
that s not debugging symbols which don t affect the code generation that s for profiling which does

2883320
serializable	deserialization
if you re talking about the inbuilt java serializable then you wouldn t even need to retain the file extension
the serialized form has enough information such that the deserialization process will produce an identical object without any additional help

2884654
division	subtract
the easiest division algorithm to implement for large numbers is shift and subtract
if numerator is less than denominator then finish shift denominator as far left as possible while it is still smaller than numerator set bit in quotient for amount shifted subtract shifted denominator from numerator repeat the numerator is now the remainder the shifting need not be literal

2884915
memcpy	strncpy	memmove	strncpy
i pretend memcpy doesn t exist as it can fail if the source and destination areas of memory overlap whereas memmove will get it right regardless. think of bcopy as an archaic variant of the functions
use strncpy only if you know there s enough space for the string - because it does not guarantee null termination and is over-enthusiastic if the destination is way shorter than the source string because it null pads the string to full length

2884915
memmove	strncpy
and if you know the length you can use memmove .
if you know the lengths of the strings memmove is a sensible choice - and nominally faster than strncpy because it does not have to check for nulls as it goes

2885863
firefox	safari
getelementsbytagname was failing on safari but not firefox internet exlporer
turns out the namespace prefix was needed for firefox internet explorer and not for safari so now according to the agent.

2886726
email	dkim
i d recommend dkim support at the mta level so all your server generated email for a given domain is signed by default
unless you have a really good reason to not sign all server generated email for a domain

2886726
email	dkim
unless you have a really good reason to not sign all server generated email for a domain
the best starting point in my googling to get dkim setup on lamp with dkim-milter and sendmail on centos 5.2 in my case was jeff atwood s post about sending emails through code

2888544
xslt	xquery
in xpath 2.x this also means xslt 2.x and xquery 1.x simply escape an apostrophe by entering two adjacent apostrophes escape a quote by entering two adjacent quotes as defined by the xpath 2.0 language
in xpath 1.0 you can use the built-in entities and in xslt 1.0 alternatively you can define your and variables put the content the literal or the literal character in the body of the xsl variable not in the select attribute

2889131
google-chrome	firefox
i m not sure it s possible to control the cursor but you can simply focus the element in google-chrome if your element with id editor has any content then the whole content will be selected
in firefox you don t see a cursor but if you type after loading the page it will appear in the element

2891847
onclick	onsubmit
i m not sure if pressing enter on a textbox will fire onclick on all browsers
you might want to use onsubmit instead of onclick for forms.

2894277
google-chrome	firefox
update mar 2013 in google-chrome version 24.0.1312.52 m and i assume higher versions the ctrl + tab key does not loose focus to flash
unfortunately it is almost a decade old well known firefox bug and now in google-chrome too which is not present in ie

2894530
client-side	server-side
where xss becomes a problem is when people a use it to bypass client-side validation or input filtering or b when people use it to manipulate input fields for example changing the values of option tags in an acl to grant them permissions they shouldn t have
the only way to prevent against these attacks is to sanitize and validate input on the server-side instead of or in addition to client-side validation

2895332
equals	compareto	comparator	comparable
perhaps you were confusing this with treeset java.util.treeset note that the ordering maintained by a set whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if it is to correctly implement the set interface
see comparable or comparator for a precise definition of consistent with equals. this is so because the set interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a treeset instance performs all element comparisons using its compareto or compare method so two elements that are deemed equal by this method are from the standpoint of the set equal

2896245
onchange	onsubmit
user selects from the list the onchange event puts the value into a hidden field the form submits and the value from the hidden field is stored somewhere this would explain why you can submit the form before the value has registered - as the submit happens before the onchange has done its thing
if this is the case and by all means it may not be then you need to check the value of the select list in the onsubmit action of the form to ensure it is correct before the submit occurs

2896679
required	placeholder
one approach to solving this problem is esi - but that required a high level of skill with the technology for anyone involved - and try to restrict peolpe from doing stuff they shouldn t is rather difficult
another approach is for you to provide a set of html fragments which should contain matched tags and no positional font info other than classes and have the customer provide an html page with a set of placeholder where you insert your content customer provides another approach would be to provide the customer with an online thru-the-web editor

2897080
implements	extends
however from the code point of view it is benefitial to share some implementation of list methods as they can be implements in terms of others usually with the same efficiency for example isempty can be implements as
some platforms such as gobject or to some extends haskell - although it is not oo language and many things are totally different alows default implementation of methods in interface which is defining it

2898479
inline	inlining
whether or not the method is defined in place or a hint inline keyword or __forceinline is used the compiler is the only one to decide if the inlining will actually take place and uses complicated heuristics to do so
one particular case however is that it shall not inline a call when a virtual method is invoked using runtime dispatch precisely because runtime dispatch and inlining are not compatible

2899154
comparator	comparable
there are a few subtle points here it doesn t just support - it also supports the older non-generic comparator as a fallback
this means that it can t be expressed just as for example a generic constraint it supports where t is comparable even though clearly isn t comparator or it prevents explosion of generic type constraints by not demanding them - for examle a can provide a sort even though it doesn t insist that all t are sortable

2899154
comparator	comparable
this means that it can t be expressed just as for example a generic constraint it supports where t is comparable even though clearly isn t comparator or it prevents explosion of generic type constraints by not demanding them - for examle a can provide a sort even though it doesn t insist that all t are sortable
you d be amazed how quickly the generic constraints would otherwise accumulate it allows you to pass a comparer into any of the existing apis that demand a comparer when all you have is a type that may be comparable

2899344
apache	nginx
in fact nginx can use select instead of epoll if you compile it with the --with-select_module option and i bet it will still be more efficient than apache
i m not as familiar with apache internals but a quick grep shows it does use select and epoll -- probably when the server is listening to multiple ports interfaces or if it does simultaneous backend requests for a single client

2899344
apache	nginx
i m not as familiar with apache internals but a quick grep shows it does use select and epoll -- probably when the server is listening to multiple ports interfaces or if it does simultaneous backend requests for a single client
incidentally i got started with this stuff trying to write a basic socket server and wanted to figure out how nginx was so freaking efficient

2901111
super	self
from the python online documentation class c b def method self arg super c self .method arg so your exception would be defined as follows
when you call super you need the subclass derived class as the first argument not the main base class

2901281
profiling	debugging
the profiling will help point you to where you re spending the most of your time what the hot path s are and whether or not your spending it in framework sl code or your own code
the basics of profiling are open a visual studio command prompt as admin cd to the directory where your dll and pdb files are typically your debugging folder vsperfclrenv sampleon vsperfcmd -start sample -output somefile.vsp vsperfcmd -globalon vsperfcmd -launch c program files x86 internet explorer iexplore.exe -args vsperfcmd -shutdown vsperfclrenv off you can find detailed instructions on using the profiling on my blog if you find that you are spending time within silverlight track down the code path to see where your code is triggering the expensive calls so that you can then investigate specific solutions based on the cause of the slow down

2902644
scheme	racket
the base language is an eagerly evaluated dynamically typed scheme variant but some notable languages built on top are a lazy scheme and a functional reactive system called father time
an easy way to make a purely functional language in racket is to take the base language and not provide any procedures that mutate state

2903975
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
at least it doesn t in the highly standards compliant opera
update 2 on further testing the scrolling directions in firefox and google-chrome were opposite

2905125
clang	llvm
it s likely that one of the llvm optimization passes in clang analyzes whether or not the callee accesses any allocas or varargs in the caller
if it doesn t the pass marks the call as a tail call and lets another part of the llvm figure out what to do with the tail marker

2906690
junit	jmockit
if the jmockit jar comes after the junit jar in the classpath it might cause problems
as i understand it this exception is thrown when one attempts to call a jmockit method while jmockit has not been properly initialized

2909020
centos	linux
i found this thread looking for an answer for the same longbit error while installing python readline for 32bit python on 64bit centos
the link doesn t have the direct answer so i had to google further for the answer which might be straight-forward for seasoned linux users devs

2909043
ilist	iqueryable
i think iqueryable has deferred the creation until the sort was executed where the ilist did the creation up front and then performed the sort on it
just like the ilist the hashset creation was not deferred and therefore the the big up front cost

2910555
firefox	safari
mobile safari shows these event responses more consistently than firefox
not sure about chrome though it should be pretty close to safari

2911939
tiff	png
er i see you re downloading tiff images
flash by default doesn t support tiff format - it allows only jpg png and gif images

2911939
tiff	png
flash by default doesn t support tiff format - it allows only jpg png and gif images
you re going to have to load it into a bytearray using a urlloader and parse it using some actionscript tiff encoder

2914583
client-side	server-side
if you want to perform a client-side disabling you ll need to use script for that or perhaps use a readonly attribute
specifying is like a server-side disable not a client-side disable

2914583
client-side	server-side
specifying is like a server-side disable not a client-side disable
this is for security purposes so you can truly disable an input element even if the user uses some client-side trickery to re-enable it

2916588
g++	gcc
if g++ isn t available for your version of your distro or if you don t have admin rights then you ll have to download gcc compile it yourself and install it under your home directory
the gcc web site has documentation on how to do so

2917844
voip	sip
now it does get confusing because you ll have voip providers that operate sip proxy servers or sip pstn gateways which make it seem as if sip does operate on a client-server model but it doesn t
so i think the question you are actually wanting to ask is can a sip call between a uac-to-b2bua-to-uas which is actually two separate calls or sip sessions uac-to-uas uac-to-uas have the media bypass the b2bua and instead travel directly between the uac and uas at either end

2919474
mvp	presenter
that isn t to say that you couldn t mimic all this functionality in c++ but on the way you would pass through using a basic mvp c pattern and in most cases that is good enough
mvvm model - view - viewmodel is an adaptation of the mvp model -view - presenter or mvc model - view - controller patterns both of which are very popular design patterns for c++ applications

2919546
lisp	scheme
so in your case in common lisp you don t need all the not null tests
secondly it s common more so in scheme than in lisp to use tail recursive functions rather than accumulator based ones so rather to add two lists without using the library functions you would typically take two lists and return a list whose head is the sum of the heads of the two lists and whose tail is the result of adding the elements of each lists tails

2919795
opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
here s some code i use to add dynamic favicon support to opera firefox and google-chrome
i couldn t get ie or safari working though

2920355
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
html5 video doesn t specify a codec to use some html5 browsers support the h.264 codec google-chrome safari and ie9 others support ogg theora firefox opera google-chrome
if you have a flash video that is in h.264 then in theory it should work as an html5 in google-chrome safari and ie9 but not in other browsers

2920355
h.264	webm
or you could encode in h.264 and ogg to switch between them depending on the browser but your storage and processing requirements go up
to add to the confusion there is a third video codec for html5 called vp8 or webm recently acquired and open-sourced by google this will be supported in firefox opera chrome and ie9 but not safari

2920435
equals	gethashcode
from object.gethashcode on msdn a hash function must have the following properties if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values

2920435
equals	gethashcode
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values
in other words your equals is written wrong

2921155
equals	gethashcode
if you override equals you should override gethashcode from msdn it is recommended that any class that overrides equals also override system.object.gethashcode. the two functions should match in the sense that if two objects are equals they should have the same hash value
that doesn t mean that if two objects have the same hash they should be equals

2921340
prepare	execute
if c3p0 doesn t cache prepare statements then the driver will just see the application preparing a statement executing it and then closing it again
looks like the jdbc driver has a threshold setting for avoiding the prepare execute server overhead in the case where the application always does this

2923437
persistent	transient
persistent makes a transient instances persistent
however it does not guarantee that the identifier value will be assigned to the persistent instances immediately the assignment might happen at flush time. persistent also guarantees that it will not execute an insert statement if it is called outside of transaction boundaries

2923712
implements	extends
then have each of your implements classes extends abstracta
also i would wonder why you have a single interface with all these methods when they aren t intended all to be implemented by each class that implements the interface

2926668
factors	mean
actually due to the jon skeet factors it s more like 65
but that doesn t mean you should throw in the towel

2927184
serializable	deserialization
the complement to serializable is deserialization which takes the serializable data and reconstitutes the original object representation
serializable which is not specific to .net is the process of converting an in-memory object into some form of bits and bytes that are suitable for transmission over the internet or storage on disk

2927816
exponent	modulo
you are not attempting to encrypt the private exponent which is the actual secret part
the private exponent is always smaller than the modulo so you should be able to encrypt it using the raw rsa operation if you make sure to remove the prepended zero

2929214
ubuntu	debian
however the ubuntu python packaging guide is pretty useful
for simple packages ones easy to describe to setuptools the steps are pretty simple once you have a debian control structure set up run setup.py --sdist --prune and also make sure to set dist-dir to something reasonable invoke dpkg-buildpackage with the proper options for your package probably -b at least you will need a debian rules file for buildpackage to function from but luckily the work is done for you if you use cdbs you ll want something very similar to if you re not using distutils you might want to take a look at the debianpython policy page on the wiki under cdbs + the hard way

2929484
hex	binary
why not represent the string not as binary but as hex and then you can store each four-binary-digit section as a single character
then finding a single group would be a single call to charat and you d just have to expand to the binary form via a lookup table

2930486
postgresql	mysql
postgresql doesn t so you d have to use
you want to use having not where when you re acting on aggregation i think mysql allows you to column aliases in the having clause .

2935145
opera	safari
europe daylight time whereas opera just coughs up 29 05 2010 15 03 46 which as it doesn t state the timezone at all is uselessly ambiguous
ie is similarly terse and safari states no timezone either

2935622
udp	tcp
you say you are sending files over udp yet connecting to the sever with tcp - the two protocols are mutually exclusive over a single connection
udp does not provide any mechanism for detecting packet loss that s what tcp is for so by default you won t be able to work out whether packets have been lost. you should use tcp for sending files as it manages sending resending packets for you

2935622
udp	tcp
udp does not provide any mechanism for detecting packet loss that s what tcp is for so by default you won t be able to work out whether packets have been lost. you should use tcp for sending files as it manages sending resending packets for you
as stated in the air serversocket documentation all packets sent over tcp are guaranteed to arrive within reason any lost packets are retransmitted

2937484
uiview	uiwindow
if it still isn t on top you can use bringsubviewtofront on the uiwindow remember a uiwindow is a uiview to bring it to the top of that level
make your special view its own uiwindow

2939310
udp	tcp
it s easy to run a socket server on a worker role but only tcp not udp
you can start your own process from the worker role s onstart method you can do it from the run method too but once you hit the run state your role is seen by the load balancer and outside world so you might get tcp traffic before your socket server is running

2939386
ssl	https
the gevent.wsgi module does not have built-in ssl support
if you re using it put it behind nginx which would receive request over https but proxy them to your gevent app using non-encrypted http

2941327
implements	extends
they have only implements bounding box analysis and it is not implements for most spatial functions
i would recommend using either postgis or perhaps spatialcouch or extends mongodb

2941964
postgresql	mysql
postgresql has full support for utf8
mysql doesn t support the complete utf8-encoding currently mysql support for utf-8 does not include four-byte sequences

2944003
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari
unfortunately this doesn t quite fly with ie opera google-chrome or safari
not sure why because in opera google-chrome or safari there is something associated with the collapse and getrangeat methods

2944003
opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
to get a flavor of what you selected works in ff3 safari opera and google-chrome selectobj.collapsetostart
works in ff3 safari google-chrome but not opera selectobj.collapse document.body 0

2944441
strcpy	malloc
strcpy myvalue invalue function copies the contents of the string invalue appended with the string terminated control char 0 to the memory block allocated by malloc
once strlen invalue returns the length of the string excluding 0 control char the area to be allocated by malloc strlen invalue sizeof char is not large enough to receive strcpy myvalue invalue

2944829
multiplying	multiplication
in c-ish pseudocode using a row-vector convention a sequence of transformations can be composed by multiplying the matrices for each together in turn
note that matrix multiplication is not commutative so the order in which you multiply is important

2944829
multiplying	multiplication
note that matrix multiplication is not commutative so the order in which you multiplying is important
in turn this means it is important whether you are multiplying row vectors on the left or columns on the right

2947182
postgresql	mysql
when i get a chance to use a good relational engine such as postgresql i believe i m overall more productive than i would be with any orm in between incuding sqlalchemy despite its many admirable qualities
however i have to admit that the case is different when the relational engine is not all that good i ve never liked mysql or when porting to non-relational deployments is an important consideration

2953026
intersect	contains
general overview 1 segment-plane intersection determine if the line segment connecting points 1 and 2 intersect the plane contains the polygon
if it doesn t then it will never intersect the polygon and you re done

2953786
junit	testng
see distributed junit overview
just in case this is not exactly what you re asking for but testng can run tests in parallel thi would already make your build faster

2953999
jruby	mri	jruby	rubinius
of course one of the main points of jruby is to integrate the java and ruby object models as closely as possible so we are actually getting both java and ruby methods here but by rejecting all methods with characters that are unusual or plain illegal in java we get a reasonably clean list and the remaining ruby methods are not that hard to spot
looksee patches the interpreter which is the reason why it only works on mri and yarv and not on jruby xruby ironruby ruby.net rubinius tinyrb rubygolightly macruby hotruby blueruby cardinal maglev smallruby red sun and all the other implementations

2954290
gridview	sqldatasource
edit based on user comment well for what you are doing i wouldn t really recommend a sqldatasource as it is really meant to be bound to a control such as a gridview or repeater
however if you want to use the sqldatasource you will need to bind to a dataview in your code-behind

2954764
division	exponent
division per se isn t so bad
however standard ieee 754 fp types allow for a greater negative negative range of exponent than positive due to denormalized numbers

2956008
directx	gdi
windows forms is actually one more native windows api wrapper based on gdi it is designed better than mfc and much easier to use. however microsoft considers windows forms as old technology and promotes wpf which is based on directx and not gdi
directx is native api for windows vista and later

2956644
comparator	comparable
most places where you can specify a comparator also have a version without using a comparator at all in which case it uses the natural order it expects all objects to implement comparable and uses comparator
so the usualy solution to this is to not specify a comparator at all

2956644
comparator	comparable
so the usualy solution to this is to not specify a comparator at all
if you absolutely need it the google collections as well as guava which is a superset of the google collections provides ordering.natural which returns a ordering object that represent the natural order as defined by the comparable interface

2958308
operands	scalar
the || operator puts its left-hand operands in boolean scalar context c-style logical or binary || performs a short-circuit logical or operation
that is if the left operands is true the right operands is not even evaluated

2958308
operands	scalar
that is if the left operands is true the right operands is not even evaluated
scalar or list context propagates down to the right operands if it is evaluated

2958531
jpql	hql
examples jpa 1.0 doesn t offer such a mechanism so if you re using jpa 1.0 this won t be possible using standard jpql
if you don t mind using proprietary hql then you can use the special property class likewise the special property class accesses the discriminator value of an instance in the case of polymorphic persistence

2960474
filewriter	bufferedwriter
in what respects of the work to be done by the java writer itself eg make the system call to write to disk in the case of a filewriter or akin and close the filehandle yes you can assume that when close returns it has already done all its work
a writer or bufferedwriter is a black box that writes a stream of characters somewhere not necessarily to the disk

2961363
equals	compareto
in both cases be sure to also implement equals in a manner that is consistent with the other method
hashset is based on hashcode not on compareto

2961510
equals	compareto
then it finds the corresponding bucket for that hash code and iterates through each object in that bucket using the equals method to see if any identical objects already exist in the set
your debugger is not breaking on compareto because it is never used with hashset

2962227
serializable	deserialization
it has only one method for serializable and assumes a specific constructor for deserialization as constructor cannot part of an interface
you mention the serializable attribute so i assume that you are talking about binary serializable

isnull	nvl
isnull may be used for sql server
roman you need to do a full outer join on your select so that for any given event type id and i am assuming that you will have 0 or 1 row in both your past and future tables for any particular event type id you will output a single row and the appropriate null and non-null dates. the first answer will not combine the dates from the two sources into a single row which is what i believe you asked for. the second answer was closer but would only work for rows with both a past and future date ie one in each table due to the inner join. example note that the nvl function is for oracle and will use the first non-null it sees

2963859
super	self
if it s local then what is the point of self super init in init
self is not a local variable

2964964
perforce	cvs
subversion cvs perforce and sourcesafe are not distributed
furthermore perforce and sourcesafe are neither free nor open source

2965001
bazaar	git
git is something that you can add to the list but it s support on windows is not as good as that of bazaar and mercurial
i use git myself but i develop exclusively on gnu linux and so can t comment on windows support

2965450
soappy	suds
i am not sure how to do this in soappy but i do know how to do it in suds
suds does the same thing as soappy but it is newer and is still supported

2967306
expression-blend	silverlight
i m not sure exactly what you re asking but here are two answers if you re looking for an application to create a mock-up design of a silverlight application i d recommend using expression-blend 3 version 3 or greater with sketch flow
sketch flow allows you to create a real sketch of a user interface that can later be turned into a silverlight application

2968681
hex	binary
oh and by the way it s not hex data
if you re still at the point where you refer to any non-human readable data as hexadecimal which is a number system delving head-first into a binary data format that involves complex decoding encoding algorithms might be a bit too much for you for the time being

2969382
jar	war
after you have this class in place you have to jar it and put that jar into the tomcat lib folder
for obvious reasons it cannot go together with war file

2971444
opencv	emgucv
if not it means that opencv or bitmap or both copy provided memory block and possible solution if it exists is definetly not worth efforts
following is just a theory and might not work i m not very experienced with opencv emgucv both system.drawing.bitmap and emgu.cv.image have constructors taking scan0 as an argument

2972050
postgresql	mysql
hibernate only enforces indexcreation for mysql not for postgresql oracle etc
mysql doesn t allow foreign keys without an index other databases don t have this restriction

2972158
floating-point	fractions
read the floating-point guide for more information
if you want decimal precision double is the wrong target type as it is a binary format that cannot accurately represent most round decimal fractions

2973037
gdi	direct2d
i think it s unlikely you ll find something that performs faster than gdi on windows since it has kernel-level support which is something open source solutions will not have
you might want to also look into opengl or direct2d direct3d since these too have direct access to the frame buffer

2974614
google-chrome	firefox
in ie and google-chrome event is resolving to window.event
firefox doesn t have this property and instead provides an event to an event handler function by passing it as a parameter

2978867
implements	extends
this expression instantiates a new object from an unnamed and previously undefined class which automatically implements the interface named interfacename and automatically extends the class named object
the class can explicitly implement one and only one interface and cannot extends any class other than object

2979455
lisp	scheme
note that modern lisp are not dynamic-binding-only like emacs lisp
common lisp supports both forms of binding though the lexical one is used much more the scheme specification doesn t even specify dynamic binding only lexical one though many implementations support both

2981041
passenger	webrick
for rails have a look at passenger
i can t speak for python but webrick is not meant to be used for an in-production application you didn t mention if this application was in production though you did say external access

2981199
dictionary	map
in other words it doesn t really have a first item. of course if you iterate through the items using a for or for each loop one of the items has to be accessed first so you could do something like this however the dictionary class has no contract about the order of the items and even if the order were predictable alphabetical keys first assigned first returned etc i would consider it an implementation detail that s subject to change between player versions
in addition the class doesn t expose any internal map that you could access

2982312
postgresql	mysql
i am using postgresql and i prefer writing the db initiation myself i want to have 100 control and sql is as explicit as it gets.
i use schemaspy to generate the er diagrams. i have had no issues with multiple schemas and foreign keys across schemas - not sure how that works in mysql

2983165
strncpy	malloc
strncpy does not nul-terminate the result if the number of characters copied is equal to the length
and since your memory comes straight from malloc there may not be a nul-terminator there already

2983811
ssl	https
if you need highest security you have to use ssl because jcryption offers no way of authentication
please don t tell me to use https it s not enough to ensure the data communication on a client - server application well sorry but that s exactly what i m going to do

2984268
division	modulo
there are ways around this that actually allow use of all n slots and eliminate the division implicit in taking the index modulo n
given an implementation of circular queues wherein the begin and end are kept as indicies modulo the size of the allocated underlying array say n it is necessary that the actual capacity of the queue not the array be less than n elsewise the begin and end indicies will be equal and there would be ambiguity between empty and full

2985456
ubuntu	debian
in ubuntu it is a bit easier to install packages for java development but it doesn t really matter that much
remember that ubuntu is based on debian so it works the same

2985988
jsf	stripes	jsf	wicket
netbeans is just an ide and let you use whatever framework you want jsf 2.0 wicket struts 2 stripes spring mvc your own poison
of course one could say that netbeans promotes and supports jsf 2.0 but this doesn t mean you can t use another framework just add the required libraries to your project

2987555
testdriven.net	xunit.net
an alternative for visualstudio integration is testdriven.net also providing a context menu
for nunit you can also use the runners that come with nunit itself there is a gui-runner and a commandline runner . for mstest you can use the native visualstudio integration for running tests however i find that one a bit clumsy . xunit.net also comes with its runners however i am not familiar with them

2989317
opera	google-chrome
however the size of this storage area can be customized by the user so a 5mb storage area is not guaranteed nor is it implied and the user agent opera for example may only provide 3mb - but only time will tell.
quoting from the wikipedia article on web storage web storage can be viewed simplistically as an improvement on cookies providing much greater storage capacity 10 mb per origin in google-chrome mozilla firefox and opera

2991421
implements	extends
a classcastexception usually mean that either encoderimpl does not implements encodeinterface or the .jar on the client-side and server-side are different resulting in two versions of the class to be deployed which are considered different
few hints check that you implements the interface encoderimpl extends unicastremoteobject implements encodeinterface add a version id to your class as supported by java serialization clean rebuild and redeploy and restart everything to make sure the same jar are deployed everywere and that there isn t a server running somewhere already hope it helps otherwise provide more info in the question

2991627
antialiasing	transparent
antialiasing cannot work when on a transparent background
the colors used for the antialiasing pixels will not blend the letter shape into the background when the text is displayed with a different background

2992055
postgresql	mysql
use current_timestamp is ansi standard and works on oracle mysql postgresql sql server.
here s the create table statement converted create table example id integer primary key from varchar 255 not null default 0 message text not null lastactivity timestamp default null read integer not null i can t find anything about postgresql allowing character sets per table only that you would set utf8 support using the unicode keyword when creating the database postgre like oracle uses sequences for auto_increment behavior create sequence example_seq start 1

2994324
awt	swing
features awt components do not support features like icons and tool-tips
swing pros portability pure java design provides for fewer platform specific limitations

2994324
awt	swing
behavior pure java design allows for a greater range of behavior for swing components since they are not limited by the native peers that awt uses
features swing supports a wider range of features like icons and pop-up tool-tips for components

2995604

2996677
ssl	https
443 https gets a little more tricky as you typically cannot have more than one site use 443 even if you are using host headers there are exceptions like wildcard ssl certs
this is due to iis not being able to read the host headers and know which ssl cert to use to decrypt them since they are encrypted

2996747
punctuation	words
and if you need to do this for european languages only just search for space or punctuation marks so std string find is more then fine
3 character or now code point counting looking at utfcpp thx characters are not code points for example a hebrew words shalom -- ש לו ם consists of 4 characters and 6 unicode points where two code points are used for vowels

2997377
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this question may be applicable problems with jquery getjson using local files in google-chrome
this code works for me in safari and surprisingly firefox the reason it doesn t work in some browsers is likely due to the fact that you re hosting from the filesystem assuming you are

2997377
firefox	safari
this code works for me in safari and surprisingly firefox the reason it doesn t work in some browsers is likely due to the fact that you re hosting from the filesystem assuming you are
chrome and firefox tend to give trouble when accessing the filesystem via ajax request due to same origin policy

2997863
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
if a caller passes null in some parameter for which null values are prohibited convention dictates nullpointerexception be thrown rather than illegalargumentexception
a nullpointerexception isn t reserved for just when you access members of a null reference

2998156
imperative	declarative
the same result in an imperative style would be in this example we expressed no timeless static logical relationship between the input and the output we changed memory addresses manually until one of them held the desired result
it should be evident that all languages allow declarative semantics to some extend but not all allow imperative some purely declarative languages permit side effects and mutation altogether

2998156
imperative	declarative
it should be evident that all languages allow declarative semantics to some extend but not all allow imperative some purely declarative languages permit side effects and mutation altogether
declarative languages are often said to specify what must be done as opposed to how to do it i think that is a misnomer declarative programs still specify how one must get from input to output but in another way the relationship you specify must be effectively computable important term look it up if you don t know it

2998544
cpython	ironpython
if you re interested in cpython specifically it compiles the source files into a python-specific lower-level form known as bytecode does so automatically when needed when there is no bytecode file corresponding to a source file or the bytecode file is older than the source or compiled by a different python version usually saves the bytecode files to disk to avoid recompiling them in the future
otoh ironpython will typically compile to clr codes saving them to disk or not depending and jython to jvm codes saving them to disk or not -- it will use the .class extension if it does save them

2999058
nfa	dfa
this is not a traditional nfa because traditional nfas don t have anti-accept states
however we can use the traditional nfa- dfa algorithm to convert this into a traditional dfa

2999058
nfa	dfa
the algorithm works like usual where we simulate multiple runs of the nfa by making our dfa states correspond to subsets of the nfa states we could possibly be in
the one twist is that we slightly augment the rule for deciding if a dfa state is an accept final state or not
