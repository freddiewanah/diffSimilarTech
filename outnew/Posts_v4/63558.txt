cvs	svn
you cannot have the same working tree in both git and cvs svn though the ui may seem to imply so
i we tried this during an initial let s try git and still use cvs as a backup plan phase

4000159
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari
your best bet is to write code focused on the standards-compliant browsers google-chrome safari opera and firefox if you re not doing any super-crazy html5 you ll find all these browsers act pretty much the same
as a bonus mobile browsers are generally based on webkit or opera so you ll also have the mobile market covered

4000976
portrait	landscape
it is not clear what you are trying to accomplish with your real app but the recommended practice is to lay out your views for portrait orientation and then set their autoresizing properties to handle the automatic rotation whether it occur immediately after app launch or later
i think the launching in landscape mode of the ios application programming guide mostly explains what is happening with your test application applications in ios normally launch in portrait mode to match the orientation of the home screen

4002330
implements	extends
furthermore a java class may implements and an interface may extends any number of interfaces
however an interface may not implements an interface

4005055
multiplication	exponent
if the exponent is 0.5 you should use sqrt and if the exponent is a small integer 2 3 4 expressing the formula with multiplication is faster but less readable
if you want to implement fast exponentiation with an integer exponent the square-and-multiply algorithm and not a simple loop might be what you want

4006430
opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
try navigator.appversion i have windows 7 here and the navigator.appversion returns a string containing nt 6.1 in these browsers google-chrome opera safari ie9 beta
only firefox does not return that info in that string btw winxp is nt 5.1 vista is nt 6.0 .

4006604
inline	inlining
little benefit on a good compiler for a modern platform inline will affect only a very few functions
it is just a hint to the compiler modern compilers are fairly good at making this decision themselves and the the overhead of a function call has become rather small often the main benefit of inlining is not to reduce call overhead but opening up further optimizations

4010382
lxml	elementtree
but the way the elementtree api supports namespaces i think is horribly ugly requiring one to use string concatenation every time an element in a particular namespace is created here s how you create an element with a namespace in .net s system.linq.xml dom here s how you create an element in a namespace in lxml i m not seeing horrible ugliness here
in fact the developers of the .net api have bent over backwards creating base classes that support operator overloading to make it possible for their api to handle namespaces as intuitively as lxml s does

4011595
comparator	comparable
the first solution is to have this data object implement comparable then when you do the queue will order items by the order defined by the comparator method
the problem with this solution is that if you want the ordering to be only on the integer then either equals method and your comparator method will not be consistent or your equals method will not be correct

4011595
comparator	comparable
a better solution would be to use the priorityqueue constructor that takes a comparator
in this case data wouldn t have to implement comparable

4013992
factors	mean
whether it is the database layer depends on a few factors
security inside the database is possible but tends to be expensive - by which i mean less connection pooling if you use connection identity overheads if you have to encrypt the data connection but it is an option albeit it one generally reserved for the most security-critical applications where even dbas aren t allowed to read the data

4016183
inline	inlining
however if the above calls are inline the compiler will immediately be able to eliminate the branching
essentially in the above case inlining allows the compiler to interpret the function argument as a compile-time constant if the parameter is a compile-time constant - something that is generally not possible with non-inlined functions

4016183
inline	inlining
again the possible examples are numerous all of them stemming from the basic fact that inline calls are immersed into the specific caller s context thus enabling various inter-context optimizations which would not be possible with non-inlined calles
with inlining you basically get many individual versions of your original function each version is tailored and optimized individually for each specific caller context

4016524
prepare	execute
not a isolated single command in the middle of a prepare batch
if you get rid of them and think in terms of execute whatever you have prepared in the batch it might help you to understand the problem better

4016652
udp	tcp
this is not related to udp
epipe only happens for stream file descriptors - unix pipes and tcp sockets

4017392
inline	inlining	inline-functions	inlining
compilers are able to inline-functions automatically or don t inline-functions users marked as inline even though they could
some say that inlining should be left to the compiler completely and we shouldn t even bother marking functions as inline

4017509
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
in fact this is how uiviewcontroller work
but be aware that while standard apple controllers like uinavigationcontroller know how to deal with the status bar they don t know anything about what you want to do so they re going to be confused more often than not

4017557
inline	inlining
i only ever explicitly inline functions that comprise of a single statement not involving a further function call and that is more for speed of development of class methods than for performance
and worth the bloat of having it inlined it is not always the case that inlining results in larger code

4017557
inline	inlining
and worth the bloat of having it inline it is not always the case that inlining results in larger code
for example a simple data access function such as will result in significantly more instruction cycles as a function call than as an in-line and such functions are best suited to inlining

4018265
g++	gcc
this doesn t provoke any warning for me with g++ -pedantic
you could even do this in the default version by recognising gcc which certainly is messing around with #defines but again not in a way that s at all unusual for a multi-platform product

4019323
svg	vml
clipping paths are available in svg but internet explorer doesn t support svg
instead it uses the propietary microsoft vml standard so in summary imho raphael only can be inside the intersection of svg operations and vml operations

4023707
apache	nginx
i wound up with nginx serving static resources and proxying framework requests to apache and mod_python -- if i recall correctly my app had a mod_python dependency
here are the resources which came in handy for me configuration example from the nginx wiki another django - nginx - fastcgi configuration example for comparison flup proxying nginx to apache assumes you already have apache serving django successfully so maybe not so useful for you page caching with memcached - i found a lot of tutorials for django and memcached

4024307
multiplying	multiplication
c allows you to multiplying a boolean temporary with another number but the result is not defined except insofar as result 0 the bool was false or the number was zero
in ada regarding blah 2 n the language does not define a multiplication operator on type boolean

4025108
perforce	svn
but perforce would require a connecion to the server for every operation
svn checkout is not the same in perforce

4025424
matlab	simulink
afaik matlab allows to process only one picture frame at a time surely you could elaborate an algorithm to compute a stream but using simulink you can process the stream directly
on the other hand i found aforge a lot friendlier and easier to use since you can easily adjust the processing parameters from a gui not so fast easy to do in matlab simulink

4025947
aggregate-functions	sum
for doctrine 1.2 looking at your code i m guessing your having clause is referencing something that s not in a group by or the result of an aggregate-functions
try something like this you re grouping by p.id so sum p.nr_of_bookings will be equal to p.nr_bookings

4026978
scheme	racket
the syntax for calling a function in scheme is function-name arguments not function-name arguments
when you write racket first evaluates get-artifacts which evaluates to itself

4028440
punctuation	words
there are also a variety of sentence-ending punctuation marks
however there are also exceptions to the exception if the next words is capitalized and is not a proper noun then dr

4028890
swt	swing
i use eclipse as a fairly accessible ide and all swt applications i ve looked at with the exception of uml editors are fairly accessible with jaws and no customization
as a jaws user who s had to fight with many a swing interface i do not believe this is possible and you should stick with your solution

4029711
qgraphicsview	qwidget
you can put the following code in the constructor of your window containing the qgraphicsview named view and it will add two buttons to a layout that will keep them anchored at the bottom right of the view it shouldn t be too much trouble to add two more buttons and two more spacers to achieve a button in each corner of the window
making standard qwidget controls transparent can be a bit tricky especially buttons

4031037
strdup	malloc
you can use standard strdup to get the same functionality end edition by doing this will point to a dynamic allocated memory space that will be available outside your function - unless you free it
if you don t want to use glib then in this case mind that the malloc is of sizeof char because a string is an array of chars not of as you had before

4034874
lisp	scheme
i would reccomend chicken scheme if you re interested in learning some lisp
it s got very good documentation is actively developed works on a variety of platforms and has a great extension system called eggs that contain a lot of libraries for actaul coding that scheme doesn t directly specify

4036627
factors	mean
it s also important that pagerank doesn t represent all factors only the ones that google categorizes as popularity
and by good i mean other factors that just have nothing to do with popularity

4040692
rubymine	radrails
in last 3 months i have tried radrails netbeans and rubymine and finally settled on rubymine not so much for features but for responsiveness and stability reasons
in terms of features rubymine has slightly better code completion debugging and code navigation but only ruby beginners like myself need them most

4042107
udp	tcp
if you want to use some application to filter http requests your application should deal with application-layer information not network-layer like tcp udp
tcp and http are protocols in different networking stack layer

4050785
postgresql	mysql
feature no 1 firebird required 0 administration and is simpler to use than postgresql think of sqlite like easy of use with oracle postgresql like features 2.firebird does have embedded mode and is fully multi threaded in 2.5 3.and yes firebird is fully multithreaded where postgresql is not so we are ahead in this area with at least 2 or more years all backends running as threads in a single process not wanted this eliminates the process protection we get from the current setup
thread creation is usually the same overhead as process creation on modern systems so it seems unwise to use a pure threaded model and mysql and db2 have demonstrated that threads introduce as many issues as they solve

4052372
memcpy	malloc
therefore memcpy is not copying that so the resulting string is not terminated
the same applies with your malloc s

4053245
vb.net	vb6
vb.net does not use control arrays by default
this is because events are handled differently from vb6

4054212
queue	fifo
this approach also supports the client and server queue not being on the same message engine
it supports accessing the queues in fifo mode which should be more performant

4056088
junit	mockito
i ve used the following in combination with junit to facilitate testing mockito for mocking objects - hamcrest assertions for more readable assertions - twip for parameterized testing the junit stuff isn t the greatest in fact testng does this better as well -
junit and testng are the main unit test frameworks

4057346
wildfly	jboss
see also the balusc code - jsf 2.2 tutorial with eclipse and wildfly - install jboss tools el proposals autocomplete code assist in facelets with eclipse show jsf el call hierarchy in eclipse properties of new tags using composite component are not displayed by eclipse auto complete shortcurt
install the most recent jboss tools

4057362
ubuntu	linux
you can use cygwin to install a bash shell for you i think it has perl that you can choose to install but if not you can use another way is that you can try virtual machine and install ubuntu on it
it can be a lot of fun to see a linux box running like a real machine on your windows

4057941
innodb	myisam
rewriting mysql select to reduce time and writing tmp to disk full sql script here innodb implementation recommended myisam implementation not recommended
if i understood your question properly then you could use one of the following two methods innodb vs myisam

4059119
mp3	wav
but the class only provider a raw audio.we could not encode the audio file to arm or mp3 etc
rehersalaudiorecord contains some very well written code for recording in uncompressed wav

4059320
cassini	iis
processmodelinfo.gethistory but unfortunately it s not available on cassini process metrics are available only when the asp.net process model is enabled
when running on versions of iis 6 or newer in worker process isolation mode this feature is not supported

4059371
matlabpool	parfor
basically instead of writing you write then you use matlabpool to create a number of workers you can have a maximum of 8 on your local machine with the toolbox and tons on a remote cluster if you also have a distributed computing server license and you run the code and see nice speed gains when your iterations are run by 8 cores instead of one
even though the parfor route is the easiest it may not work right out of the box since you might do your indexing wrong or you may be referencing an array in a problematic way etc

4059486
dictionary	map
you should use map instead of dictionary dictionary is obsolete
with map you can use containskey instead which in my opinion is more readable in my experience this is not slower than your approach despite the apparent double access to the map

4059569
postgresql	mysql
i strongly suggest you to start with postgresql then you can learn what real sql is
then you can decide if mysql is sufficient or not

4062092
trie	tree
there are a number of trie variations worth looking into as well
i m not positive i understood your problem correctly but it sounds like a prefix tree aka trie might be quite handy here

4063067
implements	extends
extra processing checking invariants or stuff like that that does not change the interface can be implements using the decorator pattern
the difference between the two is that the decorator pattern is intended to extends functionality where with the strategy pattern you can actually change the implementation

4063162
setinterval	settimeout
to be clear this happens because you re calling it each time it runs with normal one-time usage this wouldn t be an issue there s nothing inherently evil with setinterval
use settimeout instead of setinterval here like this settimeout cycle 8000

4063162
setinterval	settimeout
use settimeout instead of setinterval here like this settimeout cycle 8000
with setinterval you re queuing more and more stacks of the function each time rather than calling it once 8 seconds later we re queueing another interval timer to run every 8 seconds so you re getting this 8 seconds 1 run 16 seconds 2 runs 24 seconds 4 runs 32 seconds 8 runs ...uh oh with settimeout you ll get just one run when the timer is up not an additional run every 8 seconds

4063486
postgresql	mysql
some dbmses such as sql server 2005 postgresql 8.4 and oracle 11g 1 support recursive queries with common table expressions using the with keyword
this feature allows recursive queries to be written easily but sqlite and mysql do not support recursive queries yet

4063714
spaces	delimiter
well one obvious candidate is that this white spaces isn t actually a tab but spaces
try fmt delimiter

4065296
realloc	malloc
if it returns null the original memory stays unchanged so you must always use a temporary variable for the return value of realloc
an example will clarify this a bit points of interest realloc syntax is similar to malloc s no need for extra casts etc. and after realloc you need to produce the same steps for the new objects as you did after malloc do note that this is not really an array of structs but more an array of pointers to structs - or even an array of arrays of struct if you wish

4066285
webclient	httpwebrequest
webclient httpwebrequest and the ui thread on windows phone 7
it is asynchronous but it s recommended not to do any non trivial processing using webclient since that work will be done on the ui thread as indy rightly points out

4066332
strtol	strcpy
you can pass it as an argument to any function that doesn t try to modify it printf strtol strchr etc.
you cannot write to it though so if you need to modify the contents for any reason either directly or through a function like strtok or strcpy you ll have to create a local copy and manipulate that

4067362
udp	tcp
if you have different connection type like udp tcp com port .
using interface is good for manageability but in the case which you have just one connection there is no need to use interface also i think using static and singleton is not useful here you should have a service for your tcp connection to always keep it up and when you got disconnected you should be able to repair connection

4068641
ssl	https
this is what you get out of a classic ssl tls tunnel a https url in a web context
if you cannot establish a ssl tls tunnel with server authentication the server has a certificate which the client can verify then you may want to resort to an authentication protocol with a challenge the server sends a sequence of random bytes the challenge and the client responds with a hash value computed over the concatenation of the password and the challenge

4069980
firefox	safari
ext js comes included with a debugging console you need to add debug.js and call ext.log blah to bring it up this will provide functionality that is similar to firebug on firefox but not as extensive still its useful for supplementing the poor development tools that come pre-installed with ie 8
firebug as ergo mentioned here is the most powerful of the browser-based development tools it allows step-by-step debugging however the latest versions of chrome and safari also come installed with develoment tools that are useful but not as much as firebug

4070043
strncmp	strcmp
make certain you use strncmp and not strcmp
strcmp is profoundly unsafe

4070435
printwriter	bufferedwriter
printwriter doesn t know if you re writing to a file a socket the console a string etc
so the right way to do what you want is simply interesting side note if you wrap an outputstream in a printwriter java automatically inserts a bufferedwriter in the middle

4070435
printwriter	bufferedwriter
so the right way to do what you want is simply interesting side note if you wrap an outputstream in a printwriter java automatically inserts a bufferedwriter in the middle
but if you wrap a writer in a printwriter it does not

4070435
printwriter	bufferedwriter
but if you wrap a writer in a printwriter it does not
so nothing is gained by saying just leave off the bufferedwriter and the outputstreamwriter you get them for free anyway

4071588
ssl	https
if you stop reading now you only need to remember one thing ssl tls is not computationally expensive any more
one false sense of security when using https only for login pages is that you leave the door open to session hijacking admittedly it s better than sending the username password in clear anyway

4072290
hex	binary
the info_hash parameter is not a hex string
it s a pure binary string so yes you will have to url-encode many of the bytes in it

4072636
implements	extends
for example you might test a public method or property that is implements in the base class and isn t marked as abstract
so you will have to create a class that extends the generic base class baseclass t and a different class that extends baset

4072723
fgets	strtol	fgets	atoi
first of all you ll need to read the input as a string preferably using fgets
if you aren t allowed to use atoi you probably aren t allowed to use strtol either

4074034
jar	war
however if a persistence unit of the same name is defined by an ejb-jar war or application jar file within the ear the persistence unit of that name defined at ear level will not be visible to the components defined by that ejb-jar war or application jar file unless the persistence unit reference uses the persistence unit name # syntax to specify a path name to disambiguate the reference
when the # syntax is used the path name is relative to the referencing application component jar file

4074090
profiling	instrumentation
also note that you can use instrumentation profiling with vs2008 on a virtual machine although sample profiling is not supported
i m not sure if it helps but the profiler in visual studio 2010 premium and ultimate does support profiling on virtual machines

4074938
mef	prism
well keep in mind that mef won t be officially part of prism until version 4.0 is released it is in ctp right now but they can definitely be used together
on the other hand mvvm is not strictly part of prism it is possible to use prism and mvvm but it is possible to use prism and not use mvvm and vice-versa

4075843
bash	subshell
if not you may need to use an option perhaps -i - or some more serious magic possibly even process substitution in bash
you could also use parentheses to run a subshell note that the semi-colon after cat is necessary with braces and not necessary with parentheses and a space is necessary after the open brace - such are the mysteries of shell scripting

4077102
google-chrome	firefox
i you load the page in google-chrome upload an image and hit ctrl+shift+j you will see the error message not allowed to load local resource on the error console
you can do somthing similar in firefox with firebug. ie won t show the local resources unless your internet security level is set to medium

4077229
inline	inlining
that is how the constant pragma defines constants would be inline if it is seen before its first use
otherwise perl allows subroutines to be dynamically redefined at run time so inlining is not suitable

4077247
innodb	myisam
for all operations where transactions are needed just stick with innodb
however myisam can really speed things up when transactions are not needed in certain situations - and requires less disk space and ram compared to innodb

4078122
png	ico
png has 2 advantages it has smaller size and it s more widely used and supported except in case favicons . as mentioned before ico can have multiple size icons which is useful for desktop applications but not too much for websites. i would recommend you to put a favicon.ico in the root of your application
an if you have access to the head of your website pages use the tag to point to a png file. so older browser will show the favicon.ico and newer ones the png

4087809
erd	entity-relationship	erd	diagram
some tools support an erd dialect that allows specifying additional attributes for any relationship in a rounded box arrowing to the relationship arrow but this is imo not common practice
before i design the database i want to model the problem as an entity-relationship diagram using chen s notation

4090060
webclient	httpwebrequest
when you use webclient you re actually making the request through the browser s http stack and therefore get all of the automatic cookie handling
when you use httpwebrequest you re using silverlight s http stack and therefore cannot use the cookies sent to the browser

4092349
nexus	artifactory
edit this is not true anymore as of 2017 nexus gives a much larger support for other build tools end of edit artifactory provides an awesome hudson teamcity and bamboo integration and gradle ivy support
so while nexus gives you nothing once you step out of sonatype comfort zone maven m2eclipse artifactory embraces and collaborates with all major build tools

4092349
nexus	artifactory
so while nexus gives you nothing once you step out of sonatype comfort zone maven m2e artifactory embraces and collaborates with all major build tools
in fact being able to deploy build artifacts from hudson when job has finished and not by mvn deploy is a huge difference artifactory hudson plugin makes an atomic-like deploy of all artifacts at once only when a build job finished successfully

4092863
postgresql	mysql
other free databases like postgresql sql server express or oracle express might be worth considering as an alternative for sake of better data type support
i had originally suggested time and datetime data types but was unaware that mysql does not store microseconds in a column of any temporal data type ie time datetime etc

4093138
client-side	server-side
another possibility if you not fussy about users modifying things but do require ample space although may not work for all browsers is to create a html5 local database or client-side storage
in this manner you are both eliminating your concern about the size of the cookies as well as the growing size of your own server-side database

4093569
bazaar	git
okay this will get me into a lot of trouble so let me clarify i am absolutely convinced that open source projects should be run on a dvcs preferably git or mercurial as they are the most widespread - nothing against bazaar but i think it s a bit too obscure
edit sourceforge now offers mercurial and bazaar so that argument doesn t stand anymore

4094588
super	implements
implements backbarbuttonitem is for the super view controller which uses pushviewcontroller subviewcontroller
for example if you ve pushed a view controller for its super view controller logout then you should ve implements backbarbuttonitem in the super view which is logout view not in the pushed subviewcontroller

4094588
super	implements
for example if you ve pushed a view controller for its super view controller logout then you should ve implements backbarbuttonitem in the super view which is logout view not in the pushed subviewcontroller
so to implements backbarbuttonitem you do it in super view logout like you can do this in - void viewdidload for static use or in - void viewwillappear bool animated for dynamic use for setting the title without allocating and initializing

4095773
qcodo	qcubed
i m not sure what s changed in its fork qcubed -- i think they just branched while qcodo was stagnating but it also might be worth looking at
qcodo seems to be back under active development

4095855
primefaces	icefaces
i like primefaces - it s easy and well documented
second place is icefaces if you create a website not a web application where you need to put life into html instead of create enterprise application that fits into browser use wicket if you prefer component based pull attitude or springmvc if you prefer template based push attitude or just use play

4097009
bash	subshell
so yes in this case this is equivalent to curl | bash i m not sure why they suggest the more complicated and less portable version
in some cases you would prefer the version using to the version using a pipe as the pipe creates a subshell for the command receiving input in this case bash while the creates a subshell for the command producing output

4099608
viewdidload	viewwillappear
this all works fine but the caveat is that the size of the scroll view and any other view for that matter is adjusted to the orientation of the device not in the viewdidload method but in the viewwillappear method
just to be clear with the prior i don t mean that this actually happens in the viewdidload method

4099608
viewdidload	viewwillappear
so i wrongly set the content size of the scroll view in the viewdidload method but at that moment the size of the scroll view was not correct yet with not correct i simply mean that depending on the orientation of the device it was not adjusted to the orientation of the device
what i did to solve the issue was moving my method that set the content size of my scroll view to the viewwillappear method

4099834
innodb	myisam
it doesn t have a lot of the features of innodb which makes it a little quicker if you don t need things like transaction and foreign keys
also myisam has table-level locking while innodb uses row-level locking which won t make much different for a high-read low-write table

4100373
lisp	scheme
edwin is a variant of emacs which uses scheme instead of emacs lisp
take a look at the relevant sections of the mit scheme manual not sure why mit scheme wouldn t run on windows however if you installed it on os x try just running mit-scheme from terminal.app

4100546
cassini	iis
there are many differences some of them local access in cassini cassini does not support s cassini runs as your account whoever is logged on iis runs as a service which means some things change quite a bit does not support authentication methods like basic digest etc
does not run any of the iis modules which means you will not be able to do things like url rewrite default documents directory browsing custom errors for static pages etc does not support things like virtual directories etc

4100691
profiling	instrumentation
the easiest way to examine memory usage is to use a profiling which is designed to help you track memory usage
the instrumentation class has a getobjectsize method however you shouldn t need to use it at runtime

4101352
ilist	iqueryable
you re also returning an iqueryable when your method clearly says it gives back an ilist
whether you really need an ilist or if you can get away with a concrete list which is also ienumerable and iqueryable and thus allows for easier further manipulation is a topic for another discussion but understand that ilists as ilists cannot be iterated

4102615
ssl	https
however the wide availability of ssl tls stacks on various languages platforms os makes it rather convenient for many applications to protect the communication between the client and the server via https. not using https doesn t mean that your system is going to be insecure although it might require a bit of work to protect the data
and using https isn t a guarantee that your application will be secure either

4102669
xsl-fo	xslt
i think that the issue might be that the xsl-fo is not complete
also i don t think you need to add the namespaces to the fo root element if they re in xslt stylsheet

4105737
implements	extends
thread controls how and when the code is executed alternatives are executorservice or calling run directly for synchronous execution on the current thread in general and to keep these two functions apart you do not want to extends thread you only want to implements runnable or callable
it is possible to extends thread and directly implements run rather than letting it delegate to the runnable but that is sort of old school

4105737
implements	extends
it is possible to extends thread and directly implements run rather than letting it delegate to the runnable but that is sort of old school
if they were to redesign the java api today thread would probably not implements runnable anymore

4106573
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
you can use either of them why because html is not case-sensitive markup language
see html 4.01 specification the value is case-insensitive user agents interpret a and a as the same

4108343
strtol	atoi
you should investigate strtol for most cases
atoi takes a string not a character

4108555
client-side	server-side
it injects a tracking js script onto all requests that measures the client-side of the request
it s got great graphing mates directly to your server-side data and measures your actual users not a sample of servers all over the globe

4109348
division	multiplication
mod is a division operation not a multiplication operation
division is more expensive than multiplication

4109616
division	multiplication
they both have the same asymptotic complexity but the constant for the division is greater you have to find out the digit and that is not trivial so you can mess up and have to fix the mess
algorithms processors execute the division and the multiplication by algorithms implemented in gates for division are more costly than for multiplication

4109998
apache	nginx
we have made the jump and cannot consider to go back to apache
nginx will definitely work faster than apache

4112909
dictionary	map
so you d use something like this still doesn t handle tags with both text and children sanely and it turns the collections.defaultdict list into a normal dictionary so the output is almost as you expect if you really want integers instead of strings for the text data in the b tags you ll have to explicitly turn them into integers somehow.
well map will always return a list so the easy answer is don t use map

passenger	webrick	puma	webrick	thin	webrick	unicorn	webrick
newer alternative application servers are phusion passenger unicorn thin puma trinidad jruby only torquebox jruby only i ll cover them later and describe how they differ from each other and from mongrel
webrick does the same thing as mongrel but the differences are webrick is not fit for production unlike everything else that i mentioned before

4113570
passenger	unicorn
phusion passenger can run the ruby garbage collector outside the normal request response cycle potentially reducing request times by hundreds of milliseconds
unicorn also has a similar feature but phusion passenger s version is more flexible because 1 it s not limited to gc and can be used for arbitrary work

4113570
passenger	unicorn
unicorn also has a similar feature but phusion passenger s version is more flexible because 1 it s not limited to gc and can be used for arbitrary work
2 phusion passenger s version works well with multithreaded apps while unicorn s does not

4114477
lxml	libxml2
lxml s documentation says the support for parsing broken html depends entirely on libxml2 s recovery algorithm
it is not the fault of lxml if you find documents that are so heavily broken that the parser cannot handle them

4115546
serializable	deserialization
seq is not supported in serializable because it is not a concrete type
during deserialization there s no type information which can be used to decide on concrete implementation

4116529
realloc	malloc
as other folks have mentioned realloc can be used to resize the struct but it will invalidate old pointers to the struct so make sure you aren t keeping extra copies of it like passing it to the library
this type of structure is not trivially useable on the stack you ll have to malloc it

4117862
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	opera	safari
so i ended up with the following table how stuff should be used ie flash v9 will ship with html5 h264 support as well but flash is cool firefox flash only theora vorbis supported for now safari flash if possible else html5 h264 supported in versions 3.0+ google-chrome flash if flash not aviailable unlikely h264 html support in versions 5.0+ opera flash no support for h264 yet
opera mobile.

4118492
.htaccess	httpd.conf
apache will read .htaccess files as long as allowoverride is enabled in httpd.conf
what you cannot do is put php directives inside .htaccess this works only with php installed as an apache module and would cause a 500 server error with php installed as either cgi or fastcgi

4118701
firefox	safari
of the major browsers only firefox lets you dynamically change the source of an embedded flash movie
for this reason your code will not work in internet explorer chrome or safari or rather it will change the source but to no effect

4119004
uilabel	nsstring
the uilabel in the view controller are probably still nil at that point and not accessible
instead of setting the controls directly create two nsstring properties in the newsdetailviewcontroller and set those before you push it

4119973
backgrounding	multitasking
at least not directly here s the list of all kinds of multitasking that apple supports from its s what s new page multitasking ios 4 delivers seven new multitasking services that allow your apps to perform tasks in the backgrounding while preserving battery life and performance
these multitasking services include backgrounding audio - allows your app to play audio continuously

4120438
client-side	server-side
implement a system to keep your session alive if you must have your session expire by time alone rather than just lasting until the browser is closed then put in a client-side call to refresh the session with a simple ajax request before it expires if the page is closed the request isn t fired allowing the session to expire when the allotted time passes
i believe you re dealing with a session whose timeout information is stored server-side the client doesn t necessarily know when his session will no longer be valid

4120574
direct3d	direct2d
the best cross-windows-version way is to use direct3d and simply update the texture on a single full screen quad
direct2d is a new api win vista with service pack and above which is the preferred mechanism if you do not need to support xp

4121333
primefaces	richfaces
primefaces has more components but lack combobox available in richfaces
richfaces does not have a bunch of common components like the star rating component captcha component and password strength

4121333
primefaces	richfaces
primefaces is tiny and can be implemented in the code easily - not too many dependencies
richfaces does not support jsf 2.0 till now nov 2010 - primefaces has a stable release that supports jsf 2.0 richfaces component growth is pretty much absent.

4122069
directx	gdi
these are the same issues as when rendering 2d or 3d via opengl or regular directx if you stray outside of well trodden rendering paths things aren t so rosy
as far as rendering non-antialiased graphics goes my advice would be to stick with gdi the implementations are solid with widespread hardware support

4122201
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
whether the search is case-sensitive or not depends on how you stock the data especially what collation you use
by default the search will be case-insensitive

4122608
draggable	droppable
to get the desired behaviour you really have to accept all draggable on all sortables
there may be different solutions one might be on over of the droppable determine if the draggable is accepted i mean accepted by you not by the droppable as there are all draggable accepted . assuming you set revert to true in all draggable you can now set the revert-option of the draggable to false if its accepted

4122608
draggable	droppable
there may be different solutions one might be on over of the droppable determine if the draggable is accepted i mean accepted by you not by the droppable as there are all draggable accepted . assuming you set revert to true in all draggable you can now set the revert-option of the draggable to false if its accepted
otherwise add the class for highlightning if unaccepted draggable are received

4125074
division	subtraction
division requires iterative subtraction that cannot be performed simultaneously so it takes longer
in fact some fp units speed up division by performing a reciprocal approximation and multiplying by that

4125154
division	multiplication
these two statements are not semantically identical - 0.1 cannot be exactly represented as a double so a slightly different value will end up being used - substituting the multiplication for the division in this case would yield a different result
division is inherently a much slower operation than multiplication

4126755
profiling	debugging
in debugging configurations in project settings you should have selected developer s profiling no need of specifying the entitlements plist
also same setting are there under targets if not manuall change them to the above for the debugging config

4127472
super	implements
says adc you can not call super as those accessor are generated on demand by the runtime
if you have two subclasses of nsmanagedobject where the parent class implements a dynamic properties and its subclass the grandchild of nsmanagedobject overrides the methods for the properties those overrides cannot call super

4127850
union	distinct
if you are using t-sql then it appears from previous posts that union removes duplicates
but if you are not you could use distinct

4128060
inline	inlining
on a side note you can force a function to not be inline l ike this
here is an old post from eric gunnerson that talks about inlining

4131188
directx	gdi
i have always found good starting places from him and actually while i may be insane for saying this i would swear the improvements to the directx sdk in doc and examples were done based on this guys work
as for the directdraw vs direct3d and not the gdi calls discussion

4131188
direct3d	gdi
as for the directdraw vs direct3d and not the gdi calls discussion
i would say go to direct3d

4133538
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox
solution 1 in the page directive on top of your aspx file you can add a setting to maintain the scroll position in this case you can define your button as you did originally note this setting does not work in safari and google-chrome but it works in other major browsers ie5+ firefox opera
solution 2 to make it work also with safari and google-chrome you can instead implement ajax to prevent full page refresh

4134623
shadowing	named
note that this last definition does not distinguish between types and class members so the named hiding shadowing rule 3.3.7 1 applies
this works since you ve used a as a member named in b that member s definition shadows the a type from the outer namespace

4135772
innodb	myisam
if you are running an e-commerce portal a crm module or any other software that may be affected by the consequences of a failed db transactions you need innodb
if you run a highly visited web site a bittorrent tracker or something that is highly stressed but not critically affected by inconsistencies in the db then you can drop innodb for myisam

4136419
opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
both opera and google-chrome appear to use synthetically-created bold fonts on weight 600 rather than the genuine bold font variant that is used from weight 700 up
synthetic fonts are usually used when bold or italic is requested on a family that doesn t have a bold italic variant. in addition on firefox osx 600 used to be taken as normal

4137595
innodb	myisam
do not do this if its innodb only isam or myisam
if its innodb i m afraid you may have a dump reload in your future

4138075
freemarker	velocity
never having worked with velocity i can not meaningfully compare the two but i was so satisfied with freemarker that i saw no reason to look beyond it
there is a lengthy comparison on the freemarker project page

4140183
cfstring	nsstring
unfortunately nsstring doesn t give us the power to escape the rfc3875 significant characters so we have to dip down into cfstring to do so
obviously using cfstring is a pain so i generally add a category onto nsstring like so with this category in place the original problem could be correctly solved with the following this is a little variable heavy just be more clear

4141273
profiling	benchmarking
if profiling proves it matters then be sure to compare your algo to itoa - internally it may use some cpu instructions that you don t have explicit access to from c++ and which your compiler s optimiser may not be clever enough to employ aam which divs while saving the mod result
experiment and benchmarking coding the assembler yourself

4141531
webclient	httpwebrequest
just use webclient if the abstraction works for your application
webclient uses httpwebrequest under the covers see webclient.getwebrequest so it s not an either or

4143806
queue	fifo
his technique implements a fifo queue that is on delay -- it holds what we just sent to the buffer
the delayed fifo queue does not hold pixel data it holds shape primitives which might be pixels in your application but it could also be lines rectangles easy-to-draw things because they are just shapes no unnecessary data is allowed

4144139
client-side	server-side
even if this could work cleanly it still doesn t sound like client-side processing of the raw document is a good idea
so first step is to investigate what server-side technologies php jsp asp you have available

4144514
innodb	myisam
50000000 results fetched and looped in 00 01 59.2144880 secs moving to innodb in my simplified system the myisam table doesnt perform too badly so it might not be worth migrating to innodb
if you do decided to copy your result data to an innodb table then do it as follows ordering the result by the innodb pk before inserting and wrapping the whole thing up in a transaction will speed things up

4150778
apache	nginx
apache automatically sees the location header in the response and forces the response code to be 300-series if you haven t previously set a response code of your own
nginx does not do this -- it expects you set the proper response code yourself

4151002
google-chrome	safari
you can also find lots of logging functions to use with firebug check out the console api firebug lite not as powerful as the full-featured firebug but great in a pinch google-chrome developer tools google-chrome
safari has nearly identical tools ie developer tools when you must open ie

4156063
postgresql	mysql
thus companyid in 1 2 3 companyid in cast 1 2 3 as int companyid in 1 in postgresql you could cast the string into array or store it as an array in the first place and this would even use an index on companyid
unfortunately this does not work in mysql since the latter does not support arrays

4156657
ienumerable	ilist
hashset has a constructor that takes an ienumerable so you need merely pass the list into this constructor as ilist derives from ienumerable
you do not specify what type blockedlist is so i will assume it is something that derives from ilist if meant to say string where you wrote blocklist then it would be a string array which derives from ilist

4157240
voip	sip
the same applies to documentation sip documentation will tend to be geared around voip
using a solution that doesn t support xmpp or sip is a dead end in terms of development in my opinion

4158470
aggregate-functions	sum
the zero check is based on sum an aggregate-functions which means it is not executing per row -- which is when the division is occurring
you re going to have to review the group by clause or run the division and zero check in a subquery before applying sum to result

4159657
allocator	stl
stl containers use an allocator they are given at construction time with a default allocator that uses operator new and operator delete
if you find the default is not working for you you can provide a custom allocator that conforms to the container s requirements

4160477
profiling	instrumentation
but you should be able to get useful informations from any good profiling tool in optimized code
also it s usually easy enough to instrumentation your code by hand and find out exactly which parts are efficient and which are not

4162022
google-chrome	firefox
it works when i have google-chrome up showing one web page but not when there are multiple web tabs open because appactivate activates the window but does not give focus to anything
maybe it works better with firefox

4163253
google-chrome	firefox
kaitsu s comment this solution of sending false credentials to make browser forget the correct authenticated credentials doesn t work in google-chrome 16 and ie 9
works in firefox 9

4163901
opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox
see screenshot all major browsers except ie - including firefox webkit google-chrome plus desktop mobile safari and opera have had a chance to implement the html5 implementation of server-side push
this is great news for iphone ipad android web app developers but not so momentous for the rest of the world that is still struggling with poor web standards implementation of ie6-8 and firefox playing catch-up

4166871
scheme	racket
i d recommend the book the little schemer and either racket or petite chez scheme both are free if you want to learn functional programming
i m a fan of scheme because it was designed from the ground up to be consistent and simple but still have advanced features not found in most other languages

4169523
daemons	systemd
in my case i have the daemons doing more than 1 thing so it s very helpful to have systemd keep track of all the timers for me so that i can effectively poll stream_select for the xmpp connection
i m actually work on something very close to what you described but in my case the daemons doesn t poll for event it get s them asynchronously via xmpp but that s besides the point

4169956
gtk	gdk
if you want to consider other windows than the ones from your application then you could try gtk.gdk.screen_get_default .get_toplevel_windows but this will only get you gdk windows and not gtk windows because you have no way of knowing whether those gdk windows are actually associated with gtk windows
the answer is actually not os-specific -- you can do it within gtk

4170435
icmp	tcp
a ping icmp echo request reply will give you the latency of a peer but not the available bandwidth the peer has
you want the bandwidth since tcp is good at doing bandwidth delay products and figuring out how to make a connection fast even if it roundtrips a satellite

4171054
super	implements
they have a php client available and super simple api
i wouldn t advise using either polling or trying to implements a push based solution using php if you are going to have any sizable traffic

4173840
r-tree	quadtree
but quadtree aren t very good at storing rectangles and i would recommend using an r-tree instead
you can still use quadtree even if you have moving objects just remove and reinsert an object every time it moves or every time it crosses region boundary

4174495
moq	fakeiteasy
i m sure there are lots of other differences that i forget about now and to be fair i have never used moq in production myself so my knowledge of it is limited i do think these are the most important differences though
to be clear i created fakeiteasy so i ll definitely not say whether one framework is better than the other what i can do is point out some differences and motivate why i created fakeiteasy

4175730
mongodb	bson
json on the server it s not a bad idea at all to store json on the server especially if you go with a nosql solution like mongodb or couchdb
both use json as their native format mongodb actually uses bson but it s quite similar

4176382
ssl	https
for example if you are deploying this project to an apache server you might check out the apache documents relating to ssl
https is usually implemented at the web server not in scripting languages

4177452
uiview	subviews
the easiest way to fix this is to set the view of photoviewcontroller to a regular uiview and add the scrollview as a subviews of this uiview
then the navigationcontroller will modify the frame of this view but it will not touch the subviews

4178185
addition	multiplication
in any case it s not going to be a single-cycle addition of to integers
multiplication involves a couple steps and division a lot of steps

4178768
icmp	tcp
note that to work the icmp protocol must not be stopped by a firewall
icmp is a protocol that runs atop ip like tcp does

4178768
icmp	tcp
icmp is a protocol that runs atop ip like tcp does
it doesn t use tcp

4178863
allocator	stl
furthermore when the c runtime receives an allocator request it cannot satisfy it will often allocate more than is necessary again to remove the expense of going to the kernel most of the time
finally if you re using boost goodies they probably depend on some stl components such as std vector

4180193
realloc	malloc
that way if the realloc fails you still free the original value
glibc is telling you you re passing in an address that couldn t have been returned from malloc realloc

4181446
google-chrome	safari
some examples by default safari has 3rd-party cookies disabled but google-chrome has them enabled by default
safari does not store content in the dom google-chrome does google-chrome keeps each browser window sandboxed in its own operating system process multi-process model

4181446
google-chrome	safari
safari does not store content in the dom google-chrome does google-chrome keeps each browser window sandboxed in its own operating system process multi-process model
safari keeps all windows in one process

4182937
ssl	https
edit there is example in stunnel doc where client cannot use ssl in your case you can configure stunnel like then in eclipse dialog with url use localhost 88 communication between eclipse and stunnel will be in plain text but between stunnel and www.mylocalsecuresite.com 443 will be encrypted
if you want to see what is send received by your application but https hides it then you can use normal http query with stunel which adds ssl to socket transmission

4183683
uilabel	uitextview
but my suggestion is that instead of using multiple uilabel just concentrate on nsattributedstring
find uicontrollers that draw nsattributedstring because uilabel uitextview do not support nsattributedstring

4184463
orientdb	neo4j
and it s licensed under apache 2.0 so orientdb is free for any use
neo4j s open-source version doesn t limit the size of database

4186345
oncreate	onstart
unfortunately the expanded state always resets whenever the focus is lost and oncreate is not called when it gets the focus again but onstart
so my workaround for now is to manually store the ids of all expanded items and expand them in onstart again

4190023
realloc	malloc
realloc has to copy the contents from the old buffer to the new buffer if the resizing operation cannot be done in place
a malloc free pair can be better than a realloc if you don t need to keep around the original memory

4199127
ssl	https
some google engineers wrote an article explaining how some previous assumptions about ssl are no longer true
i think the faster performance you re seeing over https isn t a fluke

4203005
boost	allocator
the use of those cpu instructions would give some significant and useful performance boost to bottleneck code
simply using inline assembly to do an operation that can easily be expressed in c++ - like adding two values or searching in a string - is actively counterproductive because the compiler knows how to do this equally well to verify this look at its assembly output gcc -s or disassemble the machine code you re artificially restricting its choices regarding register allocator cpu instructions etc. so it may take longer to prepare the cpu registers with the values needed to execute your hardcoded instruction then longer to get back to an optimal allocator for future instructions compiler optimisers can choose between equivalent-performance instructions specifying different registers to minimise copying between them and may choose registers in such a way that a single core can process multiple instructions during one cycle whereas forcing everythingt through specific registers would serialise it in fairness gcc has ways to express needs for specific types of registers without constraining the cpu to an exact register still allowing such optimisations but it s the only inline assembly i ve ever seen that addresses this if a new cpu model comes out next year with another instruction that s 1000 faster for that same logical operation then the compiler vendor is more likely to update their compiler to use that instruction and hence your program to benefit once recompiled than you are or whomever s maintaining the software then is the compiler will select an optimal approach for the target architecture its told about if you hardcode one solution then it will need to be a lowest-common-denominator or #ifdef -ed for your platforms assembly language isn t as portable as c++ both across cpus and across compilers and even if you seemingly port an instruction it s possible to make a mistake re registers that are safe to clobber argument passing conventions etc

4206971
factors	mean
as for your question regarding the month day year of the date yes factors those things out if you need easy access to these individual data in tools that process the xml
it s easier to search for all notes from before 2009 with an xpath statement that does not have to do string parsing and then string-to-number conversion if you see what i mean

4207306
concave	convex
if those points may not define a convex polygon you need a concave hull algorithm in step 1
find the convex hull of the set of points

4207985
queue	fifo
if you are expecting or desiring something that matches this behavior you should be aware that if a number of short operations are being added to a queue you may see this behavior instead because operations are started as part of being added to the queue in my project i needed to know when the last operation completed after a large number of operations had been added to a serial nsoperationqueue ie maxconcurrentoperationcount 1 and only when they had all completed
-- if all operations have the same priority which is not changed after the operation is added to a queue and all operations are always - isready yes by the time they get put in the operation queue then a serial nsoperationqueue is fifo

4207985
queue	fifo
-- if all operations have the same priority which is not changed after the operation is added to a queue and all operations are always - isready yes by the time they get put in the operation queue then a serial nsoperationqueue is fifo
chris kane cocoa frameworks apple in my case it is possible to know when the last operation was added to the queue

4210231
kerberos	ntlm
the upgrade provider for windowsstreamsecuritybindingelement invokes an sspi handshake between the client and the server using the spnego security package in the nettcpbinding this will normally result in kerberos being selected as the underlying security provider if available but will choose ntlm if not
if ntlm is the resulting authentication provider the sspi handshake will involve the three-leg ntlm challenge-response exchange of tokens described in the ntlm specification

4210290
backgrounding	multitasking
as others have answered your app likely won t be approved if this is all that your app is going to do but to answer your question your problem is that the app is multitasking on ios 4 and doesn t get called again when the app comes back into focus from the backgrounding
more on how the app delegate methods work with multitasking here . if this is all your app is going to do then the easiest fix is to simply opt out of multitasking

4214284
spaces	delimiter
will only split on spaces not on n newline
try adding this to your array of delimiter

4215868
ssl	https
i disabled the client ssl authentication on the server side and i still could not create the connection
since my end goal was an https get i punted and tried using the apache http client that s bundled with android

4215868
ssl	https
i could make the https conection but i still could not use ssl auth
if i enabled the client ssl authentication on my server the connection would fail

4216785
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
from the uiviewcontroller class reference for the navigationitem property to ensure the navigation item is configured you can override this property and add code to load the bar button items there or load the items in your view controller s initialization code
if you re not using a uinavigationcontroller you will need to add code to manage the navigation bar programmatically

4218716
cvs	svn
the meta-answer to your question is not to use cvs unless you re participating in a project that s already using it
even the cvs maintainers as far as i understand don t recommend it for new projects but recommend svn instead

4218766
udp	mtu
so you cannot assume that a udp datagram will cause a specific number of bytes to be transmitted
the mtu is the maximum size of an ip packet that can be transmitted without fragmentation

4220799
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
so while it s true that mozilla firefox and google-chrome both rely on network-enabled geolocation via google s location service database that s not a requirement of the standard
for example mobile safari on your iphone will in some cases use gps rather than wifi-triangulation or cell-site geolocation depending on what location service is most accurate and accessible at a given moment

4220908
scheme	racket
but note that i can t define t as a tuple since multiple values are not first class values in most scheme implementations
in racket you can use match and related things like match-define match-define list a b list 1 2 and match-let that works for lists vectors structs etc etc

4221343
equals	gethashcode
also if you are going to override equals it s almost always worth implementing so i would instead have
and of course you should never override equals and not override gethashcode it s also worth noting that identity entails equality that is for any valid concept of equality something is always equal to itself

4221620
union	distinct
union all would be faster than union but it doesn t remove duplicates
use select distinct col1 as col from your_table where col1 is not null union select distinct col2 as col from your_table where col2 is not null union select distinct col3 as col from your_table where col3 is not null union select distinct col4 as col from your_table where col4 is not null order by col union will remove duplicates between the statements

4221620
union	distinct
use select distinct col1 as col from your_table where col1 is not null union select distinct col2 as col from your_table where col2 is not null union select distinct col3 as col from your_table where col3 is not null union select distinct col4 as col from your_table where col4 is not null order by col union will remove duplicates between the statements
distinct will return a unique list of values per statement

4222649
serializable	deserialization
i take it the same holds for the json serializable
the documentation does not state anything concerning deserialization

4223731
pthreads	fork
as matthew wrote in his answer the other threads from the parent process will not exist in the child process if you are using pthreads
note that if this were not so it wouldn t help to place the exec call immediately after the call to fork since there would still be the possibility that the other threads would run before the call to exec

4228774
serializable	deserialization
in this case use datacontractserializer as it can serializable into binary if necessary
if the serialization and deserialization will only occur within your application and if there is no requirement that anyone else be able to read the serialized data then the serialization format doesn t impact the api as far as a user of the api is concerned you will serializable into an opaque file and deserialize from the same

4229898
haskell	scheme
calling it is almost as lightweight as scala i can sort-of replicate the operator sections from the haskell example by grabbing a reference to the + method of 1 ruby also has a pre-defined succ method for integers which we can pass using the symbol#to_proc trick some people criticize blocks in ruby because every method can only take a single block and methods taking more than one function are much uglier but it s actually not that bad
here s the same code as above but without using blocks ecmascript ecmascript is a direct descendant of scheme so it s no surprise that it can handle our problem nicely although with some amount of syntax clutter the main distraction here is the generally ugly syntax not so much the handling of higher-order functions

4229898
haskell	scheme
this is a pre-defined type which is part of the core library just like in scala or a b in haskell
this is an important distinction to java. thanks to type inference and collection initializers creating the list isn t all too painful and passing a lambda which consists only of a single expression is basically as lightweight as ruby scala scheme or haskell and even more lightweight than ecmascript because you don t need the function or return keywords but even using the full syntax isn t too bad you ll notice that i made morph an extension method which means i can call it like l.morph f in addition to morph l f . java at first glance this isn t too bad actually

4230910
xsl-fo	xslt
however that doesn t mean that you cannot render xsl-fo in a browser
you can render xsl-fo in any browser by adding a processing instruction to the xsl-fo for an xslt stylesheet that will render html from the xsl-fo

4232181
glut	glfw	glut	sdl
glut is outdated and not maintained anymore
switching to glfw or sdl for window creation wouldn t take much effort in terms of code and - contrary to glut - you define your main loop yourself which seems to be what you want to achieve here

4233213
required	placeholder
here l is required to have a length refer to an object that defines a __len__ method which shouldn t be a problem
but placeholder must also be a single character

4233506
move	drag
in delphi documentation it says if immediate is false the mouse pointer does not change to the value of the dragcursor property and dragging does not begin until the user move the mouse pointer the number of pixels specified by the threshold parameter
also for onstartdrag the documentation says occurs when the user begins to drag the control or an object it contains by left-clicking the control and holding the mouse button down

4233878
innodb	myisam
myisam is slightly faster than innodb and implements the fulltext index which is quite useful for integrating search capabilities
myisam is not transacted and doesn t implement foreign key constraints which is a major drawback

4235641
serializable	deserialization
you can even serializable non-public members such as private or protected members
and you dont need a set on a property either however without a setter you can serializable but not deserialize is about 10 faster than xmlserializer to serializable the data because since you don t have full control over how it is serializable there is a lot that can be done to optimize the serialization deserialization process

4236790
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome you d right click and select inspect element and then click the looking icon in the bottom left it s the second from the left
in firefox you d install firebug and there s a tab called console not sure if it s available in ie probably something in the developer tools press f12 but i wouldn t recommend developing in ie

4243204
flask	django
if you are really looking for a glue framework on awesome python libraries including the ones you choose flask is out there
the one reason i d refrain from using jinja mako or anything else is that it may not make your app future proof with django enhancements

4243460
g++	gcc
by default ubuntu installs do not have g++ installed
the following command will install stuff essential for development in ubuntu like gcc g++ and headers and make

4244883
innodb	myisam
for these sorts of tables i would recommend an myisam structure or an innodb table with innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit set to 0 this switches to a mode where transactions are not commited to disk before control is returned to the caller
using an innodb table comes with an overhead of transactional support rollbacks etc

4244883
innodb	myisam
using an innodb table comes with an overhead of transactional support rollbacks etc
if you don t need this support for transactions then you should really go with an myisam table as it doesn t have any transactional support and can be faster for lookups etc

4246325
pyopengl	pyglet
transitioning your code from pyglet to pyopengl is fairly easy so this is not a decision you need to worry about too much upfront
the trades-off between the two are pyopengl s bindings make the opengl interface more friendly and pythonic

4246325
pyopengl	pyglet
things like this make pyopengl really easy and convenient
pyglet s opengl bindings are automatically generated and are not as friendly to use as pyopengl

4246375
primes	square-root
you could even search from the top of the range down if you think the person providing the value is trying to be tricksome although with the density of primes being so much higher at the low end this likely will not help
the main thing to remember though that the largest possible factor of x besides for x itself is the square-root of x

4248496
memcached	apc
unlike apc memcached has no other functionality for verifying existence or non-existence of a key
if memcached get returns false the key doesn t exist or an error occurred

4248749
vim	textmate	vim	aquamacs
6 vim with fireplace - vim has been through a couple phases but fireplace is where it s at - lots of people are successful with it
i have spent significant chunks of time on a mac with textmate w clojure bundle netbeans enclojure eclipse ccw emacs.app not aquamacs my opinions on those textmate - was a great way to get started and is obviously a very functional text editing environment

4248749
emacs	aquamacs
but it s emacs with all its pros and cons
if you re going to use emacs on the mac i d recommend using emacs.app not aquamacs

4248749
emacs	aquamacs
if you re going to use emacs on the mac i d recommend using emacs.app not aquamacs
aquamacs does not follow standard gnu emacs conventions and you ll find it harder to create a portable environment or use other people s extensions

4248749
emacs	aquamacs
aquamacs does not follow standard gnu emacs conventions and you ll find it harder to create a portable environment or use other people s extensions
right now i use emacs for day-to-day editing and my normal work environment

4249137
equals	gethashcode
you can call gethashcode to determine if the items are not equals but if two objects return the same hash code that doesn t mean they are equals
two items can have the same hash code but not be equals

4249245
freebsd	solaris
first of all read this linux uses 1 1 threading model starting from kernel 2.6 nptl native posix threading library and today almost all oses move to this model freebsd starting from 7.0 if i m not mistaken
solaris starting for some version also moved to 1 1 - i don t remember which one

4249248
equals	gethashcode
in fact in my application i decided that having identical hashes was close enough to being equals that i didn t even bother to implement the equals overload causing the c# compiler to warn me that i was overloading gethashcode without overloading equals
you cannot say that just because the hash codes are equals then the objects must be equals

4249248
equals	gethashcode
you cannot say that just because the hash codes are equals then the objects must be equals
the only time you would call gethashcode inside of equals was if it was much cheaper to compute a hash value for an object say because you cache it than to check for equality

4252830
profiling	debugging
if none of that yields enlightenment you could try debugging where the environment is set by adding set -x and perhaps env to the top of etc profiling maybe only if the person running it is root so as not to disturb other users and track what is executed and set
use the env command to diagnose whether java_home is already set on entry to etc profiling

4257202
implements	extends
if the default is not good enough you can implements your own collection editor by extends the uitypeeditor class in the system.drawing.design namespace and decorating the property in your code with the editorattribute you can also extends the existing collectioneditor class but the class only exposes very limited functionality to derived classes
in order for a collection to be automatically supported by the designer it must implements the non-generic ilist interface - will not automatically work

4260646
n-gram	words
the first sieve can be based on a n-gram trigram works often well frequency histogram or a hash function
you shouldn t try all your possible words with the levenshtein distance algortihm

4260831
scheme	racket
if you install a scheme implementation i am using mit scheme edited to add that this also works with racket using mzscheme it may come with a symlink named scheme - this is what emacs looks for i think
if it doesn t mit scheme doesn t seem to on os x you can edit your emacs configuration in emacs type m-x customize-group then type scheme

4260913
junit	testng
i personally have not encountered any significant drawbacks compared to junit
at the start of a new project my team switched to testng and had no regrets

4267506
google-chrome	firefox
this would probably explain why google-chrome allows the xhr but not firefox
google-chrome considers the subdomain part of the same origin but firefox does not

4269033
postgresql	mysql
1 using postgresql you could do something similar with to_char
note that using a function like this will probably make the database do a full table scan since at least mysql doesn t support adding an index to a function

4270002
matlab	simulink
if you have arrived to the performance barrier of matlab then maybe you should simply change the environment
i do not see any sense anyway starting today a new project in matlab except if you are using simulink

4270002
matlab	simulink
i do not see any sense anyway starting today a new project in matlab except if you are using simulink
python rocks for technical computing and with c# you can also do many things matlab does using free libraries

4270094
youtube	vimeo
so on the youtube side doesn t happen nothing
also it only works with youtube it does not affect vimeo flash embeds for example

4270094
youtube	vimeo
also it only works with youtube it does not affect vimeo flash embeds for example
ironically at the time of writing the new html5 iframe embedding from youtube doesn t work with the iphone nor with the ipad while the old flash embed still does

4272652
firefox	safari
firefox 3.5 also supports the children property of an element which is the collection of all child nodes that are elements
recent versions i m not sure of the specifics of safari chrome and opera also support these properties

4273372
comparator	comparable
be careful though- any two prioritizedrule-s will have to be comparable to each other which is why i m recommending prioritizedrule be an abstract base instead of an interface because that s where the comparator implementation needs to live for consistency
your comparator does not need to be consistent with equals unless you try to keep your collection in a sorted set which can never end well prioritizedrule can t be aware of enough to make itself consistent with equals

4278107
backgrounding	multitasking
adding application does not run in backgrounding or uiapplicationexitsonsuspend will stop your application being suspended when it is closed
if you have an app that you developed pre-multitasking and you are having issues or you don t need it you can disable multitasking in the application s info.plist file

4279947
udp	tcp
just generate random integers with rand or whatever and send them over udp
since you re using udp you re not really going to get a stream because udp is not a stream-oriented protocol like tcp

4279947
udp	tcp
since you re using udp you re not really going to get a stream because udp is not a stream-oriented protocol like tcp
you can generate lots of random udp packets however

4281252
persistent	transient
you should be merging only if an object that was persistent becomes detached and you need to reattach it
you cannot get an id from a transient object by definition a transient object does not have an id

4282634
noexcept	throw
here s a discussion of noexcept that also details why traditional nothrow-specifications prohobit optimizations at the callee s site
generally you pay for every throw specification you have at least with a fully compliant compiler which gcc has in this respect appearantly not always been

4286346
dictionary	map
it isn t all that useful in situations when you want to add elements - that is create new dictionary containing all elements of the original one and also some new elements
in that case it is better to use the map type

4288281
pthreads	fork
this is not general c code but unix pthreads code and works by splitting the process into a parent process and child process
fork returns the child process id a nonzero number thus true in the parent and 0 false in the child

4288557
gif	png
there are tools to minimize the size of png such as pngout note that png won t support animation like gif does
8 bit png only has binary transparency but not alpha transparency.

4289512
sproutcore	cappuccino
sproutcore makes use of bindings better than cappuccino currently does
cappuccino does also have kvc kvo support but bindings are not totally there yet

4289512
sproutcore	cappuccino
for example in sproutcore you can implement incremental loading with bindings and arraycontroller very easily where on the other hand in cappuccino its not as straightforward
of course cappuccino offers the cptableview datastore api which is pretty clean and can achieve similar results just not with bindings

4291839
pthreads	fork
it is also quite possible as several people have noted in comments that semaphores may simply not work across fork ed processes edit - if you pass a non-zero value to argument 2 of when initializing pthreads semaphores will work across processes edit - see here for a much better explanation than i could give complete with source code to do nearly exactly what you want
just because you fork the producer thread first doesn t mean the os will schedule it to run first - its quite possible that the consumer actually runs and gets the lock first

4293265
calloc	malloc
if you use calloc instead of malloc you get zeroed memory
for instance allocating an array of pointers with calloc will make them initialized to null and you do not need to do that explicitly

4293280
alloca	malloc
making a call to alloca with an unwarranted size may cause the kernel to crash. certain compilers warn usage of alloca and even vlas for that matter under certain options that ought to be turned on while compiling a kernel code - here it is better to allocate memory in the heap that is not fixed by a hard-coded limit
a place where alloca is especially dangerous than malloc is the kernel - kernel of a typical operating system has a fixed sized stack space hard-coded into one of its header

4293676
boost	allocator
they re guaranteed never to leak memory if they re used properly and there s a wealth of well-written smart pointers in boost or a new compiler s standard library
edit task manager is not a reliable way to measure allocator deallocations etc

4295588
hex	binary
so -1 in a 16-bit integer which has the highest unsigned value of 65535 would be 65536-1 65535 0xffff in hex or 1111 1111 1111 1111 in binary
so 1 in binary 0000 0000 0000 0001 not on all bits would result in 1111 1111 1111 1110

4296557
ubuntu	linux
this post is intended to rescue the people who are suffering from not being able to properly setup apache2 for perl on ubuntu
the system configurations specific to your linux machine will be mentioned within square brackets like this

4297139
icmp	udp
this is very different then icmp protocol ping
you are going to have to assemble your own udp rmcp ping packet that adheres to the protocol defined under dmtf asf releases as i am not aware of any libararies that do this currently

4301344
realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
of course also realloc and calloc shall be implemented but memory block cannot be used by other software which expect normal malloced memory
another way to do this is to hash the pointer and collect memory information by hooking the malloc free functions

4302924
draggable	droppable
as you point out you ll be able to drop the draggable anywhere
what you usually want is revert invalid which means that it ll revert whenever it s dropped on anything that isn t a droppable that accepts it

4304080
cakephp	yii
in cakephp you cannot use composite primary key this is the main deal-breaker for me
composite primary key is supported in yii

4304080
cakephp	yii
cakephp enforces convention while yii favors convention you are not forced to follow a certain standard
while enforced convention is a good way to build good programming practice in the end the flexibility that yii offered wins this round for me

4305402
scheme	racket
both ocaml and racket plt scheme have opengl bindings
it looks like racket doesn t have sdl bindings however which may or may not be important to you

4305418
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
since dataaccessexception is a runtimeexception you might want to check what is the real cause of the exception and fix it instead of catching it and retry the operation
from unchecked-exception are exceptions that do not need to be declared in a throws clause

4306168
bazaar	git
when i was reviewing dvcs a few years back bazaar was tied to python 2.4 and wouldn t install run on 2.5 out of the box
git support on windows was sketchy at best

4306501
uiview	calayer
on an iphone this isn t very different from a uiview because a uiview is then just a lightweight wrapper around a calayer
i m going to disagree with count chocula on this and say that a calayer does appear to wrap a bitmapped texture on the gpu

4307033
bellman-ford	dijkstra
bellman-ford algorithm can be made to detect the presence of a negative cycle and abort execution abort since no correct solution exists in that case
bellman-ford algorithm allows distinct edges with negative weights not supported in dijkstra algorithm but neither algorithm allows negative cycles

4307049
phpunit	simpletest
to expand on the above answer with respect to simpletest mentioned above the st system has a built in browser object class for browser automation while phpunit has an extension for the selenium browser automation the advantage of selenium vs
simpletest is that selinium will run any on-page javascript while simpletest will not

4308715
profiling	instrumentation
vs was slow to connect and disconnect the profiling and often instrumented my binaries and left them in a corrupted state
.net binaries do not need to be instrumented since they contain the metadata of the methods which is odd that visual studio kept hosing my binaries trying to instrumentation them

4308845
interpolation	splines
i d like to quote introduction to catmull-rom splines to suggest not using catmull-rom for this interpolation task
one of the features of the catmull-rom splines is that the specified curve will pass through all of the control points - this is not true of all types of splines

4309096
equals	gethashcode
that s why your equals implementation is not getting called
you need to override gethashcode in your class

4309222
h.264	webm
h.264 is a patent trap waiting to happen
probably webm if not ogg

4311323
implements	extends
the class should only be abstract if the user needs to implements some logic to make it functional within the framework in which it is being used where the class designer does not know the exact implementation details of how the class will be used like the template or command design patterns for example
if the class is complete and usable it makes sense that you should be able to instantiate and use the class even if the user decides to extends it later

4311582
icmp	tcp
on 1gb hardware i see 80µs icmp latency i cannot help on 10gige or infiniband
at faster fabrics though it really depends upon what protocols you are using tcp often has more acceleration options than other protocols and hence can reach higher performance figures

4311754
keystore	jks
this is how to add a certificate with a associating private key to a pkcs12 keystore. when you are using client authentication the keystore needs to contain also the private key in that case you use keystore.getinstance pkcs12
when youre not using client authentication but only server authentication and private key will not be added to keystore since it belongs to the server its better to use keystore.getinstance jks than you can add multiple certificates with an alias to that one keystore

4312187
opera	firefox
it actually works in opera even on real sites
firefox does not support this as of 2010-11-30 and thus won t in firefox 4

4312474
webkit	gecko
in opera and msie you may set the unselectable-property to on as the both styles related to gecko webkit are css you can use a class to apply it note unselectable will not pass on child-elements so if you have there anything else than textnodes inside target you need the workaround you already have there for msie opera
for webkit use khtmluserselect instead of mozuserselect

4312734
comparator	comparable
your comparator and equals methods are not consistent and therfore the treeset cannot work correctly with them
from the api doc note that the ordering maintained by a set whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if it is to correctly implement the set interface. see comparable or comparator for a precise definition of consistent with equals. this is so because the set interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a treeset instance performs all element comparisons using its comparator or compare method so two elements that are deemed equal by this method are from the standpoint of the set equal. the behavior of a set is well-defined even if its ordering is inconsistent with equals

4313142
innodb	myisam
however i solved the issue by using innodb engine instead of myisam
myisam only allows locking on table level not on row level

4313830
serializable	deserialization
deserialization does much the same thing as the first step by calling formatterservices.getuninitializedobject and then does much the same thing as the second step by setting the values for fields to be equivalent to those that were recorded during serializable which may require deserialising other objects to be said values
now the state that deserialization is putting the object into may not correspond to that possible by any constructor

4313830
serializable	deserialization
it could also just be impossible only constructor is one that takes parameters - serializable has no way of knowing what arguments to use
you could look at it as a special sort of constructor only used by deserialization oo purists will - and should - shudder at the idea of a constructor that doesn t construct i mean this as an analogy only if you know c++ think of the way overriding new works as far as memory goes and you ve an even better analogy though still just an analogy

4314102
kate	jedit
it has ftp i m not sure about svn and is has feel similar to kde kate editor that is my first choice
i also use jedit occasionally

4315379
boost	stl
note as noted by john dibling the boost book might be a bit out of date i do not have experience with that one myself
you might wnat to check out the definitive c++ book guide and list for your purposes i would especially recommend c++ coding standards effective stl beyond the c++ standard library an introduction to boost code complete clean code examples in java still valid though. they are not in particular order also you might want to read and code something in between them

4322120
jax-ws	jax-rs
java ee 6 offers a web profile but the web profile does not include jax-ws
java ee 6 full profile includes both jax-ws soap ws- web services and jax-rs for http and more restful web services

4323238
profiling	benchmarking
with this tool you can add counters like private bytes handle count thread count etc for profiling your application over time
there is allot of interesting information that can be extracted using this tool and there is plenty of information on msdn that covers how to use it its not only limited to memory leaks it can benchmarking i o performance and other stuff as well

4324160
svg	vml
you could add a viewbox attribute on the svg root element to define the coordinate system the shapes will then scale to whatever the size of the container is
not sure how to deal with the vml side of things though

4324312
cvs	svn
not cvs it s ancient and horrible during development and write a deployment script which uploads either the newest release tag or simply the most recent snapshot to your shared hosting server. that script would obviously be located somewhere in your local network where all devs can access it - you might want to add some checks if another deployment is already running so dev 2 can t start it if dev 1 has already started it and it s not finished yet
the easiest solution would be using git mercurial svn etc

4325818
qtreewidget	qtreeview
seem like the standard qtreewidget doesn t allow this
i think there are two ways to do this use a qtreeview with your own class derived from qabstractitemmodel and override the flags function use a qtreeview with a qstandarditemmodel

4327123
sudo	passwd
here is the man entry -s the -s stdin option causes sudo to read the passwd from the standard input instead of the terminal device. this will allow you to run a command like echo mypassword | sudo -s ls tmp as for ssh i have made many attempts to automate script it s usage with no success
there doesn t seem to be any build-in way to pass the passwd into the command without prompting

4329274
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome doesn t have any flicker with either method
note the subtle change of storing the returned document which circumvents the bug in firefox 4.0b7

4330713
factories	presenter
autofac s delegate factories are a true joy here since you can just inject a delegate into the presenter and autofac will automagically wire it up as if it were a factories pseudocode follows so the listproductspresenter knows about the edit feature set the edit presenter and the edit user control --and this is perfectly fine they go hand-in-hand--but it doesn t need to know about all of the dependencies of the edit feature set instead relying on a delegate provided by autofac to resolve all of those dependencies for it
generally i find that i have a one-to-one correspondence between a presenter view model supervising controller let s not too caught up on the differences as at the end of the day they are all quite similar and a usercontrol form

4334047
udp	tcp
udp on the other hand leaves it up to you to deal with packets not arriving
if you have a game where losing the odd update isn t important you can achieve far better bandwidth use latency and scalability by using udp instead of tcp

4334047
udp	tcp
if you have a game where losing the odd update isn t important you can achieve far better bandwidth use latency and scalability by using udp instead of tcp
udp still leaves you with all the issues of firewalls security etc though

4335808
svg	vml
raphaël uses vml in internet explorer and svg in all other browsers
canvas has built-in ability to export as an image where as such feature is not built in vml

4338760
memcpy	malloc
this code is wrong is not initialized when you memcpy a into it
i would expect to see two malloc s - one for and another for which you would then use to seed before copying stuff into it

4342220
cvs	svn
not to mention that all of them are orders of magnitude better than vss and cvs
to give you a quick start here s a short list of providers you can look at codeplex - svn and mercurial support free for open source projects but there s control over the visibility of your source github - git support free plans for open source paid plans for proprietary projects google code - svn and mercurial support free 2gb for open source projects though they do have some control over the visibility of your source bitbucket - svn and mercurial support free for 5 users unlimited for paid and proprietary projects sourceforge - git svn mercurial and cvs support free for open source projects unfuddle - git and svn support paid codebasehq - git mercurial and svn support paid there are a lot more out there with various pricing models and reliability of course - update if you are working on a web app your web host dos necessarily have to support also the source control

4342287
strncmp	strcmp
as such the n you pass to strncmp should be the received size of message which you ought to know from the return value of the read recv function that read the message
presuming that the string in message is supposed to be null-terminated the only reason to use strncmp here rather than strcmp would be to be to prevent it looking beyond the end of message in the case where message is not null-terminated

4342486
kerberos	ntlm
windows by default will use kerberos ie active directory to control security
if kerberos is not available it will default to ntlm

4342486
kerberos	ntlm
if kerberos is not available it will default to ntlm
only use ntlm if you specifically need to avoid kerberos i cannot think of a scenario where you would want to do this but part of wcfs greatness is its flexibility

4343455
postgresql	mysql
this is a weak point that iirc postgresql can handle better but with mysql you have to work around that by reverting the changes yourself in case of rollbacks
this is not supported by mysql innodb

4343836
realloc	malloc
be careful with this one you must keep a copy of your original pointer until you know realloc succeeds
there is nothing illegal about the way you are using malloc but this isn t a list it s an array of pointers

4344090
backgrounding	multitasking
apple only allows specific hooks for backgrounding functions but you cannot - without jailbreaking the device - run anything in the backgrounding generically
better think of multitasking as fast-app-switching with some extras

4344324
equals	compareto	comparator	comparable
from the sortedset docs note that the ordering maintained by a sorted set whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if the sorted set is to correctly implement the set interface
see the comparable interface or comparator interface for a precise definition of consistent with equals. this is so because the set interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a sorted set performs all element comparisons using its compareto or compare method so two elements that are deemed equal by this method are from the standpoint of the sorted set equal

4344385
equals	compareto
there is no rule in java which says that the hash codes of two objects must be different just because they aren t equals so o1.hashcode - o2.hashcode could return 0 in your case
also the behavior of equals should be consistent with the results from compareto

4348044
gson	jackson
also jackson works fine on android if you don t mind using it over gson
with regards to jackson you can not only choose between numeric timestamp and textual serialization serializationconfig.feature.write_dates_as_timestamps but also define exact dateformat to use for textual variant serializationconfig.setdateformat

4349728
client-side	server-side
here the gridview markup is the same as before except the checkbox does not cause a postback that is autopostback is false and there s no server-side event handler all the magic happens on the client-side
presuming you have referenced the jquery library your javascript code would just be the following i created a client-side function named enabledisablebuttonasneeded that determines how many total checkboxes there are in the grid and how many are checked

4352956
flask	django	flask	web2py
some would say that there is a danger of learning the framework and not the language so it might be best to get a deeper understanding of the python language and lighter weight frameworks flask or wekzeug first
having said that web2py has a lower initial learning curve than django as it was specifically designed as a learning tool

4353033
django	web2py
disclaimer i am the project leader for web2py django has been around 5 years longer than web2py therefore it has more users and more applications to show off
django has what they call admin which is not the same as web2py s admin but more like web2py s appadmin

4353033
django	web2py
django has what they call admin which is not the same as web2py s admin but more like web2py s appadmin
django s admin is better and more customizable than web2py s appadmin

4353033
django	web2py
django s admin is better and more customizable than web2py s appadmin
django does not have the equivalent of web2py s admin

4353033
django	web2py
django does not provide them out of the box
for web2py long term backward compatibility is a primary goal together with security

4353033
django	web2py
to me the web2py syntax is more natural i am not aware of any functionality of web2py that is not present in django
i have asked that question many times because if there is we want to add it to web2py but i have not yet received a satisfactory answer

4353033
django	web2py
django follows explicit is better than implicit
web2py does not and instead follows everything should have a default behavior

4353966
udp	tcp
you can generally get better performance for a specific goal by using udp and handling more of the network issues yourself
tcp and fancier things built on top of it try to give you reliable ordered communications with a sense of connected sessions but their means of insuring reliability aren t necessarily going to be the ones that are most optimum for you

4354804
setinterval	settimeout
if cleartimeout needs to be bulletproof or you need setinterval and presumably clearinterval you d need to throw more code at the problem but the principal of verifying enough time has elapsed before executing func holds
you could work around the bug by using a wrapper for settimeout this still returns the value from settimeout so if the bug is not encountered cleartimeout can still be used

4355241
swt	swing
i d still recommend swt because it s native code and faster but that s a different answer than the one above
i admit this is not a particularly helpful answer but understanding what exactly swing is may help

4356511
firefox	safari
in firefox hooking into the clipboard interface is also disallowed by default
in safari chrome this not allowed either except explicitly in onpaste handlers

4356568
opera	firefox
it likely wont make it for opera 11 but will probably make it for the version after
css3 gradients using the latest syntax closer but not exactly the same as firefox as the spec has evolved are in development now in opera presto our rendering engine

4356610
implements	extends
#0 is usually best because it is the shortest it is least prone to error it is idiomatic and easy for other people to read at a glance it is efficiently implements by the compiler it does not pollute your method scope outside the loop with unnecessary names
#3 has a disadvantage because the scope of the iterator it extends beyond the end of the loop

4356675
strcpy	malloc
instead of the two lines using strcpy is safe because you know all the sizes
note that malloc does not return initialized data you cannot guarantee that the last allocated byte will be zero

4356739
calloc	malloc
i figured out the problem - i should have been using calloc not malloc
while malloc simply allocates the memory calloc contiguously allocates enough space for count objects that are size bytes of memory each and returns a pointer to the allocated memory

4358801
ssl	https
no you cannot decrypt https ssl sessions from a network capture even if you do have the certificates
that is the whole point of public key cryptography on which ssl is based

4358822
vim	emacs
you will not be able to run a shell inside vim or use it to control a debugger
this should work the other way around use vim as a component from a shell or in an ide. a satirical way to say this unlike emacs vim does not attempt to include everything but the kitchen sink but some people say that you can clean one with it

4359645
udp	tcp
udp doesn t guarantee message delivery - if there s no place in the buffer the packet is dropped without hesitation
if you need guaranteed delivery use tcp and build a message-based communication scheme on top of tcp

4359958
udp	tcp
udp vs tcp when opening and forwarding ports you may notice that it asks for udp user datagram protocol or tcp transmission control protocol
what they stand for may not make sense but all you need to know is this udp is for single packet transmissions which means that two packets sent by a pc may or may not be related to each other

4360045
sudo	passwd
to do it for a single command the most normal case simply prefix the command with sudo sudo python setup.py install
you will probably be prompted to supply your passwd again not root s passwd but your own and then the command will be executed

4360579
opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
you might be able to use the css zoom property - supported in ie 5.5+ opera and safari 4 and google-chrome verifed please check before downvoting
firefox is the only major browser that does not support zoom bugzilla item here but you could use the proprietary -moz-transform property in firefox 3.5

4361629
memcpy	strcpy
i though about memcpy is not really any slower than strcpy
in fact if you perform a strlen to identify how much you are going to memcpy then strcpy is almost certainly faster

4361736
rvm	bundler
i have not yet installed rvm on my deployment server there i just use bundler to make sure each apps dependecies are handled
i will probably install rvm there as well but have to figure out how that plays ball with passenger first

4361901
memcpy	strcpy
replacing strcpy by memcpy doesn t make any significant difference
strcpy doesn t do an extra pass to find the length of the string it s simply conceptually

4362081
multiplying	subtract
the next few instructions multiplying the result by 10 again but avoiding the mul imul instructions whether this is a win or not depends on the exact processor you re targeting - newer x86s have very fast multipliers but older ones don t
this is then subtract from i again to obtain which is i 10 for unsigned numbers

4362688
lisp	smalltalk
there are certainly other choices lisp doesn t have operators at all
plus 1 2 + 1 2 smalltalk almost doesn t have operators

4362890
dictionary	map
this is not specific to dictionary
this syntax is a way to help map c++ semantics onto managed types

4362910
strcpy	strncpy
the answer is probably just to use a coyping function - for example if you are certain that then you can just use strcpy
if you cannot be sure about the length being correct then you can use strncat as as truncating string copy note that despite the name strncpy is not suitable for this and in fact is very rarely the desired function at all

4363273
quicksort	mergesort
fundamentally quicksort is a top-down approach while mergesort is a bottom-up approach
in quicksort we select a pivot or partition value and partition the list into two halves not always exactly half but the closer to half the better - those less-than the pivot and those greater

4367925
queue	fifo
the collection interfaces that you listed which do have interfaces are random access while stacks and queue are not
they have to be accessed in a very particular manner fifo or lifo and therefore cannot be used generally

4368652
cassini	iis
unless you are deploying to cassini and you aren t no one does then there s no point in developing against it unless you simply can t you don t have a local install of iis
web deploy install web deploy on the iis server you are going to deploy to

4370193
appfuse	spring
other reason you might go for appfuse is if you want to use an ide with full intellisense and code-completion support but don t want to use eclipse you can use other ide s and build works perfectly well with spring roo but due to the aspectj files which aren t recognized by netbeans other ide s then eclipse currently don t do code completion well for the spring roo generated managed files
but if you don t mind eclipse or better even the spring tools suite and do want to use gwt and or spring mvc i d recommend spring roo

4372377
webclient	httpwebrequest
i am not sure if this is possible using webclient
use httpwebrequest instead to be able to set the values above

4372845
firefox	safari
your ad-blocking firefox plugin is detecting and removing the div from the dom
i experienced the same behaviour in chrome and firefox which have ad-blocking plugins extensions but not in safari or ie which don t

4373763
udp	tcp
mysocket.setsockopt socket.sol_socket socket.so_reuseport 1 normally though when you talk about a multithreaded server you re talking about a server using a connection oriented protocol over tcp not udp where there is a server socket listening for connections and then when a connection is formed it creates a thread to deal with it
for a multithreaded udp server you would probably have a single socket which queues incomming requests and have multiple threads pulling from the queue and doing the work

4373777
innodb	myisam
this explicitly creates an innodb table
mysqldialect does not append an engine string thus would create a myisam table

4375115
nginx	lighttpd
nginx - the new kid on the block
not as well documented at the moment obviously documentation improves with time as either lighttpd or apache but people have been saying that it outperforms both

4375847
portrait	landscape
for example if a 1024x768 splash image is used and the initial view doesn t support portrait viewing through orientation locks this can cause visual ui objects to appear off screen especially when animation is involved as the view will try and present itself in a portrait configuration even though the device may be in landscape
generally 1024x768 images imply portrait while 768x1024 images imply landscape

4377160
jsf	seam
seam with seam-gen is mainly targetted for using jsf as the web framework while spring roo is focused on spring mvc and or gwt as its web framework
seam itself has also good support for wickete but not with the seam-gen tool

4377160
jsf	seam
so if you are very familiar with the spring stack which i guess you are seeing that you re coming from grails go for spring roo as else you might loose quite some time in getting familiar with the java ee stack including jsf of course this does depend on the size of your project but assuming it is not a very large project the impact of learning new techniques might be too large for a single project
if you cannot or don t want to use eclipse and are really passionate about this i guess seam might be a better solution

4377160
jsf	seam	wicket	seam
if you want to use jsf or wicket go for seam while if you want to use spring mvc or gwt use spring roo for other web frameworks it probably doesn t really matter which you choose though spring roo might then be a better solution
and if adulthood is your main point of decision i guess you d better use seam

4380825
svg	vml
raphaeljs does not use canvas. it uses vml in ie but svg in all other browsers
as the op said you can grab the raw svg as it s a whole svg doc and download that he is looking for some similar functionality with vml

4380840
innodb	myisam
myisam doesn t support many of the enhanced data validation facilities supported by engines like innodb so you are generally at a disadvantage by starting with myisam
but ymmv and if your application can survive being subjected to myisam s shortcomings by all means use it

4382614
firefox	safari
try this it looks like it corrects the problem in firefox and doesn t mess with safari
update it looks like firefox and opera are rendering overflow hidden inline blocks correctly and webkit browsers are not

4385219
bash	subshell
you may try using the eval construct in bash then just use it in your loop
edit this read loop creates a subshell which will not allow you to use them outside of the loop

4386251
tabcontrol	tabitem
you can download snoop or other tool that shows you visual tree and see there that content of tabitem is not actually the visual child of this tabitem but the visual child of tabcontrol
so tabitem is the logical child of tabitem s content and tabcontrol is the visual child of tabitem s content

4388479
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
jonathon bolster s code doesn t work for opera
this should work in opera ie firefox and google-chrome

4390774
boost	stl
read effective c++ by meyers and c++ coding standards by sutter you re not likely to understand everything if you re a beginner so re-read them from time to time it s also a good vaccine time to introduce the stl it s an amazing little pearl learn to use its algorithms instead of hand-crafting everything if possible jump straight to the c++0x version incorporate boost into the mix softly at first boost optional boost variant boost lexical_cast boost numeric_cast make your code safer and more idiomatic
also poke the boost string algorithms library

4393084
prng	random
if you treat a prng function as this oracle machine that gives you a random number each time you ask for it hen it is side-effect free and impure and the function inherits that
the type of side effect that doesn t violate referential transparency is sometimes referred to as a soft side effect sine it doesn t alter the behavior of the program note before you tell me that reading the time changes the behavior of the number generated the specification of the function call says that the function returns a random number

4393613
memcpy	malloc	memmove	malloc
bcopy 3 while deprecated so prefer memmove 3 handles overlapping memory regions memcpy 3 doesn t
allocate with malloc 3 release with free 3

4395742
decoder	encoder
why not write your own base64 encoder decoder but replace those chars in your algorithm
sure it will not be able to be decoded with a normal decoder but if that s not an issue then whyt worry about it

4396581
pdfsharp	itextsharp
in the same time if it s not a problem to change the pdf generator library for your project then you may check out pdfsharp and migradoc which we re using succesfully for over 1 year now
much simpler to integrate then itextsharp requires less code it has great charting tools a much more intuitive object oriented model and the best part is that it has a great documentation with a dozen of working example projects

4398280
fgets	atoi
you shouldn t use gets use fgets or scanf with a limit instead good practice would include checking the return values of fopen fwrite fclose for errors
atoi doesn t take three arguments

4398600
javassist	cglib
you should do everything however to make your code working with javassist which is still actively maintained
remember that cglib library is not developed for about 4 years

4399158
ssl	https
when this directive is present all requests are denied which are not using ssl
this will not do a redirect to https though

4400649
updatepanel	scriptmanager
edit more directly try looking in to scriptmanager for updatepanel
since asp is just pushing the raw data not actually executing it you ll need to probably use the registerstartupscript method of the scriptmanager to programmatically inject the script to load after a partial postback

4401585
google-chrome	firefox
it s a known bug and you can t eliminate it until they fix it in the browser and judging by how fast they are to respond to some bug reports - some have been reported two years ago and still are unsolved even when the users offer a ready solution - i think we shouldn t expect google-chrome to work properly in the near future
edit also note this firefox produces the bleed effect opera doesn t render css3 gradients ie doesn t render box shadow google-chrome fails in the worst manner possible so.

4404570
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
you can t use the following since mainwindow.xib contains your app delegate and another uiviewcontroller not just your uitabbarcontroller
if i can help translate i think the scenario is essentially this he has an app with two view controllers in mainwindow.xib a uiviewcontroller and a uitabbarcontroller

4404570
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
when the button is tapped it removes the uitabbarcontroller from the superview and shows the login uiviewcontroller
when the user logs in again the uitabbarcontroller has remained in memory so the state has not changed since logging out

4410728
freebsd	linux
documentation man htobe64 on linux glibc 2.9 or freebsd
unfortunately openbsd freebsd and glibc linux did not quite work together smoothly to create one non-kernel-api libc standard for this during an attempt in 2009

4410728
freebsd	linux
unfortunately openbsd freebsd and glibc linux did not quite work together smoothly to create one non-kernel-api libc standard for this during an attempt in 2009
currently this short bit of preprocessor code tested on linux and openbsd should hide the differences

4411300
eventlet	gevent
first of all eventlet can actually use twisted for networking so in a sense it s not an either-or question it s a this-is-built-on-top-of-that question
personally i don t see the need for libraries like gevent or eventlet especially since the advent of the inlinecallbacks decorator in twisted which already write code which sorta looks like it s blocking

4414682
haskell	sml
you can write java in scala even if not advisable idiomatic but you really can t write java in haskell
i would recommend looking at scala f# sml ocaml and haskell -- but scala in particular the reason for this is scala shows that a fun statically strongly-typed high-level in a real sense oo language can exist

4416178
client-side	server-side
we would use client-side again
the server-side integration works but did not save any development time

4420244
super	self
since super works a bit differently it might mean that self is not getting retained like one would expect
one easy way to check this would be to use the calls to super as originally written and simply leak the object referred to as self and see if it works

4420797
hmac	md5
hmac is not encryption it s actually authentication integrity but its secure when used with a reasonable hash
normally i d recommend sha-256 or better but for what you re doing md5 sounds secure enough

4421117
implements	extends
neither drawable nor bitmapdrawable implements a specific .equals method that could have been adapted to check that 2 instances contain the same data so mathias lin hint to try .equals will not work
what you could do following itsik s advice without having to extends drawable is use the view.settag and view.gettag methods

4421312
required	placeholder
this won t allow the translator to re-order the sentence and it might be required due to target s language grammar rules
do not use raw placeholder like s i u if you have more than one of that kind in a sentence it is actually better to use numbered placeholder like 0 1 instead

4423157
implements	extends
if anything you could try this unfortunately this will still not work because mathsubset implements iterable but so does solutions
an easy fix would be for solutions to not extends iterable but it really sounds to me like you re trying to use a more complex approach than you need to

4424210
onclick	onsubmit
use onsubmit for the form submission handler not onclick on the submit button
you can t cancel a form submission reliably cross-brower via the submit button s onclick

4425384
boost	stl
you can get one from boost though
it s the c++ standard library or something to that effect not the stl

4427408
super	implements
so in a simplified way we can say that super invokes the method you are in of a superclass
in your case the superclass of a bacterium is object which doesn t implements #eats

4432211
implements	extends
the only objection that i can see is that extends the interface will require all derived classes to implements the interface
on the face it may seem easy to implements an interface with nops multiple times perhaps but you shouldn t have to

4436915
multiplying	multiplication
you can multiplying two quaternions together to produce a third quaternion that is the result of the two rotations
note that quaternion multiplication is not commutative meaning order matters if you do this in your head a few times you can see why

4437462
helpers	actioncontroller
if you intend to use rails unobtrusive javascript functionality read up on the new csrf_meta_tag view helpers
you should not set the secret directly on actioncontroller base.session anymore

4440278
kerberos	ntlm
so the user accounts would sit in an active directory and the usual microsoft way would be to use a protocol like ntml oder kerberos
applications are generally advised not to use ntlm although there are enterprises still using ntml and jcifs for sso

4441456
codeigniter	cakephp
use something like codeigniter benchmark it
rasmus inventor php did not like cakephp much because it had he benchmarked it a while back so things could have changed real bad performance

4442725
udp	tcp
the receiver s only choice is the receive the udp packets or let them get dropped and do something with them or not
if you use tcp then the tcp protocol includes a built-in way to do what you want called source quench .

4443739
pbkdf2	md5
when you store a hash password you should use a salt and key strengthening for example pbkdf2 to make these attacks more difficult
you should also be aware that md5 is considered broken and it is recommended not to use it for new applications

4443972
implements	extends
next define subtraits that extends the abstract trait and implements the various abstract type fields often these subtraits will be parameterized with arguments
in the lambda calculus example the subtypes are trait app extends lambda which is parameterized with two types s and t both must be subtypes of lambda trait lam extends lambda parameterized with one type t and trait x extends lambda which is not parameterized

4444683
ilist	iqueryable
you have exposed the dal to performance problems ui programmer adding a sort where it shouldn t be if you need extra control beyond the dal you could add options to the interface or a not so good idea would be to return iqueryable of ilist to limit what the ui code can do
the pros of iqueryable are numerous callers can add filters paging sorting etc

4444862
octal	binary
btw internally all java integers are binary but literals in the source code are decimal or octal
whether it s binary or decimal doesn t really have anything to do with the integer itself

4445686
inline	inlining
the keyword inline is more about telling the compiler that the symbol will be present in more than one object file without violating the one definition rule than about actual inlining which the compiler can decide to do or not to do
the problem you are seeing is that without the inline the function will be compiled in all translation units that include the header violating the odr

4446477
udp	mtu
this has an amplification effect on the packet loss rate - this table shows how the udp datagram loss rate goes up dramatically as the number of fragments used to carry it increases underlying fragment loss rate 1.00 fragments udp datagram loss rate -------------------------------------- 1 1.00 2 1.99 3 2.97 4 3.94 5 4.90 6 5.85 7 6.79 8 7.73 9 8.65 10 9.56 15 13.99 20 18.21 30 26.03 40 33.10
ensure that you do not send udp datagrams larger than the path mtu which is typically no more than 1400 bytes and sometimes less

4446477
udp	mtu
ensure that you do not send udp datagrams larger than the path mtu which is typically no more than 1400 bytes and sometimes less
such packets will be fragmented into multiple ip packets and reassembled at the destination - and if any one of those fragments is lost then the entire udp datagram will be discarded

4447303
ienumerable	ilist
so you need to change your code to look for getenumerator on the ienumerable type
you can t find getenumerator on the ilist type because the ilist type does not declare getenumerator

4447323
profiling	benchmarking
and after reading the comments trying to cut down on memory usage by rewriting to a different language without profiling first is crazy
there is no general answer to your question about performance and the benchmarking does not prove almost anything performance is too complex issue to be judged by a single test

4450575
direct3d	gdi
your problem more likely arises from the fact that direct3d in full-screen is quite a different beast
things like gdi which qt may well use to do rendering do not work by default the run-time hooks lots of bits of information

4451211
client-side	server-side
javascript was born at netscape as a client-side language and never made the transition
comparing it to the prominent server-side web languages today i think the most obvious difference is that the batteries aren t included with javascript

4454060
pthreads	fork
to answer your original question pthreads cannot guarantee the safety of calling any pthread_atfork function is async-signal safe because the kernel s implementation of signals makes that impossible
oh and if you fork in the signal handler do not allow the child to return from the signal handler

4459301
realloc	calloc	calloc	malloc
if ptr does not match a pointer returned earlier by calloc malloc or realloc or if the space has previously been deallocated by a call to free or realloc the behavior is undefined
from open groups specifications if ptr is a null pointer realloc shall be equivalent to malloc for the specified size

4459308
realloc	malloc
malloc is not required you can use realloc only
malloc n is equivalent to realloc null n

4459383
wordpress	joomla
wordpress might not get you far as i m concerned with building shops but i haven t looked into it
please don t use joomla

4460056
innodb	myisam
since then innodb was improved a lot
myisam was not

4461024
lisp	scheme
already answered here on so comparison lisp vs scheme best answer from vinko vrsalovic excerpt from practical common lisp if you ve used lisp in the past you may have ideas about what lisp is that have little to do with common lisp
while common lisp supplanted most of the dialects it s descended from it isn t the only remaining lisp dialect and depending on where and when you were exposed to lisp you may very well have learned one of these other dialects

4461024
lisp	scheme
while common lisp supplanted most of the dialects it s descended from it isn t the only remaining lisp dialect and depending on where and when you were exposed to lisp you may very well have learned one of these other dialects
other than common lisp the one general-purpose lisp dialect that still has an active user community is scheme

4461024
lisp	scheme
if you studied lisp in college and came away with the impression that it was only an academic language with no real-world application chances are you learned scheme
this isn t to say that s a particularly fair characterization of scheme but it s even less applicable to common lisp which was expressly designed to be a real-world engineering language rather than a theoretically pure language

4461024
lisp	scheme
this isn t to say that s a particularly fair characterization of scheme but it s even less applicable to common lisp which was expressly designed to be a real-world engineering language rather than a theoretically pure language
if you ve learned scheme you should also be aware that a number of subtle differences between scheme and common lisp may trip you up

4461208
erlang	ocaml
erlang has the dialyzer which can be used to statically analyze and infer types of your programs
it will not come up with as many type errors as a type checker in ocaml but it won t cry wolf either an error from the dialyzer is provably an error in the program

4466974
required	placeholder
thus your query above becomes then you will use the parameterized query calling function pg_query_params to pass the required parameters where is an array of parameters
also note that the query string is single-quoted because the n placeholder are not there for interpolation

4467078
inline	inlining
these days inline isn t a strong hint to the compiler but it does make a difference
in particular having those function definitions readily available to the compiler at the call site may enable inlining which for setters getters usually improves both speed and size of the executable

4468258
bazaar	svn
also for svn you would have to set up a local svn server repo on your machine not as simple as git mercurial bazaar
you will want to take a look at the documentation for bzr-svn which describes how to simply check out from svn with bzr

4468287
bazaar	svn
with a distributed vcs you clone an entire repository or at least a branch in bazaar s case meaning that you have all the data and metadata necessary for you to serve up your clone and have other people clone from you
unlike distributed vcses you do not create an entire copy of the repository locally when you do svn checkout

4474317
bash	subshell
bin bash cd etc # no subshell here output
as you can see below make sure your call to cd is not executing within a subshell

4475206
prepare	execute
just write a function init that will prepare all the statements that you ll use
first argument for bind should be the type of variable also you should check the return value of execute and not the also i d say that it s not a good ideea to prepare the statement each time you insert something

4475206
prepare	execute
first argument for bind should be the type of variable also you should check the return value of execute and not the also i d say that it s not a good ideea to prepare the statement each time you insert something
prepared statements should be class variables or if you re not in oop global variables so you don t prepare the statement each time you call the function

4475979
persistent	transient
no you should not persistent your presenter you should have a configuration settings appdata file where you can store that information after all is a requirement of your application and you should model it as you d model anything else
what i find useful doing is while the application is in a transient state is to reflect any change that the user does through the view in a model in the presenter

4476788
udp	tcp
so_sndbuf i think only matters for tcp in udp whatever you send goes directly out to the network
for tcp you could fill the buffer either if the remote side isn t reading so that remote buffer becomes full then tcp communicates this fact to your kernel and your kernel stops sending data instead accumulating it in the local buffer until it fills up

4476826
swt	swing
my applications require minimal user interaction so swt and jface have minimized my development time quite nicely
i can see though that if i scaled out my application to an enterprise level mvc design requiring richer interactions with users that using swt and jface may not be as suitable as using swing

4480146
memcpy	memmove
if you know buffers cannot overlap memcpy is fine and may in any given library use optimizations that allow it to be faster than memmove
in another library memcpy may actually just be memmove

4480146
memcpy	memmove
in another library memcpy may actually just be memmove
if you know src and dst cannot be aliases it is safe to use memcpy

4481205
profiler	gprof
if you find no solution then you may try out some other profiler like shark
i have heard some time ago that gprof did not work correctly on snow leopard and symptoms were like you described

4482785
webclient	httpwebrequest
but many hard not yet possible in webclient
so simply httpwebrequest is better option then webclient

4483320
vsto	add-in
you ll have to use vsto to write an add-in use the c# + office + word 2007 add-in project template to get started
using iribbonextensibility interface which is available from add-in only which means that it won t work through automation the interface is not exposed in the out-of-process type library

4486075
required	placeholder
you won t need a new validation method then as the required rule will work as intended
this doesn t answer your question exactly but seeing as you re trying to detect placeholder text and that jquery validation s code appears to use jquery s .val method for retrieving text input it makes sense to override .val with a simple wrapper that returns if the input s value is the same as element.defaultvalue

4486429
backtracking	greedy
i couldn t think of a smart heuristic to limit backtracking but this should be o n² with dynamic programming and o 2 n as written
greedy algorithm

4491217
awt	swing
awt used native libs underneath
osx has the feature to look for directories only windows does not. so youre only change is to use a dialog not based on awt swing or swt

4491654
google-chrome	firefox
this is probably why you get a confusing error message in google-chrome
the firefox error message is different and also doesn t have a useful line number although firebug does show the code which causes the problem

4491770
persistent	transient
if you only want to serialize part of your object just set specific fields as transient marking them as not to be persistent and implement serializable
just for completeness the transient keyword also closes the gap between the two

4491930
requestfactory	gwt-rpc
requestfactory uses its own servlet requestfactoryservlet and implements its own protocol for data exchange between client and server
it is not designed for general purpose services like gwt-rpc but rather for data-oriented services as we will see shortly

4493465
super	extends
pecs - producer extends consumer super - this mnemonic helps you remember that using extends means the generic type can produce the specific type but cannot accept it
using super means the generic type can consume accept the specific type but cannot produce it

4493499
bash	tcsh	bash	zsh
it depends on whether you use shells other than bash and whether you use bash-only features in your profile
if you use other sh-style shells sh ksh zsh etc but not csh or tcsh don t use bash-only features and want the same setup no matter what shell you re in you should use .profile

4495878
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
one issue you are running into is that nested uiviewcontroller do not receive the proper events such as viewwillappear
according to apple s guidelines an uiviewcontroller should fill the entire screen and not represent a partial view of course with the exceptions of the uitabbarcontroller uinavigationcontroller and uisplitviewcontroller

4495878
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
according to apple s guidelines an uiviewcontroller should fill the entire screen and not represent a partial view of course with the exceptions of the uitabbarcontroller uinavigationcontroller and uisplitviewcontroller
try setting the groupstableviewcontroller as the main controller if it is in an uinavigationcontroller try pushing it if its a split view make it the details view etc

4497638
jar	manifest.mf
making an executable jar is the same no matter gui or not
you need to specify your main-class in your meta-inf manifest.mf

4502061
queue	fifo
two immediate benefits are that you can support an arbitrary number of producers and the blocking is limited to inserting into a queue and not to actually sending the messages from the point of view of the producer that is
you could model this as a producer consumer where each thread injects messages into the tcpsender whenever they are ready and the tcpsender maintains a fifo queue of messages

4503308
namenode	hdfs
while the loss of any other machine intermittently or permanently does not result in data loss namenode loss results in cluster unavailability
the permanent loss of namenode data would render the cluster s hdfs inoperable

4506059
super	implements
of course in words it sounds super straightforward but in code it gets really messy since the all the checks and jni calls
so in my opinion i will not try to implements the whole thing from native jni code instead i will implements a helper method in java that makes all the stuff and just receives the needed data to read write the preference

4506137
postgresql	mysql
it s hunt peck support like how postgresql 8.4+ supports more analytic functions than oracle certainly more than sql server
mysql and sqlite support omitting columns from the group by but those column values are per the documentation arbitrary -- the value can not be guaranteed to be returned consistently

4506277
innodb	myisam
use innodb instead
-- myisam doesn t support any kind of foreign keys

4507221
memcpy	strcpy
you should consider memcpy
as indicated by its name strcpy works on c string which a unsigned char array is not

4508613
jar	war
update if you tell me that you ve done everything right according to your ide i d recommend one last check look at the zipped or exploded war file that you actually deploy to tomcat and make sure that you can see the jar with the .class file that the error mentions
if it s not part of the war you have to figure out what went wrong with your packaging

4508736
swt	swing
ps i still prefer swt over swing -
from my experience swt isn t available for all platforms

4509942
implements	extends
you can then create data structures that implements the protocol note that here the object implements the protocol is passed as the first parameter x - somewhat like the implicit this parameter in object oriented languages
one of the very powerful and useful features of protocols is that you can extends them to objects even if the object was not originally designed to support the protocol

4510012
prng	random
some say that getting true random protects you from any future cryptanalytic breach on the prng
but that argument holds only if you can get fresh uniformly random bits which does not happen in practice you need to apply a hash function to smooth out the gathered noise and if you use the random bits directly not as keys in an encryption algorithm

4510673
webclient	httpwebrequest
you have to create derived webclient class and override the getwebrequest method
in that method you tell the httpwebrequest not to decompress

4512235
shadowing	named
to be more exact warn when the shadowing might be dangerous when the intent of the code writer might not be clear
in the case of an int parameter and a member function having the same named it is clear that the author does not want the member to be called when he she references the parameter

4513405
ravendb	couchdb
i would like to add ravendb to the list as well
written in c# and while it is not a direct clone of couchdb it was heavily influenced by the project

4513938
google-chrome	firefox
webkit safari and google-chrome has a css pseudo-element for styling scrollbars which allows you to apply any css property to it
to learn more see this surfin safari blog post example mozilla firefox and opera do not seem to have any support for styling scrollbars

4515338
ssl	https
another edit as pointed out in a comment below remember that ssl tls isn t the only solution to all your site s security needs there is still a lot of other considerations but it does solve a few security issues for the users and solves them well even though there are ways to do a man-in-the-middle even with ssl tls
it is highly recommended these days to run the entire site on tls https that is if possible

4518264
tortoisegit	svn
since you have concerns of using git on a windows server as indicated in your comment to greg s answer i m using a bare git repo on a windows server and work on a windows workstation msysgit tortoisegit access via hostname share to bare.git and several linux vms access via ssh hostname path to bare.git without any issues regarding git except one minor problem msysgit 1.7.3.1 running on the windows workstation lacks one perl module can t remember that is needed for git svn compressing old stuff
if you re not planning to use git together with svn that doesn t matter to you

4518455
mongodb	bson
mongodb saves all data as bson not as json
you can t delete data files without stopping mongodb

4519807
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox
using border-radius on an img element works on safari v5 google-chrome v8 and firefox v4b
here s an example it does not work on firefox v3.x even with the non-standard -moz-border-radius properties

4521804
inline	inlining
any code that is volatile either not working or subject to change or is complex will not be inline
in general profile before inlining

4524184
cassini	iis
ms is trying to move people over to iis express and provides it as part of their web platform installer - so it stands to reason they will not be spending too much time plugging cassini bugs
since i was using a 2008 server i just added iis takes less than a minute created a virtual directory the vs project page allows you to do it with one button click and i m now successfully debugging on iis

4524319
postgresql	mysql
it limits postgresql to the things it does well traditional transactional db load handling is a strong point and not so great at the things that mysql often fills in the gaps on like live networked clustered storage with the ndb engine
in this case none of the different engines in mysql allow you to easily solve this problem

4524631
direct3d	gdi
still i expect the vector based apis offered by opengl and direct3d should perform far more reliably - gdi line drawing is not something driver writers strive to optimize
in answer to the update re windows ce being the target direct x has apparently been available on windows ce since at least ce 2.1 im still betting that gdi is not particularly hw accelerated on ce

4524897
coalesce	isnull
whilst coalesce can evaluate to a default of null
create view dbo.pdtest as select isnull getdate getdate as test1 coalesce getdate getdate as test2 go create view dbo.pdtest2 as select isnull getdate getdate as test1 coalesce getdate getdate null as test2 when you view the definitions of the columns of the view in management studio say the definition on pdtest shows the columns as datetime not null datetime not null

4525213
octal	decimal
i assume your values are meant to be decimal so if the user types 08 you want the value 8 not an error because 08 is invalid octal notation
giving parseint the second parameter tells it to always use that base 10 decimal

4527109
ssl	https
another forum mentioned that setting serveralias would also work. more specifically the httpd.conf file for the ssl site had the following in the virtualhost section servername www.secure.mydomain.com the certificate was registered to secure.mydomain.com and the url we were accessing was also
so simply changing the conf file to the following and restarting apache did the trick servername secure.mydomain.com the following would have also worked most likely servername www.secure.mydomain.com serveralias secure.mydomain.com here s some additional background information for future reference the two errors we saw in the system.net.trace.log were here are all the things we tried which did not resolve the issue installing intermediate certificates from the ssl certificate issuer into apache this is required changing user agent in web request no effect changing server-side and client-side time-outs and memory limits no effect testing with a static page no effect testing with other https sites they worked fine adding the cert to the trusted certificates store no effect purchase and install a certificate from a different certificate issuer no effect compare virtual host .conf files from a known working server to the problem server this led us to resolve the issue the https url could be opened in opera ie8 and firefox without any problems

4528270
profiling	debugging
bring up xcode window organizer and when in the view for jim sphone summary i think or provisioning profiling or something sorry-- i forget which.
given the warning similar to xcode doesn t have debugging information for this version of ios select collect keep organizer in view to see progress.

4529174
innodb	myisam
if you have a relational database then definitely go with innodb
myisam isn t relational since there are no declarative referential integrity etc

4529338
intersect	contains
the idea is that when a new rectangle collides with an old rectangle you resolve the collisions by breaking the old rectangle into 4 3 or 2 new rectangles that do not include the portion that intersect the newly added rectangle
we know that the old rectangle didn t intersect any other old rectangles and so because the newly created ones are contains in it we know that they don t intersect any either so you don t have to perform collision detection on them

4529545
spaces	delimiter
the second is that set applescript s text item delimiter to spaces sets the text item delimiter to the literal string spaces
thus for instance running set applescript s text item delimiter to spaces return text items of thisspaceisspaceaspacestring returns secondly even if you had instead of spaces this would split your string on spaces and not newlines

4529545
spaces	delimiter
thus for instance running set applescript s text item delimiter to spaces return text items of thisspaceisspaceaspacestring returns secondly even if you had instead of spaces this would split your string on spaces and not newlines
for instance running set applescript s text item delimiter to return text items of this is a string which is on two lines. returns as you can see string nwhich is a single list item

4531601
dictionary	map
as john mentioned dictionary cannot be used as a hashmap since it uses strict equality to check the keys of dictionary
in contrast an object can be used as a map where the keys are strings

4532352
selecteditem	selectedindex
protected override void onitemschanged notifycollectionchangedeventargs e in this method the following line will cause the exception if selecteditem is set and selectedindex is -1 which it is unless it s set before it s loaded
if selecteditem isn t set this line is never reached hence no exception

4533593
innodb	myisam
mysql depending on the engine you use can be horribly slow when using varchar indexes especially innodb
myisam will be pretty fast but it s not acid compliant so you should abandon it

4536955
listview	gridview
i do it by changing the layout parameters right inside the listview.onmeasure method like so this works because when you give the listview a mode of at_most it creates and measures all of its children for you right inside the onmeasure method i discovered this by browsing through the source code
hopefully gridview behaves the same but if it doesn t you can still measure all the contents of the gridview yourself

4537279
updatepanel	scriptmanager
if the updatemode of all the updatepanel on your page are set to conditional and your scriptmanager has partial updating enabled it really shouldn t undo everything the script did
the real problem here was that i wasn t using updatepanel correctly

4539419
jar	war
the ejb beans go into a jar file which represents the ejb module while the web related artifacts facelets backing beans utility code go into a web archive war file which represents the web module
note that a war doesn t actually have to be a file

4540574
swt	swing
well there is a possibility of doing this using path class in swt
for example the above code is not an exact translation of the swing snippet that you have posted but the intent is same

4541841
google-chrome	firefox
for instance you know that in google-chrome page xyz.com loads and renders perfectly
you can fire up firefox and see that maybe something is not quite the same and so on with the other browsers

4542606
base	fractions
consider using the decimal data type if you only use + and - you shouldn t have that problem since decimal uses a base 10 internally
the problem is that with float some fractions numbers cannot be exactly represented

4543646
super	extends
so put doesn t really work with the extends boundary types. but it works perfectly well with reading operations like get if you want a map to primarily use with put instead of get then you can use super instead of extends as in
if the library specifies extends then they are explicitly disallowing put

4543814
super	extends
to illustrate this point a call to method is for variables and fields you normally don t use bounded widecards you can do note there is no need to cast new double splitatquantity to its super type e.g number or object
extends number is not used for variables or fileds

4544674
inline	inlining
i agree with kvb s answer but here are two specific reasons not to consider throwing inline on all of their functions if they didn t care about the size of the resulting assemblies
the obvious case is that inlining anonymous functions won t work

4548128
setinterval	settimeout
what you want is closer to this it may also be worth your while to read up on setinterval as a possible alternative
settimeout is a little trickier than that because it doesn t block it doesn t finish waiting on the timeout before continuing with the program

4549764
udp	tcp
there are other alternatives such as udp or even udp multicast but these usually end up being a lot more complicated because udp doesn t guarantee that packets always arrive at the destination and they may even be duplicated or out of order
tcp ensures that the data you send either arrives complete in the correct order or doesn t arrive at all in that case the connection would be dropped

4550057
java.util.calendar	java.util.date
java.util.calendar has an horrible get int and set int int method taking an integer identifying the field instead of proper defined getter and setter
java.util.date and java.sql.timestamp extends java.util.date in the worst manner possible the documentation explicitly tell that it extends but should not be considered a is-a relationship which is really bad since extension purpose is to define an is-a relationship

4554119
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
this problem occurs when you nest a uinavigationcontroller within another uiviewcontroller in this case a uitabbarcontroller
if you had the uinavigationcontroller as the root view controller then this problem wouldn t occur

4556970
selecteditem	selectedindex
the tricky thing about this is setting selecteditem it can be the item for which isselected is true or it can be the item whose items property contains an item for which selecteditem is not null
the selectedindex property needs to work the same way

4557031
prng	random
with fixed size seeds i suppose you d look at the actual running time as well as the program complexity. for comparing one prng against another the one with a smaller faster distinguisher is worse
one common assumption even though it s not been proven is that some prngs are indistinguishable from random in polynomial time

4557885
prng	random
the idea is to devise tests of randomness where each test will try to find non-random aspects of a prng
note that what might seem to be random to a human being is not

4558737
trie	dawg
the trie in the aho-corasick algorithm is not a simple trie of the words but contains additional transitions for the failure function where do you continue after a mismatch
there is a algorithm called multibdm that uses both a trie and a dawg

4561173
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
so your code might work in ie and opera but will what i assume to be good behavior fail in the other two browser that i ve named
firefox and google-chrome do not allow a location change after the unload or beforeunload events have fired

4563182
postgresql	mysql
i d recommend postgresql mysql or mariadb
some people still thinks mysql is unstable i ve never had any problems but not worked with data larger than 1gb

4567092
postgresql	mysql
the qtsql objects provide a consistent interface to many databases including mysql sqlserver postgresql odbc etc with the ability to substitute your own drivers and still use the same interface for everything at a high level in c++ some other notable options sqlapi++ mysql++ not trying to come on like a salesman or anything and i have no affiliation with any of these but sometimes it never hurts to shop around and find something that works better for your needs
i don t know if you have your heart set on using this mysql connector driver package but there are many robust database wrappers available for free or nearly free out there if this is causing seemingly unspoken headaches for you

4568162
ienumerable	icollection
both implementations also have an optimization where if the source ienumerable is an icollection they will actually allocate the exact right buffer size to begin with using icollection count and then use icollection copyto from the source to fill their buffers
in the end you will find that they perform nearly identically in most situations but the is technically a heavier class to hang on to in the end and the toarray has that extra allocate + memcpy at the end if the source isn t an icollection to be able to hand back the exactly right sized array

4568693
octal	decimal
the atoi function only translates decimal not octal
for octal conversion use strtol or as chris jester-young points out strtoul - though the valid sizes of file permission modes for unix all fit within 16 bits and so will never produce a negative long anyway with either 0 or 8 as the base

4568992
fileoutputstream	printwriter
fileoutputstream provides everything you need
printwriter is used for writing text in files and doesn t support writing raw bytes

4569094
icomparable	compareto
compareto is not a propertly of struct but because all major structs also implement icomparable
but u is a value type and should know compareto

4570631
svg	vml
adam hooper has some brilliant ideas of what to do with a custom map using svg on the client side note that you do not necessarily need to use svg
here s an example of a map drawn on the server using imagemagick with a highlightable clickmap drawn over it by the browser where the highlighting is handled by the jquery maphighlight plugin which uses the canvas element where it is supported and vml in its place on internet explorer browsers

4572877
exponent	addition
it properly handles negative numbers nans infinities and cases which are not representable as integers due to being too large as well as doing so in an efficient manner that uses exponent and masking rather than generally-costlier floating-point operations
in addition it s regularly tested so you know it doesn t have glaring corner-case bugs in it

4572934
mvp	presenter
i think the main point of gwt mvp is that presenter activities in 2.1 do not depend on view implementation so that you can easily swap in mock views for easy testing
further it s ok to have views that depend on presenter call presenter methods but not vice versa well yes but via interface

4574238
glut	glfw	glut	sdl
glut is no longer under active development that s one reason not to use it
another is that other wrappers glfw sdl are not only under active development but generally more powerful

4574238
glut	glfw	glut	sdl
also the callback-oriented api of glut is usually not considered very usable
i mean it works and it is certainly possible to use it but both glfw and sdl want you to write the main loop of your program yourself sdl also has platform-independent yet explicit message handling which at least in my opinion results in much more clear and flexible code

4576059
glut	glfw
personnal note go for glfw because glut isn t maintained anymore i think.
i suggest you to try opengl coupled with either glfw or glut . with opengl you will be able to handle all the things that are related to graphics processing 2d 3d rendering and the role of the glfw library for instance is to add some functionalities like window management event management timers threads etc

4576122
nemerle	boo
boo primarily integrates with sharpdevelop while nemerle has visual studio 2008 integration
adding caas to a language like c# or even macros to boo is not nearly enough to reach nemerle s level of metaprogramming for which the language has been designed from the start

4576304
pascal	delphi
delphi is from mid nineties so that probably means delphi s ancestor turbo pascal not delphi
some extensions sound familiar as shortened versions of words screen was sometimes used for helpscreens a medieval form of helpfiles they are typicall ansi screens that can be loaded directly into screen memory there is a fair chance that this is something handcrafted specially if that date of 1987 and the general assumption pascal is true and not generated by some known database package at all

4577241
innodb	myisam
innodb on the other hand uses row-level locking meaning that row is the only row locked from the table during a transaction
innodb can be slower at searches because it doesn t offer full text search like myisam but that isn t a big problem when you compare it to table-level locking of myisam

4577241
innodb	myisam
innodb can be slower at searches because it doesn t offer full text search like myisam but that isn t a big problem when you compare it to table-level locking of myisam
if you use innodb like many large sites then you could use a server side search engine like sphinx for full text searches

4585668
jar	war
put it in root of the jar and get it by context classloader instead of servletcontext
the web-inf folder convention is specific to war files not to jar files

4589447
strtol	atof	strtol	atoi
instead use one of the strtol family of functions
in almost all cases atoi should not be used this also applies to atof atol and atoll

4591503
profiling	debugging
note my older instrumenting profiling does exact profiling is on the same site
you can try the process stack viewer of my open source sampling profiling you need some debugging info a .map or .jdbg file you can watch the stack also the raw stack with false positives but useful when normal stack walking is not possible of all threads and do some simple sampling profiling

4591654
profiling	debugging
profiling that s not a debugging tool
you use an profiling when you need to find bottlenecks in your application or you need to do some speed optimizations

4592648
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	viewdidload	viewdidappear
uiviewcontroller or uinavigationcontroller which implement their user interface in their own viewdidload
you should create your view controllers in viewdidload of the uitabbarcontroller not in the viewdidappear

4593638
prepare	execute
if you want to prepare this with maven you will find that copying files with maven is not trivial
you will need a way to execute code the standard choices being the maven-antrun-plugin and gmaven-maven-plugin

4595723
equals	gethashcode
when you override equals you must override gethashcode as well else dictionary won t work for you
you probably did not override gethashcode in your class

4596503
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
you should use an uinavigationcontroller in order to pop push uiviewcontroller on your screen
the navigation controller will add an uinavigationbar to your uiviewcontroller automatically so you will not need to create them as you did

4598857
equals	gethashcode
the type ultamitely uses equality to determine whether 2 objects are equals or not
in the type foo you have only overridden gethashcode and not equality

4600414
xslt	xquery
this commercial website is totally client-side xslt driven we already have an implementation of xquery in the browser xqib michael kay has blogged about his attempt to produce xslt 2.0 in the browser and there would be something working soon
some people argue that xslt isn t designed for programming in the large -- for example it lacks any separate compilation capabilities

4606132
moq	fakeiteasy
there are frameworks like moq that does not distinguish them
fakeiteasy goes even further and calls everything fake objects

4608353
invalidoperationexception	argumentexception
invalidoperationexception isn t appropriate for your scenario
argumentexception isn t appropriate either

4610845
intersect	contains
ii think that intersect function does not depend strictly on the set of points you have but on those of the minimum bounding rentangle mbr contains it
from mbrintersects g1 g2 returns 1 or 0 to indicate whether the minimum bounding rectangles of the two geometries g1 and g2 intersect

4611726
google-chrome	firefox
while there may be some way to create the hash using google-chrome or ie 8+ i did not know how to do it and was left with the box to enter my own hash
however when i used firefox the automatic option was available and the process was over and done i installed the certificate exported the p12 and was ready to roll

4614222
prepare	execute
if you have a query that doesn t run often though less than once per request a prepare statement can take longer to run
it takes two calls to use a prepare statement once to prepare it and once to execute it

4615352
spaces	delimiter
delimiter ## ... end## need to put a spaces right after delimiter and the ending end does not require
you forget to reset the delimiter to not

4619569
apache	nginx
however if you have 10 apache child processes this is not a huge deal
if you are on a server that gets these busy periods then one way to achieve better results is to use nginx instead of apache or fastcgi with apache

4619751
wordpress	joomla
i ve suggested this numerous times here s why it s ready to go right now you have a ton of flexibility and customization options available to you there is a huge wealth of example code to borrow pre-made plugins and themes or code snippets to achieve certain tasks a massive community available to you for support if you get stuck i ll bet in your area there are numerous consultants you can hire if you re in a real pinch frequently updated and serious about both security and ease of use easy to get hosting and many low-med cost hosts are comfortable with the demands of wordpress for a busy site the community isn t too commercially focused some cms communities over-encourage commercial add-ons if you get 90 there with wordpress php and want to add some additional functionality there are resources such as this wordpress and django best buddies that show you how to add a bit of enhancement
i spent 4.5 years building a commercial cms and since then i ve used many extensively wordpress drupal joomla and built some simple options based on frameworks

4620552
factors	mean
probably the latter is worse but it very much depends on the variables here - d could be the most important variable in the first example and that would make it pretty hard to compare to the second - unless we re assuming the second doesn t have a d factors say optimizations of some sort also - three loops doesn t necessarily mean less efficient although this is often the case
if statements in the outer loops could cause the inner loops not to run which could mean o n 2 despite having three nested loops

4623212
dictionary	map
you are already getting this output and your way is probably slightly faster but for a dictionary this size that doesn t matter
generator expressions are generally preferred to map and using the dictionary constructor is more canonical than dict.fromkeys

4623389
inline	inlining
the fundamental thing to realize is that the inline keyword or microsoft s __inline extension for c - since msvc doesn t support c99 is essentially a pass to violate the one definition rule
if you think about it - that s all it really is since the compiler is under no obligation to actually perform any inlining

4625909
phpunit	simpletest
phpunit is activly mainted stable and works great for every codebase every scenario and every way you want to write your tests. simpletest is unmaintained outdated and does not work well with php 5.3 released over a year ago subjective phpunit provides much nicer code coverage reports than simpletest with phpunit you also get these reports inside your ide netbeans eclipse ... i ve yet to see any argument in favor of simpletest
it s not even simpler to install since phpunit is available via pear pear channel-discover pear.phpunit.de pear install phpunit phpunit and the first test looks pretty much the same

4626109
datamapper	activerecord
in short - with activerecord you have class that handles both data and persistence - with datamapper you have data class and class that handles persistence also there is data access object pattern which can go on top of either of mentioned above
your first example looks like activerecord pattern with unreasonable static shorthand for building record object why not have multiple constructors or optional id - null for new integer for existing

4628751
clang	llvm
ok i think none of the answers below tell the whole story so here s my take on a response to my question llvm compiles code faster than gcc may create code that runs faster and the clang frontend provides more accurate error messages than gcc so there are definitely reasons for switching
that said the version provided with latest stable xcode llvm 1.6 is not 100 stable yet you can run into some minor bugs if you re unlucky

4630879
super	self
the reason self.one probably doesn t have a value is because you are doing the work before the call to the super save call
so instead do your work after saving your self

4631095
innodb	myisam
it s not reliable at all in innodb since this engine can reorder the table at will
if it s myisam you can do it in two queries this is unreliable however because it assumes rows are only added to this table and never deleted

4632403
atoi	atof	strtol	atof
i think that there could be room for errata in the man pages - it is not so clear whether the page that needs correction is the one for atoi or the one for strtol
taking a look at the manual page on macos x 10.6.6 it documents two functions atof and atof_l and i suspect that gives a hint as to why the function is deemed not thread-safe synopsis description the atof function converts the initial portion of the string pointed to by str to double representation

4632403
atof	strtod
implementation notes the atof function is not thread-safe and also not async-cancel-safe
the atof function has been deprecated by strtod and should not be used in new code

4632403
atof	strtod
the atof function has been deprecated by strtod and should not be used in new code
errors the function atof need not affect the value of errno on an error

4634357
bmp	png	png	tga
png jpeg bmp tga just read about the header and some file you might have to guess the width first
for exemple the png doesn t seem to include widht height but you should be able to read the width and guess a height with the pixel size ratio

4634792
inline	inlining
but with the virtual call you re looking at one big disadvantage to start with which is that none of the calls can be inline and i would guess a virtual call is less likely to be predicted than a non-virtual call when not inline
the gain from inlining with unknown n could be more than the gain of knowing n or it could be less

4637753
cpython	ironpython
ordinary cpython requires python .net to do the same or similar things
in my experience python .net works most of the time but not always and ironpython provides a much more polished experience in accessing .net from python

4637898
scrypt	md5
in the future scrypt or bcrypt should be used as the password hash function
md5 is a cryptographic hash not an encryption scheme

4640822
jsf	wicket
wicket by itself is a very nice web framework but in practice it isn t used as often as jsf
i won t go into the discussion whether wicket or jsf is better this is mostly a religious battle anyway but due to the popularity of jsf there are simply more people experienced with it and there is a large community offering many things for jsf like component libraries and extensions

4641532
calloc	malloc
you could also use calloc
the difference is in calling convention and effect - calloc initialises all the memory to 0 whereas malloc does not

4642578
ati	nvidia
but current-day nvidia vs ati cards for gpgpu not graphics performance but gpgpu that i do have a strong opinion about
and to lead into that i ll point out that on the current top 500 list of big clusters nvidia leads amd 4 systems to 1 and on gpgpu.org search results papers links to online resources etc for nvidia outnumber results for amd 6 1

4642893
vim	atom-editor
a quick look at vim s help tells me is exactly what to use
it tells vim that the preceding atom-editor must be in the text but not in what s matched

4643946
glut	sdl
i am not sure why you want to alter window decorations if the situation allows it might be easier to use a library that supports this natively rather than rigging glut into a solution
i know sdl ogre3d have limited abilities to control the window decorations i don t think either can round the corners though and if you really want to work with glut it is possible to get either of those libraries to give you a pointer to the opengl rendering context they use

4645564
atoi	strcpy	atoi	malloc
0 random random is parsed by atoi - undefined since we don t know what under this pointer resides. and then it s printed out.
use strlen malloc strcpy sequence instead edit it doesn t compile since you pass a char into function which accepts char

4647174
opencart	magento
having looked under the covers of both of these beasts i can t say that i actually like either of them as they re both rather ugly when you pop the bonnet and something like opencart is actually a much nice and easier to work with solution
however from a feature perspective opencart is nowhere near either magento or prestashop and unlike prestashop it doesn t have a team of developers behind it

4649380
rsa	aes
ps that doesn t mean that you should take the wikipedia entry on rsa and roll you own implementation from that one that s exactly were sony and big-n failed no use a tested open source implementation
attacking a aes or blowfish crypted file is more trivial for a cryptanalyst than if the algorithm the file is encrypted with is unknown to him.

4649724
cvs	svn
if using cvs be aware that it does not handle binary files efficiently
an svn repository makes no distinction between binary and text files

4650563
uiview	subviews
the version that i copied the source from turned out to be an old version that looked like this changing that to a uiview pointer makes it work
looking at the debug info it looks like i was wrong about the subviews not getting retained they were actually just unavailable in the debugger being cast away when the play control was pressed

4658372
kerberos	ntlm
as kennyw explains if you access the sharepoint application using the full domain name of the machine the impersonation token in the web server process which provides your sharepoint user identity under windows authentication will be obtained via kerberos and have membership of the network users group
if you use just the machine name the optimization kenny refers to gets you a logon token via ntlm which is not in the network users group and is therefore not denied access by the acls which wcf puts both on the pipe and on the shared memory object where the server publishes the actual pipe name

4658624
inline	inlining
with the inline tag the compiler understands why there are multiple definitions and will remove all but one from the application
note on inlining the processes a method does not need to be in the header file to inlined

4658624
inline	inlining
note on inlining the processes a method does not need to be in the header file to inline
modern compilers have a processes a full application optimization where all functions can be considered for inlining even if they have been compiled in different compilation units

4659630
prepare	execute
since the sqlserver extension doesn t support re-binding of a query after it s been prepare you need to do dirty hacks with references that may not be the best option
build once - execute once

4661870
ssl	https
if the asset you need is available on ssl then always use the https asset
when used on a link or import ie7 ie8 will download the file twice per update from 2014 now that ssl is encouraged for everyone and doesn t have performance concerns this technique is now an anti-pattern

4662645
qgraphicsview	qwidget
embedding qwidget into qgraphicsview has some overhead and was really designed for complex widgets that can t be easily reimplemented in terms of qgraphicitems
qlabel inside qgraphicsview is not a good idea indeed

4662948
actionscript	mxml
the language reference has this note for framerate in the application class note this property cannot be set by actionscript code
it must be set in mxml code

4666981
google-chrome	safari
for communicating between the two how to detect keyboard short cuts in javascript have tested ctrl+1 in google-chrome on windows xp
it s not just google-chrome that does this safari and some other browsers do it too

4669885
client-side	server-side
also you should not confuse the server-side id with the client-side id
the server-side id mapped to id property of controls is used to programmatically access the control from code behind

4672422
multiplying	division
as it happens dx is always positive so we can just multiplying both d1 and d2 by dx to remove the division operation without losing the information we were looking for
because the only information we care about in d1-d2 is the sign we can multiplying it by any positive value and not lose anything

4672709
multiplying	division
the correct way of doing it would be to multiplying first and then divide
the problem with the conversion is that decimal 36 4 is technically not adequate to store the intermediate result of the division of 500 by 15

4674004
client-side	server-side
the reason people bother with client-side validation is one of user-experience
client-side validation gives instant feedback - server-side validation does not

4676863
extjs	gxt
note with gwt you can still write your own jsni methods and write javascript there 3 no i would not think there are many performance issues compared to extjs
the gxt debugging support is great

4677809
google-chrome	firefox
i ve looked around a bit on the web and so far see that both google-chrome and safari do not expose these events in the browser
firefox does support something but i don t see a lot of references to this

4680506
erd	diagram
the erd diagram can sometimes look similar to the class diagram but that doesn t mean is the same as a class diagram
the class diagram contains just the classes in your object model with eventual links relationships connecting diagram elements

4680506
erd	diagram
however those links don t necessarily correspond to physical relationships like in an erd diagram but instead they represent logical connections
the class diagram is just the object model of your application and does not contain any persistence-specific information

4681595
ioexception	fileoutputstream
using it means that you don t have to deal with the possible-but-rarely-useful ioexception that can be thrown by close
you should close the fileoutputstream not the zipoutputstream because the former is what actually consumes system resources

4683734
portrait	landscape
this means that when the device is in portrait mode it still occupies the full screen
however in landscape mode it leaves some of the underlying master view to still be visible but dimmed as the user cannot interact with the uncovered master view controller

4687759
jlabel	jlayeredpane
how much the jlabel will cover will depend on its size and on the jpanel s layout manager
one way is to give the listener to the jlabel as has also been mentioned above but another way to do it is as i describe below and while perhaps not the best way it worked well for me 1 a jlayeredpane holds everything and has a mouseadapter that is added as a mouselistener and mousemotionlistener

4687759
jlabel	jlayeredpane
one way is to give the listener to the jlabel as has also been mentioned above but another way to do it is as i describe below and while perhaps not the best way it worked well for me 1 a jlayeredpane holds everything and has a mouseadapter that is added as a mouselistener and mousemotionlistener
2 a jpanel called board that uses gridlayout 8 8 and is the exact size as the jlayeredpane is added to the layered pane s bottom layer or to be precise the jlayeredpane.default_layer

4687906
tortoisegit	svn
git works great in linux and tortoisegit on windows is very nice
however it terms of fame svn not dvcs of course is still dominant especially it s client can connect to tfs via bridge

4687952
nginx	lighttpd
no event processing here so the implementation is simpler and the pool means threads are not created and destroyed unnecessarily but it can t really compete with a well implemented thread asynchronous hybrid like what you re trying to implement or nginx
the third best is asynchronous event processing alone like lighttpd or node.js

4689871
portrait	landscape
you cannot get the layout landscape portrait that way ofcourse so you ll have to get the screen width height to check if the current be it changed or not but you ve checked that
position is landscape or portrait so if the rotation is 0 and you get landscape with above metrix your device is default landscape

4690411
udp	tcp
rtp generally runs on top of udp to get away from tcp s streaming behavior tcp always delivers data in-order which is not optimal for real-time applications
it might be possible to do a dumb forwarder that is not rtp-aware but instead is configured to accept udp packets to port x and forward all traffic to host y packet by packet

4691191
trie	tree
i want to address just one point in your question a trie is not a general-purpose dictionary data structure
the reason is that a trie is a specialized search tree for sub string search

4691904
inline	inlining
racket will usually want to inline references to bindings that are never mutated in the code so if you try that last piece of code you will not be able to further redefine + on the repl
you can deal with that in one of two ways -- the first is to mutate the binding explicitly which makes the compiler avoid any inlining

4694941
spaces	delimiter
the selector selects elements that have the specified attribute with a value containing a given word delimiter by spaces
since ids cannot contain spaces i m guessing that you want which selects elements that have the specified attribute with a value containing the a given substring

4695653
boost	stl
an unordered container is the term they came up with for boost and c++0x because they did not want the name to clash with already existing implementation of hash_set and hash_map
and thus though the not documented in the sgi stl the unordered kind approximates the previous hashed kind

4695754
postgresql	mysql
if you re not married to mysql postgresql has a postgis extension that natively handles geographic data including queries against it
if you re set on mysql i d do it as points so you can query against individual points

4699245
svg	vml
i think for hundreds even up to thousands of objects then svg performance is not going to be too bad certainly no worse than any other way you might approach it
the main performance issue would be in ie where you d have to use some method to fall back to vml or flash and you say you re not too concerned about ie8 support

4699906
gridbaglayout	boxlayout
it sounds to me like gridbaglayout would be a better fit for you either that or miglayout though you ll have to download that first since it s not part of standard java
either that or combine layout managers such as boxlayout for the lines and gridlayout to hold all the rows

4700756
vim	emacs
but vim did not allow me to cursor down to a blank line under hello
emacs did allow me to cursor down to a blank line under hello

4702819
jlabel	jlayeredpane
setbounds shouldn t work with a non-null layout and your problem is happening because changing the text in the jlabel stimulates a re-layout of the jpanel and since jpanels by default use flowlayout the jlabel stays at the top in the middle
so if you really need this functionality then consider setting the layout of the jpanel to null or else use a jlayeredpane

4707033
memcpy	memmove
in theory memcpy might have a slight imperceptible infinitesimal performance advantage only because it doesn t have the same requirements as std copy
from the man page of memcpy to avoid overflows the size of the arrays pointed by both the destination and source parameters shall be at least num bytes and should not overlap for overlapping memory blocks memmove is a safer approach

4707033
memcpy	memmove
from the man page of memcpy to avoid overflows the size of the arrays pointed by both the destination and source parameters shall be at least num bytes and should not overlap for overlapping memory blocks memmove is a safer approach
in other words memcpy can ignore the possibility of overlapping data

4708370
mdpi	hdpi
on an hdpi screens it will result in 15 pixels because hdpi is 1.5 mdpi
note that though the constants for various densities are similar to dpi mdpi is 160 etc density is not exactly dpi

4710274
vbscript	vba
so my assumption until now is that there are way too much kind of constructs that are simply not translatable from vbscript to c#
i m translating read rewriting a ms access vba application since two years to c# and found out that even the online available converters like this one which is more vb.net but anyway fails at most basic conversions

4714751
allocator	stl
if you rolled a custom string class that didn t allocate anything in it s default constructor or checked your stl implementation then swaptimizing it would guarantee no redundant allocator
for example my msvc stl uses sso and doesn t allocate any heap memory by default so by swaptimizing the above i get no redundant allocator

4714751
allocator	stl
you could improve performance substantially too by just not using expensive heap allocator
there are allocators designed for temporary allocations and you can replace the allocator used in your favourite stl implementation with a custom one

4715251
invalidoperationexception	argumentexception
if the basket does not exist sounds like a argumentnullexception or an invalidoperationexception depending whether the variable is a parameter or not
if xyz must be greater than 1 sounds like an argumentexception

4716111
boost	stl
if you don t want to use c++0x you could use boost instead but that s not in the stl
i m pretty sure that regular expression support was added in c++0x so there are no stl things that support it until then

4716421
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
even if you have some code that throws a nullpointerexception and it is code that you do not control and cannot fix you should determine the input parameters that cause the nullpointerexception and specifically test for them
another exception that you shouldn t catch is the illegalargumentexception

4716644
oncreate	findviewbyid
you could simply call findviewbyid in your onresume method to get a reference to it in that method or you could change ib to an instance variable so that it is accessible in methods other than oncreate
findviewbyid does not create the view it is just finding the already created view

4716907
persistent	transient
the last comment on this thread specifies it very well persistent is well defined
it makes a transient instance persistent. however it doesn t guarantee that the identifier value will be assigned to the persistent instance immediately the assignment might happen at flush time

4719381
ssl	https
ssl https tls is still encryption and unless you are using it just for authentication then you should get the proper approval
i just received approval and my app is in the store now for something that uses ssl to encrypt data traffic not just authentication

4720328
jar	manifest.mf
if that s indeed true you ve got to either drop the jar file in tomcat lib folder if you use the container managed datasource approach for a fast connection pool or in webapp s web-inf lib folder if you use the poor man s class#forname approach to load the driver
if it s not and it s actually a java application which is to be executed as a jar then you ve got to specify the classpath in manifest.mf file of the jar in question

4722178
vb.net	vb6
vb had its own runtime where vb.net is one of many languages that use the more modern .net framework
if you re making a choice for a new project then the pertinent points are vb6 is legacy released 1998 the ide is no longer supported and the runtime only supported for the lifetime of win8 vs2008 doesn t support vb6 vb.net is a modern language supported in vs2008 i d say there are very few reasons if any

4722178
vb.net	vb6
if you re making a choice for a new project then the pertinent points are vb6 is legacy released 1998 the ide is no longer supported and the runtime only supported for the lifetime of win8 vs2008 doesn t support vb6 vb.net is a modern language supported in vs2008 i d say there are very few reasons if any
to choose vb.old over vb.net

4722445
vb.net	vb6
vb6 was interpreter based language while vb.net is a compiled language vb6 was not a type-safe language while vb.net is a type safe language
there is no variant type in vb.net and no magical type conversions happen in vb.net some other differences inheritance vb.net supports inheritance by allowing you to define classes that serve as the basis for derived classes

4726171
boost	stl
consider using a smart pointer that has appropriate move semantics like a boost smart pointer or if you ve got a very new compiler one of the c++0x smart pointers
however do not use the current standard s std auto_ptr inside of stl containers

4727704
viewdidload	viewwillappear	viewdidload	viewdidappear
when you display other view controllers and then come back some how to this original view1 view controller unless there was a memory event that jettisoned it from memory it will not call viewdidload again
instead it will call the following in order viewwillappear viewdidappear in viewwillappear you have a place to do things off screen before your view controller is displayed

4727705
passenger	webrick
nginx + mongrel nginx + passenger apache + mongrel apache + passenger there is phusion passenger standalone but that s really an nginx + passenger compiled together so i m not counting it although it may be a good option for some people. a larger site may then add specialized layer 7 hardware netscaler f5 ... in front of the servers
four choices there are really four choices well plus webrick but that would be an unusual choice for a production server

4729392
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
from the spec when comparing two uris to decide if they match or not a client should use a case-sensitive octet-by-octet comparison of the entire uris with these exceptions - a port that is empty or not given is equivalent to the default port for that uri-reference
- comparisons of host names must be case-insensitive

4729588
matlab	simulink
to convert simulink models or matlab m-code to c you need real-time workshop . it supports only subset of matlab language and oriented for embedded systems
look also at other matworks products for code generation and application deployment with matlab compiler you will not get a c code but a binary code executable or library dll which will run on machines without matlab installed but with matlab compiler runtime mcr library

4730608
punctuation	words
it might not be the most memory-efficient way to count words but it does a pretty good job at ignoring punctuation marks and other non-word characters the output will be words count 4
when using nstextstorage you can use the words method to get to the number of words

4730968
ssl	https
soapaction indicates it s probably not using ssl
you d expect it to have https in that uri

4731485
hex	binary
approaches that i have seen work with binary files a long time ago people expanded the old and the new versions of a binary file into temporary text files every byte expanded to 3 bytes 2 hex digits and a newline . then run these two text files through an old version of diff that definitely couldn t handle binary files to make a patch file. then we transmitted that text patch file over communication lines that were not yet 8-bit-clean. on the receive end one expanded the old binary file into a temporary text version then patched that old text file and then compressed the new text file back into a binary file compressing each pair of hex digits into one byte and throwing away the newlines and any carriage returns that might have crept in
more recently i have been using rsync or some utility built on top of it such as unison . it handles arbitrary binary files just fine. i generally do a live update with unison running on my local machine and rsync running on the file server talking back and forth to each other

4732488
onresume	onpause
in the onresume of this activity and setrequestedorientation activityinfo.screen_orientation_sensor
in onpause and it works just fine when i enter the activity it sets to portrait if it s not and doesn t allow to change and on exitting the sensor works again.

4733780
ssl	https
it makes things much more difficult for you more things to go wrong without adding much safety over that already provided by that ssl connection
the scenario where adding encryption helps is when the messages sent over https have to go via untrusted proxies. base-64 is not encryption

4736939
armadillo	lapack
take a look at armadillo directly if it is the former situation
most if not all of the things you mention are provided by lapack or blas fortran code that r links to not something r provides new code for itself

4739146
phpmyadmin	mysql-workbench
what i think you should do i think you should install phpmyadmin on your server this will allow you to access your database from work school cafe etc mysql-workbench is more advanced and gives you more features so you can deal with changing the structure and editing any rows columns relations and much more look at phpmyadmin s features it has most if not all
phpmyadmin it works in any web-browser i really recommended phpmyadmin it has many sql features to help you deal with everything when it comes to the mysql database if you are using innodb then you get even more features such as relation-ships between tables

4739171
base	fractions
here you can use the usual base 10
because you are representing the 64-bit aliased integer not the 52-bit fraction. you can also just write more decimal fractions digits

4741352
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
the time place to programmatically add buttons to the uinavigationbar is not when and where you construct the uinavigationcontroller but rather by the individual uiviewcontroller s when they are loaded as you push onto the uinavigationcontroller
i only had to add a done button to the uinavigationcontroller s uinavigationbar in the viewdidload method of the first uiviewcontroller pushed onto the uinavigationcontroller

4741707
config	ini
for example you might user the server name you might also consider having a local config file unique to whatever environment you re on
this could be an ini file or php file that just defines the above variables and is included but isn t under version control and doesn t get changed very often

4745227
postgresql	mysql
there are two major considerations here mysql is designed for speed over everything else postgresql is not the default mysql table type does not even handle transactions.
these extra features supported by postgresql can add a fair bit of overhead in some situations to make them possible.

4746355
implements	extends
looks like you don t need to perform these tasks in separate threads at all but if you really want to you could do something like this assuming that a and b are subclasses of thread which is discouraged in favor of implements runnable and using new thread runnable .start
a better way to do this would be to use an executor and have a and b implement runnable not extends thread

4748130
coalesce	isnull
also note that coalesce has been part of standard sql since 1992 - i m not sure ifnull is in any standard yet
there s a nice article by adam machanic about benchmarking an equivalent scenario - performance isnull vs

4748850
jar	manifest.mf
it looks like from the comments that embedding the jar in the bundles isn t going to work
we were able to get axis 1.4 to work as a bundle by changing some of the axis 1.4 source code via this post we also took the manifest.mf from the springsource axis and just drop it into the newly compiled axis jar

4750510
pthreads	fork
this is not required but recommended by the standards pthreads
if you have used stdout at all before fork you must call fflush stdout before fork and likewise for any other output file s you use

4750678
rvm	bundler
if you have rvm then you should do this works like a charm
youre problem here is that your textmate environment doesn t find bundler because it can t find your gemset folder

4751393
nhibernate	queryover
nhibernate linq and createcriteria should live quite happier together
not sure if is it possible using linq alone also i don t think it is possible using queryover but one way may be to use createcriteria as you have pointed out

4751531
uiview	calayer
to be more specific a calayer associated with a uiview will never implicitly animate
calayers that you create yourself and that are not associated with a uiview will buy into the normal implicit animation machinery

4752976
tabcontrol	tabitem
actually thinking about it you should be creating a list of tabitem to set to the itemssource of your tabcontrol and binding your class to the tabitem
your question is a bit unclear but you can t bind your class termino directly to the itemssource of the tabcontrol as it s not derived from tabitem

4753697
mef	prism
it has builtin support for mef which in turn is builtin to .net 4.0 but it s not your only choice
look at some of the samples included in prism and decide what approach you like better

4754066
ssl	https
one additional consideration - if your site is ssl and you need to support android 2.1 or earlier the ssl certificate on the https version of the microsoft cdn will crash those versions of the android browser per this issue
it s not microsoft s fault as the ssl certificate is technically valid and the defect is in android s ssl implementation.

4754166
bazaar	git
currently the counts of questions are git 5 789 mercurial 1 845 bazaar 188 demonstrating this in pie chart form now this shouldn t be taken as a sign that git is more difficult to use than mercurial but rather that there s a lot of people asking questions about it and receiving help about
this means that if your newbies got stuck they d have a greater chance of receiving help in the git tag than in the bazaar tag

4758858
bmp	png
it s because by default the bmp file format doesn t support transparency while the png file format does
if you want transparency you are going to have to use png

4759461
addition	multiplication
as a general rule addition subtraction and multiplication take roughly the same time on a large number of processors
you might imagine that multiplication is a lot slower but it turns out not to be

4759923
django	web.py
the web.py framework was not designed specifically for gae. the webapp framework is the default tool set for building web applications in google app engine but not the only one. source developing with google app engine by eugene ciurana they use different templating languages web.py uses its own whereas webapp s templating language is based on django
other python frameworks for gae other python frameworks for gae neither of which use the django templating language include flask a microframework for python based on werkzeug jinja 2 and good intentions. tipfy a small but powerful framework made specifically for google app engine

4762118
inline	inlining
among other problems inlining can lead to there is the compatibility problem if you change the body of a function that is not inline you only need to recompile the unit where it is defined and everyone starts using the new implementation right away
with inline functions you need to recompile every unit that includes the relevant header which can be a pain especially if the header is used across different projects by different people

4762708
csv	tsv
the biggest problem with using phpexcel is that it s slow and uses a lot of memory which isn t an issue for reasonably sized files but if your excel csv file has hundreds or thousands of rows this library becomes unusable
here is a php method that will take some tsv data and output an excel file to the browser note that it uses the excel5 writer which means the file should be compatible with older versions of excel but i no longer have access to any so i cannot test them

4762977
ssl	https
if using apache2 check that you are using port 443 for ssl
this can be done by setting the ports.conf file as follows listen 80 listen 443 https make sure you do not have more than one ssl certificate sharing the same ip

4762977
ssl	https
this can be done by setting the ports.conf file as follows listen 80 listen 443 https make sure you do not have more than one ssl certificate sharing the same ip
please ensure that all ssl certificates utilise their own dedicated ip

4764848
client-side	server-side
it s only client-side validation that does not work with inherited attributes
the reason for that is that mvc uses strict type equality when mapping server-side attributes to client validation behaviors

4766740
h.264	webm
watch out the h.264 codec is burdened by software patents and a commercial licensing scheme
webm sometimes known as vp8 will soon play in everything else that doesn t support flash or h.264

4769411
innodb	myisam
try converting it to innodb first
the table may be in myisam format which does not support foreign keys

4769496
pthreads	fork
note that while c++ does not specify _exit and c99 leaves it implementation-defined whether it flushes buffers pthreads requires that it not flush buffers since this would break the main usage of _exit _exit handling failure of execve after fork
as pthreads does not align itself with c++ standards or defer to them on anything i think it s very unlikely that a future version of the c++ standard would try to change any of this

4771729
rtp	rtcp
1 raw sockets seems unnecessary for this application 2 yes 3 rtp runs on top of udp of course it adds overhead
in many ways rtp ignoring rtcp is pretty much the bare minimum already and if you implemented a half-way decent alternative it would save you a few bytes at best and you wouldn t be able to use any of the many rtp test tools

rtp	rtcp
in many ways rtp ignoring rtcp is pretty much the bare minimum already and if you implemented a half-way decent alternative it would save you a few bytes at best and you wouldn t be able to use any of the many rtp test tools
7 sip is completely independent of rtp

4771738
client-side	server-side
the key here is to make sure that your back-end application only exposes objects that pertain to your application domain in the sense of domain driven design so that your client-side code doesn t spend time refactoring data after deserializing it from a server call and before serializing it in preparation for a save
to that extent i had to make a few changes to my server-side presentation layer but as a result i think my client-side code is cleaner and more focused on processing actual user events

4772890
vim	emacs
in vim you have make and cn with cn to go through compiler errors warnings but its not real time with auto spelling fixes like eclipse
i think you have to go the other way and put emacs vim into eclipse

4773048
aggregate-functions	sum
the aggregate-functions sum ignores null values but the addition operator does not - the value of 1 + null is null not 1 as you might expect
as a result the sum will be lower than expected

4776508
bash	zsh
ttyctl is a zsh builtin so you cannot use it from bash
console options are set by stty so you may want to save its options to a bash variable and restore them after vim exits like this but it is probably the better way to use zsh for this task if you put the only line ttyctl -f into your .zshrc then zsh will automatically restore terminal options after program exits

4778678
octal	decimal
octal digits are only 0 through 7 so 789 is not a valid octal number
the only solution here is to remove the 0 from the beginning of the number assuming you meant to have the number be in decimal ..

4778681
allocator	stl
any linked-list container list map set will do this in constant time while array-like containers vector will do it in linear time with constant-amortized allocator
-sorting considering that you can keep a sorted collection at all times this isn t much of an issue any stl container will allow that

4782650
serializable	deserialization
from your code i expect that the signature of post is if that s the case then you d need to serializable your dictionary postvenue and add the serializable string to the dictionary
the code accepting the post would then need to deserialize however since you re calling a method on an api i suspect that you might not be able to supply the deserialization info to the called party

4783342
factors	mean
note that you might get duplicates if some prime factors have a greater multiplicity than one -- these can be filtered out using set non_prime_factors
numpy wouldn t help too much in this context. edit by contains all factors according to there multiplicity above i mean that say 2 should appear twice in the list if it is a prime factor of multiplicity 2 4 is the highest power of 2 which is a factor of the number

4783342
factors	mean
numpy wouldn t help too much in this context. edit by contains all factors according to there multiplicity above i mean that say 2 should appear twice in the list if it is a prime factors of multiplicity 2 4 is the highest power of 2 which is a factors of the number
edit 2 if there are prime factors with a high multiplicity the above code is inefficient

4785162
clang	llvm
clang is not doing any optimisations at all
there is an llvm pass tailcallelim which may do what you want but it is not guaranteed

4785506
openssl	m2crypto
the problem is that the m2crypto setup.py by default points to but if that openssl directory is the source tree include isn t the right place to look on windows at least - you need to be looking in inc32 otherwise opensslv.h is just a line pointing to a different file which is why swig bombs out on line 1
actually the problem here isn t swig but i ll leave this question answer for the next m2crypto user that comes along - maybe it will help them

4790729
union	distinct
you need to use a union select america as country union select england as country union select distinct c.country as country from tb_country c union will remove duplicates
union all will not but is faster for it

4794642
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari
i assume webkit might use gtk or qt but i am not sure and for opera i have no idea but i assume they use some form of framework or toolkit
the main are trident ie and derivats webkit safari google-chrome khtml kde konqueror this was the base for webkit presto opera you can read more here these engines create an object structure of the html and then use components to build the page the browser engine does not render pixel by pixel but uses buttons comboboxes image elements all of which in them self render to a buffer and then those imagebuffers are collapsed to the screen

4794877
google-chrome	firefox
i suspect what you re seeing is a preflight followed by a failing google-chrome request due to a bug
that would explain why things work in firefox but not in google-chrome

4797537
boost	stl
for that take a look at boost pointer container library or smart pointers
the simplest option would probably be a standard stl container of pointers since const -ness is not propagated to the actual objects

4798840
union	distinct
or use a triplet of left right and inner and union all the query is also very wrong because you have a group by but your select columns are not aggregates
after you convert this properly to left + right + union you still have the issue of getting an offername and merchantname from any random record per each distinct of.merchantid and not even necessarily from the same record

4800354
inline	inlining
it s important to note as it whittles down the conditions under which a method may be inline
while hans answer is correct there is one omission not necessarily about when a method is eligible for inlining but when a method is not

4800886
requestfactory	gwt
i know it looses most of the meaning to do so but this is seems to be the current deal with roo gwt. the whole ui infrastructure that roo generates is based on requestfactory
it is not a gwt artifacts it very specific thing gwt requestfactory entityproxy framework that causes you troubles because as of gwt 2.1.1 inheritance of entities and its entityproxies try not to run gwt setup than it will not generate gwt related code but you will have your entities and stuff

4802994
implements	extends
here is the request to implements extends in the ie bug tracker in earlier versions of ie the selection api is completely different and does not have any support for programmatically creating backwards selections either
it s possible in recent versions of all major browsers except ie via the extends method of the selection object

4804813
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome has a design policy that forbids you from using xmlhttprequest to load local files
firefox does not have this policy

4807500
client-side	server-side
it s not a trivial task to get really snappy performance using either load-on-demand or self-contained client-side garguantuan datasets
load-on-demand can suffer from server-side latency

4809182
profiling	debugging
if the provisioning profiling is not on the device xcode will also install it
when you build and go or build and debugging in device mode in xcode then your app will automatically be installed on your device

4809396
svg	vml
see also the top answer to this question for example xsl transform svg to vml
you mention that you are doing this because ie doesn t support svg

4809586
nfa	dfa
as a result a posix nfa engine is slower than a traditional nfa engine and when using a posix nfa you cannot favor a shorter match over a longer one by changing the order of the backtracking search
traditional nfa engines are favored by programmers because they are more expressive than either dfa or posix nfa engines

4810387
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
the orientation change method shouldautorotatetointerfaceorientation just like the other viewwill methods are not broadcast to all uiviewcontroller they are passed down the hierarchy from the top level window from class to class
built-in uiviewcontroller like uinavigationcontroller and uitabbarcontrollers explicitly pass down these calls to their children that s why it seems like a broadcast when they arrive but when you insert your own uinavigationcontroller subclass to the vc hierarchy you must yourself pass down these calls to any children uinavigationcontroller

4815393
jpql	hql
you could also query using jpql hql and explicitly fetch-join the lines as russ decribes but you get a larger result set than you would with a batch fetching approach if the size of the raw data transferred proves to be too high you can disable fetching explicitly by removing fetch from the query in the relevant places
note that there is a maintenance issue using jpql because the compiler cannot check all the property names for you and if fetching is off for all associations then the query is a net cost

4817455
factors	mean
edit - for further reading on the subject of just how much you can abuse sql while keeping it valid see this wonderful post by phil factors - evil code
as far as i m concerned there is nothing overly wrong with it as long as your not colliding with a system function however just because is a valid variable name doesn t mean you should use it

4817787
serializable	deserialization
firstly because log isn t serializable so any attempt of serializing your class will fail too
if you declare your logger transient then as is the logical thing to do your log field will not be initialised after deserialization so you ll get an npe while trying to log stuff

4818487
jar	manifest.mf
if you decide to not use an external tool then your alternative is to put the library helper jars in the classpath in the manifest and then copy the jars themselves in a directory path relative to your main jar
edit op asked for an example manifest.mf

4821239
apache	nginx
as shown on that page it s very lightweight and apache is not even necessary
as you get to needing more performance you might use nginx or apache as a reverse proxy serving your static files quickly and something like thin to make your application run faster

4822907
apache	nginx
alternatively and not recommended but if it must go straight from apache to the browser you could specify the port
in apache set up an alias in your virtual host to serve this file directly alias url to open-flash-chart.swf full path to open-flash-chart.swf then instead of using to reference the file code in the absolute path nginx will still proxy the request because it s not your media path and then apache will deliver the file back to nginx

4825911
super	implements
additional note however based on the documentation you should not call super method probably the reason for infinite loop is caused by not implements view property appropriately
since you are just inheriting what s being implements in super class uiviewcontroller if you don t call super methods then implementation that needs to be done is not done

4825911
super	implements
since you are just inheriting what s being implements in super class uiviewcontroller if you don t call super methods then implementation that needs to be done is not done
almost all super methods do something critical and the local class inheriting super class implementations must either override them all together unless you know everything about what super does by referring to the documentation it s never a good idea or just add local class implementation to the inherited super class implementations

4826047
implements	extends
arraylistdemo itself doesn t implements the interfaces or extends arraylist
arraylist only has to implements the methods which aren t already present in abstractlist

4826055
implements	extends
as arraylist allready implements those interfaces you do not need to do so yourself
arraylistdemo is not extends arraylist it is just using one

4826060
implements	extends
and arraylist is full implements
not at all because arraylistdemo does nt extends or implement any class object of course

4826632
oncreate	onstart
if this does not help with your instance state being null in your oncreate and you are sure it was saved correctly you will probably want to restore your instance state before the rest of your code in oncreate
also note from the same link for onrestoreinstancestate this method is called after onstart when the activity is being re-initialized from a previously saved state given here in savedinstancestate

4830314
tabcontrol	tabitem
with this tabcontrol i can add or remove items from a collection of viewmodel and my changes will be reflected on user interface
mytabcontrol.cs mainpage.xaml notice that the properties are called myitemssource and myselecteditem because this tabcontrol use objects not tabitem

4832843
tortoisegit	svn
you had the same error with tortoisegit and it turned out to be a path issue tortoisegit couldn t find git or actually some associated dll
since tortoisesvn don t need svn to run is svn.exe or other dll s in the path and would conflict somehow with tortoisesvn

4834429
hex	binary
so here is the code i came with the function to convert binary to hex string is from converting binary data to hexadecimal string i know that in sql 2008 we can use convert function to do this as this post explained sql server 2008 new binary hex string conversion but this was not an option in my case
however it will be good if someone has a better idea how we can use sql bitwise operations on binary data type

4834763
apache	nginx
if you do not require the performance of nginx then you may find a pragmatic solution is to just use apache
i use nginx as a reverse proxy in front of apache but that introduces some additional issues with getting the remote_addr passed to php notably mod_rpaf

4835136
dbcontext	objectcontext
from there you can set your poco s objectcontext dbcontext property which has to be either public or internal
you shouldn t do this because you want to keep persistence concerns out of your domain objects but if you must you can hook into the objectmaterialized event fired by objectcontext

4837039
boost	stl
boost pointer container are very much like smart pointers that could hold multiple objects and provide a nicer syntax that containers of pointers in general
regarding his comparison to a i think it is simply because this is the traditional way of implementing a vector of pointers in the absence of move semantics no unique_ptr since auto_ptr cannot be used in stl container

4839399
backbone.js	javascriptmvc
not surprisingly i had the same candidate backbone.js javascriptmvc and knockout.js
backbone.js won i wasn t be required to follow conventions or replace what was already in place i ve easly hacked in its codebase to understand what wasn t clear from the documentation i ve successfully ignored a large amount of its features that was not interesting for me it gave acceptable performance on busy pages it works backbone.js is lightweight and relatively magic-free

4841734
ubuntu	linux
here is an example from a ubuntu configuration manual search for hostname
generally this needs to be configured on both the relay and machine level i m not sure what system you re using but in my experience with linux windows operating systems this should solve your problem

4843827
stateless	stateful
very often stateless session beans can be used for a lot of business problems
stateful does not necessarily means only a remote server keeps state although this is certainly one of the options

4844080
slug	permalinks
if you want to use slug with friendly_id you have to use slug table
in friendly_id many slug could reference same resource slug are not permalinks but only a seo friendly name . if you want something ligter than friendly_id i suggest to use stringex

4844874
lxml	beautifulsoup	elementtree	beautifulsoup
use elementtree from the standard library or lxml if you need a more powerful xml library
i d not recommend beautifulsoup not even for html parsing

4845844
ssl	https
https is a protocol used to prevent watching the data being sent between you and the server by isps or public wifi hijackers and other cases it may not prevent a spyware on your server to read it to post data using ssl you only need to set the action attribute to a full https end url assuming you already installed an ssl certificate
from wikipedia hypertext transfer protocol secure https is a combination of the hypertext transfer protocol with the ssl tls protocol to provide encrypted communication and secure identification of a network web server

4845966
ocaml	scheme
i am not familiar with ocs scheme but i would expect an interpreter for a garbage-collected language written in ocaml to use weak pointers they let you piggy-back on ocaml s memory management
in ocaml s defense i do not think that the custom method block contains the name of the type retrospectively that seems like a good thing to have

4847478
uiview	subviews
and then include the following in any of your uiresponder methods such as wherever you instantiate your uiview set the forwardabletouchee property to whatever view you d like the events to be forwarded to
if the view you want to forward the touches to doesn t happen to be a subviews superview you can set up a custom property in your uiview subclass like so make sure to synthesize it in your .m synthesize forwardabletouchee

4847855
jar	war
the fact that you have added the mysql jar as an external dependency means that it would not be added to the war that you would be deploying
the short answer to your question is that you need that mysql jar to be on the classpath of your webapp which you would do by placing it in then restart tomcat that is if you use tomcat

4849676
listview	gridview
to reorder columns programmatic you need to modify listview.view s columns collection for example assuming listview is your listview and its view is a gridview with at least 2 columns this code will put the first column at the end
to reorder rows programmatic you modify the collection behind the listview if the listview has no sorting if it has one should not want to change the order of the rows

4849863
inline	inlining
static methods and non-virtual instance methods can certainly be inline
inlining may cross namespaces of course and assemblies not so obvious because it happens at run-time when the jit compiles the method call

4849971
union	distinct
i removed all three the non-distinct union is union all and moved the distinctness to the outer query with count distinct author
you could wrap the query in a subquery select count distinct author from select author from comics where author not in select email from bans union all select email from users where email not in select email from bans as subqueryalias there were two distinct s in your query and union filters out duplicates

4850475
calloc	malloc
calloc also initialises your memory to zero
3 you do not need to cast the return type of malloc

4853130
mp3	wav
the only thing built into the flash player is mp3 support
i am not aware of an as3 wav codec so you ll have to write your own to make this happen

4853850
vaadin	wicket
this is only a guess and is not based on actual performance testing probably wicket will be doing better than vaadin
one final thing is getting cool nice looking ui is much easier with vaadin

4855988
profiling	debugging
version 10.1 does not work with the profiling
you have to use version 10.0 of the flash player the debugging version

4856683
division	subtract
from epoch converter this will truncate it because of integer division so make it 10000000.0 to maintain the sub-second portion or just don t do the division
it s important to note that the .ticks property you get is relative to jan 1 0001 and not jan 1 1970 like in unix which is why you need to subtract that offset above

4857814
opera	firefox
their implementation and opera s force you to use fully qualified uri s but apart from that the hta s work as expected
firefox seems to cache old versions of the hta s and doesn t download new ones though it appears to download something

4858984
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome safari i only see simple response headers in the result of getallresponseheaders even when the access-control-expose-headers header is set in the response
and in firefox 3.6.13 getallresponseheaders doesn t return anything not even simple response headers

4860003
serializable	deserialization
note that xmlserializer is a tree serializable not a graph serializable so it will fail
the usual fix here is to disable upwards traversal note you will have to manually fixup the parents after deserialization of course

4862272
inline	inlining
this is an internal optimization and even if you declare a function inline the compiler may chose to not do so
some compilers allow you to control inlining to some extent

4862696
google-chrome	firefox
window.title isn t supported by google-chrome but document.title is
it works in google-chrome firefox and opera on both linux and windows

4864181
multiplying	subtract
we subtract from 5395 because we counted from 0 to 5394 which is 5395 numbers solution is take each digit that is 1 subtract one and multiplying by 9 for each digit that appears after it
if the number is 1 we do not subtract one

4865778
ubuntu	linux
so to solve this problem of the emulator not being accessible to computers other than the host machine you intercept the incoming connections to your host and forward them to 127.0.0.1 here s how first install rinetd linux either download it from the link above or in a terminal in ubuntu enter sudo apt-get install rinetd
the command could be different in other linux distros.

4866081
memcached	apc
everything else is either redis or memcached
well the documentation is pretty clear on that apc does not support tagging

4866081
memcached	apc
if you want to take advantage of the tagging and the two level caching your might want to use memcached as fast then you ll have tagging available
you could still hack your way in adding support for tagging to the apc backend of zend by extending it but i would not recommend it

4868757
freebsd	linux
a brief summary of platforms i ve checked linux possible here syscall sys_gettid getpid is what you want freebsd not possible here thr_self seems random and without relation to getpid openbsd not possible here there is no way to get a tid netbsd possible here _lwp_self always returns 1 for the main thread solaris possible here pthread_self always returns 1 for the main thread so basically you should be able to do it directly on mac os x freebsd and openbsd
you can use the tid pid approach on linux

4869013
allocator	stl
the device you are using may not support large allocator however take care to not exceed whatever limits the hardware and the os enforce
as for ndk libraries the c++ stl and a subset of the c std libraries and some subset of the posix apis are provided plus a few android specific apis

4869145
jquery	curvycorners
what i would do is use two divs one for the outer and one for the inner border and the css3 border-radius with a jquery plugin for ie
the jquery plugin i would recommend is curvycorners it does not require you to change anything

4871170
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
you can put a uinavigationcontroller inside a uitabbarcontroller but not the other way around
if you have a uitabbarcontroller the easiest thing to do is to assign different view controllers uiviewcontroller subclasses to each tab

4871724
serializable	deserialization
so it would be serializable encode the gettype metadata in some way use serialzier.nongeneric to encode the object assuming it is serializable by protobuf-net deserialization decode the type metadata and resolve your type use serializer.nongeneric to decode the object another alternative approach would be to simply use binaryformatter which handles the type metadata internally but hook iserializable for your special types and forward that to protobuf-net
this allows your objects to be handled side-by-side with objects that aren t protobuf-net compatible but get the enhanced serializable for your objects

4873278
crossover	mutation
you would not typically mutate crossover all members of the tournament
instead you perform a tournament with the winner of that tournament being select as an individual to undergo mutation crossover

4876291
punctuation	words
this can be as easy as splitting the input string around whitespace but if you are parsing more general text you will also need to handle numbers and punctuation which is non trivial
for instance sentence ending periods are often not regarded as part of the words it is attached to but periods marking an abbreviation often are

4880050
super	implements
i found a solution for the case where there is hierarchy with a single super class apart from object which also works when there are multiple type parameters on the super class
still would not work for deeper hierarchies or when implements generic interfaces

4881178
vim	textmate
i use vim which doesn t have a great way to interact with a repl
textmate is in the same boat afaik

4882583
hex	binary
binary hexadecimal hex hex is really the only common base that isn t intuitively obvious because it uses alpha characters to describe the values 10 11 12 13 14 and 15 using the letters a b c d e and f respectively instead
we use binary octal and hex because binary is the language of computers remember a digital wire can either have current or not have current values 1 or 0

4882583
hex	binary	octal	binary
we use binary octal and hex because binary is the language of computers remember a digital wire can either have current or not have current values 1 or 0
each single hex character describes four binary digits exactly while an octal character describes 3 binary digits

4882685
vim	emacs
understand that i m comparing emacs and vi not vim
i ve never learned the extensions that vim has added to vi and it s likely that many of them are features copied from emacs

4882685
vim	emacs
i ve never learned the extensions that vim has added to vi and it s likely that many of them are features copied from emacs
if so and if you re already proficient with vim emacs may not hold as many advantages for you

4882685
vim	emacs
if so and if you re already proficient with vim emacs may not hold as many advantages for you
among the things i depend on all the time in emacs are when you use emacs everything s treated as text

4884098
spaces	delimiter
it might be better if you can choose a delimiter other than a spaces between fields in your data file
for example if you use tabs you could do you wouldn t need to quote fields that contain spaces

4884228
udp	tcp
some applications of udp are found in movie streaming where you can actually afford to lose a frame and not jeopardize movie quality
udp does not need binding between the two parties and is often looked at as a light alternative to tcp

4885270
jar	war
if the war depends on the jar then the jar needs to be build and added to the local repository before the war is built not after as you have written in your question
it has to be done in this order so that the jar file can be included in the war file. assuming that you really mean that the jar should be built first this is easy

4886354
datamapper	activerecord
datamapper currently doesn t support this feature but it s on the roadmap and is referred to as embedded value
activerecord supports defining embedded values already

4888945
apache	nginx
the point is apache sits in some obscure port only serving requests sent to it from nginx while static file serving is handled by nginx
the django docs you linked to do not suggest you use apache as a reverse proxy

4892997
profiling	debugging
now if you try to build you will get a different error something like code sign error the identity iphone developer x xxxxx doesn t match any identity in any profiling .
so now what you need to do in xcode is to click on the pull down in the upper left corner the pull down that had the original base sdk missing indication but probably has something different now and make sure that both simulator and debugging are checked as options in the pull-down

4893455
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i ll try to illustrate tab bar with 3 tabs a uinavigationcontroller provides content each tab tab 1 loads tab1navcontroller.m sets self.tabbaritem.item to 1st loads tab1viewcontroller.m sets self.title to tab1 view tab 2 loads tab2navcontroller.m sets self.tabbaritem.item to 2nd loads tab2viewcontroller.m sets self.title to tab view tab 3 loads tab3navcontroller.m sets self.tabbaritem.item to 3rd loads tab3viewcontroller.m sets self.title to tab3 view when the tab bar loads all of its viewcontrollers for each of the 3 tabs the tab buttons in the tab bar have these labels tab1 view 2nd 3rd this is because the 2nd and 3rd nav controllers aren t loaded until the user selects those tabs
the 1st tab is loaded when the uitabbarcontroller is loaded and due to the order of events it replaces the tabbaritem.title with the navcontroller s rootviewcontroller s self.title

4895200
mvp	presenter
asking confirmation is in pure mvp not a responsibility of the presenter
the logic in the presenter is called after the confirmation

4895264
ienumerable	ilist
it doesn t implement ienumerable but it does implement ilistsource
ilistsource has a method getlist which returns an ilist which implements ienumerable

4897792
allocator	stl
however regarding the question -- does anybody know of an stl implementation that allows for dynamic allocator to be passed in to an instance of a container before use
-- it is simply not supported by the c++ standard library stl therefore while it may be that there are implementations where per-object allocator work it is not portable

4898369
setcontentview	findviewbyid
if findviewbyid is failing to find your target id here are some reasons this may happen in your case i suspect #1 or #2. setcontentview or inflate hasn t been called yet to associate a layout to search yet
setcontentview or inflate was called with a layout that does not contain the target id you specified the wrong layout

4899295
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
except it doesn t seem to come with a navigation item so you have to add your own and then set the left and right buttons as dealing with uinavigationcontroller uinavigationbar uinavigationitem can be confusing but luckily apple has a decent explanation of how all these things work together at the top of its uinavigationcontroller documentation
it seems like self.navigationitem is only looked at by the uinavigationcontroller controller not bar

4900884
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc
realloc does not work with memory allocated with new there is no standards defined analog to the realloc function with c++ memory management functions
do not mix new and delete with malloc calloc realloc and free don t free any memory allocated with new don t delete any memory allocated with malloc if you are doing you most likely should be using an std vector which encapsulates all that memory management for you

4902702
factors	mean
from exactly now from arbitrary date date edit as pointed out in the other answers does not account for daylight savings time if that s a factors
just to clarify that limitation i was talking about for people affected by daylight savings time if by 7 days earlier you mean that if right now is 12pm noon on 14 mar 2010 you want the calculation of 7 days earlier to result in 12pm on 7 mar 2010 then be careful

4902735
client-side	server-side
that s not to say you can t use something like the jquery validate plugin to add client-side logic on top of it but i wouldn t rely only on client-side logic
i ve found myself becoming fond of the mvc famework from microsoft because version 3 has very nice integration between the server-side validation logic and the jquery validate plugin

4903400
udp	tcp	icmp	tcp
ping and traceroute make use of lower layer network protocols icmp and or udp in particular which are layer 4 protocols and will not work over an http layer 7 tunnel
in any case even if you could convince the http proxy to open a raw tcp session for you which is how some http tunneling works you would not receive the necessary packets to confirm that the host is reachable

4905458
lisp	scheme
the code practically writes itself. not all functional languages use explicit types but the how to design programs book an excellent book for learning scheme lisp clojure relies heavily on data descriptions which are closely related to types
design of a functional application in lisp or clojure

4907447
serializable	deserialization
all public properties are serializable or if you require more control over what gets serializable you need to decorate your class es with attributes for the class level and decorate each item you want to have serializable public or not property or field with a attribute the explicit decoration with the datacontract datamember attributes has some clear advantages you can define an xml namespace for your serializable data classes you can define which fields and or properties public or not you want to have serializable you can rename a property in serializable you can give it another name in the data structure that will be sent from client to server you can control the order in which the fields and properties are serializable you don t need to provide a parameter-less constructor for deserialization of course there s no free lunch - it means you have to go and decorate all the classes you want to use as wcf method parameters and or return types
if you want to serialize that class so it can be used as an argument in a wcf service call you have to either use the implicit serializable that wcf has since .net 3.5 sp1 - it works much in the same way as the xml serializer

4909225
google-chrome	firefox
for google-chrome there are also a number of extensions you could try which aim to add what you seek xml viewer xml tree
internet explorer and google-chrome doesn t have fancy xml rendering built in whereas firefox and opera does

4911193
arp	icmp
arp equivalent ipv6 neighbor discovery is now part of icmp
this is important because if the user wants to block icmp packets and isn t careful they could lose all their connectivity

4912771
nunit	mstest
myproject.tests.unit if you re not wanting to use two bdd frameworks you can still use mstest nunit in a bdd way
for example this blog article describes a nice naming convention which is close to bdd but aimed at mstest nunit unit tests

4914249
onclick	onsubmit
second right now you are submitting the form as response to onclick event of ordinary button
better approach at least in my humble opinion is having submit button then overriding the form onsubmit event cancelling it if something is not valid

4914928
ssl	https
i found that when i configured my test application the console app and my unit tests that i configured one using ssl and one not
by default fiddler does not decode or list https traffic

4915145
rsa	aes
if you re looking for privacy rsa isn t the way to go use rsa to generate a private public pair and then use them to excahnge keys -- or exchange keys out of band
use a streaming algorithm like aes to encrypt the message

4916982
move	drag
again you d need to use the mouse move event to check that the square doesn t intersect with any existing squares
you will have to use a canvas if you want the squares to appear where the user clicks and drag

4917180
automake	autotools
on automake if you use automake you re pretty much using the entire autotools
automake cannot work without autoconf

4917300
division	multiplication
note that gcc at least is able to compile this to x86 code which does not use any division operations since the modulo is a constant
this method uses multiplication in a finite field map converts the unicode points to the unique 7 bit numbers and unmap does the reverse

4919314
prng	random
if the user must not predict the random numbers even those good prngs are not enough and you have to choose a cryptographic prng
they can neither be predicted with realistic computational power nor be distinguished from real random numbers unless you know the seed

4920814
n-gram	words
as you aren t doing a wildcard search you are matching a search term on n-gram parts of words
another alternative is to use n-gram and tokenfilterfactories specifically the edgengramfilterfactory

4921518
webchromeclient	webviewclient
hence you have both a webviewclient and a webchromeclient as separate objects
if want to add the support for alertbox then need to switch to webchromeclient then i can not do other things

4924524
move	drag
but you ll still have the jump problem because you re supposed to touch the button not its edge and the first move will put the edge under your finger
i would try using a gesturedetector its ongesturelistener has an onscroll method that gives you the scrolling distance it does the job of remembering last position and giving a relative motion so that you can add that value to the padding that is you drag 10px you add 10px of padding

4925290
pascal	delphi
although it does not do duplicate code detection there is also peganza pascal analyzer which does different audits using static analysis
delphi 2010 xe have it built in

4929975
bash	tcsh
here s one way you can get around that using bash to interpret the escape sequences although it s a little ugly
the problem is that tcsh isn t interpreting the escape sequence in your variable name so the environment variable ends up with a literal e in it when you try to set it with tcsh

4930677
equals	gethashcode
i suspect it is in part because your gethashcode doesn t agree with equals
you should ideally have something like since that is what your equals cares about

4930855
google-chrome	firefox
i guess google-chrome and safari are more forgiving
firebug in firefox and developer tools in ie both show that the style defined for your class .execphpwidget is not being applied

4932875
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
to sum it up i m going to quote myself from months ago i d imagine it matters very little in the modern browsers ie 8 9 and latest versions of firefox safari google-chrome opera you listed in your comment
i d imagine it matters very little in these modern browsers you listed in your comment ie 8 9 and latest versions of firefox safari google-chrome opera however i have heard of a bug in ie8 when it comes to an image of exactly the size internet explorer 8 doesn t perform the repeat of a 1x1 pixel semi-transparent background image correctly when any other element on the page is using the -ms-filter drective for the alpha transparency see and the demo so 8x8 seems like a good enough size to use

4933315
memcached	apc
mysql s query cache is great but it still has limitations it s not suitable for large data sets queries have to be identical character for character it does not support prepared statements or queries using user-defined functions temporary tables or tables with column-level privileges cache results are cleared every time the table is modified regardless of whether the result set is affected unless it resides on the same machine as the web server it still incurs unnecessary network overhead even with a remote server memcached is roughly 23 faster than mqc
and using apc s object cache you can get up to a 990 improvement over using mqc alone

4934278
equals	gethashcode
basically with an implementation of equals that never returns true for a certain value what you would have is a type capable of providing keys with the following bizarre behavior could be added an unlimited number of times to a dictionary could not be detected using containskey and therefore.
could never be removed using remove remember that equals is very closely related to gethashcode for this very reason the c# compiler even warns you if you ve overridden one without the other a big part of why they re there in the first place is to facilitate the use of types as hash table keys

4935163
listview	gridview
another method would be to bind both widths of the gridviewcolumns to the width of the listview and then use a custom converter to get an appropriate fraction of that back
what comes to mind is using internal grids in the templates which each have a columndefinition with the same sharedsizegroup the gridview should then have and the columns of the grid view should themselves be unresizable if that is possible cannot test that right now so it s a bit sketchy

4937016
ssl	https
but in general the best idea is of course to keep the authenticated session in secure channel - ssl is not that heavyweight these days as computers became much faster than when ssl was first introduced and also the heaviest part is handshake which is performed only once if persistent http connection is used or when ssl session resuming is used
the cookies can be set per protocol so that https cookies are not used for http and vice versa

4938475
ienumerable	iqueryable
use ienumerable when sending data
i would not operate with iqueryable in this particular case

4938746
innodb	myisam
it doesn t support transactions use innodb instead
perhaps you use myisam as a storage engine for your table

4940389
fastcgi	scgi
fastcgi is the method by which lighty can communicate with runtimes like ruby or php
lighty can also use scgi though i ve never use it myself and am not sure how well it works last i heard it was still experimental-ish

4941200
google-chrome	firefox
if it doesn t work then this task is may not be possible in google-chrome
note similar gm and the bookmarklet both work fine in firefox

4942257
vbscript	vba	vbscript	vb6
you have to escape bigmoney when using it in vbscript regular expressions but that is a very specific case
you cannot use it as you are used to in some basic flavours vba or vb to assign the string primitive to a variable. like for the c64 or in good ol vb6 just eliminate the in the latter example you don t need them

4942485
gdk	cairo
i did not figure out the cause of the problem but a way to work around it create an empty gdk pixbuf
create a cairo imagesurface using the gdk pixbuf s pixels as data buffer

4942485
gdk	cairo
clear the cairo context this is important because gdk pixbuf s pixel data seem not to be initialized yet
the code looks like this when i now paint to that context and set the cursor from the gdk pixbuf i get almost what i want the shape is fine but red and blue are swapped

4944822
pbkdf2	md5	hmac	md5
none of the currently known weaknesses on sha-1 has any impact on its security when used in hmac a fortiori when used in pbkdf2
for that matter md5 would be fine too but not md4

4945234
scheme	prolog
parts of that functionality can be potentially ported to scheme other parts needs an extended macro system with explicit context
not a scheme but somewhat similar lisp dialect with a very extensive use of macros there are macros implementing various kinds of pattern matching list comprehensions various parsers generators including a peg packrat implementation embedded prolog adt visitors inference like scrap your boilerplate in haskell extensible syntax macros hindley-milner type system scheme-like syntax macros and many more

4947857
google-chrome	safari
in addition to toscho s answer i ve noticed some webkit inconsistencies between google-chrome 9-10 and safari 5 with the css properties supported that are worth noting
specifically google-chrome 9 and 10 do not support background-color border text-decoration and text-transform when styling the placeholder

4948459
jtable	jlabel
i wouldn t show a label inside the jtable but instead the jtable
try removing the table element from its container and adding the jlabel with the message

4950137
clang	llvm
clang is a new open source compiler that s having its development by apple that leverages llvm
clang is designed from the ground up to be usable not only as a compiler but also as a c++ library that you can embed into your applications

4953900
erlang	lisp
we first make a new car or using record syntax the order of fields doesn t matter we can even use pattern matching i remember there were attempts to implement something similar to haskell s record syntax in erlang but not sure if they were successful
some posts concerning these attempts in response to what sucks about erlang geeking out with lisp flavoured erlang

4954156
apache	nginx
normally you would do it the other away around have nginx proxy anything that s not a static file to a backend apache
having apache look at all the incoming requests would defeat the purpose since you use nginx to avoid the inefficiencies of apache when handling numerous requests

4954739
backgrounding	multitasking
the reality is that on ios4 applications are not allowed to run continuously in the backgrounding
surprisingly there is actually very little time-slicing going on in the multitasking ios 4.x

4955657
inline	inlining
the documentation of parameter max-inline-insns-auto makes it clear that manually declaring a function inline might cause it to be considered for inlining even if it is too big for automatic inlining
inlining isn t a all-or-nothing process since there s a -fpartial-inlining flag

4956816
jboss	glassfish
jboss isn t really that bad either
it s also free but is a somewhat larger download starts up slower and not being the reference implementation means its always a little behind glassfish

4959000
super	implements
should you want to add new elements to a list you should use instead. this idiom is known by the abbreviation pecs - producer extends consumer super coined by josh bloch in effective java 2nd edition item 28
as others have noted this idiom is needed because a is not a even when someclass implements someinterface

4959603
firefox	safari
2nd update perspective is now supported in all edge browsers although firefox s anti-aliasing has little to recommend it and needs -moz obviously 3rd update updated the fiddle for cross browser for firefox ie and unprefixed
-webkit-perspective doesn t work in chrome yet just safari so this won t work try your code in safari

4959603
google-chrome	safari
-webkit-perspective doesn t work in google-chrome yet just safari so this won t work try your code in safari
also 3d transforms in google-chrome in general are a bit iffy and don t combine well with gradients for one

4959766
postgresql	mysql
postgresql does not
i don t know about mysql

4962154
xml-rpc	json-rpc
first of all transmission doesn t expose an xml-rpc service
it s a json-rpc service

4963370
firefox	safari
this is not just firefox
your code will stop working in every browser except chrome and safari in some instances because they have console.log built in along with their developer tools. it is because when you don t have firebug open the object console is not defined

4965006
jax-ws	jax-rs
if you are already using spring3.0 please feel free to use jax-ws support provided by spring s resttemplate
we have used the rest based implementation with apache wink and the results from the wink layer are very good.our application was scalable with 2 clusters to 3000 requests per second.we did not face any performance issue with the wink layer.i felt that as spring does not provide a jax-rs aka jsr 311 we need to settle for another rest based implementation like jersey or restlet

4968459
bmp	png
the default is png not bmp
you now probably have a .bmp file on disk that actually contains a png image

4969194
coalesce	isnull
if the column a is of int data type writing isnull a 1 is ok but isnull a hello causes a conversion error while writing coalesce a hello is allowed and an error will be raised only if a is null and you try for example to insert the returned value hello to an int column but doing auotmatic conversion of a s value if not null when inserting in a varchar column
you can use both isnull a b or coalesce a b c ... functions where isnull returns the value of b if a is null and coalesce returns the first non-null argument. an important difference is that isnull forces the casting or convert of b to the type of a while coalesce s return type is the same of the returned argument letting the engine to try any conversion only after the evaluation of the function

4969723
ocaml	scheme
ocaml does not it pushes that over to its oop part
and scheme does not have any types

4970901
cloudant	couchdb
cloudant is an open source non-relational distributed database service of the same name that requires zero-configuration
cloudant is based on the apache-backed couchdb project and the open source bigcouch project. source couchone is not available any more

4970901
cloudant	couchdb	cloudant	couchbase
cloudant is based on the apache-backed couchdb project and the open source bigcouch project. source couchone is not available any more
as of june 2015 gives 404 not found since at least march 2013 couchone on twitter had last tweets in may 2011 and says that couchone is now couchbase inc. - but please note that contrary to some marketing material the couchbase server is not a continuation of couchdb - it has a different code base licensing philosophy features data and protocols

4971512
nsmutablestring	nsstring
note that this doesn t do what anyone wants when you synthesize the accessor as the setter invokes -copy and gets an nsstring which is not an nsmutablestring as a result
i don t know if this has something to do with it but if you read the documentation for the initwithstring method it returns an instance of a subclass of nsstring which may or may not be an instance of nsmutablestring try this instead it will do what you want also 99 of the time you want a string properties of a class you want to declare it as if you declare a readwrite string properties as anything other than copy then whoever sets it can change their string and affect your object s internal state which is usually not what you want

4972043
punctuation	words
personally given this setup i d work with the innertext property of htmlnode to find the words probably with regex so i can exclude for punctuation and not simply rely on spaces and then use the innerhtml property to make the changes using iterative calls to regex.replace because the regex.replace has a method that allows you to specify both start position and number of times to replace
processing code identify words there s probably some slicker way to do this but here s an initial stab process the html i ll leave the details of alterword to you

4975253
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome safari and firefox official latest release
works in google-chrome and safari but not in firefox

4977259
rvm	bundler
- gem list will tell you the version of each gem. i hope you ve got rvm if not i strongly sugget you to install it this will allow you not only to use different versions of ruby but also to set different gemsets therefor one each project you ll find it useful
once in rails 3 you can use bundler have a look at this episode of railscasts by the way this is a very good site but you may know it already

4978208
apache	nginx
first off i d reason that it takes a lot of effort to understand apache s request processing model and to configure it correctly especially with respect to mod_wsgi
if your not exactly set or locked into using apache i would recommend that you take a look at running spawning or green unicorn behind a nginx proxy like neo suggested

4978208
apache	nginx
if your not exactly set or locked into using apache i would recommend that you take a look at running spawning or green unicorn behind a nginx proxy like neo suggested
spawning and gunicorn are both ridiculously fast don t require that you compile apache with a specific python interpreter and provide support for progressively updating your code base on the fly hooks for django and other goodies out of the box

4978890
implements	extends
the domain-side initdata type could be an interface possibly implements with an anonymous type
the initdataproxy could extends valueproxy instead which doesn t require that the object on the server have any kind of id or version semantics

4979404
queue	fifo
post takes a runnable and puts it on the message queue for the main application thread
as such it will not get processed until all other messages that are presently on that queue get processed fifo

4980000
gitolite	gitosis
additionally if you are not aware gitosis is unmaintained and deprecated in favor of gitolite
you need to either add the ssh public key of the user on server to gitosis or copy the ssh private key from the desktop to the user on the server and use it

4980101
asterisk	ivr
asterisk does not come with voicexml browser but there are companies that provide that for asterisk such as softsyl technologies companies like cisco and avaya also provide voicexml browser but they are not for asterisk
the best way to build an ivr applications is to use voicexml designed by w3c.org

4980550
nunit	mstest
after some investigation i have moved to using nunit
there are several reasons for preferring nunit over mstest but with regards to this particular issue the compelling reason is that the only class-wide initialisation method supported by mstest that doesn t run for every test is for static methods which is not what i m looking for

4980550
nunit	mstest
there are several reasons for preferring nunit over mstest but with regards to this particular issue the compelling reason is that the only class-wide initialisation method supported by mstest that doesn t run for every test is for static methods which is not what i m looking for
as jason points out will provide this static class wide initialisation in mstest

4983671
uiview	calayer
but i think a sprite would simply be better represented by an instance of calayer rather than uiview
as far as i know uiview s are pretty lightweight wrappers around calayer so the performance loss shouldn t be too big

4983710
comparator	comparable
you should not redefine comparator in deadlinedtask because this would break the contract of anti-commutativity if then
i would thus completely avoid to implement comparable in the task class and use a dedicated comparator when sorting a collection of tasks

4984891
uiview	calayer
if you don t want to subclass calayer you can also assign it a delegate which must not be a uiview and implement drawlayer incontext
just subclass calayer and do your drawing in drawincontext

4986136
viewdidload	viewwillappear
that way only view controllers that are actively visible will receive your notifications i assume currently you re putting your addobserver removeobserver methods in viewdidload unload hence why they re getting notifications when they re not visible but still loaded
sure - the simplest way is to just to put your addobserver and removeobserver methods for each view controller into the viewwillappear and viewwilldisappear methods or didappear diddisappear

4986864
margin	text-align
the size is safe however the margin auto -centering isn t completely
you have to add text-align center to the body style to center it in ie6 too

4989080
haskell	ocaml
there s also bert-rpc client and server library for haskell but i m not sure a java port exists
you could use some of rpc frameworks for example apache thrift which supports c++ java python php ruby erlang perl haskell c# cocoa smalltalk and ocaml

4990017
dictionary	map
enable -forcedict option or uncomment it jconf file to skip error words in dictionary and force running. or.. 2
map the not found triphone to the most close physical triphone in hmmlist file tiedlist . for example b-ey+t v-eh+t the first column is the name of triphone generated from your dictionary and the second column is the name of the hmm actually defined in your am

4994991
dictionary	map
django doesn t construct such dictionary for put options and delete requests the reasoning being explained here
to summarise it for you the concept of rest is that the data you exchange can be much more complicated than a simple map of keys to values

4995007
jax-ws	jax-rs
if you want to use soap with json which is not the common choice then check jax-ws and the json extension
yes jax-rs is meant to do that - to let you expose restful services

4995866
opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i ve tested this in ie8 doesn t look too bad in ie7 and recent versions of google-chrome firefox opera safari
live demo screenshot from google-chrome it got a bit silly and to be honest probably more complicated than it s worth - a js based solution would definitely be easier to understand

4996744
ubuntu	linux
i wouldn t worry about helios being unsupported on ubuntu according to presumably ubuntu
helios is well supported on pretty much all flavors of linux by the eclipse community

4997150
floating-point	fractions
read the floating-point guide to understand why
there is no double 0.55 - the number cannot be accurately represented as a binary fractions

4999480
scheme	racket
in general different scheme implementations have various approaches to this problem but in almost all cases you will not get eval to handle local bindings like you re trying to do
but specific to the racket case you should read the evaluation section in the racket guide -- it explains why things aren t working like you want them to and it shows how to get the module scope to work

5002477
quicksort	heapsort
another approach is to not sort partitions below a certain size and then do an insertion sort on the whole array after quicksort is done
it s also possible to use heapsort instead of insertion sort if done carefully

5004019
nsmutablestring	nsstring
we can avoid many of the issues altogether in most cases by simply avoiding use of nsmutablestring as an ivar where possible
as mentioned earlier nsmutablestring is not thread-safe it s easier and more efficient in many cases to use a copied nsstring ivar when your string is small or does not change frequently

5004289
strcpy	strdup
strcpy response getfile request
should be splited into this is sometimes refered as strdup style allocation which is not recommended. you should allocate the buffer in the calling code like and call getfile buf2 strlen buffer input

5008649
mef	prism
application composition prism using any ioc container mef unity ninject autofac etc
there are a few things that make mvvm easier with prism but i wouldn t call it a fully featured mvvm framework.

5008649
mef	prism
there are a lot of good articles on application composition with prism that s pretty much its job but here is a good article on application composition with mef by itself you should also check out glenn block s series building hellomef on his blog
i couldn t find a comprehensive list he wasn t consistent with his tagging but here is the mef tag

5009608
intersect	contains
none of the faces of 2 cubes intersect
one cube does not completely contains the other

5009931
swt	swing
etc so the language choice should rely on what external libraries are you using and whether or not you want native look and feel for your application only qt and swt jface can give you native look and feel for your application swing is very bad at it
well 3 are recommended swing java swt jface java qt c++ working with these ui toolkits is almost the same generally same approach good ui designers good communities .

5009978
freebsd	solaris
freebsd s main weaknesses here are java and virtualization support which happen to be solaris strengths
i wouldn t recommend solaris 10 as a desktop os but try solaris 11 express the descendent of opensolaris

5010119
freebsd	solaris
both systems have large suites of available software packages available freebsd is likely larger and there s a better chance something may have been ported to freebsd over solaris depending on the niche of the package of course
solaris i believe has a bit higher base resource requirements than freebsd if that matters most likely not

5010119
freebsd	solaris
solaris i believe has a bit higher base resource requirements than freebsd if that matters most likely not
solaris on the desktop is a bit of an oxymoron

5012755
jar	war
you should not put jar files inside subfolder of web-inf lib
also catalina-ant.jar and servlet-api.jar are provided by tomcat there is no need to add them in your war files especially when they are older version

5012987
kohana	yii
depends i came from php4 and didn t really touch the level of oop needed for the php5 kohana framework i ve used classes and functions but the hmvc is a process on it s own to learn when it comes to kohana vs yii i d have to say kohana is easier to pickup
my only dislike of kohana is that the documentation is all over the place and outdated and it s not till you try it do you realize you were looking at the version before ie 3.0 vs 3.1 is different

5017034
atof	strtod
man page atof converts a string to a double not a float as it s name would suggest.
strtof from the man page the strtod strtof and strtold functions convert the initial portion of the string pointed to by nptr to double float and long double representation respectively

5019165
.htaccess	httpd.conf
there s also the main server httpd.conf files which are a preferred location for long-standing .htaccess directives as that s read only once at server startup and not per-request as .htaccess files are
.htaccess files are processed in the order they re found so if there s one overriding things for your page it would be in one or more of the parent directories

5025479
multiplying	addition
at worst samples with peaks of 0 db fs will all converge at the same sample and you ll need to multiplying signal the sum of shots by the reciprocal of the sum of shots that s not ideal in many cases because there will be an exaggerated ducking sound
so you should actually introduce a limiter in addition to overall reduction for the number of simultaneous shots

5030167
bash	subshell
by sourcing the file all commands are executed within the context of your current bash session which means that all environment variables which it exports will now be available to you
if you run the script instead of source it it is executed in a subshell and exported variables are not passed on to your session

5030801
inline	inlining
the documentation explains the rules for what can and cannot be inline
as for the discretionary decisions that the compiler takes as to whether or not to inline as opposed to whether or not inlining is possible they are not documented and can be considered an implementation detail

5030801
inline	inlining
i recall that you recently commented on one of my answers to a different question that a particular function was 10 times faster once inline
clearly you are interested in inlining but in that particular case i cannot believe such an enormous gain for a function with so many floating point operations

5032555
.htaccess	httpd.conf
you can do it in httpd.conf or in a .htaccess
since apache doesn t serve .htaccess files you don t need to worry about hiding it as much.

5034068
strcpy	malloc
strcpy teacher student
this fails because you have not allocated memory using malloc to the teacher

5034577
nsis	uninstaller
there are several optional values you can set msdn does not really provide a list of documented values but the nsis wiki has a decent list and this page has a even more complete list.
the uninstaller registration is stored in the registry where in the registry you should save it depends on if your installer installs the program for all users or a single user ie your requestexecutionlevel setting user hkcu admin hklm highest shctx this means you must use setshellvarcontext correctly and also restore it correctly in the uninstaller there are only two values that are required displayname and uninstallstring

5034655
ssl	https
see also ie cannot download files over ssl served by websphere
this is a typical msie error message when a download is been provided over https ssl while the response headers are been set to disable the browser cache via no-cache

5035357
client-side	server-side
it doesn t matter for your client-side scripting how the data formatting was done and the server doesn t care what the client does with the code
the real question you should be asking is about what you need on the server-side

5035563
uigesturerecognizer	uibutton
the docs for uigesturerecognizer class specify that the action must be of the form not your form of so you could ask the gesturerecognizer where it is on the whole window then compare to your buttons or you could walk through your buttons and ask the gesture where it is with respect to each button
probably best would be to subclass uibutton and make each button itself the target

5035687
implements	extends
you can implements your getproperty method to accept an enum value as the key
this would provide an easy way to show the user which keys are valid and you wouldn t even have to modify the original enum when you wanted to add more since you can extends the enum

5042068
queue	fifo
if the queue is fifo just browse the first message
if not browse the length of the queue saving the first message you get from each priority compare the timestamp to any message from a higher priority and discard the newer one

5046028
jpgraph	phpgraphlib
i have used jpgraph for a ton of things and its very versatile and you can figure out how to do anything using the huge number of examples they include with the source
phpgraphlib looks to be more light wieght and not quite as capable as jpgraph

5046028
jpgraph	phpgraphlib
phpgraphlib looks to be more light wieght and not quite as capable as jpgraph
if you just look at the examples and the documentation you can see how much more jpgraph does

5048343
clang	llvm
i ve found that the following type definition makes the op code compile with clang 1.6 note the additional nbsnakemovementdirectionnone this could be related to llvm bug 1884 which has been fixed
as darren said it does look like a compiler bug and dave said it doesn t happen with clang 2.0

5049783
inline	inlining
your compiler may have a _force_inline keyword or similar which would be regarded and a directive rather than a suggestion as inline typically is on most compilers
one possible argument for not inlining is to maintain deterministic performance under maintenance

5052024
svg	vml
also keep in mind that ie doesn t support svg so having an svg-only solution won t be portable across major browsers
raphaël takes care of it for you - it uses vml on ie and svg on other browsers

5053556
email	dkim
as far as the disadvantages of using gmail all your email will have sent via gmail.com in their headers which doesn t convey much confidence that it s actually from your website
if you set up your own mail server you can use spf dkim to prove that the email is actually from your website

5055680
apache	lighttpd
the key lies in this line this is the correct line for apache but not the correct line for lighttpd
for lighttpd you want something like this what this will do is run the fastcgi process instead on a host port of your choosing as a daemon which will fork to the background

5057179
inline	inlining
the inline keyword makes it easier for the compiler to apply this optimization by allowing the function definition to be visible in multiple translation units but using the keyword doesn t mean the compiler has to inline the function and not using the keyword doesn t forbid the compiler from inlining the function
there are two ways to look at it inline functions are declared in the header because in order to inline a function call the compiler must be able to see the function body

5057179
inline	inlining
the two explanations really boil down to the fact that the inline keyword doesn t exactly do what you d expect
a c++ compiler is free to apply the inlining optimization replace a function call with the body of the called function saving the call overhead any time it likes as long as it doesn t alter the observable behavior of the program

5058512
persistent	transient
but if you want a helper method that starts with get or is but isn t a getter for a persistent field you have two options
one is to use the transient list - see the other option is to declare the return value as def

5058513
actionscript	mxml
the answer your posted can help you move actionscript to a different file but it is not the same as building reusable encapsulated codee
you can also use the include directive to accomplish the same thing the include directive can be used in actionscript components classes too while the script source attribute is mxml only

5058877
allocator	stl
obviously if you create them as stack objects it fails because they re immediately deallocated but i ve been told again by a very high-ranking member that dynamically allocator them can corrupt the heap
dynamically allocator stl objects will not on its own corrupt the heap

5058877
allocator	stl
dynamically allocator stl objects will not on its own corrupt the heap
no idea where you might have heard that. if you want to use a stack-allocated stl object outside of the function that you created it in you can t since the stack space in which the object resides is only valid inside the function that created it

5059888
punctuation	words
taking into account the comments you should also remove a variety of punctuation characters maybe replacing them with spaces
if you are looking for keywords then why not split the value on the space character to separate the words into an array

5060265
accelerometer	gyroscope
angle phi is the integral of angle velocity omega over the elapsed time and doing numerical integration with the trapezoidal rule like described is ok for gyroscope s data not for accelerometer
in general i would recommend to use the timestamp delivered by core motion instead of the defined period 1 5 as recommended by apple because device motion data is often delivered in a lower frequency than expected see what is the official iphone 4 maximum gyroscope data update frequency and or push method for core motion and frequency of accelerometer gyroscope data

5061327
strcpy	malloc
with strcpy even if you pass in an already-malloc ed block for the destination the responsibility is not being passed so you will still have to free that memory yourself
this allows you to easily pass in a malloc ed or non-malloc ed buffer without having to worry about it

5061452
realloc	memmove	realloc	malloc
you must free memory using the same pointer returned by malloc posix_memalign or realloc
use realloc as usual including sufficient extra space so if a new address is returned that isn t already aligned you can memmove it slightly to align it

5061614
pthreads	fork
look into using pthreads if you want everything to share the same memory space
this is not being caused by a contention issue it s the fact that when creating a new process which is what happens when using fork a new copy of the memory space is created

5061993
union	distinct
what you probably wanted was to indicate the source of the data notice that i have not even bothered to alias the columns for the 2nd and 3rd parts of the union note for performance reasons use union all instead of union which performs a distinct against the final result
if you had duplicate campus_id across different tables as well as exactly the same record data union results in one of them being removed whereas union all keeps both or all 3 copies

5066489
super	self
and it s also only during multiple inheritance when you might a situation where an explicit call to the parent might be better than super but without a specific scenario nobody can tell you whether super should be used or not
the only change in super in python 3.x is that you don t need to explicitly pass the current class and self to it

5066588
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
edit as of now july 2012 google-chrome 20 google-chrome is supporting domcontentloaded as well so you can use this and be sure that it will be correctly supported in both google-chrome firefox as good as safari and other webkit-based browsers still not supported in ie afaik
it turns out domcontent event is from webkit which google-chrome relies on and is equivelant to domcontentloaded

5067575
backgrounding	multitasking
your application delegate will at this point receive an try registering for push notifications there instead using - void registerforremotenotificationtypes uiremotenotificationtype types you could also prevent backgrounding by setting the application does not run in backgrounding property in the application s info.plist file uiapplicationexitsonsuspend
i see you register for remote notifications in if your application is running on a ios device with support for multitasking that might not be the right place

5069379
helpers	actioncontroller
you can t send a file from a helpers
the send_file method is defined in actioncontroller streaming and is therefore not available in helpers

5069379
helpers	actioncontroller
the send_file method is defined in actioncontroller streaming and is therefore not available in helpers
helpers are for your code which helps with views

5070003
google-chrome	firefox
the mathjax fonts don t include u+25fb and so google-chrome is showing the missing symbol
it looks like firefox is finding the character in a different font and using that or perhaps you have stix fonts on the machine running firefox but not the one running google-chrome and mathjax is using that

5070281
nsstring	nsobject
from the documentation note that a default s value can be only property list objects nsdata nsstring nsnumber nsdate nsarray or nsdictionary
as such you cannot store a custom nsobject

5071348
client-side	server-side
the point is that close will aim to close the entire communication channel gracefully including any closing handshake required by the communication protocol whereas abort is a rude and brutal tearing down of the client-side channel stack with no attempt to communicate the closure properly to the other side
abort may therefore leave server-side resources still tied up on a connections which will not be used further

5071846
debian	linux
i would rather suggest debian or arch
if you are not familiar with linux check a simple install on on howtoforge.com and run r via r command in the terminal

5073472
lisp	racket	lisp	scheme
if you are new to lisp and not an emacs user presently then i would strongly recommend the free editions of either allegro lisp or lispworks
or if you are going the scheme route plt scheme which is now called racket

5074263
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
the short answer is that you re using uinavigationcontroller and that won t work like you want it to
all child view controllers in your uitabbarcontroller or uinavigationcontroller do not agree on a common orientation set

5075157
strcpy	malloc	strncpy	malloc
you need to use strcpy or strncpy to copy the string into variable name
currently you are doing malloc sizeof 4 which is not correct

5076641
ssl	https
a better but more complex solution would be usage of ssl certificates available both in browser and client software
if you re only concerned by authentification and neither by confidentiality nor integrity you can handle it by securing http transport level using http basicauth user+password on each message + eventually https for confidentiality however as you noticed solution 1 it it is kind of old school and keeping user password in local cache is not a big deal but cannot be advised

5078175
equals	gethashcode
if you actually want the behaviour of the first version i d personally use edit based on your equals method it looks like you could make your gethashcode method note that your equals icontract other method could also look like this your current implementation will actually throw an exception if this.id is null.
additionally your equals object method is incorrect - you shouldn t throw an exception if you re passed an inappropriate object type you should just return false .

5087138
des	aes
depending on your version of openssl and compiled options you may be able to provide these options in place of -nodes -des encrypt private keys with des -des3 encrypt private keys with triple des default -idea encrypt private keys with idea -seed encrypt private keys with seed -aes128 -aes192 -aes256 encrypt pem output with cbc aes -camellia128 -camellia192 -camellia256 encrypt pem output with cbc camellia ultimately at the library level openssl calls the function pem_write_bio_privatekey with the encryption algorithm or lack thereof you choose
the option -nodes is not the english word nodes but rather is no des

5087758
vsto	add-in
the way the vsto add-in is put together your assembly is likely to be loaded totally separately for the rtd server and for the com add-in and in your problematic cases the rtd instance is loaded first
perhaps you can test with a sample rtd server instead of your own just to confirm that the error is there and not in the wrapper or elsewhere in the vsto add-in

5088439
ubuntu	debian
using different server oses debian squeeze ubuntu server i had similar problems
for example with simple static file serving i got this result from the apache web server on debian this led to the conclusion that i don t have a conclusion but i think the java reloading might not be the problem here rather the virtualization

5089505
union	distinct
union all is faster than union
in case of union if you have 10 columns and 100 rows it will compare each cell.i.e 10 100 to get distinct values while in union all this is not the case

5090433
udp	tcp
you should use tcp or another reliable transport rather than udp
udp doesn t guarantee that all datagrams will arrive

5092293
factors	mean
it was never so expensive that it would be a decisive factors in basic application design
doing things in a jsp does not mean no or even fewer objects are created

5093207
hex	binary
and mixing some concepts hex is just a representation of data.
data in a computer is binary and computers does not understand nor work in hex

5093207
hex	binary
data in a computer is binary and computers does not understand nor work in hex
you are choosing to represent a byte of data as a character but you can treat it as a byte and from that perform a hex representation of that data

5093564
ssl	https
so as a mechanism does work because browsers will verify the cdn.tld ssl certificate correctly but will not
you can do this if their boxes have https support

5095481
udp	tcp
udp does not guarantee delivery so you can tweak parameters but you can t guarantee that the message will get delivered especially in the case of very large data transfers
if you need to guarantee delivery you should use tcp instead

5096211
layoutparams	viewgroup
layoutparams is a class inherited from the viewgroup class which is the super class of gridview
edit just took a look and it seems that as you said layoutparams are not accessible from gridview

5096266
subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication
for example comparisons and addition and subtraction with -0.f give the same result as they would with +0.f in the default rounding mode
multiplication can preserve the sign of zero but as noted it generally isn t observable

5098299
division	modulo
casting out 999 s in base 1000 won t work as a general division algorithm
it will generate values that are congruent modulo 999 to the actual quotient and remainder - not the actual values

5098409
bmp	png
5. delete all your empty font tags and strong tags and divs that aren t being used 6. unless you overrode it to be inline you don t need to add display block to your div s 7. your favicon is a bmp file.
it should be ico for ie and or png for modern browsers 8. drop the right-click blocker - there s no point in it anymore

5099733
lxml	elementtree
however if you can use lxml s elementtree implementation then there is a getparent method
the default elementtree implementation included in the python standard library does not have a method to get a parent node

5100491
inline	inlining
clearly not inline
this illustrates that inlining can t be expected just because a function s implementation is trivial

5102364
postgresql	mysql
postgresql supports utf8 and multiple languages for spelling parsing and stemming
mysql only supports fts on myisam tables and is really not very good for anything but the most very basic fts implementation

5103214
profiling	instrumentation
provisioning profiling
from apple documentation for your protection the instrumentation does not allow you to process any application that is not code-signed with your provisioning profiling

5104012
draggable	droppable
unfortunately not when you drag a draggable away
the event out is triggerd when you hover a draggable over a droppable and then move it away

5106619
spaces	delimiter
if it was defined by a cobol programmer the two fields could be fixed-length and padded with zeroes or spaces with the format specification listing the payload length rather than the field length
if it was defined by a really incompetent programmer whatever language it contains the two names without delimiter or count so it s not possible to realiably separate them if you don t have the information there s no magic function in java or elsewhere that can conjure it out of thin air

5108225
google-chrome	firefox
i have tested this on firefox 5.0 ie 8.0 and google-chrome 10
please note the above answer does not work with firefox and a couple other browsers

5109013
bellman-ford	dijkstra
if you re looking for an algorithm that works with negative edge weights take a look at the bellman-ford algorithm but it doesn t use heuristics
the a algorithm is basically dijkstra s algorithm with heuristics

5110470
implements	extends
by using files for transfer you re already implements a form of message passing and so i think that would be the most natural fit for this sort of program
now you could write something yourself that uses shared memory when available and something like tcp ip when not - or you could just use a library that already does that like mpi which is widely available works will take advantage of shared memory if you are running on the same machine but would then also extends to letting you run them on different machines entirely without you changing your code

5117461
realloc	malloc
if you allocated originally with malloc rather than new you can use realloc
you might be surprised to know that malloc realloc are not replaced by new but are used for a different purpose and in this case it is a useful thing to use

5117461
realloc	malloc
be certain to keep a pointer to the old location until you know realloc worked
if your array is not pod you cannot realloc so malloc the new memory and use placement-new with a copy-constructor then call the destructor on each object of the old memory before freeing it

5120206
udp	tcp
you could also use netstat on the server to see that it isn t listening on udp port 80
if you don t want to block the client then use the async socket methods but use tcp

5121317
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
to get this in google-chrome you d use the following however this will error out in other browsers so you need to wrap a try catch or some other method typeof e.total to avoid the error
there is a progress event that gets triggered when each file downloads however its payload does not include the file name in any browser that i ve tested with google-chrome safari firefox beta

5121317
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
there is a progress event that gets triggered when each file downloads however its payload does not include the file name in any browser that i ve tested with google-chrome safari firefox beta
google-chrome displays the file name in the console though as far as i know it s inaccessible to js but neither safari nor firefox even go that far

5122082
memcached	apc
if storing to cache apc memcached files ... you ll often need to serialize unserialize because those caching mecanisms don t know how to store php objects
i would say if the data changes often and each user needs to have an always up-to-date value you ll probably want to query from database if the date doesn t change or changes don t need to be seen immediatly if the data is different for each user you could store it in session as the session is per-user if the data is the same for all users you should use another caching mecanism such as apc or memcached shared by all users to avoid duplication if storing to session you should have to serialize unserialize yourself it s already done by the sessions mecanism note that some data types cannot be serialized -- see sessions

5122604
datamapper	activerecord
in a default rails 3 project config application.rb contains require rails all basically requiring all of the rails frameworks activerecord activeresource actioncontroller actionmailer testunit etc. the datamapper template changes this
since it doesn t use activerecord it can t require rails all without causing problems

5122736
cairngorm	robotlegs
it does everything cairngorm does plus quite a bit more and now we have people in house who have an absolutely clear understanding of the inner workings of the mvc framework obviously if a framework is old enough it will undergo enough use cases testing that you don t need to know the inner workings but i certainly don t think it hurts
since you aren t under a tight deadline i d suggest just giving each of these a shot in a small project and see how they pan out and you ll probably realize that you can t see any substantial difference until you start getting into a more complex program your program will likely look more complicated with robotlegs or swiz in the basic form but once this is made into something more advanced you d likely end up with less of your own code using one of these

5123755
addition	multiplication
otherwise it would have to be represented by matrix addition which is more intuitive to humans but would make graphics cards even more complicated than they already are
now matrix multiplication generally isn t commutative so when adding a transformation by multiplying your matrix you need to specify whether you re left-multiplying or right-multiplying

5125881
realloc	malloc
what you want to achieve can be done by initially allocating p with malloc and then reallocating that memory again with realloc notice that the argument of foo is a double pointer
that s because realloc may not only resize the memory block but it may actually move it as well so it will affect the value of the pointer

5126111
implements	extends
as far as i know open source free .net snmp vendors do not have that much resource to implements those
if you want to extends microsoft s windows snmp agent you have to use unmanaged languages

5127961
cpython	ironpython
i don t know if the current version of ironpython has an equivalent mechanism cpython only fixed it when pep 366 was included in version 2.6
the error message you re getting says that ironpython is accepting the syntax but believes you aren t currently running code inside a package

5128091
profiling	debugging
the only tool that i am aware of is the ddms tool the profiling feature may help you track down this issue
though not so much of a debugging answer this will definitely help

5132736
rsa	aes
no public key ciphers such as rsa or el gamal are feistel ciphers
and the perhaps-surprising counter-example rijndael the new aes despite being a block cipher isn t feistel

5133978
prepare	execute
in prepare statements is not a placeholder for textual substitution it s a parameter therefore its value is always interpreted as data not as an arbitrary part of query syntax
so in this case the actual query being execute is an equivalent of select language from .

5135134
innodb	myisam
since you mentioned transaction i assume that innodb is in use. one of innodb advantages is absence of table locks so nothing will prevent many triggers bodies to be executed simultaneously and produce the same result
i thought that single operation of insert is atomic and table is locked while transaction is in progress either table is locked myisam is used or records may be locked innodb is used not both

5135151
jar	war
this is the only jar that should be present in your war file
you shouldn t be including gwt-dev.jar or gwt-user.jar in your war file

5136796
g++	gcc
ie ls developer platforms iphonesimulator.platform developer usr bin g developer platforms iphonesimulator.platform developer usr bin g++ developer platforms iphonesimulator.platform developer usr bin g++-4.0 developer platforms iphonesimulator.platform developer usr bin g++-4.2 randomly linking in the gcc-4.2 from the usr bin directory is just asking for trouble
that s not the gcc that is part of the xcode package - who knows if it is really the same version

5136847
icmp	tcp
therefore the following sequence of events is likely your java program not being able to send and receive icmp packets to test for the reachability of the remote windows host will attempt to initiate a tcp connection to the remote windows host by sending a syn synchronize packet to port 7 the remote windows host will drop the packet rather than responding with a rst packet as required by rfc 793 if no service was listening on that port
that is the remote windows host should have per the rfc have either responded with a tcp rst if the port was not listening for connections syn+ack if the port was open and listening for connections since your java program was expecting one of the two things to happen in step 2 but instead got no response at all since windows dropped the syn packet before it ever got to the tcp stack it falsely assumes the remote windows host is down

5136925
udp	tcp
it doesn t really make sense not least in terms of network overhead to have one-connection-per-query tcp ip on the back end when there s only udp ip on the front end
moreover a properly written forwarding proxy dns server has to cope with large udp ip packets truncated responses truncated and otherwise malformed queries tcp ip connection timeouts and resets loop detection and dns udp ip retry

5137968
google-chrome	safari
see lowest version for unprefixed border-radius safari | google-chrome | webkit 5.0 | 4.0 | 532.5 so it s safe to drop if you don t care about users running older versions of safari google-chrome
not many users are running old versions of safari google-chrome - these browsers aren t ie where older versions are sometimes clung to for aeons

5143287
serializable	deserialization
if you want to know the details log them in the delayed_job-2.1.3 lib delayed serializable active_record.rb file in the rescue statement just before delayed-job stupidly raises the deserializationerror and throws the useful information away
it s not really a deserialization error it s an activerecord record-not-found error on a simple model.find id query

5145872
multiplying	multiplication
that s not to say you simply can t multiplying a string
you can t multiplying c++ strings but you can with oop create your own string that support multiplication

5145872
multiplying	multiplication
you can t multiplying c++ strings but you can with oop create your own string that support multiplication
the reason you will need to do that yourself is that even std strings std string doesn t have a definition for multiplication

5148816
subtraction	multiplication	division	addition	addition	multiplication
here s what wikipedia has to say on the matter a bitwise operation operates on one or more bit patterns or binary numerals at the level of their individual bits. on most older microprocessors bitwise operations are slightly faster than addition and subtraction operations and usually significantly faster than multiplication and division operations
on modern architectures this is not the case bitwise operations are generally the same speed as addition though still faster than multiplication

5149069
super	extends
you are not passing them to the productionworkerdemo nor it s super class employee
you don t need to extends the employee with the productionworkerdemo as the productionworkerdemo is not an employee

5150565
inline	inlining
some calls may be inline some not
the degree of inlining may vary and a compiler may even completely ignore this hint in practice g++ has a tendency to follow the hint to absurd and perhaps ungood degree while visual c++ more like ignores it

5152437
margin	text-align
margin auto horizontal centering is not supported in ie6
instead you can either use absolute positioning to center or you can do body text-align center

5153243
postgresql	mysql
not sure about postgresql through
there are no booleans in mysql see bool boolean these types are synonyms for tinyint 1

5153463
stateless	stateful
for stateless session beans the container does not guarantee that subsequent method invocations will use the same ejb instance from the pool hence you cannot assume that the values you placed when you call a bean method will still be there when you call the method again or another method of the bean
for stateful session beans the container guarantees that subsequent calls will use the same ejb instance hence you can keep instance field values

5155122
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
this means effectively that fileoutputstream fileinputstream and the input output of a socket will be closed
but if you wrap a fileoutputstream in a bufferedoutputstream then that bufferedoutputstream will not be known to the os and won t be closed flushed on shutdown

5155137
factors	mean
source blending factors and destination blending factors
setcolor doesn t mean it is for destination blending color

5160676
opera	firefox
the answer is they aren t loaded asynchronously in all browsers as explained here thanks to markus olsson for the link script-inserted scripts execute asynchronously in ie and webkit but synchronously in opera and pre-4.0 firefox
in firefox 4.0 the async dom property defaults to true for script-created scripts so the default behavior matches the behavior of ie and webkit

5161763
firefox	safari
firebug if you re using firefox this is a must-have
developer tools built in to chrome safari essentially firebug for webkit also do not use w3 schools

5162791
uigesturerecognizer	uibutton
if you can get away with supporting 3.2+ you can just add a uigesturerecognizer to your view btw in your code your image view is leaking see below for proper use now it will work as expected without having to fob a uibutton in there that you might not want.
unfortunately you can t trigger actions on uibutton s that are created with custom views

5164763
postgresql	mysql
so generally speaking you can do but when you do you want mysql to compare two columns in where condition - login and admin which you obviously don t have . additionally bear in mind that when using postgresql you cannot use operator as it will have the same meaning as in mysql
when you use quotes like mysql thinks you want a column

5165760
oncreate	setcontentview
i am guessing your oncreate method should look like
you shouldn t call the setcontentview function twice

5166104
udp	tcp
for example ts container can be transmitted over udp but matroska can not
pretty much everything can be transported through tcp though

5166162
decimal	ieee
the same caveats apply - float and int must be the same size and endianness and float must be ieee if the initial hex value is to be treated as ieee you ask how to convert to float then how to convert to decimal
floats are not decimal

5166588
super	extends
in the second situation since you are redefining __init__ in num2 you need to explicitly call the one in the super class num if you want to extends its behavior
in the first situation num2 is extends the class num and since you are not redefining the special method named __init__ in num2 it gets inherited from num

5169643
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome is simply a better browser until firefox upgrades their javascript engine
just adding some talking points as someone who uses firebug google-chrome inspector every day at the time of writing there s only google dom inspector and no it doesn t have all the features of firebug inspector is a lite version of firebug the interface is not as good imo element inspection in both recent versions is now clunky but firebug is still better

5169643
google-chrome	firefox
last time i checked it did not because google-chrome updates itself in the background without your intervention gets your consent by default like all good overlords
last point the day that google google-chrome gets a fully-featured firebug is the day firefox basically dies for developers because firefox had 3 years to make firefox s layout engine gecko as fast as webkit and they didn t

5170423
profiling	debugging
make sure you run an iphone developer provisioning profiling and your device has been added to the provisioning portal
as stated by buffernet you cannot use a distribution provisioning profiling to debugging

5170423
profiling	debugging
as stated by buffernet you cannot use a distribution provisioning profiling to debugging
when i switched to a developer provisioning profiling i got the error a valid provisioning profiling for this executable was not found

5170554
serializable	deserialization
the deserialization process for binary serializable will attempt to load the object s type from the original dll
this dll doesn t exist post ilmerge and hence the deserialization will fail

5170781
daemons	systemd
remote_script.sh where the options have to be deployed according to your specific needs for example binding to ipv4 only and your remote command could be starting your tomcat daemons
note if you do not want to be prompt at every ssh run please also have a look to ssh-agent and optionally to keychain if your systemd allows it

5171532
clang	llvm
for example i can use clang llvm to illustrate both point of view at once clang is the c++ front-end it uses two distinct types to resolve function calls etc.
and treats them as completely different values llvm is the optimizer backend it doesn t care yet about names but only structural representation and will therefore collapse them in a single type.

5171665
udp	tcp
this is precisely the reason why you re finding a datagram protocol udp easier to apply to your problem
the biggest problem is that you re treating tcp as if it were a datagram protocol which it isn t

5172110
ienumerable	iqueryable
iqueryable t or search ienumerable vs iqueryable to get references
caution if you are using linq to sql and you cast any part of a composite query to ienumerable that part cannot be combined with the rest of the query to form a single sql query

5173263
innodb	myisam
looks like myisam does not support transactions rollback so if a transaction manager is required better to go with innodb
innodb enforces referential integrity

5173263
innodb	myisam
innodb enforces referential integrity
myisam does not

5173560
implements	extends
if you want to check if a class implements cloneable you can do cloneable.class.isassignablefrom yourtype.class
every class which doesn t explicitly extends anything has java.lang.object as a superclass interfaces and primitives aren t classes so that check isn t doing what you think it is

5174433
daemons	systemd
if you start your daemons from a script that s running as root have it create a subdirectory var run gmooredaemon and chown it to the daemon-running user before su ing to the user and starting the daemons
on many modern linux systemd if you start the daemons from a script or launchd that isn t running as root you can put the pidfile in which is a per-user equivalent of the traditional var run

5177265
strcpy	malloc
there are two possibilities you re getting lucky that strcpy isn t hitting anything of consequence so the program runs
malloc often allocates a few more bytes than requested to better keep memory aligned

5177382
nsstring	nsobject
nsurl will provide it s own implementation so you shouldn t have to worry about converting to an nsstring to perform a comparison
the base class of the ios object hierarchy nsobject has a isequal method that is ovverrided by subclasses to provide equality checking

5180288
cpython	pypy
but that day is still far away and if it does arrive it won t be without pypy s ability to run cpython libraries without modifications so i think you re safe for quite some time
python assuming you mean the cpython implementation and pypy are not frameworks but implementations of the python language

5180309
clutter	cairo
edit if you can not use clutter you may have a look at cairo which also has some neat examples on the given homepage
i would use clutter for details use the clutter examples they are pretty nice

5181318
serializable	deserialization
after all you have the following process you have an object instance you create a string instance that is a representation of that object instance you create an object instance based on the serializable data in the string if you take into consideration that the original instance might have mutated that the deserialization can happen in another process even in another machine it becomes quite clear that deserialization could not possibly return the original instance
in this particular case when the object is a string you could imagine that the string interning would make the system reuse the old instance if the deserialization happened within the same appdomain

5181435
nexus	artifactory
this could - as far as i remember - not be solved in general because somehow it was bound to the memory that was available to the jvm but with nexus one has the possibiliy to use a different upload mechanism via that s one point why we prefer nexus
second point in the new 1.9 version nexus comes with the archetype catalog plugin which gives you an automatic update of the archetypes you have deployed - as far as i know this is not possible with artifactory but perhaps something has been done there as well

5181599
bazaar	git
as i understand it git doesn t actually have any concept of a first-class rename operation only bazaar does of the big 3 dvcss the mv is sugar on top of the underlying machinery which is basically an add and a rm
since git can track the content that changes during such operations though it can use heuristics to guess when an add and a rm are actually a mv

5182501
multiplying	multiplication
when python attempts to multiplying two objects it first tries to call the left object s __mul__ method
if the left object doesn t have a __mul__ method or the method returns notimplemented indicating it doesn t work with the right operand in question then python wants to know if the right object can do the multiplication

5183948
equals	gethashcode
for example the string class overrides it if it wouldn t do that this would print false examples this is foo in the first example this is foo in the second example note when overriding equals or overloading
visual studio want you to override the gethashcode function

5184173
plone	buildout
i just tested a plone 3.3.5 site with plone.app.folder 1.0.3 newer version depends on products.cmfplone plone 4
extend a plone 3 buildout with this one zcml slug is important because plone.app.folder doesn t use z3c.autoinclude

5185475
multiplication	exponent
mix_columns.pdf edit normal matrix multiplication does not apply to this ..so forget about normal matrices
in the mix columns stage the exponent are being multiplied

5186170
vbscript	vb6	vb6	vba
if your files aren t truly enormous even merely 40mb can be painfully slow you can do this using the following code in vb6 vba or vbscript note that it will handle utf-8 input files either with or without a bom
using strong typing and early binding will improve performance a hair in vb6 and you won t need to declare those const values

5186534
fgetc	getline
the internals may be able to exploit speedier operation - analogous to strchr - that are not available when you call fgetc directly
i suggest using fgets coupled with dynamic memory allocation - or you can investigate the interface to getline that is in the posix 2008 standard and available on more recent linux machines

5189290
tiff	png
tiff is not supported by most browsers
the solution is to convert the tiff to a png file

5189800
division	subtract
at last if memory serves the 6800 doesn t have a division instruction iirc that was added in the 6809 so you ll have to implement division on your own or if you don t care about speed just subtract the divisor repeatedly until the result is less than the divisor and that s your remainder
to just figure the remainder without the division is actually pretty easy in binary shift the divisor left until it s larger that the dividend shift it right one place if that s smaller than the dividend subtract it from the dividend repeat steps 2 and 3 until what s left of the dividend is smaller than the divisor that s your remainder for example let s figure the remainder after dividing 127 by 9

5191087
xslt	schematron
no in xslt schema there is no possibility to do that
there are two ways you can achieve what you want if you really have to stick with xsd-schema using schematron transformation and defining those rules if you re not forced to use xsd-schema by your environment you should really use relax ng instead

5191346
ocaml	sml
of course ocaml s objects and polymorphic variants are not presented.
sml has better support for continuations

5191426
cfstring	nsstring
cfstring is actually not really an nsstring at all it is the pure c string object used by core foundation
however you ll find it is toll free bridged to nsstring

5191710
actionscript	mxml
but if what you re really asking is whether you can learn flex without prior actionscript knowledge then the answer is yes
learning flex means learning both actionsript 3 and mxml languages so in essence you cannot learn flex without learning actionscript

5191896
ftp	telnet
ftp is typically exposed since it s less risk - ssh can be much more dangerous and i would suspect blocked if you re seeing a connection timeout message
putty is an ssh telnet client not an ftp client - different protocol different tcp port

5196862
nsmutablestring	nsstring
if you pull an object out which is actually an nsstring but try to use it as a nsmutablestring your app will fall over with selector not found or similar
so in that case you do need to make a new nsmutablestring from the nsstring

5197861
ienumerable	ilist
4 linq not so much a reason why it didn t happen more of why it isn t needed in the future. with linq and extension methods all ienumerable s now have find as an extension method only they called it where
i am a little bit confused why find for example isn t available on the ilist which list inherits from

5198501
super	implements
then you can create an abstract super class with all the methods implements this way etc...so checking this class you now which methods you have to implements so that the user of this object works well
notice that #shouldbeimplemented is implements in object with something like this in pharo smalltalk but as you can see it is just a convention it is not imposed by the language itself

5198877
swt	swing
swt alternative which uses facilities of operating systems on which it is implemented
swt community is smaller and it doesn t provide that many tools as swing does

5199608
cassini	iis
also since you re hosting this in cassini the address of your service will be dictated by cassini - you don t get to define anything
so my suggestion would be try to use http binding just now for testing get this to work once you know it works change it to your custom binding and host it in iis so i would change the config to once you have that try to do a view in browser on your svc file in your visual studio solution - if that doesn t work you still have a major problem of some sort

5202286
hex	binary
the two most common ways to convert it to a string would be base64 encode it download use nsdata s -description to get a string hex dump and clean it up i prefer #1 because the latter is dependent on the internal way that nsdata s -description call works but either should work
the token is an nsdata object which points to a raw binary blob of data not a string

5203896
emacs	textmate
that would be equivalent to emacs if you were on linux or e-texteditor if you were on windows
textmate it works on mac and it s a generic text editor though doesn t just work with rails

5204231
entity-relationship	diagram
most of the e-r diagram you ll see in so are really relational diagram masquerading as entity-relationship diagram
in a true entity-relationship diagram foreign keys are not present many-to-many relationships can be diagrammed as a single line and such things as gen-spec patterns look much the same way as they do in class diagram

5204231
entity-relationship	diagram
in a true entity-relationship diagram foreign keys are not present many-to-many relationships can be diagrammed as a single line and such things as gen-spec patterns look much the same way as they do in class diagram
if fact an entity-relationship diagram can be viewed as the projection of an object world onto the world of data only

5205792
nfa	dfa
your nfa appears correct but has a lot of superfluous states that aren t necessary but do not adversely affect its correctness
at first glance it looks like you could remove 11 states. your dfa is incorrect though

5206414
octal	decimal
octal digits only go from 0 to 7 so 9 is simply not legal in an octal number
the easiest workaround would be to simply write the numbers in decimal format 07001 in octal is the same as 3585 in decimal i think

5206566
pascal	delphi
i am a delphi expert so i don t quite know how restrictive plain pascal is
nevertheless this is delphi the first line can be written if you cannot use the windows api or the delphi fillchar function

5208555
uicontrol	uibutton
in the action method defined for the uibutton s touchupinside control event i have added the following line of code this results in the touchupinside control event being called when clicking anywhere in the custom uicontrol
i came up with a simple solution that doesn t need subclassing of the uibutton

5209118
mktime	strtotime
a neat trick for iterating dates is to take advantage of mktime s ability to normalize dates something like this
strtotime interprets 100227 as the time 10 02 27 today not 2010-02-27

5209228
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
alternatively you can limit your testing to ie safari and opera in which .reload is writable
the problem is that for some reason location.reload effectively is not a writable property in firefox and google-chrome

5209740
ienumerable	iqueryable
sounds like you want a foreach statement but if you really want to do it in lambda expressions and linq then your problem with the above code is that .select ... returns an ienumerable iqueryable which creates a new query but doesn t execute your lambda expressions
you could force the lambda to evaluate by calling an extension method that forces an enumeration of the data the ienumerable iqueryable represents

5210515
vim	gedit
one reason being that i actually have to do everything myself mostly so i know what s going on the same can be achieved with vim instead of gedit
i m not sure how you compile your c code from vim but in any way you need to create a make file and execute it to compile

5211518
sudo	passwd
you can also set up the sudoers file to not ask for a passwd on a per-command basis for example to allow user xy to use smbmount without asking for a passwd in your case it would be enough to just store the current user in a variable before invoking sudo and use the already saved username then read the username from 1. you can also use the sudo_user env variable which is set to the user who is invoking sudo
you can use the -e flag for sudo to preserve the environment variables or you can set up sudoers to preserve the environment on a per-command basis

5212216
qthread	qobject
you can use separate objects for qthread and whatever foo function
it might be easier too i m not sure.. iiuc this is what you have to do use qobject movetothread to assign the object containing the foo-function to testthread that means that qt autoconenction the default signal slots calls will run correctly across thread being dispatched from each thread s own event loop

5212344
jruby	mri
i m not a jruby expert but i have used it for a couple things recently and in my opinion the big win with jruby is the ability to use java code including existing java libraries in your ruby code and the ability for java to call and or embed ruby
most of jruby s documented success stories involve the ability to access java from ruby. also it is possible to run jruby on systems that may be difficult or impossible to get mri to run on

5213546
profiling	debugging
using a profiling isn t always possible due to timing issues while running under a profiling but those are common any time calls to malloc are intercepted
profiling is not available for your platform arch the debugging data from a logging malloc must be an integral part of the program we used a variant of the library that i linked in helenos i m not sure if they re still using it for quite a while as debugging at the vmm was known to cause insanity

5214874
equals	gethashcode
from msdn for iequalitycomparer.gethashcode implement this method to provide customized hash codes for objects corresponding to the customized equality comparison provided by the equals method
this is the problem you ll have to override gethashcode appropriately as well probably currently all items are considered different because the hash code doesn t match

5216312
rvm	bundler
it s also important that when using rvm you don t have to use sudo when running gem or bundle which is not only safer but less typing too
bundler takes care of that for you and will ensure that the correct version of each gem is installed since sometimes dependencies require an older version

5217191
gif	png
you cannot display an animated gif in an iphone application directly
what you should do is extract the individual frames of the animation from the gif save them as png files and then use uiimageview animation to perform the actual animation

5217214
bazaar	cvs
for visual studio integration afaik bazaar doesn t have any and git s is probably a bit behind the curve compared to svn visualsvn or ankhsvn and hg certainly if you want explorer integration as well as vs this gives you a choice of mercurial or subversion
a dvcs or cvs

5219026
ubuntu	linux
examples of oses are window mac os x unix ubuntu solaris
note that linux is not an os but rather a kernel which is the most important part of an os

5219216
aggregate-functions	sum
ideally access sql would have a product aggregate-functions available but it doesn t
we can however simulate it by remembering what we learned about logarithms at school or not... and remembering that the anti-log of the sum of logs is equal to the product select field2 exp sum log field3 as productoffield3 from t group by field2 note that whereas a true product function would simply return 0 for a group if there are any zero values this solution will fail if there are any zero values so watch out for that

5221035
nsstring	nsobject
see the question you were previously linked to - objective c nsstring property retain count oddity - but look for the second answer the highest rated one
whilst not technically a duplicate of the question nikolai linked to the same thing applies don t use the retaincount property it s possibly the worst thing apple ever put into nsobject because it s so nicely named it tricks you into thinking it s actually useful

5221960
profiling	debugging
i am not entirely sure why this is the case but from what i found while trying to debugging this there are some things that are gotten from the user s profiling
i know for a fact that the default location of the kernel is which explains why i couldn t use it with no arguments and so i can only assume that other things are needed as well and without the profiling it couldn t determine that

5222364
requestfactory	gwt
maintainability of ui increases due to almost no dependency on business logic increases amount of shared code between client and server due to limited gwt dependencies other complementing technologies that you are likely to adopt gwt-gin client side implementation of google guice gwtp makes it almost required or required - i never tried without it guice server side for consistency with client code but not necessary technically test mocking framework mockito always comes handy with mvp gwt uibinder - unless you are extremely dynamic in your ui design gwt eventbus - main method of client side communication in asynchronous environment like ajax javascript gwt-rpc via command-pattern gwtp dispatcher and or requestfactory
i have to disagree mvp makes code way less complex especially in case of gwt

5223160
innodb	myisam
also fulltext indexes only work with the myisam storage engine so if you are using a transactional engine like innodb this will not work
you should read the manual to learn about other features and limitations of fulltext indexes including boolean mode stopwords etc. assuming you are using myisam you can create 1 fulltext index on p.title p.content and another fulltext index on w.content then query the two indexes separately and use union all to combine the results

5224270
inline	inlining
gcc does not inline any functions when not optimizing unless you specify the always_inline attribute for the function like this to gnu c90 inlining
when an inline function is not static then the compiler must assume that there may be calls from other source files

5227029
inline	inlining
simple mathmatical operations that are chained together using functions are often inline by the compiler especially if the function is only called once in the translation step
so i wouldn t be surprised that the compiler takes inlining decisions for you regardless of weather the keyword is supplied or not

5229042
passenger	webrick	passenger	unicorn	passenger	thin
for example if you were using a class declared in passenger then you would be depending on it and should include it in your gemfile
the application itself would run without having passenger installed unicorn webrick mongrel thin etc. therefore passenger shouldn t really be in the gemfile

5229042
passenger	webrick	passenger	unicorn	passenger	thin
the application itself would run without having passenger installed unicorn webrick mongrel thin etc. therefore passenger shouldn t really be in the gemfile
installing passenger as a gem separately would be the correct choice in this instance

5229505
jquery	scriptaculous
it s strongly recommended that you do not add jquery unless it cannot be avoided
pretty much any functionality that jquery provides is also available in prototype scriptaculous it s just not as popular and or well marketed as jquery

5229505
jquery	scriptaculous
pretty much any functionality that jquery provides is also available in prototype scriptaculous it s just not as popular and or well marketed as jquery
as the other answers have suggested you need to put jquery into noconflict mode

5231231
addition	multiplication
look for addition chains brauer chains hansen chains and scholz conjecture
exponentiation by squaring does not give the minimal number of multiplication in all cases

5231746
appfuse	spring
appfuse good example but not updated for long time
in my experience integration of struts-menu with spring security only can controlled the main menu but it is enough for me

5236386
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
here is the technique i use albeit for uinavigationcontroller not uitabbarcontroller
but i m fairly certain you could make it work for a root uitabbarcontroller

5240419
awt	swing
looks like you are doing swing awt operations in the smack listener thread
swing is not thread-safe so you need to do all swing operations in the awt-eventqueue-0 thread

5241314
ssl	https
the reason you re seeing this issue is because the ssl termination is happening on apache and apache is making a vanilla http request to jetty
so jetty is getting a vanilla non-https request so it doesn t know to send out https responses instead of regular http responses

5241712
vb.net	vb6
move up to vb.net to get it back
no vb6 doesn t support multi-threading

5241945
punctuation	words
move words under cursor one words to right move words under cursor one words to left both do not work very well for words followed by punctuation marks
if you want to move a words with that special characters use the following mappings move right move left edit explanations added explanation dawelpb daw deletes the words under the cursor e places cursor at the end of the words right to the cursor l moves the cursor one position to the right p pasts the words and b places the cursor at the beginning of the pasted words

5242152
nfa	dfa
sometimes it could be even less than in the original nfa
but as far as i know the algorithm to predict how many states the resulting dfa will actually have doesn t exist yet

5242247
stateless	stateful
the gpu may be able to do stateless firewall processing but you d need to batch up packets and have it work on a few hundred at a time for there to be a benefit - this hurts latency and jitter and so the job is left to the cpu
moreover stateful tracking requires shared locked access to connection tracking tables something a gpu is not capable of

5245655
hex	binary
second ruby can accept numerals in source code written in different bases such decimal binary hex etc. but it only has one internal representation and you cannot output a numeral in binary
for your purpose you need to convert it to a string that corresponds to a binary expression

5247488
google-chrome	safari
the following code works fine in safari but doesn t work in google-chrome
jqueryui jquery 1.5.1 and jqueryui 1.8.10 won t display a dialog in google-chrome 10.0.648.127 mac if you have a broken tag for some reason

5247516
hazelcast	terracotta
i have not used hazelcast but i ve heard that it is easy to use and that it works
i haven t heard anything with respect to scalability or performance of hazelcast vs terracotta ehcache but given the amount of scalability and failover testing that terracotta does it s hard for me to imagine that hazelcast would be competitive in a production deployment

5249515
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
to taking approach 2 you d want to set the viewcontrollers property of the uitabbarcontroller in your loadview method of the uiviewcontroller that contains the tab bar controller ui
my original answer below there isn t a consistently named way to access the root view controller s across apple s provided view controllers such as uinavigationcontroller etc.

5250059
svg	vml
if you re okay with svg rather than canvas then the clear winner is raphael
raphael is great not only because it makes a lot of graphical tasks ridiculously simple but also because it even works in older versions of ie where it uses vml instead of svg

5253775
notepad++	sublimetext
on windows notepad++ does a pretty decent job another good option is aptana especially for javascript although it can be a bit heavy weight depending on the job
i ve also used sublimetext but not in any great depth and then there s microsoft expression web which is very similar to dreamweaver i thought they had a free express edition but apparently not

5255668
base	fractions
yes fp is perfectly accurate but cannot necessarily represent every number we can easily type in using base 10
update clarification well ironically it can represent exactly every integer because every integer has a composition but every fractions is another story

5255879
vbscript	vb6
here is the vbscript that does what you want i don t have vb6 on this machine to get you a perfect code example right now however simply changing the wscript.echo calls to debug.print you can pretty much run this in vb6
vb6 doesn t have a way to do this directly inside the language or the runtime as you would do in .net however windows has an extensive management interface that can be access through com

5257035
junit	testng
if what you want is to group your tests then the issue is not with spring-test but rather with junit where grouping tests is not possible
consider switching to testng also supported by spring ootb

5258520
cvs	svn
subversion svn and concurrent versioning system cvs are centralized version control systems not distributed ones dvcs
cvs supports about the same keywords as rcs since cvs was originally based on rcs and uses the same backend file format and automatically replaces them if the file is not specially marked at checkin

5260458
express	node.js
this answer is for static pages and files since static urls is not really a problem with node.js and it s covered here at the express js guide
using only node.js without any framework is a pretty bad idea if you re going to build a webapp

5260879
google-chrome	safari
i found a link from someone else who was having this problem solution here . it doesn t specifically mention google-chrome but safari does the same thing apparently
the link was an accepted answer posted in a google-chrome discussion edit wow second time this morning that i ve been out googled by another member

5268322
strdup	malloc
for pystring_asstring and strdup etc. this is not an option because there is no portable way to get the size of a region of memory -- malloc and free do not expose this functionality
besides you can pass a pointer to pystring_asstring which is in the middle of a malloc block or somewhere else entirely

5270729
jar	war
the jar war is a file what you are looking for is an entry within an archive aka a resource
and because it s not a file you will need to get it as an inputstream if the jar war is on the classpath you can do someclass.class.getresourceasstream path from the jar to maven.properties where someclass is any class inside that jar war these are equivalent someclass.class.getresourceasstream abc def

5272566
memmove	strncpy
replace strncpy with memmove
strncpy or strcpy does not work for overlapping strings

5274088
flask	django
it helped me set up a working django project but it shouldn t be that different for a flask app
check out django s page on the subject

5275768
division	modulo
to get 2 you can just do remember that integer division drops the fractions portion as it can t be represented in an integer
modulo division and regular division can be used for any power not just powers of two

5276121
requestfactory	gwt-rpc
the request objects used by requestfactory roughly approximate a command pattern since multiple request objects can be queued within a single requestcontext and evaluated with a single round-trip to the server
entityproxy is part of the requestfactory system and cannot be used with gwt-rpc

5279158
super	self
it is important to remember the set of methods super refers to is always those of the previous implementation of the method in the hierarchy it is not the same set as the set of instance methods which an instance of the superclass would be given unless your class were to override every method
at the low level self contains a pointer to the set methods it responds to

5280322
super	implements
self should be always assigned with value returned by super initializer because of super can return another object upon initialization it s not unusual btw
second version is actually an official way to implements methods

5282269
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
from a feature perspective if a library is needed for more than just basic resizing and cropping operations i personally would prefer imagemagick any day because of the vast well-documented and illustrated library of thousands of examples which work very well
graphicsmagick does not seem to have documentation of similar quality

5282474
mp3	ogg
it probably doesn t work in firefox because of the lack of native mp3 support
adding an ogg vorbis version of your music which you seem to have commented out in your source code should solve the problem

5282938
pascal	delphi
free pascal not only supports several operating systems it also supports 64 bit compiling so while embarcadero have all these things on the roadmap waiting for them to be released would be a bit like waiting for the lottery ticket to bring you a fortune sorry embarcadero i m still waiting for 64 bit
as i mentioned i haven t tried free pascal lazarus my self so it is a bit of a guess how complex moving from delphi to this solution is

5284915
division	subtraction
the standard way to do division is by implementing binary long-division
this involves subtraction so as long as you don t discount this as not a bit-wise operation then this is what you should do

5285928
implements	extends
example this code throws a fatal error in line 5 as a method from the interface is not properly implements argument missing . it would also throw a fatal error in line 6 as the method from the interface is not implements at all
extends is for inheritance inheriting the methods fields from the class

5289019
automake	autotools
one useful tip is that you can just run autoreconf instead of the whole chain of aclocal autoheader autoconf automake etc
the problem in this case is actually not the autotools but the c compiler itself - you are executing the compiler in your project s root directory to compile a file in src sub but since src sub2 is neither the current directory nor in the include path the compiler doesn t know where to find it

5289311
g++	gcc
note that according to cipher s comment below source files have to precede library options in order for g++ to compile them.
first you should use g++ to compile c++ code not gcc

5290064
google-chrome	firefox
on google-chrome just removing the elements was enough to prevent google-chrome starting the download of the images but on firefox+firebug it not only started downloading them but continued even when the download took considerable time
clearing the src causes firefox to abort the download i can see this in the firebug net console

5290832
tftp	tcp
tftp is a very stupid protocol where each frame is individually acknowledged and the sender waits for the response before sending the next frame
this is not a good way of doing file transfer and is much worse than tcp

5291588
jmeter	soapui
jmeter seems to be a bit better suited as it aimes for performance testing but soapui can do this as well
there are at least two not obvious tools that can help you soapui has support for jdbc jmeter has a jdbc sampler don t miss these wonderful plugins

5294351
factors	mean
the acceleration along each axis is then note the x and y factors which are missing from the formula you stated
i m not sure what you mean by converting the gravitational constant to seconds . the value you re using for g has units of newton-meter 2 kg 2

5294847
consistency	acid
your question should be rephrased that you are concerned with database consistency and concurrency on the customer table during an insert not seeing a customer that somebody else has created
there is a very standardized way in a relational database that fulfills the acid properties atomicity consistency isolation durability to deal with this wrap the check insert in a transaction

5297376
ienumerable	icollection
if not then you need to go back to the non-generic ienumerable and use
if your s are all objects that implement icollection which is likely as most of the collection classes in the bcl that implement also implement icollection then you can simply cast to icollection although you will lose type-safety

5297467
postgresql	mysql
on duplicate key update is mysql syntax not postgresql
postgresql doesn t have a simple sql syntax to do what you want

5302408
db4o	eloquera
i think that eloquera www.eloquera.com is better than db4o and additionally has better licensing
for instance eloquera is free for commercial use and db4o not db4o has the same licensing options than mysql free for free but paid for commercial use

5302580
hex	binary
if you save your image you ll notice in a hex editor it s binary image data with your little snipped of html appened to the end of the file
you cannot mix binary responses with html content responses

5302867
bazaar	git
bazaar has a more complicated model including support for file directory renames
it s difficult to say how much more complicated though because whatever documentation may exist is not nearly as accessible as git s

5302867
bazaar	svn
hg seems fairly similar to bazaar though i think it tracks renames only for individual files not for directories
it also supports plugins though its svn plugin isn t as nice as bazaar s it doesn t support lossless commits so branching from other peoples branches is unwise

5307072
factors	matrix
after a few camera rotations only the last couple digits will be modified so think of it as a fudge factors to keep things from drifting over long periods of time
hopefully the two current answers are adequate so i ll just add on a theoretical note that the reason this arises and the reason it s not too important how you handle it is that the nine numbers that form a 3x3 rotation matrix and describe how your camera is oriented are more than necessary

5307212
udp	tcp	recvfrom	datagram
as such i am not aware of any scenerios in which a zero byte return code from recvfrom on a udp socket would be caused by anything other than a zero length datagram being received
when calling recvfrom on a tcp socket you will receive a zero byte read if a fin packet has been received an orderly shutdown

5308767
udp	tcp
you can use a tcp connection or a udp connection
the udp protocol is faster but it s very unreliable so it s good for streaming video but not for sending files you ll need to open later

5308767
udp	tcp
the udp protocol is faster but it s very unreliable so it s good for streaming video but not for sending files you ll need to open later
but a plain tcp connection is not faster than ftp at least in my experience

5309957
redmine	trac
although that said be aware that there is a fork of redmine called chiliproject set up to resolve management bottlenecks
i ve not used any of the scrum methodologies but for the project management i would favour redmine over trac

5309957
redmine	trac
i ve not used any of the scrum methodologies but for the project management i would favour redmine over trac
redmine handles multiple projects and sub projects far nicer than trac

5309979
innodb	myisam
an important point to remember is that foreign keys in mysql only work with the innodb storage engine
myisam does not support foreign keys

5311733
webclient	httpwebrequest
doing this with webclient will be very tricky i m not sure if it s even possible on the phone
use httpwebrequest instead

5311776
uiview	subviews
now you can find the button directly through this can be done for any uiview subclass not just uibuttons
looping through a uiview s subviews is an unreliable way to find a button

5312437
spweb	spsite
you re right disposing the spsite will close the associated spweb objects
the main scenario where you want to close spweb s right away is when you do something like for normal opening and closing of one spsite spweb this doesn t matter but i would argue it is still good practice especially for new sharepoint developers

5313252
google-chrome	firefox
yep that s the current behavior of google-chrome but i wouldn t expect it to continue to be the policy in the future
in firefox 4 if you enable websockets in about config you will get a warning about the certificate

5315675
profiling	benchmarking
i would highly recommend doing your own profiling and measurement if you truly believe this is a serious issue
i would not recommend using performance benchmarking to pick an ioc container

5317815
client-side	server-side
.net code within the .aspx files shouldn t be visible on the client-side because it has no use on the client-side
it should be executed on the server-side to render html output to the client

5318065
backtracking	greedy
then for some reason your library isn t deciding to backtracking and try another match thanks paul rubel marcog
this may be a quirk of your library or usage in treating the regex greedy

5318896
equals	compareto
equals + hashcode every good immutable class should implement equals and hashcode in a suitable and compatible way
for our hashcode we simply sum up the digits multiplying them with a small prime to make sure digit-switching does not result in same hash code in the equals method we simply can delegate to the compareto method instead of implementing the same algorithm again so enough for today

5318896
multiplying	subtraction	multiplying	division
for our hashcode we simply sum up the digits multiplying them with a small prime to make sure digit-switching does not result in same hash code in the equals method we simply can delegate to the compareto method instead of implementing the same algorithm again so enough for today
subtraction and maybe negative numbers and division are more complicated so i m omitting them for now

5318896
division	subtract
we need only division by small one-digit numbers here which may be easier than a general division. division by small numbers in school i learned long division
here is an example for a small one-digit divisor in the notation we use here in germany with annotations about the background calculations which we normally would not write in decimal system of couse we don t need to calculate these products 0 12 0 30 42 and subtract them if we have a native remainder operation

5318933
super	self
note the change to both super calls class foo object def __init__ self print foo class bar foo def __init__ self print bar super bar self .__init__ class baz bar def __init__ self print baz super baz self .__init__
the call to super takes the current class as the first argument not the super class super works that out for itself

5319978
backtracking	greedy
so it backtracking making the greedy quantifier match one less thing leaving the o at the end of the string unmatched
that still doesn t match the f in the regex so it backtracking one more step making the greedy quantifier match one less thing again leaving the oo at the end of the string unmatched

5319978
backtracking	greedy
that still doesn t match the f in the regex so it backtracking one more step making the greedy quantifier match one less thing again leaving the oo at the end of the string unmatched
that still doesn t match the f in the regex so it backtracking one more step leaving the foo at the end of the string unmatched

5321193
union	distinct
columns that are formed by using the set operators union union all crossjoin except and intersect amount to a computation and are also not updatable
the columns being modified are not affected by group by having or distinct clauses

5322101
division	multiplication
each stage of the division needs to look at n bits during the comparison
each stage of the multiplication is independent of all other stages doesn t matter the order you add the partial products

5323609
ssl	https
and yes you need to use https ssl or some other form of encryption as someone with admin rights on the local machine can see any data you send over the network there is no other way of hiding it from them
just using https isn t enough of course

5324396
alloca	calloc	alloca	malloc
note that alloca is an exemption - it allocates on stack so you should never free what you got from it
you didn t malloc or calloc mystructarray so you shouldn t free it

5325924
awt	swing
awt components are heavyweight
awt components are considered heavyweight because each awt component will cause the allocation of a native peer component whereas swing components do not

5326902
ienumerable	ilist
if you look at the source of elementat with reflector you will see that it will internally use the index access if the ienumerable is of type ilist
ienumerable doesn t support direct index access if you know you have a list keep using the second form since it is much easier to read arguably

5326902
ienumerable	ilist
ienumerable doesn t support direct index access if you know you have a list keep using the second form since it is much easier to read arguably
elementat is supported for all enumerations not just lists - performance wise they are the same when used on a type of ilist a generic list but if you have a list using the index access is more expressive

5327007
rsa	aes
you may think about signing the pdf using rsa that is a good way to make sure it has not been compromised
if your pdf is encrypted using 128 bits aes then it is safe from someone that would not know the key the most plausible explanation is that someone has had access to the key

5329644
swt	swing
so in my view using swing is simply easier unless you have more experience in swt almost any swing framework can be used with spring
we used swing application framework but it really does not matter

5330319
udp	tcp
i.e html pictures etc. udp - used for traffic that doesn t suffer much if a packet is dropped video voice streaming some data channels of online games etc
tcp guarantees in-order packet delivery

5330319
udp	tcp
udp doesn t
tcp - used for traffic that you need all the data for

5330970
punctuation	words
you would have to redefine the words you look up to exclude the punctuation remembering that you might or might not want to eliminate all punctuation for example you might want to keep dashes and apostrophes - but not single quotes
the crude technique - not recognizing any punctuation is you can refine the substitute command to meet your needs

5333059
uiview	calayer
it s true that you re not technically supposed to look at the frame property of a uiview after transformation but it s also not technically pertinent to the question you re asking
when applying caffinetransforms to a uiview the transformation takes into consideration the uiview s backing calayer s anchorpoint property

5333224
svg	vml
unfortunately svg is not supported on ie
fortunately on ie you can use vml instead of svg

5333415
implements	extends
so let s use inheritance to define our concrete greeting types it s not absolutely necessary to have an interface and an abstract implements the interface
we could have made our concrete greetings not extends from the greetingtype

5335336
mp3	wav
safari and ie don t support ogg vorbis but support mp3
chrome supports both mp3 and ogg vorbis but doesn t support wav

5335891
actionscript	mxml
recent versions of flashbuilder allow for creation actionscript air project directly
if this isn t your case just create new air mxml application add new actionscript class and set it as default application

5335891
actionscript	mxml
if this isn t your case just create new air mxml application add new actionscript class and set it as default application
then you can remove mxml

5338869
client-side	server-side
php works server-side and therefore cannot print anything on the client-side
it can t do anything on the client-side actually other than via generated html css javascript etc

5339528
portrait	landscape
putting in that attribute should be done as a last resort and typically for activities that do not have separate portrait versus landscape layout files
but problem is when i change the phone orientation to landscape my landscape layout does not work

5341243
dbcontext	objectcontext
both generators produce the same entities however ado.net poco entity generator is based on objectcontext s api whereas ado.net dbcontext generator is based on dbcontext s api
dbcontext s api has a few very nice new features local query on navigation property etc. and api is somehow simplified but at the same time it looks like some features used in objectcontext api are missing in dbcontext api or at least it has not been explored enough yet

5342630
vbscript	jscript
however you cannot pass a vbscript function as an argument
from my experience if you were to rewrite this function in jscript you could use it when you re calling json.stringify to ensure that dictionaries do get rendered properly

5342735
cstring	bstr
if you want to pass a string to the callback or retrieve a string from it you have to take into consideration that vb string s are not equal to c s c++ std string s or microsoft s cstring s
vb string s must be mapped to microsoft s rather obscure bstr data type

5343234
nsmutablestring	nsstring
it sounds like it must be getting set to an nsstring instead of an nsmutablestring
just because you have declared displaystring as an nsmutablestring that doesn t mean that it is always going to point to an nsmutablestring

5345267
mp3	wav
are you certain you don t mean a boolean and instead of an or extension is neither wav nor mp3
i would expect the result of the second expression to be true regardless of the value of the string strext any extension is either not equal to wav or not equal to mp3

5345276
mp3	wav
i think what you re trying to say is something like neither wav nor mp3 which is logically equivalent to not wav and not mp3
your logic is flawed if your variable strext was equal to wav it would not be equal to mp3 and versa-visa

5345536
jax-ws	saaj
cxf uses by default the build-in java saaj implementation but can also support axis2-saaj cxf faq last but not least is the jax-ws also relies on saaj
both cxf and jax-ws allow you to work directly on the xml level

5345681
client-side	server-side
client-side scripting has access to all url parts and the server can put it s response there encoded as part of it as well as the name of the callback that has to be invoked
means - this page can be a static and html page and does not have to be a dynamic server-side page this utility page will take the information from the url it runs in - specifically in my implementation bellow - the query-string parameters or you can write your own implementation using anchor-id - i.e the part of a url right to the # sign

5355270
udp	tcp
the newer rtmfp uses udp and requires the ability to make outbound connections to 1935 and also higher port numbers in order to establish a server connection
running over port 443 and 80 udp wouldn t help the firewall is likely configured to open up tcp 443 https and tcp 80 http while still blocking udp outbound udp to be enabled

5355482
ant	emma
see the emma documentation for how to integrate emma into ant or maven scripts
the emma hudson plugin does not generate coverage.xml

5356170
prefuse	jung
i am not experienced with prefuse but i ve seen some beautiful visualizations created with it
here are the answers to those questions for jung

5357408
queue	fifo
it wouldn t even need to be persistent like that since the intentservice s own queue is not persistent
just maintain your own fifo queue in onstartcommand chaining to the superclass and popping your intent off the queue at the end of onhandleintent

5357684
fgets	strtol
this is one disadvantage to using fgets . erroneous input - handle however you like
here s a way no one else suggested that doesn t use fscanf so you can have sane error handling basically instead of trying to use s d to read characters use the function it probably calls to do the conversion strtol

5360231
rational-numbers	fractions
.net doesn t have built-in support that i know of for rational-numbers but there is at least one existing library out there
your solution will ultimately come down to storing the numerator and denominator probably in a custom class that you create doing arithmetic against other numerator denominator pairs possibly by implementing overloaded operators on your class and applying a fractions simplification algorithm

5363141
innodb	myisam
quote bug #45987 error 1075 42000 incorrect table definition actually this is not a server bug just a difference between myisam assumed as default by that manual page and innodb storage engine documented elsewhere myisam is no longer the default engine
innodb is

5363141
innodb	myisam
innodb is
also conclusion innodb doesn t support auto_increment but no primary key being defined for the table but myisam does

5369402
opera	firefox
working at least in opera 11.10beta
for single item select with background-color transparent firefox shows image google-chrome and opera doesn t

5371545
implements	extends
from within your constructor or you havn t implements required class properties methods on initialization
try extends button not simplebutton see if that works better for you

5371680
implements	extends
since by definition a java class is serializable if it implements the serializable interface a serializable class cannot have a non-serializable subclass
so one should think twice before implementing that interface on a class high up the inherited tree or extends it in an interface

5371950
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i d also go with webgl because it is a standard from khronos group since february. firefox got it for almost one year but still in the version 4 beta rc . google-chrome got it in the current version. opera just implemented it i think not entirely yet as yojimbo87 tell you microsoft is not part of the khronos group because microsoft support directx which is in concurrency with opengl
as for o3d google used it as a plugin-api but on the main web page you can see it s now deprecated. for other way of doing 3d on web you can use something like vrml x3d flash got something serious but here is the good thing that happen with webgl you have webgl implemented on firefox for mobile phone who will be coming soon . i think it won t take long til it google-chrome and safari will be doing the same

5372482
scheme	racket
mit scheme is known for strong interactivitiy support while plt racket feels much more static
in any case interactive programming does not seem to be a central concern to most scheme subcommunities and i have yet to see a programming environment similarly interactive as most common lisps

5372482
lisp	scheme
in any case interactive programming does not seem to be a central concern to most scheme subcommunities and i have yet to see a programming environment similarly interactive as most common lisp
common lisp is a battle-worn language designed for practical programming

5372482
lisp	scheme
it is also extremely dynamic arguably more so than any of the popular dynamic scripting languages class redefinition applies to existing instances for example and the condition handling system has interactivity built right in and interactive exploratory programming is an important part of the common lisp way. this is also reflected in the programming environments available for common lisp practically all of which offer some sort of direct interaction with the running lisp compiler
common lisp features a built-in object system clos a condition handling system significantly more powerful than mere exception handling run-time patchability and various kinds of built-in data structures and utilites including the notorious loop macro an iteration sublanguage much too ugly for scheme but much too useful not to mention as well as a printf-like formatting mechanism with goto support in format strings

lisp	scheme

both because of the image-based interactive development and because of the larger language lisp implementations are usually less portable across operating systems than scheme implementations are

5372482
lisp	scheme
both because of the image-based interactive development and because of the larger language lisp implementations are usually less portable across operating systems than scheme implementations are
getting a common lisp to run on an embedded device is not for the faint of heart for example

5372503
prepare	execute
for your loop you d issue the start transaction before your prepare then your commit after the loop exits
you probably should not try to open a transaction after a prepared statement has been started but before it s been execute

5375357
nunit	mstest
i used nunit mstest both in past and i like nunit because it not only supports various mocking frameworks like nmock rhinomock moq etc
it also makes the life easier where you can directly run the unit tests from nunit ui without opening the vs interface

5377938
firefox	safari
for example if i have a method on my applet called someaction that s callable from javascript i would do this approach seemed to fix the issue for me in firefox
it does not get around same origin problems in safari though for example if you want to serve the javascript from a different domain than the applet

5377967
exponent	modulo
i must also add that designing the rsa key so that the private exponent is substantially shorter than the modulo to speed up operations is a security risk if the exponent is smaller than 29 of the modulo length then the key can be cracked
therefore all of the text above about exponentiation speed and the length of the exponent really applies to the public exponent only which we can choose to be small at which point the discussion on the window-based optimizations do not apply anymore

5379718
apache	lighttpd
theoretically because of a smaller footprint lighttpd should allow more users to visit site at the same time using exactly the same resources as apache would
as example just to prove the point this is not the real numbers on the same hardware apache would allow 100 users to view your page at the same time while lighttpd would allow 150

5379718
apache	lighttpd
as example just to prove the point this is not the real numbers on the same hardware apache would allow 100 users to view your page at the same time while lighttpd would allow 150
lighttpd also has a different scheme of mapping processes so it would serve better when the number of visitors is spiking

5380126
nhibernate	queryover
unfortunately the current linq provider in nhibernate 3.0 does not really support the kind of query you are trying to do here
instead you can try using queryover

5381424
boost	stl
if you take a look at the reference you will notice that it is advertised to be a boost single_pass_traversal_tag
this is the equivalent in boost terminology of the input iterator in the stl think of it as an iterator delivering packets from a network connection you cannot rewind

5381997
udp	tcp
in cases like that you can use a cousin of tcp called udp which doesn t re-send lost packets
udp stands for user datagram protocol but many people think of it as unreliable data protocol

5382685
nsstring	nsobject
description is defined as returning an do not try to learn about subclassing and overriding methods by subclassing nsstring or any other class cluster
if you want to play with subclassing and such -- a very good idea when new to the language assuredly -- then subclass nsobject potentially multiple levels and play there

5387951
postgresql	mysql
ruby + postgresql pain in the ass
i not wondering why everybody uses mysql instead of postgres

5387951
postgresql	mysql
i not wondering why everybody uses mysql instead of postgresql
with mysql i never had so much trouble

5388900
decimal	ieee
it s the closest decimal representation to the binary floating-point number that results from the sum
the problem is that ieee floats cannot represent 43.65 + 61.11 exactly due to the use of a binary mantissa

5389178
stateless	stateful
these are by design stateless in contrast to other web technologies that try to somehow keep state
in fact what you say that asp.net is stateless isn t correct - asp.net tries hard to keep state using viewstate and are definitely to be characterized as stateful

5389178
stateless	stateful
in fact what you say that asp.net is stateless isn t correct - asp.net tries hard to keep state using viewstate and are definitely to be characterized as stateful
asp.net mvc on the other hand is a stateless technology

5389702
google-chrome	firefox
by the way in google-chrome linux it works
in firefox linux it doesn t

5391227
datalist	repeater
but datalist can do your job
i am not sure whether repeater is having property repeatcolumn repeatrow and repeatdirection property

5392262
mvp	presenter
in mvp you should not be using methods from another presenter
the view should only now about the existence of it s own presenter

5393457
realloc	malloc
if you get unlucky it will instead corrupt memory causing a crash some time later or worse incorrect output. the only way to partially deallocate memory is realloc with a smaller size but that s only good for trimming at the end and isn t guaranteed to make the trimmed-off chunk available for some other allocation
you must always pass exactly the same pointer to free that you got from malloc or realloc . if you don t the behavior is undefined which is a term of art that means you can t rely on the program behaving in any predictable way

5393483
daemons	systemd
you might try the following in your shell script if your operating systemd has a daemons command
i checked in freebsd and it has one daemons 8 this is not a command available on all unix alike systemd however there might be a different command doing the same thing in your operating systemd

5393483
daemons	systemd
i checked in freebsd and it has one daemons 8 this is not a command available on all unix alike systemd however there might be a different command doing the same thing in your operating systemd
the daemons utility detaches itself from the controlling terminal and executes the program specified by its arguments

5393692
gridbaglayout	miglayout
if for some reason you can t use external dependencies then you will want to look at gridbaglayout
gridbaglayout will be powerful enough to do everything you need but it is not as easy to use as something like miglayout

5395745
vsto	add-in
this will not execute when deployed as a vsto template because it s not the type of add-in word expects in order to run autoexec it expects either .wll files or .dot files in your startup folder
the way around this for vsto is to use autoopen instead which will execute the code in that sub routine when the template is opened as a vsto add-in

5397108
onclick	onchange
i looked at this msdn page and it seems that an option doesn t have an onclick event
however it does have a onselect or onchange event

5397731
implements	extends
that way circle square and image could all implements that protocol while extends either uiview or uiimageview as needed
you ve realized that a class cannot extends two parent classes

5398476
listview	gridview
in wpf the property for data population is called itemssource you probably want to either use a listview or datagrid to display your data that way
the gridview is a view and not a standalone control as far as i know you would normally use it as the view of a listview

5399186
actionscript	mxml
adobe flash cs does not include this compiler nor does it contain many of the actionscript classes that mxml gets converted to
no mxml is not natively supported in flash

5403883
exponent	modulo
the private key is the modulo and the multiplicative inverse of the public exponent and depending upon the toolkit you re using it might also store your cn dn for x509 keys or subkeys for gpg keys so just comparing sizes may not be useful
don t forget that 2048 is the length of the modulo in bits but your measurement of the private key is in bytes

5404748
backgrounding	multitasking
for more info on backgrounding and the events generated see
my answer would be as per kirky todds but don t use applicationwillterminate -- it s not a good strategy on ios4+ with multitasking because this method often won t get called -- an app will be background and then can be dumped from memory if other apps are run or the phone is turned off restarted without applicationwillterminate getting called

5406082
hex	binary
presuming it is some form of der asn.1 i nslog d it to the console as hex and loaded it into this program
sure enough the internal representation is der asn.1 but it is a very simplified version of what i normally found for rsa key representations shouldn t be too tough to construct on the fly from a binary rep

5407974
viewmodel	caliburn
if the container is global the child view models could simply call another way to wire the view models into the views is to create an instance of the viewmodel in xaml like this this method is not compatible with unity
there are a few mvvm frameworks that allow you to resolve types in xaml i believe caliburn does

5409867
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
it s not recommended to do this i mean subclassing of uitabbarcontroller but uitabbarcontroller forbids rotation if not all uiviewcontroller do allow rotation
make sure your rotatable view returns yes in shouldautorotatetointerfaceorientation method of uiviewcontroller

5409867
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
subclass uitabbarcontroller override shouldautorotatetointerfaceorientation and handle rotation here based on current uiviewcontroller s shouldautorotatetointerfaceorientation return value
you have to also check if current view controller is uinavigationcontroller or not and if yes you have to get current view controller from uinavigationcontroller too

5411022
opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
there are native implementations in google-chrome and opera and there s a jquery plugin to emulate the interface when the browser doesn t implement it
they wanted to slip it into firefox 4 but they couldn t quite make the cutoff

5411810
quicksort	mergesort
when sorting to it does not matter which of the fives was the first one before. so we can use the quicker and non-stable quicksort algorithm here
the reason for using mergesort is that they want a stable algorithm - where equal objects by compareto or compare are at the same relative order as before

google-chrome	firefox
it s kind of a hack but you just turn off that line if google-chrome or can try
ie since firefox probably doesn t need it either

5413082
vaadin	smartgwt
as far as widget goes they do not offer as many eye candy stuff as vaadin gxt or smart but i like to stick with the bases
smart i used smartgwt for enterprise level projets and it does the job

5417466
viewdidload	viewdidappear
btw the viewdidunload method is really badly named btw -- it s not an opposite to viewdidload it s only called if there was a low memory situation and the view for that controller was unloaded due to not being visible at that time
basically viewdidappear gets called after your uiviewcontroller s view was added to the application s uiwindow heirarchy

5417593
postgresql	mysql
if the mysql dump is in plain sql format you will need to edit the file to make the syntax correct for postgresql remove the non-standard backtick quoting remove the engine definition for the create table statements adjust the data types and a lot of other things
it is not possible to import an oracle binary dump to postgresql

5418648
udp	tcp
udp do not guarantee that your messages arrive in the correct order or that they arrive at all
tcp on the other hand is connection-based

5418648
udp	tcp
the close method on a udp socket will only free system resources
a call on client.close will not notify the server socket as it will with tcp

5418890
vbscript	jscript
that s not possible using vbscript unless you want to dynamically generate the code for a class including the properties save that to file and then execute that file as a script
this is so much easier to do using jscript

5419009
ssl	https
if you want to send information securely you need to consider a secure transport such as ssl https
if you are not using ssl then anyone will be able to read either of those with ease

5423639
uiview	subviews
from uiview class reference for complex views declared in uikit and other system frameworks any subviews of the view are generally considered private and subject to change at any time
therefore you should not attempt to retrieve or modify subviews for these types of system-supplied views

5426030
implements	extends
we now had to implements some cron jobs which runs every day every day we make a list of passes which are supposed to expire and we ask apple if the original receipt is still valid the magic thing is that in their answer there is a field latest-receipt which embeds the latest receipt
if it is not the same as the one we have we understand that the subscription has been renewed automatically we store the latest receipt for the next cron check and we update the user account to extends the expiration date

5427438
google-chrome	safari
what i really want is -webkit-font-smoothing subpixel-antialiased but that only seems to work in google-chrome and puts safari back the way it looked before
to be clear google-chrome doesn t exhibit the anti-aliasing problem but does respect the style definitions above

5428001
move	drag
i don t really know what i m doing here but this move more controllably at least
first explicitly set the canvas size then in __init__ add a couple of instance variables to keep track of the current position then replace the drag method with this i don t know why you have to cast those numbers to float but it doesn t work if you don t

5428843
union	distinct
you could also do this with a union
the union operator returns distinct results so there will not be any duplicates

5429820
multiplying	multiplication
you re doing a simple multiplying by 2 n using bitwise shifts though this should be used sparingly i usually only do this when looking to improve readability not for speed improvements
no for two big reasons your hardware likely has built-in support for multiplication

5432590
postgresql	mysql
and to be clear mature rdbms such as postgresql server oracle do not allow to specify in group by or any fields without aggregation or that was not specified in group by - and it is great limitation
that is because mysql does not guarantee what exact rows will be returned for the fields that are not used in aggregation functions or wasn t used to group by

5434950
png	ico
since a png isn t an ico the browser needs to support png images as favicons for this to work
you can t use a png as an ico

5438754
nhibernate	queryover
nhibernate linq is a promising feature with lots of potential
unfortunately i have already encountered several situations where a query in linq did not work and i had to use queryover another very fine addition

5439079
gitolite	gitosis
having gitosis pre-installed shouldn t affect how gitolite works but of course there might be some conflict
i have never installed gitosis just gitolite

5439354
spaces	delimiter
maybe not the most efficient but you could use regular expressions and replacefirst basically it finds the first instance of either a spaces or plus sign + which we had to escape with two since + is also a special symbol in regular expressions along with any other characters following it up to the end and replaces it with an empty string
if you needed to extend the code to catch other delimiter like maybe

5439586
client-side	server-side
the benefit of client-side validation is that the user doesn t have to wait for a page to postback
validation constraints are best declared server-side

5439989
codeigniter	yii
what i ended up doing in codeigniter was to add the facebook php sdk to my libraries directory and change the __construct function of the facebook class to be then i added all of the above key value pairs to config config.php added the facebook library to the autoloads list once that was done i could access the fb api from anywhere in my app through
having said all that this was all pre-2.0 so i m not entirely sure what the changes would be if needed i m using yii now which is mainly why i don t know if changes are required

5440071
spaces	delimiter
this pattern makes a field delimiter reside side by side with another one like this |john ||betty ||wally ||beth| then the zero with field generated between delimiter is also padded with the extra 1 spaces by default
i d open spaces for a delimiter that doesn t cause a delimiter to be near others

5440071
spaces	delimiter
i d open spaces for a delimiter that doesn t cause a delimiter to be near others
simply adding a spaces after the comma

5442823
spaces	delimiter
since it s not mentioned anywhere in the grammar the only way to encode a spaces is with percent-encoding 20
in fact the rfc even states that spaces are delimiter and should be ignored in some cases extra whitespace spaces line-breaks tabs etc. may have to be added to break a long uri across lines

5446525
apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd
if you re intending to run a larger public site then you ll want to consider running web2py with another web server - apache will work with web2py under windows
see chapter 11 in the online book. of course just because you started development on windows doesn t mean your final deployment has to be windows based - you can pretty much just transfer your code over to a linux server with web2py and optionally apache nginx cherokee lighttpd installed and your set

5452041
super	self
i can reproduce your error if i de-indent the super line
upon starting the server even typing in super idontexist self should not throw an error until save is called

5452837
backtracking	greedy
this is a form of backtracking hierarchical clustering
consider some form of recursive greedy merge -- each point begins as a singleton cluster and repeatedly merge the closest two such that such a merge doesn t exceed max

5453325
union	distinct
note nested types and functions cannot be declared within an anonymous union
end note the names of the members of an anonymous union shall be distinct from the names of any other entity in the scope in which the anonymous union is declared

5455535
punctuation	words
i suppose you need to consider punctuation and other non-word non-whitespace characters as well
you want 200 words not counting whitespace and non-letter characters

5455903
implements	extends
note however that it is possible to change mappings in the associated map using put putifabsent or replace depending on exactly which effect you need. concurrenthashmap internally uses a hashentry class analogously to the hashmap but this does not implements anything
additionally there is an internal class writethroughentry extends abstractmap.simpleentry whose setvalue method delegates to the put method of the map

5457512
dbcontext	objectcontext
it mainly contains dbcontext api code-first development approach code-first is probably not what you are looking for at the moment
if you are using objectcontext api and edmx + poco t4 template you can continue with it

5457816
profiling	debugging
the solution for me was to make sure that my profiling scheme was using the debugging and not release build configuration
in xcode 4 select product edit scheme from the top menu then click on the profiling button on the left

5459132
division	multiplication	division	modulo	multiplication	modulo
some processors do not even have an integer division opcode multiplication on n -bit values can be optimized into a circuit of depth o log n whereas there is no known method to optimize a division circuit below a depth of o n
if the divisor is known in advance for code produced by a c compiler this is a constant known at compile time then integer division from which the modulo can be easily obtained can sometimes be implemented with a multiplication and a shift

5459339
persistent	transient
edit for your information on attached persistent and detached objects hibernate defines and supports the following object states transient - an object is transient if it has just been instantiated using the new operator and it is not associated with a hibernate session
it has no persistent representation in the database and no identifier value has been assigned

5459339
persistent	transient
it has no persistent representation in the database and no identifier value has been assigned
transient instances will be destroyed by the garbage collector if the application does not hold a reference anymore

5459339
persistent	transient
hibernate will detect any changes made to an object in persistent state and synchronize the state with the database when the unit of work completes
developers do not execute manual update statements or delete statements when an object should be made transient

5465024
imperative	declarative
one word i haven t seen mentioned here yet is declarative declarative programming is often defined as any style of programming that is not imperative
a number of other common definitions exist that attempt to give the term a definition other than simply contrasting it with imperative programming

5465648
serializable	deserialization
what ever picks up your class in serializable format may not have the method information which is in the original assembly of a non dto class
secondly a class may reference a resource db connection file handle etc do not serialize these since deserialization does not re-establish resource connections and state unless explicitly designed for but is still a bad idea

5465648
serializable	deserialization
secondly a class may reference a resource db connection file handle etc do not serializable these since deserialization does not re-establish resource connections and state unless explicitly designed for but is still a bad idea
so in summary do not serializable when you have contextual methods and storing data for a thrid party to use

5467603
portrait	landscape
let s take the case of an image captured with a portrait orientation the original image height is higher than its width woo no surprise so far
the image that the cgimagecreatewithimageinrect method imagines in its own world is not really a portrait though but a landscape that is also why if you don t use the orientation argument in the imagewithcgimage constructor it will show up as 180 rotated

5467603
portrait	landscape
the image that the cgimagecreatewithimageinrect method imagines in its own world is not really a portrait though but a landscape that is also why if you don t use the orientation argument in the imagewithcgimage constructor it will show up as 180 rotated
so you should kind of imagine that it is a landscape the 0 0 position being the top right corner of the image

5468599
realloc	malloc
unless ptr is null it must have been returned by an earlier call to malloc calloc or realloc
however you shouldn t forget that realloc can return null if it can t resize the memory

5471519
phpunit	simpletest
at least i couldn t find anything so my clear recommendation is to got with phpunit as there are only upsides
for my general take on phpunit vs simpletest please see this question what unit testing in php to start

5471519
phpunit	simpletest
for netbeans netbeans as great phpunit support and i ve never seen or heard of anything like that for simpletest
i m not even sure it can run tests written with simpletest at all

5471754
spaces	linefeed
from pcrepattern specifications page generic character types s any white spaces character for compatibility with perl s did not used to match the vt character code 11 which made it different from the the posix spaces class. however perl added vt at release 5.18 and pcre followed suit at release 8.34
the default s characters are now ht 9 linefeed 10 vt 11 ff 12 cr 13 and spaces 32 which are defined as white spaces in the c locale

5473976
vsto	add-in
vsto add-in s have to be installed via an installer
a .net vsto add-in dll is not a normal com dll for instance it doesn t self register it has no tlb embedded within it so word can t deal with it through that add-in s dialog as far as i know

5474166
awt	swing	swt	swing
it is really only appropriate for situation where there is an enormous amount of awt swing and a temporary solution is necessary while the ui is ported to swt
it is not easy to mix swt and awt swing ui in the same process

5476163
portrait	landscape
this will mean if your device is in landscape and you switch activity the new activity will display in portrait on its side and the user will then have to rotate the phone into portrait mode to view it correctly
if your device is in landscape orientation and you re not specifically setting orientation for the other activities then they will show in landscape orientation

5476284
innodb	myisam
mvcc cannot even be applied to innodb in some instances
aspect #2 myisam s involvement from another perspective if any myisam tables are being updated via inserts updates or deletes the myisam tables involved in a join query would be locked from other db connections and the join query has to wait until the myisam tables can be read

5476284
innodb	myisam
my advice for you is to go all out and convert everything to innodb and optimize your settings accordingly
update 2012-12-18 15 56 edt believe it or not there is still an open ticket on innodb myisam joining during a select for update

5477189
udp	tcp
so if you set ipproto_tcp and open a raw socket on port 5000 your application will receive raw tcp packets sent to port 5000 but not raw udp packets sent to port 5000
even though the packets are guaranteed to be tcp the socket will not do any of the normal tcp processing syn ack reordering etc you just get the raw ip packets with a chunk of binary data representing the tcp headers

5478252
opera	firefox	firefox	safari
fix for no mousewheel in a flex app when wmode opaque it actually works in ie just not firefox or google-chrome probably not safari or opera either
this also fixes the different mousewheel scroller rates between firefox and everything else

5478925
jar	war
the instructions from david chandler part of the gwt team suggest that the maven-clean-plugin should be used to remove the jar from the resulting war file
gwt-user should not be in the resulting jar as its dependency scope is provided

5478956
inline	inlining
if math.max isn t inline it will execute as a function call with call and return overhead not present in the if statement
so the if statement will give identical performance to math.max in the inlining case or the if statement may be a few clock cycles faster in the non-inlined case but the difference won t be noticeable unless you are running tens of millions of comparisons

5479858
mtu	icmp
for efficiency purposes the path mtu discovery allows the originator of a packet to size it so that it would fit the smaller mtu encountered on the path and hence avoid fragmentation
btw 1460 is a very common mtu well mss because it it corresponds to 1500 ethernet v2 s maximum minus 20+20 40 bytes for the ip header overhead see the following wikipedia entry for an overview of mtu maximum transmission unit and a basic description of the path mtu discovery method basically setting the the df do-not-fragment flag and relying on the icmp destination unreachable datagram too big messages to detect that some node on the way couldn t handle the packet and hence try with smaller size until it goes through

5481332
implements	extends
i know you said you can t ... if that is not an option then the next best solution is to change args to implements map and delegate all of the methods in the map api and others as required to a private linkedhashmap instance
if that is not an option you could do the same with extends hashmap

5485831
udp	tcp
see enet for an example of a library that implements reliability and some other features on top of udp raknet or hawknl would be other examples
it is common for clients to implement reliability on top of udp if they need reliability or sometimes just some reliability but not any of the other things that tcp offers for example strict in-order delivery and if they want at the same time low latency or multicast where it works

5485831
udp	tcp
it is common for clients to implement reliability on top of udp if they need reliability or sometimes just some reliability but not any of the other things that tcp offers for example strict in-order delivery and if they want at the same time low latency or multicast where it works
in general you will only want to use reliable udp if there are urgent reasons very low latency and high speed needed for a twitch game

5485840
umask	sudo
iirc to set the group sticky bit umask should be 2770 - but do check the manual
sudo mkdir -p path to parent sudo chmod -r 660 myself somegroup path to parent erm - not ideal

5486739
realloc	malloc
as far as malloc realloc and free are concerned memory is just a flat array of bytes
if you store pointers in memory that s you choice but malloc doesn t care

5489123
opera	firefox	firefox	safari
fix for no mousewheel in a flex app when wmode opaque it actually works in ie just not firefox or google-chrome probably not safari or opera either
this also fixes the different mousewheel scroller rates between firefox and everything else

5489766
vb.net	vb6
if you see that then you ve got a visual studio vb.net project
if the file is missing that doesn t necessarily mean its vb6 though

5491297
jar	manifest.mf
the problem is that your fastcodefeature_1.2.0.jar file is not a valid feature jar
it does not contain a manifest.mf file

5492101
implements	extends
create an interface and write all client code to talk to the interface but also create an abstract class that implements the interface
subclasses can extends the abstract class if they want to or not

5493841
gridview	objectdatasource
your code for the gridview events will be as follows edit i fixed the loaddata method below
please refer to this page if you are using an objectdatasource refer to this one or if you are set on not using a data source object you can convert the linq query to a data table and bind to that

5495572
mongodb	bson
from the back-up-with-mongodump docs mongodump reads data from a mongodb database and creates high fidelity bson files which the mongorestore tool can use to populate a mongodb database
mongodump and mongorestore are simple and efficient tools for backing up and restoring small mongodb deployments but are not ideal for capturing backups of larger systems

5497077
stateless	stateful
for certain kinds of transactions a stateless session may perform slightly faster than a stateful session
the former opens a normal stateful session while the latter probably not surprisingly a stateless session

5497077
stateless	stateful
the former opens a normal stateful session while the latter probably not surprisingly a stateless session
according to the javadoc a stateless session is a command-oriented api for performing bulk operations against a database

5500371
invokelater	invokeandwait
if you just want to do something that affects the gui but do not care when it is finished you should instead use invokelater
to understand what invokeandwait does you first need to understand the event thread model of swing

5501662
comparator	comparable
then use create comparator keycomparator comparator valuecomparator to make the map
the benefit of using a comparator over implementing comparable is that you can make the comparator specific to the situation that you want with the map and it doesn t effect your object in general

5502755
invokelater	invokeandwait
so it calls invokelater to put the action in a queue for later execution
another thread not the main swing event thread can call invokeandwait to wait for the swing event thread to be ready to run some action

5504480
client-side	server-side
voicexml at least version 2.0 and 2.1 was not designed to be consumed by client-side browsers
the main objective of the spec was to enable server-side voicexml browsers to answer calls and in response to execute the relevant voicexml documents thus generating a conversation on the line

5504490
interpolation	splines
that is do independent linear interpolation between successive pairs of points
for interpolation in non-linear situations where one doesn t know the exact equation people generally uses a cubic splines fit and interpolation

5504568
prng	random
while not a strong prng this is actually very weak one approach is to use a prng as described in one-to-one random mapping
this particular solution is shows a prng solution for which the cycle length is the range

5505854
profiling	instrumentation
i think he wants a tracer not a profiling
he can do that using instrumentation but he ll have a lot of instrumentation to insert because it looks like the goal is tracing every action

5506180
setinterval	settimeout
you should use settimeout rather than setinterval for occasions where you need to do something repeatedly
if you use setinterval but the function that is executed in the timer is not finished by the time the timer next ticks this is bad

5506240
super	implements
variant objects are the closest thing and even then not for non integral types without making your own super variant class which you could do by subclassing qvariant then adding some bits to handle your structs
a simpler solution implements elsewhere will probably alleviate the need for such a container

5506322
ssl	https
you can avoid ssl warnings for domains that support ssl by not being specific about the transport protocol
instead of including http or https use

5507921
content-length	content-type
dr facebook s content-length is incorrect if the content-encoding is not gzip
here goes taking a packet dump i see that facebook returns the same content-length to safari as it does to curl and that content-length is the incorrect 11252 get hprofile-ak-snc4 41674_660962816_995_n.jpg http 1.1 user-agent curl 7.19.7 universal-apple-darwin10.0 libcurl 7.19.7 openssl 0.9.8l zlib 1.2.3 host profile.ak.fbcdn.net accept http 1.1 200 ok content-type image jpeg .

5510850
google-chrome	safari
expect new webkit features to be 2 generations behind in google-chrome webkit development chromium google-chrome beta standard google-chrome this cycle can be quite long but usually a new version of google-chrome gets released 1 month after the previous one
i would count at least 2 versions for a bug to be fixed so 2 months as for safari they only update the browser twice to 3 times a year and not in a constant way

5512621
webclient	webrequest
or is it that you expect webclient to have a timeout property and to set this the request timeout automatically for you
the webrequest will not know what timeout you want to use unless you set it

5512703
opencv	emgucv
i don t know if it s possible to do it easly in your case if not you might try to code few classes in mc++ and try to compile your opencv code using mc++ afterall main usage od c++ cli is to create a bridge between native c++ and managed languages altough i personally still prefer to make nice native api and pinvoke it from c#
as for iplimage if you are using emgucv there s a .bitmap property that gives you managed system.drawing.bitmap class that can be used without copying underlying buffers i was rendering 5 live streams from cameras in my application and it worked pretty well

5516117
textview	imageview
a vertical linearlayout containing the non-heading textview
the inner vertical linearlayout will probably need so it stretches to fill the available space but doesn t squeeze out the right-hand imageview

5518813
coalesce	isnull
the former is standard and returns the first not null argument or null if all arguments are null select coalesce micv.value pending as value isnull is restricted to only 2 arguments but is more efficient in sql server if the first value to be tested is expensive to evaluate a subquery
one potential gotcha with isnull to be aware of is that it returns the datatype of the first parameter so if the string to be substituted is longer than the column datatype would allow you will need a cast

5520735
udp	tcp
if you chose to go the udp route you ll need to carefully think through all these cases to make sure it won t cause perhaps subtle problems in your app
if your only concern with tcp is the extra overhead then i wouldn t worry too much

5522964
gitolite	gitosis
i m not sure if this will be of any help to you but it s worth noting that the successor to gitosis gitolite has built-in support for wildcard repositories documentation here
according to this blog post gitosis does not support wildcard repositories

5523339
ubuntu	linux
you can download vmplayer and ubuntu and get started really quickly
linux isn t as scary as it used to be and something like ubuntu is actually really easy to use

5524943
serializable	deserialization
the concerning items do have different table positions before the serializable
after the deserialization you cannot find these items again because they are stored at differnt positions now

5525178
spaces	delimiter
we use while read here because the default delimiter for read is the newline character not the spaces character like the for-loop saddly the perfect solution one which executes a single scp command while working nicely with white spaces eludes me at the moment
perhaps the simplest solution but it does not deal with spaces in filenames scp ls -t | head -3 user server . using xargs has the advantage of dealing with spaces in file names but will execute scp three times a loops based solution would look like this

5525199
awt	swing
canvas is an awt component and should not be used with swing
see the swing tutorial on custom painting for more information and examples

5525759
division	modulo
doesn t make sense as there can t be a division by 300 leaving a rest of 300
the modulo returns the rest of the division

5532608
nstextview	nstextstorage
this isn t too obvious if you just look at the nstextview s instance methods in the documentation
try the nstextstorage inherits from nsmutableattributedstring which inherits from nsattributedstring

5533213
prng	random
prng s generate sequences of pseudo-random numbers the seed selects a starting point in a sequence a prng may generate one or several sequences
what you are using is not a random number generator it s a pseudo-random number generator

5536706
serializable	deserialization
if you can serializable the object faster yourself and then pass a simple type to the isolatedstoragesettings then you should be able to get better performance
any object you pass to must support serialization and deserialization i would guess that the way you are defining game you are not enabling this

5540312
opera	safari
if that s not an option and you re stuck serving a desktop site to mobile users then see if you can tweak your design so none of your blocks of text are wider than the mobile device s device-width 320px for many portrait phones you can use mobile-specific css to avoid affecting desktop browsers then mobile safari won t need to increase any font sizes and browsers which reflow text like the android browser and opera mobile also won t need to change your layout
finally if you really need to prevent mobile safari from adjusting your font sizes you can set -webkit-text-size-adjust 100 but do this only as a last resort since it is likely to cause mobile users to have difficulty reading your text as it ll either be too small or they ll have to pan from side to side after every line they read

5540750
requestfactory	gwt-rpc
i tried requestfactory for our own project but decided to abandon it for the following reasons requestfactory can not be used to transfer maps
old plain gwt-rpc can do it

5541034
shadowing	named
at first i thought that you were running into a shadowing issue between a view and a public synonym
this is not the case here however since apps can only own one object named ap_batches the synonym

5541153
backgrounding	multitasking
check for your crash log if you are getting this exception codes 0x8badf00d then its most probably your application is taking much time either in launch or while moving in backgrounding or terminate actually app take much time in launch shut ios suspend it and our app freeze there is no such time define in documents but as i experienced it should not be more then 4-5 seconds
check your app delegate applicationdidfinishlaunch or multitasking delegates there is some code which is taking time in completion

5542961
opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox
note if you need earlier browser support please ask as a previous version of my answer did work with google-chrome 12 safari 5.0.3 firefox 4 and opera 10 but i have updated it now that new browsers support prefix-free css3
edit firefox now requires an additional property setting - border-style solid see css - new firefox-release doesn #39

5543203
hmac	md5
you need to use a secure hashing scheme like an hmac or the ha1 of digest
why not use the appropriate type for storage namely binary 16 i hope you are aware that md5 hashing passwords is basically useless right

5543624
client-side	server-side
it s not quite ideal because your server-side javascript probably has features that you can t guarantee will exist on the client-side unless you limit your users to say recent versions of firefox
if you re like me you don t want to limit your server code to js that happens to run in every browser so your server-side js and client-side js will be subtlety different

5544296
ienumerable	ilist
the c# expression evaluator does support ienumerable though and by the above rules
the results view only works for collections which meet the following conditions implement or ienumerable vb.net only works for do not implement ilist icollection or c# restriction only do not have a debuggertypeproxy attribute system.core.dll is loaded in the debugee process in this case bitarray implements both ienumerable and icollection

5544714
awt	swing
but as the java team looked at the experience with awt and with the deadlocks and races that people had encountered we began to realize that we were making a promise we couldn t keep
this analysis culminated in one of the design reviews for swing in 1997 when we reviewed the state of play in awt and the overall industry experience and we accepted the swing team s recommendation that swing should support only very limited multi-threading

5545954
express	node.js
it is not a good idea to try to use express before learning node.js basics
you really do need to understand the fundamentals of async because the node.js library modules are all async

5546374
implements	extends
class a cannot implements c because c is not an interface
you extends classes

5546408
serializable	deserialization
anything you add to isolatedstoragesettings is serializable with the datacontractserializer
my guess is that this doesn t handle the serialization and deserialization correctly

5548150
aggregate-functions	sum
round risk_cv tar b.hesap_no b.doviz_kod - sum m_v b.teklif_no1 b.teklif_no2 tar - nvl ipotek b.hesap_no 0 2 this is not an aggregate-functions
only the sum part is there

5548249
google-chrome	firefox
also the speech attribute is not necessary if you re targeting only webkit-based browsers like google-chrome or safari
and even if you leave it in it doesn t work with firefox 4

5548700
serializable	deserialization
another benefit of enums-style singletons over classic ones is that they have singleton semantics in the face of java object serializable
the java object serializable and the enum base-class combine to ensure that deserialization doesn t create copies of enum constants

5549695
opera	firefox
technically you are not starting firefox you are executing a url. i m not sure exactly what windows does but in effect that url is opened in the system s default browser be it ie firefox or some other thing that might not even support tabs so finding and killing firefox is not really a solution if the url is opened in opera
moreover the process.start method returns null if no process is actually started by the call so if firefox is already running and just displays an additional tab you will get a null as the result of the call

5550544
hmac	md5
hmac is not susceptible to length extension attacks
md5 t + k should be fine for most uses unless your adversary is motivated to tamper with your message and has very good computing power

5553094
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
selenium was using the keyword google-chrome before google-chrome and it was using it for firefox

5553433
caliburn	prism
these mvvm frameworks work with windows phone 7 caliburn micro mvvm light it doesn t advertise it but i ve been to a demo where it was used on wp7 reactiveui uses the reactive extensions for .net my personal favorite is reactiveui but if you ve never used the reactive extensions it can be a brain burner at first
as for ui composition you mentioned prism there aren t a lot of options mostly due to reflection restrictions on the phone

5554833
equals	gethashcode
thus we have shown that the only possible implementation of gethashcode is all of this put together makes it clear that you need to rethink the concept you are trying model and come up with a different definition of equals
this is a terrible definition of equals because it is not transitive

5555729
portrait	landscape
thus when a split view controller is first displayed in a portrait orientation it calls the viewwillappear and viewdidappear methods of only the view controller that is shown initially
the view controller that is presented using a popover does not receive those messages until the popover is shown or until the split view controller rotates to a landscape orientation

5558597
division	subtraction
a hybrid strategy of shift right then divide by 5 using the normal division might get you a performance improvement if the logic in the divider doesn t already do this for you
well division is subtraction so yes

5559688
rvm	bundler
you could install rvm as a regular user although i don t see the point
bundler is per-application and doesn t need sudo privileges since it can install your gems into a bundle directory that the bundle install user can access with for instance bundle install --deployment which will put them in vendor bundle by default

5560574
inline	inlining
the choice to inline methods or not should not be based on how easy it is to reverse engineer
the difference between inlining and not will be negligible

5560810
inline	inlining
you may also be able to use some preprocessor trickery to inline the code itself but i would not typically recommend that
there may be a reason why the compiler isn t inlining it possibly something to look at

5561949
rpm	yum
yum you ll need to package it as an rpm and make the repository available
i m not very familiar with the fedora ecosystem but as far as i know yum is a layer on top of plain old rpm to resolve dependencies and fetch packages which it installs

5561949
rpm	yum
i m not very familiar with the fedora ecosystem but as far as i know yum is a layer on top of plain old rpm to resolve dependencies and fetch packages which it installs
the rpm format contains metadata that the package maintenance system can use to keep track of what is installed what was pulled in etc

5563750
typemock	moles
disclaimer i work at typemock typemock isolator utilizes the clr profiler api to perform il rewriting thus allowing you to fake mock static methods and concrete classes
as far as i know moles does similar things to isolator in terms of using the profiler to mock those things and it s free but not open source

5563950
persistent	transient
apart from this to your question myxxxactivity.onpause is the last safe chance you have to trigger the saving of data that has to be persistent across different runs of your application
this is not transient application state instead it s stuff that goes to db file system storage and that you want to retrieve again in the next run

5565752
sudo	passwd
either way you re playing with fire when using sudo or kill
this should do do shell script shutdown with administrator privileges if you want to pass the admin passwd from key chain with no prompt do shell script shutdown with administrator privileges passwd passwd here but do not store the admin passwd in clear anywhere

5566318
fgets	fgetc	fgets	getline
it s possible to implement getline but not the more powerful getdelim as a very fast efficient wrapper around fgets so if you re willing to do that as a fallback using getline doesn t really make your program any less portable
versus something like using __fpending which cannot be implemented portably and requires an implementation-specific hack to emulate. also of course both getline and getdelim can simply be implemented on top of flockfile funlockfile and fgetc

5568526
mvp	presenter
it turns out that an activity takes the role of a presenter in the mvp design pattern
not all of your presenter need to be activities but if you have an activity you can think of it as being a special kind of presenter with a well-defined lifecycle used for transitions from one place to another

5568590
postgresql	mysql
postgresql uses the reserved word serial as a part of the ddl in that process
mysql doesn t

5568590
postgresql	mysql
if the postgresql file uses any of mysql s reserved words as a table or column name you ll need to guard it with backticks
backticks aren t legal in postgresql

5569621
google-chrome	safari
actually it s not just a part of safari since google-chrome has it too
the web inspector is a part of the webkit engine used by safari google-chrome and if i m not wrong by the default browser in android devices

5570244
tlistview	tlistbox
while the tlistview does not expose an itemheight property the tcustommultiselectlistcontrol is also the ancestor for the tlistbox which does expose this property
the tlistbox s itemheight property is implemented in tcustomlistbox which descends from tcustommultiselectlistcontrol

5570244
tlistview	tlistbox
from what i can gather from a cursory glance at the implementation of setitemheight in tcustomlistbox and the use of f itemheight in that class you would need to create a tlistview descendant add your own itemheight property with getter and setter implement the getter and setter along the lines of tcustomlistbox which involves causing the control s handle to be recreated in the setter override reimplement the handler for cn_measureitem to use f itemheight as appropriate override reimplement the paint method to use f itemheight as appropriate anything i have overlooked in my cursory glance all in all not a simple exercise
if you your app permits it and you can switch to a tlistbox or a tcolumnlistbox your task will become a lot easier.

5570477
postgresql	mysql
i don t have a mysql installation and pas.plugins.sqlalchemy works fine on postgresql for me but it would seem that the authors have made an assumption about varchars
assuming it s not something that sqlalchemy should be handling itself it would be really nice if the mysql dialect for sqlalchemy would select an appropriate maximum size for unbounded varchars i ll see if i can commit a fix this evening

5570771
memmove	malloc
memmove or any other kind of block move is not thread safe any more than an assignment statement is thread safe
malloc may be thread-safe

5570824
allocator	stl
update removed incorrect commentary about stl allocator
it may apply to other compiler stl versions check the history if you want to see it but it s not applicable to this question

5570859
memmove	malloc
memmove will normally be just like if you did assignments in your own code -- if you re sharing a buffer across threads it s your responsibility to synchronize access to that data
in an implementation that provides threads malloc will normally be thread safe it will take steps to assure the heap doesn t get corrupted even if malloc gets called from multiple threads

5571583
postgresql	mysql
and since the pgerror means postgresql and you mentioned heroku postgresql 8.3 - i think this is because end is indeed a reserved word in postgresql
begin and end are reserved words in oracle and sql server but not sure why mysql doesn t consider them as such

5573890
persistent	transient
you are effectively merging your business logic with your persistent tier
for the sake of removing duplication it might be a good idea but occasionally you will find yourself using transient and xmltransient to put things only needed in xml or the database into the class without having them effect the areas where they aren t needed

5574223
nsmutablestring	nsstring
either live with creating a new string probably with the method you mentioned or use an nsmutablestring instead
nsstring instances cannot be changed

5575040
lisp	scheme
in common lisp i think that only variables or lambda forms can be in the function position of an application
i could be wrong about the details here but i know there are restrictions in cl that aren t in scheme

5575978
perforce	svn
checking out a fresh copy from perforce should also work provided you have not checked-in the .svn folders into p4 in which case you should delete them all from p4
since you switched away from svn you can delete all the .svn folders that are probably left over from your previous version control efforts

5576399
spaces	delimiter
if there is no + followed by a spaces it will return the whole sentence breaking down the regular expression match any character non greedy will explain in a sec
+ a plus sign followed by a spaces added the closing delimiter here otherwise the spaces doesn t show up

5576890
octal	decimal
you can test this on a scientific calculator by putting it into octal mode and then switching to decimal
having a 0 at the start of a number makes the interpreter compiler interpret the following digits as an octal number sequence base 8 not a decimal number sequence base 10

5576890
octal	decimal
having a 0 at the start of a number makes the interpreter compiler interpret the following digits as an octal number sequence base 8 not a decimal number sequence base 10
therefore the number you entered is an octal number and not decimal

5577622
google-chrome	firefox
now it seems firefox lets you override this property but google-chrome does not
try in the google-chrome console the output should be object

5583309
viewdidload	viewwillappear
once i added in the viewdidload function of my viewcontroller the table appeared
i have been struggling with this as well but i just discovered that for some reason viewwillappear was not being called

5585727
clang	llvm
also we have modern tools since a couple of months i believe that clang may definitively be something to look at for this kind of stuff
if the code generation you plan to do is simple or not simple but structured you can also directly output llvm code

5586580
super	self
you should end up with something like def append self obj append to the list... if not isinstance obj host raise runtimeerror cannot append a s object to a hostlist obj.__class__.__name__ super hostlist self .append obj
use isinstance to check your objects to see if they re instances of host and use super super hostlist self .insert ... to use the functionality of list rather than reimplementing it yourself

5586875
serializable	deserialization
you certainly can serializable a class that inherits an interface
but you cannot tell the serializer to serializable the interface because it wouldn t know which concrete class to instantiate on deserialization

5587645
serializable	deserialization
yes unless you create a custom serializable mechanism that does not involve serializing an instance of a foo object
for example you could serialize the x and y components separately and create a new foo instance from them in your deserialization code

5588533
octal	decimal
confirming according to od the first 4 bytes are indeed in octal ascii or 1 byte decimal and in haskell so just remember that 255 in decimal is 377 in octal
the non-ascii character 255 is just being shown in decimal not octal

5589503
keystore	jks
but it only generate jks keystore so you again need protecle to convert it to bks format
not sure you resolved this issue or not but this is how i do it and it works on android use openssl to merge client s cert cert must be signed by a ca that accepted by server and private key into a pcks12 format key pair openssl pkcs12 -export -in clientcert.pem -inkey clientkey.pem -out client.p12 you may need patch your jre to umlimited strength encryption depends on your key strength copy the jar files from jce 5.0 unlimited strength jurisdiction policy files and override those in your jre eg.c program files java jre6 lib security use portecle tool mentioned above and create a new keystore with bks format import pcks12 key pair generated in step 1 and save it as bks keystore

5589780
lxml.html	beautifulsoup
i recommend you html5lib+ lxml.html
as i know there are not any parsing libraries that parse wordpress html specially but general-purpose html parsing libraries such as html5lib beautifulsoup

5591099
super	implements	super	self
edit base method hack the other way is to make the to_python on the classes have unique names and call them in your inherited classes to_python methods or maybe check out this answer edit after some reading if you implements a call to super class self .method args in the first base to_python then it will call the second base
if you use super consistently then you shouldn t have any problems

5591568
implements	extends
if you d like to go the inheritance way which is imho not very good you could inherit from an abstract base class where a protected non-static logger is declared like this this way the logger s class will be of the implements class
but of course there s the problem with java allowing only single inheritance which might get you in trouble when you need to extends another class

5591601
cpython	ironpython
as kragen said it is important not to rely on a cpython module
have a look at ironpython

5591699
cpython	ironpython
if your script is a cpython script and can t be adapted to work with ironpython then your options are more limited
i believe that some cpython c# interop exists but i couldn t find it after a quick google search

5593434
gif	bmp
there is no really good way to display image formats beyond gif jpg and png in browsers
some support some additional formats iirc ie does bmp but firefox does not

5593489
octal	binary
2 is binary 8 is octal 10 decimal etc
i am not completely sure what you are missing so i will just explain how you can convert integers to binary strings back and forth in java

5593533
hex	binary
every int is a number it s not binary hex or decimal it s just a number
the statement is a binary manipulation of 4 int s into another int

5594195
udp	tcp
tcp vs udp comparison - connection reliable two way connection reliable one way connection reliable tcp vs udp comparison - ordering tcp rearranges data packets in the order specified
udp does not order packets

5594195
udp	tcp
tcp vs udp comparison - error checking tcp does error checking udp does not have an option for error checking
tcp vs udp comparison - header size tcp header size is 20 bytes udp header size is 8 bytes

5594589
opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome as soon as the mouse leaves the link area opera not till the mouse button is released
ie behaves the same as firefox in this example

5595784
updatepanel	scriptmanager
i assume you call the scriptmanager method from your user control which has an updatepanel as you said
this means the first parameter of the method is not inside an updatepanel control that is being updated so the script block is not registered

5595784
updatepanel	scriptmanager
this means the first parameter of the method is not inside an updatepanel control that is being updated so the script block is not registered
so changing your script registraction to scriptmanager btnupdate btnupdate.gettype closeedit closeeditmodal

5597662
division	modulo
modulo is a common operation in cs because it is a byproduct of integer division on a cpu
most if not all assembly languages have a modulo and this operation uses the exact same hardware as the division operation

5597662
division	modulo
most if not all assembly languages have a modulo and this operation uses the exact same hardware as the division operation
thus if you can t divide by zero in hardware then you can t do modulo zero in hardware

5597700
jar	war
anyway i never have tried to reference other classes from a war not jar and i do not know if this is possible
in a war the classes must be located at web-inf classes .

5598318
division	modulo
if this has to be 0 num has to be even since prime is not . we thus have num 2 a for some a and 2 21 42 2 a 566201239 2 5 31 5 after division by 2 we get 21 a 566201239 2 4 31 5
note that the part after the sign got divided by 2 as well. we continue by taking this modulo 2

5598731
coalesce	isnull
note that isnull does not return a boolean value indicating whether the parameter is null or not instead you pass it 2 parameters and it does the following if the first argument is non- null return the value of the first argument otherwise return the second argument you can also use the coalesce function for this which takes an unspecified number of parameters and returns the first non- null argument value back in the order they re specified
in other words isnull columnname 0.0 and coalesce columnname 0.0 behaves the same but i don t know if there is a difference in sargeability of these two ie

5601058
spaces	delimiter
also the spaces at the beginning and end of the string should be removed since they re not in the string you re looking for and finally would it not be easier to use something like given that an id must be unique within a document it s maybe also worth limiting the selector to only one element
you can t quote a string within a string using the string delimiters...so you can t use inside a string delimiter with but you could use inside a string delimiter with

5602483
ienumerable	ilist
the only .net interfaces that were updated to support covariance are ienumerable t is covariant ienumerator t is covariant iqueryable t is covariant igrouping tkey and telement are covariant icomparer t is contravariant iequalitycomparer t is contravariant comparator t is contravariant this from
for this to work as you are thinking then i believe ilist would have to be declared as covariant not the items in the list

5604189
ienumerable	icollection
the simplest form would be you can then improve on this by querying for icollection update as gerard points out in the comments non-generic ienumerable does not inherit idisposable so the normal using statement won t work
it is probably still important to attempt to dispose of such enumerators if possible - an iterator method implements ienumerable and so may be passed indirectly to this count method

5605640
uiview	calayer
if the animation you want to do can t be accomplished with uiview animations or coreanimation something you can do are make sure you aren t calling needsdisplay on unnecessarily often
once you draw something once the result is cached in a calayer so drawrect should only need to be called when something changes

5605957
single-quotes	double-quotes
you are using single-quotes in your insert statement with those simple quotes will not be evaluated -- and the literal string will be sent to the database -- resulting in something you probably don t quite expect
if you want variables to be interpolated you should use double-quotes around your string

5606543
apache	nginx
you can t serve port 80 from both apache and node.js
having apache as a reverse proxy wouldn t be much efficient and that s why nginx is popular in this scenario

5607373
implements	extends
i dare say that i only use this method while i am in the process of developing a system makes it easier for me to not lose track of which methods are still not implements properly
you could do it yourself thats what i did - in order to not be bothered with exception handling you simply extends the runtimeexception your class could look something like this you could extends it to take a message - but if you use the method as i do that is as a reminder that there is still something to be implements then usually there is no need for additional messages

5608137
postorder	inorder
a simple counterexample postorder listing a b c this can be one of two trees c | c b | a b a but the inorder listings for these two trees are a b c and a c b
you can t derive an inorder listing from a postorder listing because postorder listing does not provide enough information about the shape of the tree

5608137
postorder	inorder
you can t derive an inorder listing from a postorder listing because postorder listing does not provide enough information about the shape of the tree
you need two listings postorder and preorder in order to uniquely reconstruct the tree

5608293
equals	gethashcode
equals determines equality
gethashcode returns a hashcode suitable for a hash map but does not guarantee equality

5608392
vim	textmate
it s important to understand that macvim is a gui layer on top of the regular vim editor so there are somethings it won t do because vim s engine doesn t make it easy
that hasn t ever bothered me because if i need a particular textmate feature i ll fire it up use that particular thing then jump back if i feel like it

5608438
strcpy	malloc
the strcpy is there to copy the string to the allocated buffer
the use of malloc is necessary but this way is wrong since you can t perform strlen on mystring because it doesn t contain any string yet and because the pointer itself is not initialized

5608850
quicksort	mergesort
quicksort or introsort std sort is one should be the fastest comparison-based sorts available to you
mergesort is slightly slower than quicksort but it does not have quicksort s susceptibility to pathological cases

5608850
quicksort	mergesort
mergesort is slightly slower than quicksort but it does not have quicksort s susceptibility to pathological cases
on average all of those take o n lg n time with quadratic worst-case for quicksort

5609317
mef	prism
mef doesn t have anything like this built in
in prism the initializationmode is metadata on the export that the corresponding importer looks at and follows

5612119
daemons	systemd
but be aware that it is this mindset that causes memory leaks in daemons and long-running programs
any modern operating systemd will clean up everything after a process terminates but it s generally not a good practice to rely on this

5613390
richtextbox	textblock
the call to the richtextbox in your example has this priority
but your textblock which is bound to the property and isn t updated manually has the lower priority databind 8 that s why it is updated slower

5616114
h.264	webm
as of right now i know it can do h.264 as well as theora .
i m not sure about webm .

5616773
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
for example i see this error in google-chrome on your chapter 2 example xmlhttprequest cannot load file ...chapter2 dom.sample.html. origin null is not allowed by access-control-allow-origin. things seem to be behaving reasonably well in google-chrome other than that sort of thing
i usually target ie 789 google-chrome firefox safari and opera and i haven t seen many browser issues that are specific to jquery or jquery-ui

5616958
innodb	tokudb	tokudb	myisam
tokudb blows innodb and myisam out of the waters in specific situations but is not a general replacement db engine for everything under the sky
if you are storing blobs such as images then don t use tokudb

5620814
oncreate	findviewbyid
without the error from your logcat we can only guess you have defined adwhirllayout in your xml but you create a new one in your oncreate
i guess you should also use findviewbyid for your adwhirllayout and you shouldn t add it to your layout_main because it is already there

5622804
vbscript	vba
authoritative source explicitly stating it s not available in vbscript visual basic for applications features not in vbscript strings fixed-length strings lset rset mid statement strconv vba has both a mid statement and a mid function
vbscript only has the mid function

5622887
.htaccess	httpd.conf
any changes to httpd.conf require you to bounce the server while .htaccess changes take effect immediately for the next request
a .htaccess is essentially the guts of a block in httpd.conf so you d want something like though you should only make such a chance once you re satisified that the .htaccess is working properly and will not be changed much anymore

5623433
addition	multiplication
once these products are computed you can add them pairwise and reduce mod n after each addition which will also not require more than 1 bit beyond the range of n
there is a python implementation of modular multiplication in my answer to this question

5623465
mef	prism
mef doesn t have createshell and initializeshell methods
i think those are methods that prism uses

5623465
mef	prism
prism is a ui application framework which uses mef
since you are writing a service you wouldn t use prism but you could use mef

5624507
bmp	png
also the richtextbox supports images in bmp format - this is good idea for c# because the bitmap is standard .net class
richtextbox doesn t support png it supports wmf - but this isn t variant in c#

5626461
uiview	uiwindow
also see iphone - get position of uiview within entire uiwindow
your objection was right- instead use from uiview like not tested but i believe that should work

5627028
onsubmit	onblur
firstly prevent the default form action by returning false in the onsubmit or by using event.preventdefault in the event handler
inline better using preventdefault or jquery then decide if you want to use onkeyup i use that in number fields or onblur used when the complete value is important this can be done using plain old javascript or jquery but we need more information to help you further i prefer using the form tag and pass the form object instead of just have input fields that have to be accessed per field instead of using the form elements array - i feel unhappy not wrapping inputs in a form tag

5629221
decimal	ieee
you ve stumbled upon the compromise of trying to represent decimal numbers in floating point binary formats like ieee 754
not all decimal numbers can be exactly represented

5629571
google-chrome	firefox
using the extreme example below we can see that the text has been pushed out of visbility in google-chrome while it still stays right in the vertical center in firefox
firefox google-chrome when a button element is left to the native style remove the border line-height is ignored by both browsers weirdly google-chrome also ignores the height but firefox does not

5629571
google-chrome	firefox
firefox google-chrome when a button element is left to the native style remove the border line-height is ignored by both browsers weirdly google-chrome also ignores the height but firefox does not
as soon as the button is custom-styled google-chrome picks up the line-height but firefox does not

5632076
serializable	deserialization
a serializable class can declare its own serialversionuid explicitly by declaring a field named serialversionuid that must be static final and of type long if a serializable class does not explicitly declare a serialversionuid then the serializable runtime will calculate a default serialversionuid value for that class based on various aspects of the class as described in the java tm object serializable specification
however it is strongly recommended that all serializable classes explicitly declare serialversionuid values since the default serialversionuid computation is highly sensitive to class details that may vary depending on compiler implementations and can thus result in unexpected invalidclassexceptions during deserialization

5633679
wordpress	joomla
i ve worked with everything from enterprise crms tridion rhythmyx mediasurface as was to other foss systems silverstripe wordpress etc and it is by far the most intelligently put together and executed of the lot
it has some niggles - the permissions system is overly abstract and complex it lacks some plug-and-play features fine-tuning performance is a bit of a black art and it doesn t have the ecosystem support of bigger players like drupal or joomla or even wp

5634108
udp	tcp
note that your clients might also get multiple copies of the same datagram in some situations with udp
50-100k connections with this level of traffic shouldn t be that difficult to achieve with tcp if you have a decent architecture

5634691
tripledes	3des
when you set the tripledes.key property the tripledes class sees that you give it a 24-byte key and thus will set itself the keysize property to 192
the output of 3des encryption is binary not utf-8 encoding of a string

5636797
datamapper	activerecord
the activerecord pattern is not very suitable for this purpose and the datamapper pattern combined with just model classes containing just the business logic and do not communicate with the data access layer is probably more suitable in situations like these
the activerecord pattern fails here because it maps more or less directly to a table in the database

5641063
uiview	subviews
the standard uiview block based animations should work great for this as well
the behavior you want should be done by animating subviews of the cell not the cell itself

5643544
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
so its looks like user-defined functions are not case-sensitive there was a vote for making functions objects under php5 case-sensitive
i am quoting from this note function names are case-insensitive though it is usually good form to call functions as they appear in their declaration

5644310
google-chrome	firefox
sorry i can t explain why it s working in google-chrome and not firefox but this should at least get you on your way
tested in ff4 the bottom isn t really centered but it looks the same in google-chrome as in firefox with that fix

5649131
division	addition	division	multiplication
second reason is that with the sieve you only do multiplication not division
if you do it cleverly you only do addition not even multiplication

5649131
addition	multiplication
if you do it cleverly you only do addition not even multiplication
and division has larger complexity than addition

5651066
decimal	ieee
not all numbers can be represented exactly even if they have a simple representation in decimal notation
this is because javascript uses ieee 754 to represent floating point values and thus uses base 2 instead of base 10

5651827
implements	extends
the first means you create a new class which has all the functionality of database class and those you implements
the second means that you create a new class but it doesn t have database functionality since it s not extends it

5653249
super	self
you are not creating a sub-class of nsmutablearray just adding a category therefore calling super init will call the nsarray and not the nsmutablearray initializer whetever it does which i would call just in case it does something important
also as ravin mentioned setting self without calling self release first will leak the previous object which was returned from the alloc call one level up in the call stack

5653488
arraylist	treeset
implicit call instead of arraylist use treeset comparator
client side you just need to rerender on listchanged explicit call suppose you do not want to use treeset as mentioned above. then call an a4j action method on listchanged sort arraylist like collections.sort list compartor

5655727
swift	objective-c
in swift 2 uiapplication.sharedapplication .openurl nsurl string uiapplicationopensettingsurlstring
in objective-c prior to ios 8 you can not

5664561
fgets	getchar
you can try scanf instead or better fgets and sscanf
getchar does not do what you think it does

5666623
uiview	subviews
uiview setanimationdelegate and friends are used for uiview animations not for uiimageview image animations
you add the shimmeranimation object as a subviews of self

5668692
punctuation	words
if you want to allow other characters except for alphanumerics after dog for example punctuation then use
b is a words boundary anchor that makes sure that only an entire words dog is matched - not part of a words as in underdog

5670005
setcontentview	findviewbyid
findviewbyid traverses the view hierarchy set up when setcontentview inflates your layout
you cannot retrieve a reference to a view in your xml before you have called setcontentview

5670005
setcontentview	findviewbyid
you cannot retrieve a reference to a view in your xml before you have called setcontentview
change your oncreate method in home to look like this otherwise findviewbyid will return null because there are no views in the tree...thus a view with your requested id value doesn t exist

5670737
mvp	presenter
to implement mvp whereas in silverlight wpf databinding is just there so whether or not you use it it is up to you
in my opinion i think mvvm simply adds in a layer of testable view logic viewmodel instead of like the mvp pattern where your business logic can really be in the presenter itself

5671079
super	extends	super	implements
now here i have a perfectly valid example of code requiring super in the named type parameter potentially supporting some nice usage the latter code fragment does not compile if i remove the b altogether so b is indeed needed
note that the feature i m trying to implements is easily obtained if i invert the order of type parameter declarations thus changing the super constraint to extends

5671202
actionscript	mxml
having actionscript defined in a script block in your mxml is not mixing logic with presentation
likewise mxml does not define the presentation of your project

5671202
actionscript	mxml
now the reason putting all your actionscript in external files is not a good thing is that it makes maintaining your project a headache
not only does someone have to look up your component defined in mxml but now they have to hunt through the codebase to find the script named logic.as relatively defined to your component

5673988
backgrounding	multitasking
assuming your device is newer than an iphone 3g or 1st gen ipod touch then yes your application may run in the backgrounding
note that even ios4 doesn t allow multitasking on the older devices

5676173
innodb	myisam
myisam table locking so innodb can handle more concurrent requests
innodb is transactional so inserts will generally be slower than myisam innodb is a proper rdbms engine so supports referential integrity transactions acid bla bla bla innodb is more reliable than myisam myisam is faster than innodb for reads myth myisam tables have smaller footprints than innodb ones myth however not many people will mention innodb clustered primary key indexes and how a well designed innodb table will easily out perform an equivalent myisam one because of this

5676173
innodb	myisam
innodb is transactional so inserts will generally be slower than myisam innodb is a proper rdbms engine so supports referential integrity transactions acid bla bla bla innodb is more reliable than myisam myisam is faster than innodb for reads myth myisam tables have smaller footprints than innodb ones myth however not many people will mention innodb clustered primary key indexes and how a well designed innodb table will easily out perform an equivalent myisam one because of this
innodb vs

5676185
concave	convex
that s because your polygon is not convex - the top right corner is concave
gl_polygon only works for convex polygons

5676947
svg	vml
the added bonus is that raphael also works in older versions of ie as it can detect and switch to using vml if svg isn t available
i d suggest using vector graphics ie svg instead of canvas

5677540
noexcept	throw
this would imply we cannot link against existing destructors unless the header is modified to tag them as noexcept false this would break backwards compatibility this arguably ought to be impossible see point 1
i spoke to a standards committe member in person about this and he says that this was a rushed decision motivated mainly by a constraint on move operations in containers you might otherwise end up with missing items after a throw which violates the basic guarantee

5677762
cvs	svn
subversion differently than cvs cannot change the content of the code coming from a commit
the svn book includes a note about this question warning do not attempt to modify the transaction using hook scripts

5678189
macports	homebrew	fink	homebrew
it might be in macports but it might not be or in fink i don t know
i try to avoid those and use homebrew if possible. this is a dmg file which you can extract and put wherever you want

5681195
lisp	scheme
you need to replace display k display l display m display n by begin display k display l display m display n lisp usually evaluates a lisp by evaluating each list entry and calling the first entry with the results of the later entries but display k doesn t evaluate to a function
begin tells scheme to simply evaluate each of the following terms

5681488
super	implements
you must call super implementations or map will just not work properly
by implements you should be able to reset region to your specific one

5682373
setinterval	settimeout
it s better not to use setinterval but to set a fresh settimeout each time
for example of course if the functions within are asynchronous as ajax requests normally are the settimeout call will still come too soon

5682392
setinterval	settimeout
setinterval is great for some things but not for anything where you re going to be mixing other asynchronous stuff in with it
instead use the rescheduling settimeout idiom ...because after all your ajax call may take more than a second to complete

5683653
dictionary	map
the correct way to iterate through a document s doc info dictionary note that this will go through all the fields in the document info dictionary not just the custom ones
also be aware that changes made the the map from getinfo will not carry over to the pdf

5687985
postgresql	mysql
the query looks like i m using substring to build the snippet because i m using postgresql and that doesn t have an equivalent of the substring_index function
you could use criteriabuilder.function to call it with mysql

5688043
padrino	ruby-on-rails
you should also take a look at padrino
it is built on top of sinatra and not as complex as ruby-on-rails

5689376
super	implements
simply use the super keyword that is possible because every trait implicitly extends anyref which has hashcode defined
if you want to use methods not defined on every object you would have to make sure that the trait can only be mixed in with objects that have the method implements which you are going to use

5693157
move	drag
the new layer we add in this case is the activity logic move outside of the activity object
for the sake of your example the classes need to look sort-of like this it should all look something like this to test myactivitylogic you will only need a simple junit testcase instead of the activityunittestcase since it isn t an activity and you can mock your application context using your mocking framework of choice since handrolling your own mocks is a bit of a drag

5693157
junit	mockito
for the sake of your example the classes need to look sort-of like this it should all look something like this to test myactivitylogic you will only need a simple junit testcase instead of the activityunittestcase since it isn t an activity and you can mock your application context using your mocking framework of choice since handrolling your own mocks is a bit of a drag
example uses mockito to test the myactivity you use activityunittestcase as usual we only need to make sure that it creates a myactivitylogic with the correct applicationcontext

5694297
implements	extends
i suggest you take a look at the wrapper also called adapter design pattern . a solution implements that pattern would include a class whose purpose is to add a note to the database
let s call the method addnote note newnote class notesmanagement public boolean addnote note newnote add note to database and return whether it was successfull or not a class that wraps the previous class and overrides that method class trialnotesmanagement extends notesmanagement private notesmanagement notesmanagement

5696075
jar	war
so converting a war to a jar would not be useful because as the war contained a web the converted jar will also contain a web so trying to run it as a program will cause an error
if you re looking to convert a web the war into a desktop app this is not the way

5696695
vb6	vba
first see the creating your own collection classes section of the old visual basic 6.0 programmer s guide there is also an answer here on stackoverflow that describes the same thing vb6 equivalent to list someclass however those are written for vb6 not vba
in vba you can t do the procedure attributes part in the ide

5696767
config	ini
regarding your config problem the launch4j documetation says additional jvm options at runtime when you create a wrapper or launcher all config details are compiled into the executable and cannot be changed without recreating it or hacking with a resource editor. launch4j 2.1.2 introduces a new feature that allows to pass additional jvm options at runtime from an .l4j.ini file
now you can specify the options in the config file ini file or in both but you cannot override them

5696767
config	ini
now you can specify the options in the config file ini file or in both but you cannot override them
the ini file s name must correspond to the executable s myapp.exe myapp.l4j.ini

5696975
decimal	ieee
you happened to input a decimal fraction that rounds to a float ieee double whose shortest possible decimal fraction is not the same as the one you entered
for any given binary floating point number there is an infinite set of decimal fractions that on input round to that number

5697623
sudo	passwd
i found the solution of not touching macs deliverd python version but downloading ad installing a new one currently 3.something when setting up the interpreter point to usr local bin pyhton3 to find out the exact path open terminal and type sudo -s
hittenter your passwd

5698446
comparator	comparable
if you re implementing comparable no need to deal with a comparator
it s for when you need to compare something that isn t comparable or need to compare in a different way

5698908
g++	gcc
so first make sure your include looks like this #include yaml-cpp yaml.h then compile it like this g++ -i usr local include -l usr local lib -lyaml-cpp -o testprogram main.cpp
gcc isn t being instructed to look in usr local

5701625
uiview	subviews
try with the alpha property of uiview and this value affects only the current view and does not affect any of its embedded subviews
read the apple documentation for alpha in uiview

5704078
fgetc	fread
i am not even sure if this is more efficient than using fgetc fputc but at least the files are read and written in one function call
here is one full example with fread fwrite

5704472
floating-point	fractions
it s not a good idea to treat money as a floating-point quantity
floating point numbers have limited precision and worse limits in which decimal fractions they can represent

5705839
client-side	server-side
remember that arbitrary form payloads can be constructed outside of a browser so you always have to check data validity on the server even if client-side validation is in place
the safest way is to check the form values on the server-side to see if the input is valid doesn t include quote characters in your case and respond with an error if it is invalid

5706746
sudo	passwd
if your script isn t running as root you ll need to wrap using the su or sudo commands in order to elevate to root privledge
writing the expected data to stdin should be sufficient but if you find you need to perform different actions based on exactly what the sudo passwd prompts say the pexpect module may be helpful

5708727
clang	llvm
llvm gcc was an initial version of a llvm based c++ compiler based on gcc 4.2 which is now deprecated since clang can parse everything it could parse and more
finally the main difference between clang and gcc does not lie in the produced code but in the approach

5709671
viewdidload	viewwillappear
correction the above code should be in viewwillappear rather than viewdidload
when viewdidload is called the geometry the view s bounds has not yet been set

5712980
wadl	wsdl
answer to your first question wsdl wadl is not mandatory for restful webservices
also wsdl 1.1 http binding was inadequate to describe restful webservice

5713016
google-chrome	firefox
actually it works in google-chrome even without the event because event is a keyword in google-chrome and it is filled with the last triggered event
the reason it doesn t work in firefox is because you should assign the event like this for some reason body does not accept the keydown event

5715112
quicksort	mergesort
in quicksort the actual sorting step is done during the splitting move elements to the left or right half depending on the comparison with the pivot element and there is no merging step to get back up the tree as observed from the data point of view
your implementation may of course have stack unwinding while in mergesort the sorting is done on the way up the splitting step does not move elements at all but on the way back up you need to merge two sorted lists

5716394
primes	modulus
with rsa it is customary to include a few other parameters in the private key such as the two or more primes factors of the modulus
these extra parameters do not offer more power the modulus and private exponent are enough to compute signatures and decrypt data but allow for a faster implementation by a factor of 3x to 4x

5716394
exponent	modulo
these extra parameters do not offer more power the modulo and private exponent are enough to compute signatures and decrypt data but allow for a faster implementation by a factor of 3x to 4x
thus possibly the question is about recovering the prime factors of the modulo given the information above

5718155
ienumerable	ilist
while every ilist is an ienumerable not every ienumerable is an ilist
you can use the tolist extention method to copy the ienumerable to a new list

5719187
firefox	safari
firefox requires you to enable this per-site look up the trusted-uris settings note that negotiate and ntlm are separate settings
safari and opera as well as non-windows clients i m not sure any more

5722301
google-chrome	firefox
another benefit of injecting code is that a user script written that way will work in google-chrome as well as in firefox
google-chrome does not support unsafewindow at all

5723153
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
and also from the example it looks like this means the uinavigationcontroller and associated uiviewcontroller
with this interpretation the answer is you cannot fully configure a uinavigationcontroller and it s uiviewcontroller in a single xib

5723630
spaces	delimiter
you can use recursive cte to progressively extract one item sample table create table atable a int identity primary key b int c varchar 100 insert atable values 1 this is a test string insert atable values 1 this is another test string insert atable values 2 here is a test string to put the others to shame insert atable values 4 insert atable values 5 null insert atable values 5 -the end- the query notes the delimiter here is a single spaces which is what is searched for by charindex
the dot in . is required because sql server normally does not see trailing spaces as significant

5723966
clang	llvm
you have essentially two options xcode ships clang llvm besides gcc so you could use clang llvm instead
that option is recognised by clang llvm but c++0x is not as fully supported as in recent versions of gcc

5723966
clang	llvm
that option is recognised by clang llvm but c++0x is not as fully supported as in recent versions of gcc
the llvm project keeps a page listing their current c++0x support status

5724571
uiview	subviews
from the uiview class reference normally a subviews s visible area is not clipped to the bounds of its superview but in ios you can use the clipstobounds property to alter that behavior
you can define a clipping area for your uiview using the clipstobounds property

5725402
debian	linux	ubuntu	linux
some popular examples of systems where bin sh does not point to bin bash and on some of which bin bash may not even exist are modern debian and ubuntu systems which symlink sh to dash by default
busybox which is usually run during the linux system boot time as part of initramfs

5725402
freebsd	solaris
freebsd s sh is a descendant of the original unix bourne shell
solaris has its own sh which for a long time was not posix-compliant

5727793
maven-shade-plugin	pom.xml
i found a solution to this problem by ditching the jarjar-maven-plugin and reverting to the maven-shade-plugin
this allows repackaging classes within your own namespace setting the main class of the jar and crucially rewriting the generated pom.xml to not include the compile time dependencies which are now bundled

5728158
g++	gcc
so as long as you target the same instruction set object file format and use the standard c++ abi which is now the default in gcc g++ you should be ok assuming of course that the standard c++ abi is actually standard and properly implemented by most modern c++ compilers that run on linux which seems to be the platform you re targeting
edit 2 you should take a look at this so post gcc vs ms c++ compiler for maintaining api backwards binary compatibility it seems like microsoft doesn t follow any consistent standard itanium or otherwise regarding their c++ abi so if you compile with gcc for windows it likely is going to be a problem

5728571
onreadystatechange	onload
as marcel pointed out for xmlhttprequests you need to bind to onreadystatechange instead and check the readystate property inside the handler
onload isn t supported for xmlhttprequest

5729517
ssl	https
if you cannot use ssl for some reason you could get a javascript implementation of rsa so you can encrypt it locally but only your server is able to decrypt it again
there is no reason to do any encryption in javascript or php as the appropriate solution is to use ssl https

5729517
ssl	https
there is no reason to do any encryption in javascript or php as the appropriate solution is to use ssl https
nowadays you can even get certificates which are trusted in all browsers for free so there s no reason for not using ssl

5732616
g++	gcc
as far as the output of gcc g++ i am guessing you re not complaining about the compiled binaries
there s colorgcc a perl script which wraps the gcc g++ output with color for easier readability

5734278
ssl	https
you can however can run ssl over a different port than 443 by simply adding a binding for https and a different port
in iis 7.x in the bindings for the site you would add one for ssl and change the port what would also need to happen which isn t shown in this image is the selection of the appropriate ssl certificate which would need to be configured on the server

5735641
interpolation	splines
in order not to end up with aliasing in the result you will also need to low pass filter before or during interpolation using either a filter with a variable transition frequency lower than half the local sample rate or with a fixed cutoff frequency more than 16x lower than the current sample rate for an 8x peak pitch increase
this will require a more sophisticated interpolator than a cubic splines

5737501
udp	tcp
typically udp is used for applications like p2p audio video not tcp
udp tolerates dropped packets where tcp does not

5739939
vim	geany
the advantage of vim is that it s lightweight does not hog up your system s resources does not tell you what to do yet it is powerful enough to be one of the best text editors out there
however if you find vim hard to grok i suggest that you try geany a lightweight text editor for programmers

5741692
pascal	delphi
it isn t really delphi but object pascal for .net
however porting from delphi to prism will be much easier because it s both pascal and effort has been made by embarcadero to make the transistion easy

5741790
apache	nginx
the none ssl port should be 8081 after install. maestro 02-12-2011 01 42 am turn off port 80 from apache or ltespeed and turn on nginxcp as port 80
just ignore it s not error just warning about 69.162.95.11 is not shared ip about just restart nginx will solve this issue if not then check none ssl port under tweak settings

5742576
client-side	server-side
javascript is a client-side language and does not interact with the server that way
you ll need to fetch that data from your server-side platform

5744860
intersect	contains
since your ranges do not intersect either this range or no range at all will contains the ip you re after
if your table is myisam you can improve this query using spatial indexes this article may be of interest to you banning ip s alternatively if your ranges do not intersect and from the nature of the database i except they don t you can create a unique index on geoip_base.start and use this query note the order by and limit conditions they are important

5751508
comparator	comparable
then you would store that comparator in a member function and use in place of the less than operator
technically you re using the comparable interface on on item not an array

5753163
scheme	racket
disadvantages are run-time type checking racket support compile-time weak standard r5rs as it does not include modules utf8 networking and so on and programmer usually have to stay with chosen scheme implementation forever
in general yes scheme programs can be run on different platforms

5755111
base	fractions
what you re missing is that you re putting each of your numbers through 2 base conversions and x2 and x4 also through a widening type conversion
first of all you have decimal literals which the compiler converts to binary fractions of type float which have a precision of 23 binary digits equivalent to about 7.2 decimal digits and cannot accurately represent most decimal fractions even those that fit into their precision

5755703
config	ini
you can look at zend_config for the most frequent implementations of config
array php only immediate but scattered and harder to read ini easy to read and write by hand xml verbose and harder to handle but very flexible json pretty easy to read can be great if you want to access it directly via js too yaml you write directly a serialized array basically of course array may seem the most immediate and uncomplicated solution since it s pure php and doesn t need any special parser or writer

5756128
bmp	png
converting your bmp file into png should solve your problem
not only do png files have natural support for transparency they are also smaller than bmp files

5756378
noexcept	throw
each library function having a wide contract that the lwg agree cannot throw should be marked as unconditionally noexcept
if a library swap function move-constructor or move-assignment operator is conditionally-wide can be proven to not throw by applying the noexcept operator then it should be marked as conditionally noexcept

5756378
noexcept	throw
if a library swap function move-constructor or move-assignment operator is conditionally-wide can be proven to not throw by applying the noexcept operator then it should be marked as conditionally noexcept
no other function should use a conditional noexcept specification

5756587
piston	tastypie
piston is the daddy tho not being actively maintained atm that s not necessarily and issue as it pretty much does what you want anyway
tastypie s advantages are that it has a great community behind it and is well documented

5757496
jar	war
that got me actually solving my problem namely including a war into an assembly and including all its transitive dependencies. i could not duplicate the war-dependency as jar as you suggested since the assembly plugin would not find a jar referenced by that groupid artefactid but duplicating the war-dependency as type pom works
the war and its transitive dependencies are not included in the assembly. to exclude the now also appearing pom file i had to add an exclude element like this into my assembly.xml file

5759317
udp	tcp
udp is not a good choice for persistant connections
tcp is a much better choice

5759376
textmate	sublimetext
it s not quite textmate but it has some pretty awesome features
check out sublimetext

5760091
super	self
if not it depends on the code if the superclass or subclassing uses super or nothing you can safely use super
this also means your subclsses must use super instead of parent.method self ...

5764134
client-side	server-side
not so for client-side javascript
adding a full client-side mvc to the stack when you re already utilizing a mvc framework server-side can be overkill and may lead to a duplication of effort

5764207
mongodb	bson
the data in mongodb is stored in bson which is not json. the ruby driver does deserialization bson bson_coder.deserialize in read_documents method
if you d like to roll your own bson-to-json you ll need your implementation of bson bson_coder.deserialize and probably rewrite more parts in mongo-ruby driver. if however this is a overhead that s acceptable then you ll just subclass actioncontroller metal and do something like this another alternative might be using the mongodb s rest http interface which provides json

5768122
postgresql	mysql
this works in postgresql
i do not believe this syntax is available in mysql

5769993
comparator	comparable
sorts the elements of the array of an object type into ascending order using the order defined by comparable interface which defines the comparator method
note that many java classes such as string but not stringbuffer double biginteger etc implement comparable

5770156
plone	buildout
if you are not using buildout and with plone 4 that s not a good idea on the whole you can also list the required packages zodb3 zope.interface relstorage psycopg2 in your pythonpath environment variable
if you are using buildout i do hope you are the easiest way to get all the zodbconvert dependencies properly included in the python path is to have buildout create the script for you buildout then will create a new bin zodbconvert script for you that includes all the buildout eggs in sys.path

5770999
firefox	safari
ie8 and lower versions and firefox prior to 3.5 do not support media query
safari 3.2 partially supports it

5771936
postgresql	mysql
i know that postgresql does not allow for a user table because user is a keyword
i m not sure for mysql

5772210
pascal	delphi
the problem is that when windows writes to the string within the getwindowtext api call it doesn t set the length of the long pascal string properly
delphi still can use this string for output and can figure out when it ends by looking for the null terminator but if you append further characters after the null terminator they will be skipped altogether

5772309
cvs	svn	perforce	cvs
at the company i m with now well in excess of 10000 devs but i doubt more then 1000 are on what most people would think of as a single project although they are that many on a single product we have used cvs for historical reasons svn because it was an easy migration path svk nice at the time but i wouldn t recommend it mercurial sorry no direct experience perforce ditto and git
unless you get warped into the past and trapped there i wouldn t recommend rcs or cvs

5772543
memcpy	strcpy
even if it were not implemented i m not surprised by the 15-to-1 advantage that memcpy seems to have over your character-by-character copy
moral 1 always prefer memcpy to strcpy if possible

5773446
inline	inlining
the compiler uses a variety of heuristics to determine whether or not to inline a function
for example the compiler takes into account the size of the function being inlined and the amount of inlining that has already been done in the current function

5774212
implements	extends
what you can do instead is to use a gridview that implements adapterview and thus you can use onitemclicklistener callback method to be invoked when an item in this adapterview has been clicked
tablelayout extends linearlayout which do not have an onitemclicklistener method

5774339
ienumerable	ilist
ienumerable a is covariant unlike ilist a
you cannot convert an ilist b to ilist a even if b inherits from a

5776183
super	implements
but if your compiler is still set to 1.5 the problem is that he will check if you re overwriting a method from a super class
in your example this is not the case since you re implements a method from an interface

5780899
opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
if you are in the position to change browsers i would consider using google-chrome tested gives normal url or opera tested normal url but not firefox tested gives funky url
when i look up this search in internet explorer i do indeed get this link but when i use google-chrome i get what you want

5785013
lxml	libxml2
once you have the dependency s then the usual methods work just fine pip install lxml or easy_install lxml
i ve had excellent luck with homebrew to install the libxml2 dependency brew install libxml2 homebrew doesn t seem to have libxslt available but i ve not yet had a need for xslt

5786368
sudo	passwd
this will disallow things like rsh somehost sudo ls since rsh 1 does not allocate a tty
because it is not possible to turn off echo when there is no tty present some sites may with to set this flag to prevent a user from entering a visible passwd

5790057
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	opera	safari
there is one drawback though in that it is not supported in ie or opera
according to mozilla s documentation is works in firefox 3.6+ safari 3+ google-chrome 4+

5791144
prepare	execute
the first time sqlstatement.execute on a sqlstatement instance the statement is prepare automatically before executing
subsequent calls will execute faster as long as the sqlstatement.text property has not changed

5792443
setinterval	settimeout
and since the timers are only approximate anyway just because you specify 10ms doesn t mean it will happen at exactly 10ms you don t typically gain anything from using setinterval over settimeout
an example using settimeout one reason why you may see pauses on some browsers and not others is because not all javascript engines are created equal

5792482
freemarker	velocity
if whitespace control is critical and post-processing is not an option i would suggest using freemarker
and if you must use velocity beware that 1.5 has some significant performance issues

5792495
cstdio	iostream
yes iostream is slower than cstdio
yes you probably shouldn t use cstdio if you re developing in c++

5793921
inline	inlining
when functions are inline they are not present in the final compilation unit as a symbolic function to be called
when inline the compiler places the code directly into the caller so if this was inline inlining causes multiply as a symbol in the compiled product to go away giving the same as if you always want the function to appear as a symbol in the final product remove the inlines

5796382
tortoisegit	svn
tortoisegit is not very mature yet
if you decide you want to move to git later there s lots of tools to import svn into git so there will be no lost work

5796628
dbcontext	objectcontext
you can try to convert dbcontext to objectcontext and set the timeout there
i m not sure if dbcontext api exposes any property to override default command timeout which is probably 30s for sql server provider

5800694
dbcontext	objectcontext
also it is not supposed usage because dbcontext api was primarily created for code-first approach
dbcontext api x objectcontext api once you start using edmx entity designer you have a choice to use either dbcontext generator t4 template or poco generator t4 template

5800694
dbcontext	objectcontext
decision is up to you - you can use either dbcontext api first template or objectcontext api second template which is much better documented and you can also use two great books programming entity framework entity framework recepies all i know about objectcontext api is from these books authors blogs and practice + reflector
dbcontext api doesn t currently have any book

5800844
jboss	glassfish
but it may depend on the classloading of the app server i have worked on jboss where additional steps were necessary like activating classloader isolation
if glassfish uses log4j itself if will be up an runnning loaded by its classloader before you application starts pointing to app servers log file so your configuration file doesn t get loaded at all

5802165
required	placeholder
as others have noted there is an attribute in html5 that allows this called placeholder - read about it here this does not required javascript but it is not supported by older browsers see
it should be noted that placeholder is not meant to replace s which you are not using and probably should be

5802277
google-chrome	firefox
i know this may not be the best help as you are not a google-chrome firefox user
however if you do chose to switch over the google google-chrome browser has a script checker built in which catches everything that you want to console.log

5802277
google-chrome	firefox
however if you do chose to switch over the google-chrome browser has a script checker built in which catches everything that you want to console.log
this is simular with firefox however firefox you have to download the addon fire-bug which can do the same but it does not come pre-installed

5802346
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
this is what it says section 3.2.3 when comparing two uris to decide if they match or not a client should use a case-sensitive octet-by-octet comparison of the entire uris with these exceptions a port that is empty or not given is equivalent to the default port for that uri-reference
comparisons of host names must be case-insensitive

5802984
implements	extends
a solution i implements simply uses a configurable receive timeout to control the processing loop so your service doesn t need to bother about the state of the queue - it will process whatever is there
here s a simple c# sample i planned to extends the timeout to be dynamic in that it would increase the timeout every time the timeout exception throws and reset it as soon as a message is processed

5805401
portrait	landscape
not recommended but you can also avoid changing orientation by supporting only portrait orientation in your app you would have to put android screenorientation portrait in your app s manifest then
you can specify a layout-land folder to put all your landscape layouts duplicate them but with little differences in order to they show properly in corresponding orientation

5806887
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
this can happen if you use a custom uiviewcontroller hierarchy
in that case you must call it with your own hands there are exceptions - uinavigationcontroller for example does this for you but simple someview addsubview mycontroller.view doesn t

5808122
innodb	myisam
i m guessing from asking about myi tables that all of your tables are myisam tables and not innodb ones
each myisam table is made up of three files .frm .myd and .myi they contain the structure data and index respectively

5809508
inline	inlining
because the compiler typically chooses by itself what to inline and at best treats the inline keyword as a hint it generally doesn t matter whether or not you try to inline everything
so while it is true that excessive inlining can hurt performance excessive use of the inline keyword usually doesn t

5809508
inline	inlining
so while it is true that excessive inlining can hurt performance excessive use of the inline keyword usually doesn t
the inline keyword has other effects which should guide its usage

5810508
inline	inlining
other constructs such as inline non-naked asm put in inline may produce unneeded stack frames or inline with special alignment requirements or even those that just push the stack allocation into the range where the compiler shoves in stack checking allocation _chkstk under msvc
something not mentioned yet is that inlining of big functions into other big functions can cause excessive register spilling hurting not only the the quality of the compiled code but also adding more overhead than was eliminated by the inline and it max even screw up global and local optimization heurstics iirc msdn has a warning about this under __forceinline

5811242
vim	notepad++
i have been using vim for years now and i would not trade it for notepad++
however to a new user its definitively easier to use notepad++ than vim

5811263
google-chrome	firefox
the answer was it was too slow in pretty much all browsers except google-chrome where it was just about acceptable
even in firefox on a fast mac laptop it was taking roughly 5 seconds to load the page from scratch and not much less than that to change the filters back to all

5811263
firefox	safari
even in firefox on a fast mac laptop it was taking roughly 5 seconds to load the page from scratch and not much less than that to change the filters back to all
it even gave an unresponsive script warning for a couple of people who checked it in safari and ie

5812916
xlib	xcb
in fact xcb was created precisely because xlib was too high-level masking too much underneath so it was easy to make mistakes and making it difficult or impossible to have full control
also xcb is not very old from an x perspective

5813695
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
do note that recovery from a runtimeexception is generally possible but the guys who designed the class exception deemed it unnecessary for the end programmer to check for such exceptions
errors are also unchecked-exception the programmer is not required to do anything with these

5814128
jquery	scriptaculous
i m not so well versed with scriptaculous but just two things right off the bat if you re planning to use jquery with another library then call .noconflict load jquery first then call .noconflict then load the other libraries
in this case prototype and scriptaculous

5814732
xna	spritebatch
click the projects tab and select the spritesheetruntime project now to actually use the code which we imported we first will create new xml file and put in the content directory the format of the xml should be like this as you can see this xml contain the names of the images that we will create spritesheet atlas from there is no need to add these sprites images to your project via visual studio just copy the images to the physical content directory and of course it is require that you will add the xml file via visual studio to the content folder project this is not the main project so be aware of it now to actually use the xml file you need to do few things. we need to set the property of the xml file. content importer will be xml content - xna framework content processor will be spritesheetprocessor after we set the proprty we can actually call the file. first we will tell our code to use the spritesheetruntime so we will add using spritesheetruntime
we will declare new spritebatch and spritesheet object in the load content we will do the following the xml file in this case will be spritesheet.xml like the exaple above. now we need to display the sprites either by animated them or show all of them at once.. so we will use the following spritebatch.draw but before that we will start the spritebatch if you will look at the class spritebatch you will find few options to draw on to the screen you can choose the most suitable for you public void draw texture2d texture vector2 position color color

5815482
hmac	md5
an hmac is a digest used to verify the authenticity of a message
unlike say an md5 signature it s generated using a secret key known only to you and the receiving party so that it shouldn t be possible to forge by a third party

5816578
floating-point	fixed-point
see the basic section in this article what every programmer should know about floating-point arithmetic for example the value 0.01 does not have a precise represenation in binary floating point type
to get a correct result in your sample you would have to either round or use a a decimal floating point type see wikipedia binary fixed-point types are most commonly used because the rescaling operations can be implemented as fast bit shifts

5816578
fixed-point	fractions
to get a correct result in your sample you would have to either round or use a a decimal floating point type see wikipedia binary fixed-point types are most commonly used because the rescaling operations can be implemented as fast bit shifts
binary fixed-point numbers can represent fractions powers of two exactly but like binary floating-point numbers cannot exactly represent fractions powers of ten

5816578
floating-point	fractions	fixed-point	fractions
binary fixed-point numbers can represent fractions powers of two exactly but like binary floating-point numbers cannot exactly represent fractions powers of ten
if exact fractions powers of ten are desired then a decimal format should be used

5819252
opera	firefox
well if you take a look at this statistic it shows that opera is getting more known and popular since 2002 maby not that fast but it still growing
i m one of the people who used to use opera before and it has some realy nice features but since they got bigger its not as fast as before but it supports the maskerading to firefox and ie

5821167
nsmutablestring	nsstring
you should create a temporary nsmutablestring and append foundcaracters result
be sure to declare currentnodecontent as a nsmutablestring and not a nsstring

5821910
udp	tcp
this specific example does use tcp though but it s not difficult to modify it to use udp
there are many other useful examples such as the echo which features some udp examples

5822296
jar	war
so you have at least one ear one jar and possible one war right
if your postgresql jdbc 4 driver is on war web-inf lib your jars which need it cannot access

5824810
union	distinct
if you dont want the implicit distinct you can use union all
use union all instead union tries apply distinct implicitly meaning your results will not have any duplicates hence the slowdown

5825203
udp	tcp
if you want to send packets without delay then use udp
tcp has to wait for acknowledgement to know if it has to resend packets or not and it is a safety mechanism to prevent the buffers from overflowing and losing data

5826512
rvm	bundler
so i think you should consider rvm as the configuration manager for your development environment and bundler the gem manager for an application
edit additional thoughts - whether we use rvm or not typically we d have to load all the gems we re going to use for an app by hand using gem install blah for every gem we want to use

5826674
rvm	bundler
there are many small things like these that bundler does but rvm does not
in general as the good people above explained rvm has a different set of goals from that of bundler

5829153
antivirus	norton
was thinking about upgrading my pc but later i find out that not vs but norton antivirus was causing slow down
some antivirus programs may cause this as they scan whenever a file is changed

5831215
serializable	deserialization
if the serialversionuid of a serializable object doesn t match to the current serialversionuid of that class then the deserialization throws an invalidclassexception . the uid is intended to be changed on every structural change of a class
the serialversionuid is an identifier for serializable objects

5832294
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome doesn t agree about this for reasons i don t understand
i think firefox is actually doing the correct thing here

5832294
google-chrome	firefox
if you add a line to append one last to target and make it just a plain-jane with a little text in it but no positioning at all then you ll see that it ends up way way down the page in google-chrome and you will get a scrollbar about the same size as firefox gives you
thus it looks like google-chrome doesn t claim the phantom space unless something actually comes after it. here is a jsfiddle

5832774
bufferedreader	ioexception
stream wrappers pushbackreader bufferedreader etc. do close the underlying stream when the wrapper is closed
the garbage collector does not in general automatically close a stream unless the stream owns on os resource file descriptor socket etc. typically the creator of a stream will using a try - finally block close the stream when finished with it so as a general rule parse should not close the reader unless it has a good reason to do so an ioexception has left the stream in an indeterminate state in case the caller wishes to use the stream for something else

5833679
innodb	myisam
for example fulltext indexes that are supported in myisam but not innodb
as for the result sets returned by myisam vs

5834843
jar	manifest.mf
the manifest file of jar file might contain a version number but not always a version is specified
decompress the jar file and look for the manifest file meta-inf manifest.mf

5835824
sqldatasource	objectdatasource
db access uses a stored procedure but you can use a objectdatasource with dal or just inline the sql statement on the sqldatasource etc
markup and t-sql for your query if the user doesn t enter anything in either of the fields the sqldatasource will still bind due to but the empty parameter will not be sent with the query due to controlparameter.defaultvalue being set

5836290
freemarker	velocity
i m not sure how it works with freemarker but with the velocity template engine you can configure certain properties in the model that you would like to always appear
you would therefore wire up the freemarker velocity config bean with your lists of custom properties where the value for suffix could come from a value stored in a properties file accessed with propertyplaceholderconfigurer

5836735
implements	extends
and implements interfaces from many sources
extends multiple classes is not available

5837140
resharper	justcode
when i resumed resharper and restarted vs both were running together without error
together resharper was finding more than justcode. for example justcode did not give a warning for the following value assigned is not used in any execution path. it even missed an error cannot convert type int to bool . the expression was all in all the tool is not bad

5838248
base	fractions
you can raise a negative base into an integer power select power -3 3 or a positive base into a fractions power select power 9 1.5
negative base raised into a fractions power would result in a complex number which sql server does not support

5840246
google-chrome	safari
blocking by user agent is not a good way to go since every decent download manager will send the request with a browser s user-agent header. for example idm 6.06 current version send the following user agent for google-chrome mozilla 5.0 windows nt 6.1
wow64 applewebkit 534.24 khtml like gecko google-chrome 11.0.696.57 safari 534.24 then again for ie it uses mozilla 4.0 compatible

5840486
google-chrome	safari
answer of mine to another question blocking by user agent is not a good way to go since every decent download manager will send the request with a browser s user-agent header. for example idm 6.06 current version send the following user agent for google-chrome mozilla 5.0 windows nt 6.1
wow64 applewebkit 534.24 khtml like gecko google-chrome 11.0.696.57 safari 534.24 then again for ie it uses mozilla 4.0 compatible

5841444
lisp	racket	lisp	scheme
lisp is a language family not a single language
to somewhat answer your question yes web frameworks exist for the various lisp dialects like uncommon web for common lisp and plt racket a scheme dialect has a tutorial on their web site too but one lisp dialect where you ll see quite a lot of web development going on at the moment is clojure since it can leverage existing java libraries and infrastructure

5841726
comparator	comparable
person and player shouldn t implement comparator
if they need to be comparable by some natural order you should implement comparable

5844023
textview	imageview
since your textview has a height of fill-parent and the linearlayout is not scrolling unless is put into a scrollview you can t see the lower parts your textview takes up the whole screen of the activity and the imageview being under it is not visible
so you can either put your whole linearlayout into a scrollview and scroll down to see your image or if your goal is to show the image at the bottom of the screen and the whole place above it should be taken be the textview then a relativelayout would be the best option

5844613
debian	centos
i m guessing then that centos is using this and that debian is not
see this post about disabling aslr in centos

5844705
skip-lists	tree
the data structure for key is going to be just an associative array implement it as a hash-table self-balancing tree or a skip-lists it doesn t matter from your keys to nodes in a tree for values
the tree for values is going to be a self-balancing binary search tree or a skip-list see edit below

5848063
jtextfield	jlabel
are used to make the jtextfield look like an jlabel
imho you can not get an event on jlabel textchange

5848524
implements	extends
for example moreover although anonymous class cannot implements multiple interfaces you can create an interface that extends other interface and let your anonymous class to implements it
anonymous classes always extends superclass or implements interfaces

5849509
draggable	droppable
also i m not sure if it s intentional but setting revert true on a draggable will cause it to always revert back to its original position which might be confusing for users
you can use revert invalid to only revert if it wasn t dropped on an accepting droppable

5850747
g++	gcc
what you re using is a non-standard extension to c++ that g++ happens to implement but vc++ doesn t
use an std vector instead of an array usually a good idea anyway in case you care the difference you re seeing isn t from dev-c++ itself it s from gcc g++

5851573
qthread	qobject
first of all you shouldn t define slots on your qthread subclass and call them from within run - the slots will be executed by performing a cross-thread slot invocation in the context of the thread that owns your updatethread instance the same one that created it unless you called movetothread on it not in the context of the thread represented by updatethread
remember this mnemonic in run instead define the slots on a qobject subclass that you create inside run

5852080
translation	localization
then you can use a parser to find all strings and create a reference translation this has the advantage that the main language version will always work and other translation can be added when needed. it s disadvantage is that you need a parser to find all strings
hopefully you did not really call them string1...stringn if for localization i personally would prefer this one as used by apple in code use something like

5853298
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
now since apple has access to the implementation they have been able to make exceptions for their own container view controller classes uinavigationcontroller uitabbarcontroller and uisplitviewcontroller
we can t tell exactly how much of a special case these controllers are or what they needed to do to support displaying nested sub view controllers correctly but one consequence seems to be that both uitabbarcontroller and uisplitviewcontroller are not intended to be used except as the root view controller of a window

5855326
subtract	addition
also you can not subtract the pointers because that may lead to some crucial memory location for the os
addition in pointer arithmetic is special in a way that it takes care of the data type of the array elements so when you say it advances 9 memory location sufficient enough to hold the 9 character 9 1 bytes typically this will add 9 memory location sufficient enough to hold the 9 integers 9 4 bytes typically

5857878
ssl	https
go to ssl settings for your application you will see check box with option saying require ssl check the check box and your job is done
now your website can be accessed from https only and not from http. remember you need to have ssl certificate otherwise browsers will show some warning messages for your website. and ya..i don t think you can achieve this with web.config

5857930
floating-point	fractions
you re doing floating-point mathematics with money
this is a bad idea because you re generally not allowed to post transactions with fractions cents

5858058
vim	emacs
the text in vim buffer is just a string without any property can be attached to them
so readonly can be only to whole buffer but not specific characters although emacs is able to add text properties to let some characters in buffer readonly

5860063
implements	extends
if there is interest in the delphi community this could be implements and contributed in a short timeframe.
generates c++ c# c++ cli and java - and it looks like the included languagewriter classes are not too complicated to extends them for delphi

5861593
vb6	vba
microsoft knowledge base article how to convert twips to pixels the link above is for access vba but will work with vb6 as well
i m not aware of native vb6 functionality to do what you need

5862411
hmac	md5
hmac is not an encryption mechanism but an authentication digest
it uses an underlying message digest function such as sha-1 sha-256 md5 etc with a secret key to generate a code that can be used to authenticate data

5862704
udp	tcp
so heres the link to udp on wikipeda
udp is generally faster than tcp as it does not have to do the overhead checking of consistency that tcp must deal with

5862704
udp	tcp
udp is generally faster than tcp as it does not have to do the overhead checking of consistency that tcp must deal with
this means that udp is most often used in programs where transmitting every single last packet correctly is the necessary action

5862704
udp	tcp
this means that udp is most often used in programs where transmitting every single last packet correctly is the necessary action
this doesn t mean that udp is a best-effort service it s something more along the lines of you need the information now and don t care if it s all there this is useful in many situations where tcp would be less optimal

5862704
udp	tcp
this doesn t mean that udp is a best-effort service it s something more along the lines of you need the information now and don t care if it s all there this is useful in many situations where tcp would be less optimal
for example dns and dhcp use udp as it is only one packet each way

5862722
persistent	transient
from this forum post persistent is well defined
it makes a transient instance persistent. however it doesn t guarantee that the identifier value will be assigned to the persistent instance immediately the assignment might happen at flush time

5863540
postgresql	mysql
postgresql supposedly supports implicitly changing data types this way
see section 5.5.6. i m not sure about mysql but i think it works the same

5863681
swt	swing
by contrast swt actually uses the operating system s windows so naturally it has less memory usage and less work to do on its own
the windows in swing aren t really windows they re just made to look like windows

5866471
moq	typemock	moq	justmock	moq	moles
with free mocking framework moq rhinomocks nmock... you can only mock delegates interfaces and virtual methods
so for static sealed and non-virtual methods you have 3 solutions typemock isolator can mock everything but it s expensive justmock of telerik new comer less expensive but still not free moles of microsoft the only free solution for isolation i recommend moles because it s free efficient and use lambda expressions like moq

5866471

just one important detail moles provide stubs not mocks

5866706
sudo	passwd
if not you won t be able use sudo from a script
you can add the following line to your sudoers file etc sudoers this will basically let the rails_user user execute the service command as sudo and the system won t ask you for a passwd

5867940
uiview	subviews
it d probably be enough to use a uiview or even just to apply a backgroundcolor
it should be enough to apply the selectionstyle and background inside the if block unless you re changing them somewhere else the restaurantnamelabel should probably be added to the cell s contentview and not directly as a subviews you re leaking restaurantnamelabel and bgview

5867964
invokelater	invokeandwait
otherwise you can use the invokelater method
the second difference is that the invokeandwait method cannot itself be called from the event-dispatching thread

5868039
cfstring	nsstring
cfstring has some slightly better functionality than nsstring but is a bit harder to use
if you are in objective-c and not straight c or c++ stick with nsstring

5868532
imperative	declarative
imperative programming means any style of programming where your program is structured out of instructions describing how the operations performed by a computer will happen
declarative programming means any style of programming where your program is a description either of the problem or the solution - but doesn t explicitly state how the work will be done

5869464
backgrounding	multitasking
apple s executing code in the backgrounding is a worth read
you can check whether the current ios supports returning the current application state by using -respondstoselector you can determine whether multitasking support is available even devices running ios 4 or later may not have the hardware to support multitasking by specifically checking for backgrounding support you can retrieve the ios version by using the following code although you should not really rely on the following code to infer backgrounding support finally if you want to perform some tasks just after having entered backgrounding mode you ll want to take advantage of the following event

5870416
ienumerable	icollection
if calculating the number of elements is expensive they should implement only ienumerable - not icollection
because icollection exposes count as a property it should be safe to assume that it is very cheap to get its value it should not iterate through the entire collection

5871352
keystore	jks
if a trust store location is not specified using this property the sunjsse implementation searches for and uses a keystore file in the following locations in order javax.net.ssl.truststorepassword - password to unlock the keystore file store password specified by javax.net.ssl.truststore
javax.net.ssl.truststoretype - optional for java keystore file format this property has the value jks or jks . you do not normally specify this property because its default value is already jks

5873554
viewdidload	viewwillappear
you do it by adding this code to your init or viewdidload method now implement method in your viewcontroller to manage your view to your liking
to do the refresh of the view do not call viewwillappear if the view is already displayed

5874634
prng	random
on most implementations of unix this file is a blocking prng
however according to this page and the documentation dev random on osx ios actually functions like dev urandom in most other unix implementations in that it does not ever block

5875818
arp	udp
to make arp entry static you can write arp on command prompt to see the list of options and help to add static arp entry
another idea is to open the command prompt and write ping 192.168.200.202 -t so that your pc keeps on pinging the other client. this will keep your pc s arp entry up to date and when you will run your c# program it will not send arp again and it will directly send the udp

5876828
fgets	fread	fgetc	fread
if you re using any higher-level input functions like fgets or worse fgetc or fscanf enough time will be spent searching for delimiters or in function call or parsing overhead that the number of read syscalls really doesn t matter that much as long as the buffer is at least 1kb or so
if on the other hand you re reading large blocks at a time via fread the implementation should be smart enough to skip buffering entirely and read directly into the buffer provided by the caller

5877197
memcpy	memmove
with memcpy on the other hand the two areas cannot overlap
memmove doesn t zero the original memory block though

5877541
queue	fifo
the queue provided by the standard template library doesn t give you random access to elements via the subscript operator because the implementation of random access defeats the point of a queue
recall that a queue is a datastructure that provides fifo behavior

5879530
memcpy	memmove
technically you have a problem in sk07 if and when b is larger than 2 or 3 as you cannot use memcpy for cases where the source and target overlaps
you could try memmove instead

5880882
printwriter	bufferedwriter
i suggest you not use printwriter in this situation
i would use plain bufferedwriter and add the newlines myself as required

5880882
ioexception	printwriter	fileoutputstream	printwriter
normal fileoutputstream operations should throw an ioexception if there is an error
afaik the only exception is printwriter which does not throw an exception

5881183
ssl	https
see the ssl how-to if using tomcat
the scheme http or https doesn t matter for the code that handles it

5883113
memcpy	strncpy
update if the length of your input tokens is static but they re not 0-terminated in the source buffer due to your tokenization process then just use memcpy and manual termination i don t see a need to wrap the above in a macro
two things beware that strncpy has very unexpected semantics it will always 0-fill the buffer if not totally filled by the string and it will not terminate the string if it completely fills the buffer

5883154
super	implements
there is no super pattern or one size fits all method
we cannot tell you how to implements you project as every project is different

5885181
super	self
the docs for respondstoselector states the following you cannot test whether an object inherits a method from its superclass by sending respondstoselector to the object using the super keyword
.. therefore sending respondstoselector to super is equivalent to sending it to self

5886308
google-chrome	firefox
so the current answer to this question is there is no adequate solution for this in google-chrome
whereas firefox and ie render it on every page opera doesn t show it at all and webkit browsers only show it on the first page

jsf	seam
until then the seam s is your best solution which not only prevents csrf which is not strictly necessary anymore since jsf 2.1 as per jsf impl issue 812 but also double submits
this is requested and maintained by jsf spec issue 559

5890893
sse	avx
if you use any avx256 instruction the avx upper state becomes dirty which results in a large stall if you subsequently use sse instructions including scalar floating-point performed in the xmm registers
this is documented in the intel optimization manual which you can download for free and is a must-read if you re doing this sort of work avx instruction always modifies the upper bits of ymm registers and sse instructions do not modify the upper bits

5890992
implements	extends
they aren t to be extended or used they are to be referenced against.if a class implements and interface it commits to implements all the function stated in the interfaces and possibly more and php throws an error if that s not the case. a very simple example
yes it s true php only officialy supports extends one class at a time its a bug bear to all oop because there s no good oop reason not to be able to but there is for the language

5892313
nfa	dfa
real regular expressions when i say real i m refering to those regex that recognize regular languages and not the regex that almost every programming language include with backreferences etc can be converted into a dfa nfa and both can be implemented in a mechanical way in a programming language a nfa can be converted into a dfa what you have to do is find a way to convert a regex into an automaton implement the recognition of the automaton in the programming language of your preference that way given a regex you can convert it to a dfa and run it to see if it matches or not a specified text
this can be implemented in o n because dfa don t go backward like a turing machine so it matches the string or not

5892617
g++	gcc
since it is substantially the same as what you got the version of g++ is essentially irrelevant but not wholly
the c++filt distributed along with gcc 4.2.1 by apple does not recognize the nm output you provided even after cleaning the bom out of the file

5893484
freebsd	linux
well on freebsd macosx and maybe somewhere else there is kevent call that allows listening on a broad range of system events including connect requests and signaling when data arrives to the socket. it will solve all of your problems in a neat way but it s not portable
there are libs such libevent and libev that wraps os-specific functionality like kevent on bsd s epoll on linux and so on

5896177
filewriter	printwriter
this causes filewriter to not overwrite the file but open it for append and move the pointer to the end of the file
printwriter is using this filewriter as opposed to creating its own with the file you pass it. a lot of editing going on here

5896188
prepare	execute
if the dbms does support prepare statements and the php implementation handles it properly there is some kind of issue with the insert being execute which also needs some investigation
the fact that the lone insert prepare statement seems to be execute against the database rather than being prepare points to either a poor implementation of php unlikely or the dbms not supporting prepare sql

5896188
prepare	execute
the fact that the lone insert prepare statement seems to be execute against the database rather than being prepare points to either a poor implementation of php unlikely or the dbms not supporting prepare sql
if the latter is the case it is possible that their way of supporting the command with out the functionality is just to execute the statement leading to the results you get

5897448
icmp	tcp
you cannot send icmp packets in pure java
however you can open a tcp socket to a specific port and send it some data

5898798
vbscript	vba
visual basic vbscript features not in visual basic for applications visual basic for applications features not in vbscript key differences between visual basic for applications and vbscript vbscript versus visual basic and vba
vbscript language reference on msdn covers all statements keywords functions and other language elements of vbscript

5898805
wordpress	joomla
as an aside this project does not sound like something wordpress excels at
your site sounds like it would be better in drupal joomla

5900935
calloc	malloc
use calloc to allocate memory
the malloc function does not initialize the memory to zeros so the pointers will be set to null

5901539
onresume	onpause
according to the activity life cycle if you start listening to location updates in oncreate and stop it in onpause then when you return your application to foreground it will not register to updates again consider moving the registration to onresume
stop the location update notification in onpause is fine but please note two things

5901753
wordpress	joomla
it s similar to wordpress joomla although less eye-candy imo
joomla is written in php ans as with every other server side webbased view template technology including jsp it just generates html css js a webbrowser doesn t understand anything else anyway

5904215
backtracking	greedy
but i can hesitate a good guess that the algorithm is greedy because once it has fitted an event into a hall it will not reconsider that decision backtracking is probably worth a quick google at this point
the definition of a greedy algorithm is that it takes the apparent best choice at each step as opposed to considering several steps ahead

5905033
innodb	myisam
this way might work if you re using innodb tables but i have no experience there so i won t vouch for it
if you re using myisam only the quickest way is it s not pretty but it does work

5906528
apache	nginx
i m putting this here in case someone wants an example of how to do this for apache and wsgi
the question title is worded such that it s not just covering nginx

5907091
fixed-point	fractions
you need to use the fixed-point format to make it apply to the fractions part setiosflags ios fixed
setprecision n applies to the entire number not the fractions part

5907741
ssl	https
just like you wouldn t try to build an http client component in vbscript similarly you wouldn t try to build an https ssl client
the vbscript language doesn t include any http or https client but windows has a couple of com objects that can be used from windows script host of from asp pages written in vbscript and vbscript code running in internet explorer can similarly access a browser object that allows https calls

5908843
uitabbaritem	uitabbarcontroller
as a result of my research you cannot add a uitabbaritem to a uitabbar that is managed by a uitabbarcontroller
since you maybe have added your uitabbaritem by adding a list of view controller this is also the way of your choice to add further custom uitabbaritems as i will show now pre-conditions as i mentioned before you maybe have added your uitabbaritems by adding a list of view controller adding custom uitabbaritems now since you know how to add uitabbaritems through adding view controller you can also use the same way to add custom uitabbaritems modify the line above all fine now you have your custom button in your tabbar

5913148
namedtuple	dictionary
this is pretty tricky since namedtuple is a factory which returns a new type derived from tuple
one approach would be to have your class also inherit from userdict.dictmixin but tuple.__getitem__ is already defined and expects an integer denoting the position of the element not the name of its attribute at its heart the namedtuple is an odd fit for json since it is really a custom-built type whose key names are fixed as part of the type definition unlike a dictionary where key names are stored inside the instance

5913148
namedtuple	dictionary
one approach would be to have your class also inherit from userdict.dictmixin but tuple.__getitem__ is already defined and expects an integer denoting the position of the element not the name of its attribute at its heart the namedtuple is an odd fit for json since it is really a custom-built type whose key names are fixed as part of the type definition unlike a dictionary where key names are stored inside the instance
this prevents you from round-tripping a namedtuple you cannot decode a dictionary back into a namedtuple without some other a piece of information like an app-specific type marker in the dictionary which is a bit hacky

5913148
namedtuple	dictionary	decoder	encoder
this prevents you from round-tripping a namedtuple you cannot decoder a dictionary back into a namedtuple without some other a piece of information like an app-specific type marker in the dictionary which is a bit hacky
this is not ideal but if you only need to encode namedtuples into dictionary another approach is to extend or modify your json encoder to special-case these types

5914468
factors	matrix
the scaling factors is needed for certain transformations like perspective projection that wouldn t be possible with non-homogenous coordinates
4x4 matrix are needed to transform coordinates from one vector space to another

5915056
opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
the drag effect occurs on webkit google-chrome safari opera
it does not happen on firefox

5917924
gmail	hotmail
if foobar yahoo.com creates a google account and logs in you will be able to send on behalf of their gmail user but not their yahoo user
same for hotmail

5918851
agda	prolog
you can of course name the variables and state they must also be equal interestingly agda does let information flow across patterns like this and introduces a special notation f x .x _ to say that this x must be that x
haskell doesn t do unification of variables as prolog does

5919074
implements	extends
the json object in java does not implements serialaizable out of the box
i have seen others extends the class to allow that but for your situation i would simply recommend storing the json object as a string and using its tostring function

5920502
pascal	delphi
glscene has cuda + opencl header conversions in it s computeapis folder but unfortunately there is no pascal for cuda opencl so the actual kernels will need to be written in c for opencl cuda
it is possible to use clenqueuenativekernel to use purely all delphi code but native kernels will only work on the cpu not on any existing gpu at the moment

5921488
qgraphicsscene	qwidget
if your code really is it can not receive events since it should be qgraphicsscenemouseevent is for items in qgraphicsscene that receive mouse input
qgraphicsview is derived from qwidget

5922001
ssl	https
i m not an expert with iis so i can t instruct you on the details but it s basically a case of setting up an additional virtual host usually pointing to the same physical location as the main http site configured to use the ssl key you ve been issued and which listens on a different port default port for https is 443 as opposed to port 80 for http
once you ve done all that you should have a functioning https site

5924159
postgresql	mysql
if you want to know if you are going to kill your server or if your website is optimizized the following has close to zero information content uip unless you get facebook-like numbers queries s unless you re above 10.000 i ve seen a cheap dual core blast 20.000 qps using postgresql but the following is extremely important dynamic pages second served number of queries per page time duration of each query all of them server architecture vmstat iostat outputs database logs webserver logs database s own slow_query lock and io logs and statistics you re not focusing on the right metric.
currently have over 300+ qps on my mysql your website can run on a via c3 good for you

5924733
avr	microcontroller
arm avr and pic are all good candidates among others
also find out what interfaces you need to use to control the camera i2c or spi read pixel data parallel or analog connecting directly to a webcam s usb interface would not be a straightforward task as the microcontroller would need to act as a usb host

5924749
pascal	delphi
in short since you re writing a dll in pascal you re going to need at least another small dll in c just to bridge the types between the python extension types numpy.array and the python floating point values
and even then you re not going to easily quickly get an array value you could read in delphi as a native delphi array type

5925714
calloc	malloc
if you want the runtime to zero-initialize the heap block before it gives it to you you may use calloc
the contents of the memory returned by malloc are not initialized

5926810
postgresql	mysql
but you lost the superb text search of postgresql
even if postgresql looks better i find it has some performances issues with django postgresql is made to handle long connections connection pooling persistant connections etc. mysql is made to handle short connections connect do your queries disconnect has some performances issues with a lot of open connections the problem is that django does not support connection pooling or persistant connection it has to connect disconnect to the database at each view call

5926810
postgresql	mysql
even if postgresql looks better i find it has some performances issues with django postgresql is made to handle long connections connection pooling persistant connections etc. mysql is made to handle short connections connect do your queries disconnect has some performances issues with a lot of open connections the problem is that django does not support connection pooling or persistant connection it has to connect disconnect to the database at each view call
it will works with postgresql but connecting to a postgresql cost a lot more than connecting to a mysql database on postgresql each connection has it own process it s a lot slower than just popping a new thread in mysql

5927494
dictionary	map
that s not a valid main function since it would have to be static if you have a you can t use this since you don t have an object instance in the static context you can t instantiate dictionary since it is abstract
use one of its subclasses or a map note that local primitive variables are also not initialized so this could give you an error too boolean res

5928206
interpolation	splines
curves are almost always rendered in four steps approximate or interpolation a set of points using a curve or splines algorithm
choices may include cubic splines which pass through all of the data points and produce a smooth curve bézier curves which do not pass through all the points but which lie within the envelope of the consecutive groups of 4 points surrounding each curve section

5928646
explode	substr
mysql doesn t provide explode equivalent however in this case you could use substr and locate to cut off score of a host and a guest
select convert substr score 1 locate - score - 2 using integer as score_host convert substr score locate - score +2 using integer as score_guest from ..

5928932
bash	subshell
if bash can guarantee this isolation property it s free to use any implementation technique it likes
in the fragment ps -o pid ppid cmd it s obvious that nothing can influence the parent shell so there s an optimization in bash that makes it not fork a separate process for the subshell

5929317
postgresql	mysql
well i don t know why mysql barfs so much on queries 1 and 3 which are pretty simple and easy in fact it should even beat postgresql using an index only scan but apparently not eh
you should ask a mysql specialist

5930407
daemons	systemd
this still requires the other daemons to be rebooted whenever there is a code change
in practice this isn t a huge concern as best practices dictate using a deployment systemd like capistrano where a rule can easily be added to bounce the daemons on deploy

5930407
daemons	systemd
in practice this isn t a huge concern as best practices dictate using a deployment systemd like capistrano where a rule can easily be added to bounce the daemons on deploy
i use monit to watch the daemons process so restarting it is as easy as telling monit to restart it

5932449
pthreads	fork
java thread on linux depends on the version but most modern implementations use pthreads the thread for linux not really a process
the linux thread is also know as lightweight processes which is not generated by an fork call but rather the pthreads call

5935198
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	opera	safari
alternatively you can wrap everything in a tag although it s not supported by opera
you can use the css 3 property word-wrap supported by ie 5.5+ firefox 3.5+ google-chrome 1.0+ opera 10.5+ safari 1.0+

5935987
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari
this persisted even after uninstalling deleting opera preferences and re-installing
it turns out that opera will honor your system font-size preferences set under control panel appearance and personalization display on win7 for rendered website text whereas other browsers i tested ff4 google-chrome 11 safari 5 ie 9 do not

5936466
wadl	wsdl
you need wsdl 2.0 or wadl to describe rest service
support for wsdl 2.0 is currently very limited and wsimport doesn t support it

5936466
wadl	wsdl
to more precisely answer your question - i don t think that you can describe rest service without wsdl 2.0 or wadl
so you cannot merge soap and rest service to single wsdl 1.1 supported by most stacks

5939220
oncreate	findviewbyid
initializing the listeners in the oncreate method should work
i m not 100 sure but you are calling the findviewbyid s in the class initialisation

5939370
client-side	server-side
if the session cookie has been created there is no way on the client-side to find out if session is new or not
session is a server-side concept

5939601
spaces	delimiter
i would have added it as a comment but i don t have enough points yet i was using this idea for a view i was working on however the items i was concatinating contained spaces
so i modified the code slightly to not use spaces as delimiter

5940378
boost	stl
if you aren t then the first thing to consider is whether you really need to use raw stl containers instead of the boost interprocess containers
that you re already using boost interprocess to allocate the shared memory segment suggests you don t have any problem using boost so the only advantage i can think of to using stl containers would be so you don t have to port existing code

5940853
opera	safari
however this seems to not be supported opera at all
ie 8 only supports it on dom objects and safari only supports it on non -dom objects defineproperty on mdn look towards bottom of file for browser support

5943390
junit	testng
according to the spring documentation it doesn t look like it provides a testng test runner out of the box in addition to generic testing infrastructure the testcontext framework provides explicit support for junit 3.8.2 junit 4.5+ and testng 5.10 in the form of abstract support classes
for junit 4.5+ the framework also provides a custom runner that allows one to write test classes that are not required to extend a particular class hierarchy

5943426
google-chrome	safari
in fact the problem was that i was using a variable to authenticate requests and safari uses a separate process to handle video playback that does not have access to the same data unlike say google-chrome
what was confusing was that both the original safari process and the playback process requested the video file separately

5943699
dbcontext	objectcontext
they are the add attach find local or remove members on dbset the getvalidationerrors entry or savechanges members on dbcontext the entries method on dbchangetracker especially add calls detectchanges which is responsible for the poor performance you experienced
i contrast to this the objectcontext api calls detectchanges only automatically in savechanges but not in addobject and the other corresponding methods mentioned above

5946948
pthreads	fork
you can see a list of async-signal-safe pthreads functions here
create a pipe fork make child process execute addr2line in parent process convert the addresses returned from backtrace to hexadecimal write the hex addresses to the pipe read back the output from addr2line and print log it since you re doing all this from a signal handler make sure to not use functionality which is not async-signal-safe

5948238
rtp	rtcp
timestamps are not in nal units but are typically part of rtp
rtp rtcp also takes care of media synchronisation

5949131
inline	inlining
the inline keyword only provides a hint so there s no guarantee but it might nudge it into being inline where normally with or without lto it wouldn t be
inlining is normally performed within a single translation unit .cpp file

5950708
ssl	https
if you have any embedded content that is not delivered via ssl then that content will also trigger the popup that you re trying to avoid
at this time feedburner does not offer feeds over ssl https scheme

5951644
quicksort	mergesort
the partition based algorithm is the classic one but just like quicksort it isn t really suitable for haskell lists
the wikipedia doesn t show much related to functional programming although i suspect that the tournament selection described is the same or not very different from your current mergesort solution

5953475
google-chrome	firefox
or restart google-chrome completely and see if the problem still occurs and you did not close a tag correctly
it is probably the caching of your browser. try with firefox and hit ctrl+r+shift

5954897
rtp	rtsp
the medaiplayer will parse the rtsp url and start the android rtspengine which will communicate with the rtp server an establish the relevants ports to transfer the data
your data source for mediaplayer is your rtsp link - rtsp 127.0.0.0 550 mystream.3gp i have done this with a videoview mediaplayer is jsut an abstraction of this so it shouldn t be too different

5955168
client-side	server-side
you need to generate the client-side id for the asp.net control for it to work #earliestarrivaltb as a selector on the client doesn t exist because it s clientside representation will be very different
the problem is you re referencing a server-side id

5956651
laravel	codeigniter
edit nov 2018 although i wouldn t knock codeigniter nowadays laravel currently 5.5 is the framework i use
here is a good article that sums up the reasons i use laravel

5959237
domcontentloaded	onreadystatechange
they bind to the domcontentloaded event or onreadystatechange on some browsers
they also have a fallback to the regular load event in case the domcontentloaded isn t supported or not fired for other reasons

5959667
profiling	debugging
you need to debugging with a development profiling and use the ad-hoc profiling only for distributing non-debuggable copies.
i have had problems debugging binaries on the device via xcode when the app includes an entitlements.plist file which is not necessary to install onto the device for debugging

5959667
profiling	debugging
emphasis mine also check your profiling
the ad-hoc profiling doesn t support debugging

5965116
portrait	landscape
tjr you could try to play with adding one of the following commandline parameters to your ghostscript call if this doesn t change the outcome try this instead the part with orientation 0 should turn all pages to portrait
using 3 should make it landscape 1 for seascape 2 for upside down

5967155
actionscript	mxml
of course doing so often relies on actionscript
not mxml

5967298
config	ini
however it was meant to read and write windows config ini files and windows config ini files are very flat and simple formats
thus i wouldn t expect config std to do much more

5967298
config	ini
thus i wouldn t expect config std to do much more
if you re using windows config ini files right now but may need to read more complex data structures in the future config any is a good way to go

5968806
ilist	icollection
the remarks section of the documentation for ilist says ilist is a descendant of the icollection interface and is the base interface of all non-generic lists. ilist implementations fall into three categories read-only fixed-size and variable-size
a read-only ilist cannot be modified

5968957
getdate	datepart
example select datepart hh getdate since you are on sql server 2008 you can use the time data type just convert to time example select convert time getdate then you can filtering that also since i am not sure what your output is supposed to be like i am showing you both but if all you need is to grouping by hour then just do a datepart hh..
convert to datepart hh ...

5970686
udp	tcp
boots and this is a time period when the client may not have its entire tcp ip stack loaded and running udp may be the only protocol the client is ready to handle at that time
finally some dhcp bootp clients have only udp on board

5973251
profiling	benchmarking
i m not familiar with any profiling that will show branch efficiencies
the linux time program should work well enough to help you benchmarking

5973570
asp.net-mvc	html.actionlink
it really sounds like you would want to make use of areas in asp.net-mvc
this wouldn t allow you to run the nested applications in their own app pool but it would accomplish everything else you are looking to do shared layouts dlls html.actionlink roles based access to each area etc

5974723
jms	jta
this is also suggested by jmsaccessor.setsessiontransacted the superclass of jmstemplate javadoc set the transaction mode that is used when creating a jms session
default is false . note that within a jta transaction the parameters passed to create queue topic session boolean transacted int acknowledgemode method are not taken into account

5975071
prepare	execute
that error means you ve prepare a statement but not execute it
you may also get it if you prepare a statement execute it and fetched all the rows then call fetch again but i m less sure about that

5975430
super	implements
but jparepository and mongodbrepository have nothing in common except the stuff that is defined in there common super interfaces org.springframework.data.repository.pagingandsortingrepository org.springframework.data.repository.repository so for me it looks normal
if you use the classes that implements your repository then use pagingandsortingrepository or repository if you want to be able to switch from an jpa implementation to an document based implementation sorry but i can not imagine such a use case - anyway

5975891
exponent	addition
if this is not the case replace the exponent with appropriate values which correspond to the way the operations will be carried out
edit the orders-of-growth in this answer are needed in addition to the accepted answer in order to run cse or matrix-chain multiplication interestingly a compression algorithm may be what you want a compression algorithm seeks to reduce the size of what it s compressing and if the only way it can do that is substitution you can trace it and obtain the necessary subcomponents for your algorithm

5976229
g++	gcc
but its better to be explicit and use g++ fror your c++ code and gcc for c
if you compile with gcc the c++ runtime is not linked in by default so you will get linker errors like the one you are seeing

5978352
udp	tcp
remember that udp is only concerned with speed
this is the main reason why streaming media is not high quality. 1 tcp is connection oriented and reliable where as udp is connection less and unreliable

5978352
udp	tcp
this is the main reason why streaming media is not high quality. 1 tcp is connection oriented and reliable where as udp is connection less and unreliable
2 tcp needs more processing at network interface level where as in udp it s not

5978352
udp	tcp
2 tcp needs more processing at network interface level where as in udp it s not
3 tcp uses 3 way handshake congestion control flow control and other mechanism to make sure the reliable transmission

5978844
apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd
speaking only of unix-based environments i d say that fortunately you only have to think of this if you are going to use php with apache web server in which case you are advised to go with the prefork mpm of apache which doesn t use threads and therefore php thread-safety doesn t matter and all gnu linux distributions that i know of will take that decision for you when you are installing apache + php through their package system without even prompting you for a choice
if you are going to use other webservers such as nginx or lighttpd you won t have the option to embed php into them anyway

5979997
email	dkim
there s a very good explanation by jeff atwood about email authentication mechanisms
django itself doesn t support dkim out of the box but there is a useful snippet you could use to get started

5980851
icomparable	compareto
this externalizes the comparison and is useful when there are many feasible ways to compare two objects of a type or when the type doesn t implement icomparable or the icomparable implementation compares a different way than what you want and you don t have control over that type s source
icomparable - defines an interface for an object with a compareto method that takes another object of the same type and compares the current object to the passed one

5980902
postgresql	mysql
an auction site would benefit from the strong transaction guarantees provided by either ms-sql or postgresql
mysql can handle the workload but can not provide the consistency guarantees required of an auction application without pushing excessive conflict resolution code in to your application

5984538
nfa	dfa
a direct implementation of an nfa which is not a dfa since dfa is a subset of nfa usually involves allowing backtracking whereas a direct implementation of a dfa requires only as many steps as the input length so in that sense dfas arrive at the answer faster than equivalent nfas which are not dfas
when trying to find a fa corresponding to a given language or re by an algorithm it is usually easier to arrive first at the nfa since the rules are less strict

5986625
kerberos	ntlm
the problem - explained from what i can tell also with help from a microsoft representative because the service account was originally a domain1 user it could not determine what domain local groups the connecting user is a member of when the user is authenticating via kerberos
the primary lead that this was a kerberos issue was when i successfully connected using named pipes as this uses ntlm authentication

5988913
clang	llvm
clang is a parser for c-like languages including c++
if your language is c-like enough ie. java is not then you could add support for your language to clang which knows how to produce llvm ir

5988913
clang	llvm
if your language is c-like enough ie. java is not then you could add support for your language to clang which knows how to produce llvm ir
llvm does not require jit and is normally statically linked

5990687
google-chrome	firefox
thus it is cross browsers for major browsers like start from ff7 ie7 and google-chrome
firefox doesn t support it

5995576
clang	llvm
i m using clang llvm 2.9 which does not have this symbol while google does turn up some older headers that do include it
so my best guess is that this symbol is no longer available in llvm and thus the current haskell libclang package depends on llvm clang 2.8

5996333
uicontrol	uibutton
i believe it is a convention that stems from the fact that there is not always a 1 1 mapping of uicontrol to ibaction
for example you could have a uiswitch a uibutton and a uitextfield all mapped to a - ibaction syncui id sender

5997458
ostream	ostringstream
that s because ostringstream needs a base conversion to ostream when you pass it to the other template while it doesn t need any conversion when you pass it to the template that forwards to write std cout ...
so if you pass ostringstream it selects the more generic template which forwards the ostringstream as an argument to output to the more specific template

5997963
swt	swing
in others linux vmware hosting windows swing and its redraw optimization outperform swt significantly. differences in performance are significant factors of 2 and more are common in either direction. code written in c c++ using the x library performs somewhat faster than code written in java using swt with the speed-up being from 5 to 10 source
this doesn t directly answer your question but here s some more info regarding window toolkit benchmarks it is hard to give a rule-of-thumb where swt would outperform swing or vice versa. in some environments windows swt is a winner

5999341
google-chrome	firefox
more here google-chrome a visited background image not working
you will probably find that it does work in firefox

5999808
lxml	beautifulsoup
lxml is significantly more powerful and robust than beautifulsoup in my experienced opinion
use lxml not regular expressions to parse the html - as will said but with a different preferred tool
