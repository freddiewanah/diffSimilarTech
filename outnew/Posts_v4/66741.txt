3000686
jboss	weblogic
i know within jboss the provider is hibernate so it probably doesn t matter
however i think the provider within weblogic is eclipselink

3000686
glassfish	weblogic
first of all keep in mind that jpa 2.0 is part of java ee 6 and that glassfish v3 is the only one java ee 6 container at this time
weblogic and websphere are java ee 5 server they may not support jpa 2.0

3001570
memcpy	strncpy
typically you d use something like note that you did have pretty much the right idea using memcpy though
strncpy for an obvious example is not really the right thing to use for this or almost any other purpose

3003532
passenger	webrick
it can be integrated in apache by using phusion passenger but afaik it s not available for windows
so if you have windows you ll have to use mongrel or webrick or any other win32-compatible server

3004611
updatepanel	scriptmanager
i looked at some code that i d written before with updatepanel and jquery and i d used scriptmanager
i think that the script is not available during a partial postback if it is not registered with the scriptmanager

3007397
cpython	ironpython
its very likely that pyodbc is not compatible with ironpython as it was designed for usage with cpython
ironpython certainly has some kind of odbc actually ado.net seems like where its at compatibility built into it but a dbapi would be the most direct way to get sqlalchemy working with it

3007904
cpython	pypy
if the optimization in python isn t enough rewrite the relevant parts in cpython and you re ok
i suggest to not rely on this tools anyway psycho is being replaced by the new python implementations as pypy and unladen swallow

3008051
configobj	configparser
according to its homepage this is the set of features worth mentioning nested sections subsections to any level list values multiple line values string interpolation substitution integrated with a powerful validation system including automatic type checking conversion repeated sections and allowing default values when writing out config files configobj preserves all comments and the order of members and sections many useful methods and options for working with configuration files like the reload method full unicode support configobj is used by bazaar trac ipython matplotlib and many other large python projects so it seems pretty mature and stable to me although i never used it myself
as python s built-in configparser module does not seem to support nested sections i d first try configobj

3008890
postgresql	mysql
ps you can also migrate to postgresql it s smarter than mysql when choosing right indexes
try to refactor your query like mysql is not very smart when choosing indexes and check the performance

3009625
punctuation	words
the re.escape escapes punctuation so it s matched literally not with special meaning as it would normally have in a re pattern
despite the frequently expressed antipathy for regular expressions on the part of many in the python community they re really a precious tool for the appropriate use cases -- which definitely include identifying words and phrases thanks to the b words boundary element in regular expression patterns -- string-processing based alternatives are much more of a problem .split uses whitespace as the separator and thus annoyingly leave punctuation attached to words adjacent to it etc etc

3009747
cdr	cons
roughly because a persistentarraymap will be turned into a persistenthashmap as soon as it grows beyond 9 entries. 1 traditionally in the lisp world cons cons tructs a pair so clojure departs from the lisp tradition in having its cons function construct a seq which doesn t have a traditional cdr
the generalised usage of cons to mean construct a record of some type or other to hold a number of values together is currently ubiquitous in the study of programming languages and their implementation

3010220
innodb	myisam
mysql cache works differently depending on whether you use the myisam storage engine or the innodb storage engine
myisam caches indexes only not data

3011700
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
hfs+ can be case-sensitive but the default is case-insensitive
you re not using a case-sensitive filesystem in os x unless you explicitly choose such

3012067
vmware	bootcamp
vmware fusion is very good alternative
i d just like to add to mmc that if you do use bootcamp realize you how many hours you spend with an ide open and not coding and how it kind of makes having os x pointless

3013980
spweb	spsite
sputility.sendemail uses an spweb parameter which is not thread-safe
spsite spweb objects are actually thread-specific so you shouldn t pass them from one thread to another

3017290
inline	inlining
adding the inline keyword later which is not a guarantee of inline btw is very easy to do and potential places can be found readily with a profiler
i don t inline anything until a profiler has specifically told me that not inlining is resulting in a performance problem

3017290
inline	inlining
i don t inline anything until a profiler has specifically told me that not inlining is resulting in a performance problem
the c++ compiler is very smart and will almost certainly automatically inline such simple function like this for you

3017994
intersect	contains
to test for this kind of intersection it is necessary to determine whether any of the polygons edges intersect
for your purposes if edges intersect but one polygon is not contains within the other then you know they overlap in a non-permitted fashion

3019898
uiview	calayer
you cannot achieve what you re trying to do with the preset uiview animations because the animation is one-time and cannot be intercepted
you can use opengl for true 3d transformations what you need is rotation about an axis or for a speedier implementation try calayer transforms as drawnonward suggested

3020192
udp	tcp
if you are reading udp packets that are each a complete message this can work well
if you are reading data streams from tcp this will probably not work well

3020754
stateless	stateful
here s the thing rest is about stateful communications over a stateless protocol
it s not that rest is stateless

3022359
ssl	https
self-signed ssl certificates are not supported server - hosting - setup ability to run scheduled jobs crontab with php 5 ability to override options in .htaccess files to install curl check this page depending on your platform
before installing magento or any other system take a look at the system requirements for magento supported operating systems linux x86 x86-64 supported web servers apache 1.3.x apache 2.0.x apache 2.2.x supported browsers microsoft internet explorer 6 and above mozilla firefox 2.0 and above apple safari 2.x google chrome adobe flash browser plug-in should be installed php compatibility 5.2 required extensions pdo_mysql simplexml mcrypt hash gd dom iconv curl soap if webservices api is to be used safe_mode off memory_limit no less than 256mb preferably 512 mysql 4.1.20 or newer innodb storage engine ssl if https is used to work in the admin ssl certificate should be valid

3025497
jar	manifest.mf
this way if at least one plug-in needs your jar it gets loaded but will not get loaded several times
you should build a jar that s an osgi bundle so it contains the required manifest.mf with a plug-in id and a version number this does not change the fact that the jar remains executable

3025542
uptime	reboot
you can use mach_absolute_time and it s used internally by some things but that s just system uptime so it fails if the phone reboot
i m not sure if you can get the boot uuid in order to find out if the phone has reboot

3025706
jboss	glassfish
in the end of the day i d go again with jboss but this is always subjective.
afaik jboss is much more adopted in production deployments than glassfish but this doesn t necessarily mean it s better

3025706
jboss	glassfish
afaik jboss is much more adopted in production deployments than glassfish but this doesn t necessarily mean it s better
i m using jboss for all of the projects i work on and although i generally like it there are points about it that i totally hate - that being the chaotic documentation the constant critical regressions and lack of emphasis on backward compatibility

3027444
implements	extends
it is implements not
problems are only going to arise if the customerdao class extends a generic abstract class and that generic abstract class needs to know the actual type of t

3027715
firefox	safari
and although that mozilla page you link to says firefox s sort is stable i definitely say this was not always the case prior to and including firefox 2.0
some cursory results ie6+ stable firefox 3 unstable firefox 3 stable chrome 70 unstable chrome 70 stable opera 10 unstable opera 10 stable safari 4 stable edge unstable for long arrays all tests on windows

3028822
queue	fifo
stacks and queue are abstract data types that have their own sense of order lifo last in first out for stacks and fifo fifo for queue
as such it does not make sense to take a queue stack and reorder their elements around

3028877
awt	swing
it s the awt s thread not swing s
anyway awt runs the dispatch loop within the show

3029122
ssl	https
this still leaves the possibility of mitm attacks but performing an mitm attack on an ssl connection isn t entirely trivial so it s probably not an attack vector you need to be too concerned with
you can muck around with client-side hashing but in general posting the credentials over a secure https connection is considered sufficient

3029676
union	distinct
select t.firstname + + t.lastname from mytable t union select t.company from mytable t edit union should make each select distinct by default
i m not sure what you mean by intersecting but you can easily get the results you describe as the union of two queries against that same table

3029887
moq	typemock
moq like other mocking frameworks or isolation frameworks is a tool that can be used to generate fake or stub or mock objects that can be used as dependencies for the class you re testing
most mocking frameworks including moq i think but i don t use it myself do not dictate how the fakes are passed to the class under test typemock isolator is an exception here in that it has magic that can inject the dependencies into the class under test

3031148
g++	gcc
but for g++ it ll force to treat source files as c++ by default even your file is .c lowercase
why not have a simple trial to convience yourself please not the usr libexec gcc i386-redhat-linux 4.1.2 cc1plus line which is the actual front-end compiler. mv test.c test.cpp gcc -v -c test.cpp mv test.cpp test.c g++ -v -c test.c you ll get the same result as gcc + test.cpp which means compiled as c++

3031151
multiplying	multiplication
first off you can multiplying floats
the problem you have is not the multiplication itself but the original number you ve used

3033362
jruby	mri
and even if they did their compiled methods are vastly different rubinius s compiled methods are rubinius bytecode yarv s compiled methods are yarv bytecode jruby s compiled methods are jvm bytecode ironruby s compiled methods are dlr trees
and of course the most widely used implementation mri doesn t even have a compiler

3033526
setinterval	settimeout
using settimeout instead of setinterval allows you to stop the animation with cleartimeout and the use of a variable
edit this whole thing doesn t work in ie but the settimeout - cleartimeout combo itself should.

3035894
visualvm	yourkit
you may first want to give visualvm a try before going towards yourkit yourkit is not freeware
in our office we use yourkit profiler on a day to day basis

3038566
ienumerable	iqueryable
if you don t need that you can call the constructor which takes ienumerable and trackingmode and turn off tracking on it
the reason loadasync requires dataservicequery is that just plain iqueryable doesn t define asynchronous way of executing the query

3038750
move	drag
you will have to observe its location and move your window when the other move
following a live drag this way is not possible

3040226
prepare	execute
in order to safely prepare input for use in a query use mysql_real_escape_string
while mysql_query only allows one query to execute in general this query is not safe

3041149
equals	compareto
the issue you re running into is that compareto returning 0 means that the objects are equals
at the same time you re putting them into a set which does not allow multiple copies of equals elements

3041506
firefox	safari
thankfully firefox does not merge unsubmitted data back into the page when you do a ctrl-f5
ie chrome safari opera etc has the expected behavior

3041506
opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
ie google-chrome safari opera etc has the expected behavior
i consider it a bug that firefox doesn t actually refresh the fields when you click refresh

3041832
lisp	scheme
if you re interested a a lisp a language which is essentially from the lisp family then scheme is a good choice
but scheme is not common lisp which is what lisp typically means today they are really different languages

3041832
lisp	scheme
but scheme is not common lisp which is what lisp typically means today they are really different languages
if you want to learn common lisp i would start with common lisp and skip scheme

3042045
lisp	scheme	lisp	racket
being experienced with a more conventional language will probably help in some ways but not with the qualities that make lisp unique
scheme --- the lisp with which i m most familiar --- is probably about as easy as python to learn especially if you choose plt scheme now renamed racket which offers you a lot of helpful extensions

3042045
lisp	scheme	lisp	racket
scheme --- the lisp with which i m most familiar --- is probably about as easy as python to learn especially if you choose plt scheme now renamed racket which offers you a lot of helpful extensions
common lisp is probably about the same difficulty though i find it less instinctive for reasons which are probably not universal

3042045
scheme	racket
if you want a more capable scheme either immediately or later on learn plt scheme racket
if you want a big friendly diffuse language of immense power but not as visibly internally consistent as scheme choose common lisp

3042683
opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox
there s another way of doing this onpaste oncopy and oncut events can be registered and cancelled in ie firefox google-chrome safari with some minor problems the only major browser that doesn t allow cancelling these events is opera
as you can see in my other answer intercepting ctrl + v and ctrl + c comes with many side effects and it still doesn t prevent users from pasting using the firefox edit menu etc

3042683
firefox	safari
as you can see in my other answer intercepting ctrl + v and ctrl + c comes with many side effects and it still doesn t prevent users from pasting using the firefox edit menu etc
safari still has some minor problems with this method it clears the clipboard in place of cut copy when preventing default but that bug appears to have been fixed in chrome now

3047142
comparator	comparable
an ordering is a comparator ++
in this case if you have a list of some type that implements comparable you could write this works for any iterable not just list and you can handle null s easily by specifying whether they should come before or after any other non- null elements ordering.natural .nullslast .isordered list

3047633
vsto	add-in
it turns out that vsto 4 doesn t trust add-in on network locations by default
however by adding the following registry key and re-enabling my add-in it appeared to work as expected again

3049877
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
presumably the default uiviewcontroller isn t returning the correct orientation so the wrong animation is used
background i checked all the differences between my code and apple s and i found out that my navigation controller was a subclass of uinavigationcontroller where i perform all the work

3050470
listview	gridview
when the attached property is set it registers a low priority dispatcher callback that scans up the visual tree to the listview searches down until it finds the gridviewheaderrowpresenter construct a visualbrush and sets it as the fill for the rectangle and the rectangle itself would be something like this
i haven t tried this but you may be able to include gridviewheaderrowpresenters inside your group headers if that doesn t work one sure-fire way to do it is to add a rectangle that is painted with a visualbrush that references the one-and-only gridviewheaderrowpresenter at the top of the gridview

3051007
tostring	string.format
related questions stringbuilder vs string concatenation in tostring in java string stringbuffer and stringbuilder stringbuilder and stringbuffer in java a string.format option one option often not considered is to use string.format
it ll look something like this return string.format pojo s rollno s name s this.getclass .getname this.rollno this.name

3057400
client-side	server-side
to execute javascript on the client-side as soon as the page has loaded one way is to use the body onload handler to call your function better yet if you can afford the bandwidth use jquery and use
javascript is client-side code php is server-side so you cannot execute javascript while building the page in php

3057686
lisp	smalltalk
common lisp was designed with this sort of thing in mind
you could also try smalltalk where using reflection to modify running code is not unknown

3058182
ssl	https
also ssl is the cheapest in terms of development time you may not need to change not one line of code in your app to get it working just make sure to keep your certificates valid up-to-date
if you use https ssl for your page your ajax requests will by default be handled the same way so yes this would eliminate all the clear-text issues and you ll get all the security benefits of ssl with your ajax requests as well

3061776
comparator	comparable
giving a concrete example enum declares its comparator method as public final int comparator e o in this case since you defined a to extend instances of a could only be compared against instances of b whatever b is which is almost certainly not very useful
with the additional construct you know that any class that extends enum is comparable only against itself

3066375
ssl	https
https is not another protocol it is merely http over an ssl tls- encrypted connection
since that encryption works transparent to the user agent to perform a https ajax call on your own domain name your site must be using https otherwise you are not able to selectively choose https on a page you want to perform an ajax call on that isn t already using https

3069904
comparator	comparable
this code prints false so obviously your comparator has broken the semantics of a set
no using sortedmap or sortedset on equatable but not comparable types is a horrible idea

3073344
lisp	scheme
learning common lisp is not that difficult but getting deeper experience get take some time because the language and its eco-system is surprisingly rich
learning scheme is useful too

3074414
opera	firefox
opera doesn t support any kind of gradients though
try some of the css gradient generators that you can find with a google search such as or also take a look at webkit s gradient tutorial and firefox now - that in mind this is new stuff -- css3 which isn t finalized yet

3075093
implements	extends
and if necessry one can still override getdropdownview ... additionally using this solution one can call adapter.notifydatasetchanged which isn t as easy if the adapter just implements spinneradapter and doesn t extends baseadapter
thanks for the answers but nevertheless i want to share with you the solution i used after searching more references instead that just implementing spinneradapter in my adapter i extends baseadapter and implement spinneradapter then it isn t necessary to override all this strange methods such as isempty registerdataobserver etc

3075321
uicontrol	uibutton
uiimageview is not a subclass of uicontrol so it doesn t support the target-action mechanism
you have 2 options use a uibutton instead and set your image as the button s background image

3075532
backtracking	greedy
on greedy vs non-greedy repetition in regex by default is greedy they try to match as many reps as possible and when this doesn t work and they have to backtracking they try to match one fewer rep at a time until a match of the whole pattern is found
as a result when a match finally happens a greedy repetition would match as many reps as possible

3075532
backtracking	greedy
in fact in some flavors you can do even better and use what is called possessive quantifier which doesn t backtracking at all
references regular-expressions.info repetition - an alternative to laziness negated character classes and possessive quantifiers example 2 from a to zz this example should be illustrative it shows how the greedy reluctant and negated character class patterns match differently given the same input

3076194
implements	extends
the controller should implements the listener interfaces because it responds to swing events as they occur
i would not have your view extends jframe

3078924
lisp	scheme
it is true that functional programming languages like lisp scheme etc have specialized features that may make it easier to implement particular ai methods but i do not believe this to be true for ai-related programming as a whole quantitative machine learning methods usually don t require a functional language
if you need access to both functional constructs and general software packages there are some tools for lisp to help with this and the recently-developed clojure is a lisp-variant that runs on the jvm and can access java libraries

3079806
equals	gethashcode
bool equals object 2
int gethashcode the hash code need not be unique but the less different objects will return the same hash code the better performance you will have

3080409
spaces	linefeed
the will most likely be converted to ascii 160 html decoded which is not the same as spaces
using s+ will match no breaking spaces as well as normal spaces tab and linefeed carriage return

3080735
pascal	delphi
but it can import existing ones from delphi and create new pascal functions and procedures for your program to interact with
delphi doesn t have any facilities for compiling code at runtime but there are a fair number of scripting languages that do

3081307
fgets	getline
for c you re probably looking at using fgets it has been a while since i used c meaning i m a bit rusty but i believe you can use this to emulate the functionality of the above c++ program like so with the limitation that the line can not be longer than the maximum length of the buffer that you re reading in to
in c++ you can use the global function std getline it takes a string and a stream and an optional delimiter and reads 1 line until the delimiter specified is reached

3082138
postgresql	mysql
with postgresql s bsd license you can do whatever you want
faulty behaviour - when mysql was counting rows sometimes it just returned an approximated value not the actual counted rows

3083034
portrait	landscape
now as the contents started loading when the frame size of your webview were according to portrait say 320 460 so converting your webview to landscape will automatically adjust your web view if you have this line in your code below is the snippet of code
here is a tweak though not a good thing to do and something should be handled by apple itself as you ve noticed that things workfine when webview is initialized in portrait and then you turn it to landscape

3084253
implements	extends
the state design pattern is an interesting way of implements a fsm it s a very clean way of implements the fsm but it can be messy depending on the complexity of your fsm but not the amount of states
however the advantages are that you eliminate code duplication especially if else statements it is easier to extends with new states your classes have better cohesion so all related logic is in one place - this should also make your code easier to writ tests for

3084641
udp	tcp
i don t know if the same is true for udp i suspect not but it might be worth a try
over tcp i think you can get the address of the local side of the socket after connect

3086109
division	subtraction
while floating point division is a single instruction it seems you may need to call fprem repeatedly to get the right answer for modulo so your rtl may not use it
i think you need to inspect the bowels of your c rtl fmod function x86 fpu s have fprem fprem1 instructions which computes remainders by repeated subtraction

3086617
config	ini
it doesn t really work as a data interchange format and if i am passing data i will probably use the same format for config and data interchange
yaml and json are between xml and cfg ini

3087164
swt	swing
swing s basic advantages are more platform independent more consistent in terms of performance better free ui designer netbeans extremely flexible can be used in javafx swt s advantages are simpler api uses native ui widgets when it can the ui is more similar to other apps in the same environment at some point it was argued that it s faster than swing although this was on windows only quite advanced rich client frameworks exist for both netbeans platform and eclipse rcp and if you plan on building anything non-trivial i would heartily suggest you use one of these you get modularized apps update mechanisms context-sensitive help consistent actions over menus hotkeys and toolbars window management and lots of other excellent features for free
i worked with swing and prefer it over swt as it has a purer component model with swt you have to worry about freeing resources as you re using native widgets is truly multi-platform swt works on windows macos and linux and is not even very well optimized for all three and it s more customizable

3087164
swt	swing
i worked with swing and prefer it over swt as it has a purer component model with swt you have to worry about freeing resources as you re using native widgets is truly multi-platform swt works on windows macos and linux and is not even very well optimized for all three and it s more customizable
you re probably not making a mistake trying swt or even javafx but i d be hard-pressed to find a good reason to switch to swt and would try javafx only to check the state of the art assuming the app is just a showcase app

3089137
client-side	server-side
you couldn t really expect to do client-side validation to ensure that a supplied username is unique not in the same way you can validate that they ve entered an integer into a textbox
you d have to do a postback to check the username server-side against your database

3089464
union	distinct
columns that are formed by using the set operators union union all crossjoin except and intersect amount to a computation and are also not updatable
the columns being modified are not affected by group by having or distinct clauses

3089839
ssl	https
that way i can be confident a script that should be protected by ssl is not called from a non ssl connection
if you are logging them in under ssl and then redirecting them to non ssl pages you may need to account for domains and cookies for example i always use a different domain for ssl normally https

3091298
firefox	safari
if you are still looking for one i just released mine works for firefox 3.6 right now
i decided not to do the chrome hack for now and let webkit catch up with filereader in the next versions of safari and chrome

3092680
multiplying	subtract
you need to be dividing multiplying by that value not 128 which would be for 7 bits
also when you are subtract adding 1.0f to your converted value you are doing it in the wrong order and will cause clipping to occur

3092886
opera	google-chrome
opera doesn t support window.onerror at all
google-chrome supports it but not on errors that you throw yourself

3095425
super	self
super is self but when used in a message expression it means look for an implementation starting with the superclass s method table.
super is not a pointer to a class

3097653
fossil	git
i ve used git and hg in anger and poked at fossil i include it because it offers some features that git and hg lack
i ll break down the major pros and cons in my eyes note if they all have the same advantage i m not going to mention it they re all fast and lightweight git pros very flexible github cons steep learning curve more flexible eclipse integration was lame the last time i looked hg pros imo more consistent commands less flexible bitbucket cons less flexible doesn t have quite as much momentum as git caveats i haven t checked on eclipse support lately

3098357
appfuse	spring
once you have that in hand then bring appfuse in to lighten your load
spring does not require that it be in the root directory to work

3098514
prng	random
plain pseudorandom number generators that do not satisfy the next bit test can be attacked and in fact security vulnerabilities have been discovered in real world systems due to the choice of prng
in particular linear congruential generators are known to be somewhat or completely predictable and some versions of unix random may use this algorithm

3098837
draggable	droppable
when you drop a draggable element into the droppable jquery then checks the scope attribute of the draggable and checks if the droppable you are trying to drag into is present in
if it isn t it means that the droppable you are tring to drop into is not in the same scope as the draggable

3099240
single-quotes	double-quotes
after that i think your plistbuddy set command will work ok but i ve had to quote its values before so just in case what that does is put single-quotes around message after escaping any embedded single-quotes.
you have to get double-quotes around the string being eval ed so it ll substitute for the expression but not treat the newline as a separator between commands

3103323
bmp	png	tiff	bmp
bmp png or tiff formats accept binary images as input arrays
bmp images are not hard to be handled by custom routines

3103323
bmp	png
bmp images are not hard to be handled by custom routines
for png images you can use png library and for tiff i can t remember but you can search or choose the other options

3107882
haskell	scheme
the closest work was inline haskell i think during the pugs perl6 time
you can also embed perl5 in a haskell program the haskell ffi happily supports calling into haskell from other languages but i m not sure this is sensible in the larger scheme of things

3111570
google-chrome	safari
adam s chromefix solution with paul alexander s pure-css modification solved the problem in google-chrome but not in safari
a couple additional tweaks solved the problem in safari too width 100 and z-index -1 or some other appropriate negative value that puts this element behind all the other elements on the page

3112184
content-length	content-type
as per your comment i m not too familiar with headers here is the response header from the working page date thu 24 jun 2010 05 24 23 gmt server apache 2.0.63 win32 php 5.2.11 x-powered-by php 5.2.11 content-length 3622 keep-alive timeout 15 max 100 connection keep-alive content-type text html

exponent	modulo
command-line openssl if you want to use something like openssl on a unix command line you can do something as follows. i m assuming you public.key file contains something like this -----begin public key----- miibijanbgkqhkig9w0baqefaaocaq8amiibcgkcaqeambajfv+29caiqqyziw4p j0q5qz2gs7kbgles3ai8xbhu5n8plomldxbrz0rpdcuxqd1yvaicqpdke tt09sr ml1h8sx3qa3eqmqi0tceeqk27ak0dtfxuvrq7c5hhb5fbj4o7ieq5myfdsl4pzax uxdnv4jrelymdap8 ioo3su1rsak6y7kox1 tm2cfwzzhmlrfyjnpoxpynyrp+yo cnkxmzjnmss698kafjdlyznllihwmroy0mqvdd7dcebovlfpugpalamwwyqtiu+9 5xvksp3kxcncnb mepskqipafq1sambkpwyca 1i5nlzdvuqa95zwmn0jkphtfih hqidaqab -----end public key----- then the commands would be then you can look into the asn.1 structure this should give you something like this the modulo and public exponent are in the last bit string offset 19 so use -strparse this will give you the modulo and the public exponent in hexadecimal the two integers that s probably fine if it s always the same key but this is probably not very convenient to put in a script
alternatively and this might be easier to put into a script will return this modulo 2048 bit 00 98 10 23 16 ff b6 f4 26 a2 42 a6 19 23 0e 0f 27 4a b9 43 3d a0 4b b9 1b 1a 57 92 dd a8 bc 5d b8 6e e6 7f 0f 2e 89 a5 77 16 d1 cf 44 69 74 2b b1 a9 dd 72 bd a8 9c aa 90 ca 7b f4 d3 d3 db 11 98 bd 61 f1 2c 77 41 ad c4 42 6a 88 d1 37 04 12 a9 36 ec 09 34 0d 31 71 b9 5a ea ed ce 61 1c 1e 5f 6c 9e 28 ee 21 2a e4 c6 1f 75 29 78 a5 96 b1 53 17 4d bf 88 d1 12 5c a6 75 aa 7c fe 23 a8 dd 25 35 46 c6 8a eb 2e e4 a3 1d 7f b6 6d 9c 7d 66 59 84 c9 51 15 82 67 a6 85 e9 c8 d6 2b a7 e6 28 08 d2 b1 99 92 67 32 c4 ba f7 c9 1a 16 30 e5 cb 39 cb 96 28 70 32 ba 18 d2 64 2f 74 3e dd 09 e0 68 56 57 cf 50 63 c0 95 a9 b0 5b 2a ad 21 4f bd e7 15 64 4a 9d e4 c5 c3 5c 35 bf e6 78 f4 8a 40 83 da 7d 0d 6c 02 60 4a 3f 0c 9c 03 fd 48 e6 72 f3 0d 5b 90 6b de 59 58 c9 f4 26 4a 61 b4 52 21 1d exponent 65537 0x10001 java it depends on the input format

emacs	textmate
i also recommend to everyone to follow the excellent blog emacs fu when i ve picked many interesting modes over the past couple of years
autopair - automatically pair braces and quotes in emacs like textmate paredit - ultimate sexp editing mode one cannot do serious lisp programming without it flyspell and cousing flyspell-prog-mode - great on the fly spellchecking eldoc - on the fly hints about function parameters etc in several languages like emacs lisp perl.

emacs	textmate
autopair - automatically pair braces and quotes in emacs like textmate paredit - ultimate sexp editing mode one cannot do serious lisp programming without it flyspell and cousing flyspell-prog-mode - great on the fly spellchecking eldoc - on the fly hints about function parameters etc in several languages like emacs lisp perl.
yasnippet - template expansion framework ala textmate bundles auto-revert-mode - reverts buffers if underlying files have been changed externally hl-line - highlights the current line windmove - easier navigation between many open windows in emacs show-paren-mode - highlight matching parenthesis making it easier to spot errors with their pairing all those minor modes are simply godsend

3120241
vmware	virtualbox
over the years i ve tried parallels vmware fusion and virtualbox and overall performance and functionality doesn t vary hugely in the real world
the main difference here is that virtualbox is free

3123074
prepare	execute
you cannot use a variable as a column alias in a mysql statement but you can construct a prepare statement as you will see from the output that generates a string which contains a sql select statement
you now need to create a prepare statement from that string and execute the result prepare stmt from sql

3125628
listview	gridview
if you want to display tabular data in a listview you would create a listview and set its view to a gridview which defines the column layout. the reality however is that as far as i know no other views were implemented
and because listview is not a very feature-rich control it s largely obsolete at this point

3126405
inline	inlining
with the profiler you can see these more commonly executed branches and inline them selectively but never start by inlining profilers do a good job at telling you what to consider inlining but never what shouldn t be inline
in fact you ll wreak havoc on your ability to profile your code by inlining almost everything when you start

3127568
union	distinct
columns formed using set operators union union all crossjoin except and intersect amount to a computation and are also not updatable
the columns that are being modified cannot be affected by group by having or distinct clauses

3127914
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
the basic idea do not use uinavigationcontroller
instead use it s constituent parts uinavigationbar and do the work yourself trigger the navbar to animate in parallel with your own custom animations or not if you want no anim at all the downsides uinavigationcontroller handles some other things like memory loading unloading automatically

3127914
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
instead use it s constituent parts uinavigationbar and do the work yourself trigger the navbar to animate in parallel with your own custom animations or not if you want no anim at all the downsides uinavigationcontroller handles some other things like memory loading unloading automatically
also it s hard coded into all uiviewcontrollers - they always have a reference to the uinavigationcontroller that contains them

3129052
innodb	myisam
for innodb tables you can do your entire work in a transaction
if you re using myisam tables you ll have to lock the table as myisam tables doesn t support transactions

3130975
client-side	server-side
however for security reasons modern day browsers do not allow client-side code to make calls to third party sites
there are ways to get around this but the typical approach to this problem is to make your requests to the third party site form the server-side then return the results to the client

3134875
profiling	instrumentation
obviously profiling is not meant to be used in production so a 2.5x overhead seems like a small price to pay
time just times the whole operation while cprofile runs it under instrumentation so it can get a detailed breakdown

3135482
multiplying	multiplication
sorting is not intrinsically harder than multiplying numbers
on paper they re about the same and you also need a sophisticated multiplication algorithm to make large multiplication competitive with large sort

3137522
innodb	myisam
when i need fulltext indexing i either maintain a myisam table as a mirror of my primary storage in innodb or else i use apache solr
past versions of mysql use the myisam storage engine by default which does not support foreign key constraints

3137522
innodb	myisam
re comment form jacob good points but be sure to read recent articles comparing innodb vs
myisam years ago myisam was considered the fast storage engine and innodb was considered the storage engine you d reluctantly have to use if you couldn t do without transactions

3137522
innodb	myisam
myisam years ago myisam was considered the fast storage engine and innodb was considered the storage engine you d reluctantly have to use if you couldn t do without transactions
but innodb has improved dramatically in the past few years and in most cases today innodb performs faster than myisam

3138136
direct3d	directx
go to the directx applet in the control panel and look under the direct3d tab
whilst in the directx control panel applet increase the debug output level for direct3d to maximum. i ve not used visual basic for over 10 years so i ve forgotten what debugging support is available and i don t have it installed on this machine to check.

3138784
setinterval	settimeout
if you don t care if the code within the timer may take longer than your interval use setinterval setinterval function delay that fires the function passed in as first parameter over and over
a better approach is to use settimeout along with a self-executing anonymous function that guarantees that the next call is not made before your code was executed

3139392
bitarray	bitset
if the integers are likely to be small and memory is not a constraint then you can use a bitarray collection
this is a .net class in system.collections though microsoft s c++ has a bitset equivalent

3140501
punctuation	words
characters that are not part of a words such as symbols or punctuation marks have word-breaks on both sides
if you aren t tied to regular expressions also have a look at breakiterator in particular the getwordinstance method words boundary analysis is used by search and replace functions as well as within text editing applications that allow the user to select words with a double click

3141998
super	implements
read a number from the .queue file do your web api calls do your logging append the number to the .done file if the .queue file is not at the end yet goto 3 delete the queue file then the done file grab another unprocessed .queue file and continue from 1 while this is a pretty crude approach it is super easy to implements pretty fault tolerant and you can easily split the .queue files between a set of servers and have them work in parallel
here is a simple super pragmatic solution first split your text file into smaller files perhaps with something like 10 000 entries in each file

3142065
vb6	vba
however the lack of several key oop features cause vb6 vba to fall short in being able to thoroughly implement a complete oop design pattern
here are some observations i ve made while working with oop concepts in vba you cannot overload methods in vba

3145602
inline	inlining
if you re worried that inline functions cause code bloat simply compile with the optimize for size flag
then the compiler will restrict inlining to the cases where it doesn t affect executable size noticeably

3147790
postgresql	mysql
in postgresql this is called row_number actually that is the sql-standard
in mysql this is not supported

3150682
persistent	transient
hmm - if an attribute is marked as transient that means exactly that it s not mean to be considered part of the object s persistent state for serialization
the fact that you want to do this at all is a code smell and the correct solution is to stop those fields being transient

3153840
jar	war
i can see what you re trying to do but this isn t going to work with a jar file
all jsp files including jspf have to inside a war not a jar

3153840
jar	war
all jsp files including jspf have to inside a war not a jar
the simplest solution is to put copies of the jspf files into each war that needs to use them

3154872
awt	swing
keep in mind that awt swing have a dedicated thread that does gui work handling event handlers repainting the gui etc
if you do long-running things on that thread swing will not repaint

3156742
apache	nginx
i have read large chunks of apache and i always came out feeling unclean it is a monolithic mess
you will not just learn about web-servers by exploring nginx but pretty much the best practises for writing networked software under unix and straight-c from code architecture to meta-programming techniques

3156742
nginx	lighttpd
you will not just learn about web-servers by exploring nginx but pretty much the best practises for writing networked software under unix and straight-c from code architecture to meta-programming techniques
i have heard nothing but good things about lighttpd however it is limited in scope compared to nginx

3156866
google-chrome	firefox
probably not as fast as in google-chrome but not far from it
firefox is slower than google-chrome in javascript

3157145
google-chrome	firefox
so i thought that after the firefox starts i can load the page from ie or google-chrome
actually the problem is that the debugger cannot be attached to the silverlight project because of the firefox

3157314
codeigniter	kohana
kohana is no longer simply a codeigniter fork and has not been for a while so sadly the code cannot be simply copied and pasted across
also codeigniter does not have modules just mvc components libraries and helpers so i m not sure what you would be copying from codeigniter

3160354
tablesorter	datatables
i ve also had ok luck with tablesorter but it s not nearly as easy not quite as well documented and has only ok features
by far the easiest one i ve used is amazingly simple...just make sure if you go the dom replacement route ie building a table and letting datatables reformat it then make sure to format your table with and or it won t work

3161913
config	ini
in the .net world the ini file format has been widely replaced by xml which is the new de-facto standard for config files app.config files for which the .net framework provides support through the static system.configuration.configurationmanager class
no as far as i know .net does not support ini files anymore

3162183
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
cons slider paging style didn t work in opera mobile browser very poor help no code examples at all didn t find it very easy to use menu doesn t seem to support actionlinks forums inactive not much on-line support none of the controls seem to render on opera mobile error - reparse document as html slow response from account manager when i activated an account couldn t find a way of setting the page size for the grid in the view it had to be done in the controller syncfusion pros grid renders nicely in opera mobile browser ajax paging works in google-chrome ie opera mobile firefox safari view customisation can be done in the view to allow for different device specific views fast response from account manager when i activated an account with them quick support turn around cons cannot customise the pager in the grid control scrolling grid doesn t render properly in ie8 safari google-chrome or mobile opera not even a scroll bar on the last one - support issue raised i think they ve fixed it already

3162534
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc
if ptr is a null pointer the realloc function behaves like the malloc function for the specified size
otherwise if ptr does not match a pointer earlier returned by the calloc malloc or realloc function or if the space has been deallocated by a call to the free or realloc function the behavior is undefined

3164817
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome has an edge over the fox in that regard
even though spidermonkey that handles gc in firefox has improved dramatically from 3.5 to 3.6 it s still not good enough for many games

3164817
opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
in 4.0 it is a lot better but still not quite as good as in google-chrome or opera
it is being worked on. playing the game and looking briefly at your code i see no complexity that would cause firefox not to be able to handle what s going on

3164817
google-chrome	firefox
in fact canvas in firefox 3.6 is already at least as fast as in google-chrome but many tests don t show it since the javascript is slower
and some javascript tests are slower because firefox does not handle the test harness well. all this leads to lots of confusion and misinformation

3167228
inline	inlining
methods that contain exception-handling blocks are not inline though methods that throw exceptions are still candidates for inlining
if any of the method s formal arguments are structs the method will not be inline

3167283
udp	tcp
the client can send udp packets with some autoincrement ids and the server can periodically send back the list of ids it doesn t receive so the client can resend them
i think 100000 checks per second will be the less resource consuming thing than having 10000 persistent tcp connections

3167927
postgresql	mysql
you said you were looking for virtual machines so i looked around the vmware appliances and found two you might be interested in trac python subversion client and server components apache web server postgresql mysql sqlite the underlying operating system is openbsd. ruby18-base-1.8.4nb1 ruby 1.8 based release minimum package ruby18-subversion-1.3.0nb3 ruby bindings for subversion only thing this is missing is php and ruby on rails which shouldn t be to hard to install on your own
apache2 2.0.54 php 4.4.0 mysql 4.1.12 postgresql 8.1.2-1 phppgadmin 3.5.6 ruby 1.8.4 ruby on rails 1.1.2 they both seem to contain most but not all of what your looking for

3168853
updatepanel	scriptmanager
i wouldn t do that but that s because i hate updatepanel
you could create a page method in your code behind class like this and in your scriptmanager you ll have to add one if you don t have it enable page methods

3171322
cassini	iis
cassini doesn t do url rewriting
you might want to look at the recently announced iis express version which will

3172581
udp	tcp
but udp doesn t have fixed connections so it won t show information about who externally is using your udp connections
it ll be using udp not tcp so won t have fixed connections

3172581
udp	tcp
it ll be using udp not tcp so won t have fixed connections
unfortunately you re not going to be able to find his ip from netstat for udp

3172614
implements	extends
to implements my desired functionality i found that if you inject the calling activity into the adapter class and call a method from the activity to display or hide the options menu this null pointer error does not occur and the menu displays or not beautifully
it appears that calling the sendbroadcast method from within an adapter regardless of using a subclass extends activity to do so is simply illegal

3175834
jtextpane	jeditorpane
neither jtextpane nor jtextfield isn t able to present formatted text i.e text having more than one format
for text-editor-like capabilities like you d find in wordpad or html the component to use is the jeditorpane or its descendant jtextpane

3176584
vim	emacs
if you prefer point n click adventures over quick command line access to manage the repository for ex. this might not be for you but if you should master vim the end boss is hard you ll finish most of your tasks faster than the college with the fancy ide.. not really a natively for windows match either but it ll easily beat all those ides speed wise
if there s an emacs answer.. if you have no problem investing some time into learning g vim

3177069
implements	extends
which i implements as such which shows a more familiar scheme style in the absence of mutation heavy use of recursion and no use of sequencing
edit if you just want to add some elements to a list and not per se join two though define extends l

3178932
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
this however does not seem work for ie and opera so you are left with parsing it out manually in those browsers
outputs test in google-chrome firefox and probably safari

3179279
rsa	aes
you should encrypt with rsa public keys not with a private key
if you encrypt with a private key as you propose then everyone with access to the public key will learn the aes key and will be able to decrypt or forge anything

3179889
content-length	content-type
edit 1 also you should not need to set the content-length as asp.net will do this for you
the content-type of application octent-stream is not appropriate for .txt and .doc files

3182280
casting	autoboxing
but php the language itself doesn t need type casting it does however support runtime type changes to the values in the variables
take a look at autoboxing and unboxing

3182877
gradle	ivy
we use gradle and chose it over maven and ant
ant gave us total flexibility and ivy gives better dependency management than maven but there isn t great support for multi-project builds

3183033
glut	sdl
that said glut is no longer developed and you should not be using it
there are numerous better alternatives the most popular being sdl

3185354
ienumerable	icollection	ienumerable	ilist
edit you would have to convert the ienumerable to another type like a list or concatenation to add which would result not in adding to an existing ienumerable but concatenating to a new ienumerable instead
the only option would be to test if the if it implements any of the interfaces usable for adding like ilist icollection idictionary ilookup .

3186156
memcpy	strcpy
also memcpy is not a string copying function it doesn t include the terminator
you should use strcpy

3186177
apache	lighttpd
apache would likely be the better choice for that since it supports things like .htaccess .
secondly php does not need to be run as the same user as lighttpd

3188012
postgresql	mysql
postgresql is an option but again not small
it also handles differently than mysql and is known to be more complex to administer

3190886
rsa	aes
custom md5 implementation for silverlight silverlight doesn t implement rsa encription algorithm there was nice web site with rsa algorithm implementation for silverlight
but looks like it is down for now. silverlight doesn t implement rijndael encription algorithm for backward compability you may use aes algorithm with block size 128 silverlight doesn t support ascii ansi encodings

3191474
boost	allocator
i d make two concrete suggestions to cut back your heap allocator since every instance of the inner vector has two elements you should consider using a std array or std tr1 array or boost array
the array container doesn t use heap allocator for its elements they are stored like a c array

3192051
equals	gethashcode
note if two objects return true for equals then gethashcode on each of them must be equals
however if the hash codes for two objects are value equivalent this does not means that equals is true

3192419
sudo	passwd
so this code sudo php workspace-netbeans trunk applications dudu scripts ejabberd_populate.php didnt work because my passwd in the shell was my home and the path was not resolving from there
but this cd workspace-netbeans trunk applications dudu scripts sudo php ejabberd_populate.php works

3193832
inline	inlining
it is possible to inline within the same file not inlining across objects are not possible until gcc 4.5
my guess inlining

3201065
strdup	memmove
nulls are also taken care of in the same memory space which was allocated by strdup
you aren t including null character while memmove . try this edit and here is a bit better way of the same thing that you are doing

3201603
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
opera doesn t yet support gradients instead use svg scalable vector graphics firefox gradient documentation webkit safari google-chrome gradient documentation opera gradients
this will work in firefox 3.6+ safari 4+ google-chrome and ie 6+ i think that supports gradient filters

3202912
youtube	vimeo
anyways this should work if you want to provide a custom flash alternative obviously if you want to use a youtube vimeo .
video as alternative you just place the embed code instead of the script tag both of this solutions prefer html5 video over the flash video if you don t want to pay for loads of bandwidth you might prefer to show the youtube video to all the people who have flash and only fallback to html5 if that s not available

3205575
ssl	https
but setup the reverse proxy with the site s certificate and have it be an ssl endpoint
the proxied requests going to the django app would then just be regular old http not https

3205605
gridview	repeater
i m not sure what you mean you want a basic grid but gridview doesn t work for you
but in any case check out the repeater

3205791
ssl	https
the reason for this is because of the native design of ssl
it separates secures it s self from the non secure version by not passing authentication states between http and https

3206639
udp	tcp
therefore most state-tracking firewalls will make a best guess about the udp data flow and assume that traffic leaving on a given port will receive replies on the same port and automatically route them back
if using some out-of-channel means such as a tcp server which simply passes addresses and not data both peers can be transmitting data to each other on the same ports their respective firewalls nat routers will open up holes allowing the traffic in

3208853
firefox	safari
i was having the same problem rendering a text input element using jquery ui autocomplete within a table cell using firefox in ubuntu
the table was rendering flawlessly in ie 7 8 chrome safari firefox 3.6 but not in firefox on ubuntu

3209655
google-chrome	safari
i found that adding display block to the input field fixes it in google-chrome but not safari very weird
i read your question and decided to check my site in google-chrome and found the same issue

3213479
base	fractions
the integer and fractions parts both consist of a sequence of decimal base ten digits
either the integer part or the fractions part not both can be omitted

3213611
setinterval	settimeout
settimeout this alternative is very similar to setinterval except that it doesn t ensures a given interval between repetition rather focuses on how long the browser should wait until repeating the action
so in order to make it more like setinterval you may need to keep track of the elapsed time between actions and calculate the measure of the change that has to be taken care of

3214766
inline	inlining
most of the time the compiler will make the right choice on whether or not to inline certain functions in your program
this automatic inlining process will mean that there is no extra cost for writing your function at all

3215196
implements	extends
the way to extends natives is to use the implements method
the only problem is that this.parent and this.previous don t exist so you have to get a bit trickier to extends existing methods without rewriting them the key concepts here are 1 - encapsulate the whole shebang in a private self-executing function so the global namespace isn t polluted by our variable assignments for the original methods old_hide and old_show

3215379
perforce	svn
i think perforce does something similar
this doesn t mean svn is bad it works rather well

3215555
multiplication	exponent
points out in the comments 128-bit floating point numbers already allow large enough exponent to call into question both lookup tables and standard long multiplication
as a practical matter long multiplication is the fastest up to a handful of digits then in a significant medium range one can use karatsuba multiplication or toom-cook multiplication and then after that a variation of schonhage-strassen is best not just in theory but also in practice

3215625
cvs	svn
we re not only supporting svn in addition to git and mercurial but also cvs
svn s killer feature among our users is narrow clones

3217209
db4o	eloquera
i found a bug in the db4o code and it took many many months before it was integrated into their codebase
i have found bugs in eloquera and they fixed them in a day or two db4o is not yet on .net 4 although they finally have an early beta

3217209
db4o	eloquera
i have found bugs in eloquera and they fixed them in a day or two db4o is not yet on .net 4 although they finally have an early beta
db4o is the only thing holding me back from using vs2010 and .net 4

3218551
quicksort	heapsort
unless you re going to write a very good sort probably quicksort merge sort or heapsort depending on your specific needs quicksort will be better and it takes fewer lines of code
the big mistake aside from the errors is not using the c library s quicksort function

3219067
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
it seems that for whatever reason ie ie8 at least and opera don t retain the value attribute though google-chrome firefox do through changing the type
here s a simplified test you can try it here ie8 opera alerts on google-chrome firefox alerts test i m not sure why opera in particular is behaving this way but in any case...just attempting to better demonstrate the issue the solution of course is to keep the type attribute first

3222993
macports	homebrew
if it is not already installed then your best bet is to install homebrew brew install ant or macports sudo port install apache-ant and use those tools to install apache ant
alternatively though i would highly advise using homebrew or macports instead you can install apache ant manually

3226612
g++	gcc
if you use gcc less 4.5 it may have something to do with a change introduced with gcc4.5 g++ now implements dr 176
previously g++ did not support using the injected-class-name of a template base class as a type name and lookup of the name found the declaration of the template in the enclosing scope

3228735
ienumerable	ilist
ienumerable is less specific than ilist ilist implements ienumerable so unless you want something specific from ilist such as count as you suggest or perhaps add delete etc i d use ienumerable
one benefit of remaining with ienumerable is that you can write iterator methods to return this type look up yield return and iterator methods if you are not familiar with them

3232713
firefox	safari
firefox doesn t support this yet. this demo doesn t use gradients but it should explain background-clip text
if you only need this for a small amount of text like a heading you should be able to achieve the effect in safari chrome using -webkit-background-clip text and -webkit-gradient

3233371

union	distinct
the second collection is added to the first collection using the multiset union syntax
unlike the the sql union operator this implementation does not winnow duplicates we can use multiset union distinct for that

3235535
equals	gethashcode
remember if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values. the second sentence often is misinterpreted as the only rule is that at object creation time the hashcode of equals objects must be equals

3235535
equals	gethashcode
ok what should be said as well there are cases where it is possible to have objects with mutable data where the hashcode is nevertheless unchanged when the objects data is changed without violating the equals hashcode-contract
this does however require that the equals-method is not based on the mutable data as well. so if i write an object and create a gethashcode method that does calculate a value only once and stores it inside the object to return it on later calls then i must again absolutely must create a equals method that will use stored values for the comparison so that a.equals b will never change from false to true as well

3237187
quicksort	heapsort
i see that no one has mentioned introsort which solves quicksort s o n 2 worst case by switching to heapsort when the recursion depth exceeds a certain threshold
this means that quicksort will not get the chance to degenerate since its number of recursive calls will definitely be limited

3238363
jar	war
jar xvf thewar.war path to jar inside war #extract the file.
jar tvf path to jar indide war.jar # read the extracted jar rm path to jar inside war # remove it i just did this and it did not delete the file i extracted from the war

3238830
backgrounding	multitasking
if fast-app switching is working on the app as part of multitasking you are correct in stating that the os will take a snapshot and restore your app to this state after it comes out of the backgrounding
if the os is saving state for you then coming out of the backgrounding doesn t suck since it brings you app back into view looking just like it did when it left

3239545
equals	gethashcode
if your simple class uses equals in a manner that satisfies your requirements then you can use the distinct method if not then you will need to provide an instance of which compares values in the way you desire
for example null problems ignored for brevity note the use of a constant for gethashcode is intentional

3240315
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
also note that some event classes change in qgraphicsview context qmouseevent becomes qgraphicsscenemouseevent so make sure to filter for the right thing
qgraphicsitem s are not qobjects but they still receive events managed by their qgraphicsscene

3241092
comparator	comparable
to use comparator it does a cast to comparable which is the source of the exceptions
i am not familiar with a default comparator in java but obviously comparator to comparator is often a mere wrapper

3241092
comparator	comparable
there is no general of natural ordering in the standard api although certain built in types like numbers have an implementation of comparator which then becomes their natural ordering
treemap and treeset and all these should throw a runtimeexception if the object you put in does not implement comparable

3241435
hex	binary
use to convert to hex before you do the base64 conversion in c#
echo adds a newline you need to do echo -n shasum might do the same check the output of that before you pipe it to base64 sha1.computehash gives you back binary hash representation not the hexadecimal representation as the shasum utility produces - which means you re base64 encoding different things in c# vs the unix command line

3244645
strcpy	malloc
a very simple approach is to not use an array at all but rather a linked list this can be done in a number of ways but the simplest is probably to modify the name struct as follows the use of char instead of char will necessitate some strcpy ing but that s really neither here nor there
to expand the array you can now simply malloc these elements one at a time

3244664
subtract	addition
than the difference between a and b is that c is added to b but not to a which means a b - c mod 10 the check from the first algorithm is performed by subtract a from 10 and check if it is congruent c for modulus 10
for addition and substraction it doesn t matter when the modulus is performed 10 - a c mod 10 this is equal to -a c mod 10 now you can substitute a with the first one which results in - b - c c mod 10 this is equal to c - b c mod 10 and this is equal to -b 0 mod 10 b 0 mod 10 and that is the check which is performed in the second algorithm

3245327
subtraction	addition
what is happening is this the result is that just adding a 60m or 60.0 to the whole statement as has been suggested will not or may not yield the wanted result depending on execution order of the statement and or the existence of addition subtraction as is the case in the op s question
to fix this follow adam s advice and convert each addition subtraction step to decimals use decimals all along not very clear or place the calculation in a little function that takes decimals as parameters forcing implicit conversion which as a bonus is shorter and adds to readability

3245646
persistent	transient
hibernate will detect any changes made to an object in persistent state and synchronize the state with the database when the unit of work completes
developers do not execute manual update statements or delete statements when an object should be made transient

3246594
config	ini
if you don t mind the config not being an ini but php arrays you can also use this code to load and write back the config somewhat related question and my answer to it reading and writing config files
you could use zend framework s zend_config_writer_ini to write the ini file back to file

3246758
ienumerable	iqueryable
ienumerable is simpler less coupling
i think a repository can give you 1 or more iqueryables ienumerables but not a repository is an iqueryable

3247803
implements	extends
for example quicksort shouldn t fail at least if you implements it yourself
if you are worried about the worst case behavior of quicksort you can first randomize the list then sort it. or you could extends your tolerance patch so that it becomes an equivalence relation and you restore transitivity

3248125
sproutcore	cappuccino
in sproutcore the model layer provides full object-relational mapping and manages things like storage state querying and back-end retrieval of the data
cappuccino does not provide a model layer in the same sense so from what i ve seen you would instead directly send requests to your back-end and then load the results into objects and handle state querying etc

3248382
udp	tcp
from you pov tcp connections will always somehow work whereas with udp you ll have to take care of packet sequencing packets missings etc
for example an image takes 3 packets to transfer udp does not guarantee that all 3 packes will arive at the destination and if they do it does not guarantee that they ll arrive in the same order you ve sent

3248382
udp	tcp
for example an image takes 3 packets to transfer udp does not guarantee that all 3 packes will arive at the destination and if they do it does not guarantee that they ll arrive in the same order you ve sent
now for tcp reestablishing a new connection for every file could be done yes but it is not necessary

3250288
sudo	passwd
you can even allow a user to execute a predefined command with root permissions without asking a passwd at all - which is still more secure because an attacker that could read your variant of the script has access to the root passwd and thus can do anything he wants while using the sudo variant only allows him to execute the predefined command as root
in addition the code does not break once you re fancy changing your root passwd

3250884
google-chrome	firefox
i can only get it to work for firefox not google-chrome or ie i haven t tested it on other browsers
firefox also allows mouseenter and mouseleave but this is not reported on the w3schools page

3251387
spaces	linefeed
authors should not declare attribute values with leading or trailing white spaces
so whitespace within the attribute value is subject to a number of user agent transformations - conforming browsers should apparently be discarding all your linefeed not only the trailing one - so chrome s behaviour is indeed buggy but in the opposite direction to the one you want

3252690
domcontentloaded	onreadystatechange	domcontentloaded	onload
window.load will always fire after domcontentloaded that is the equivalent of jquery document .ready for most cases
when not available jquery will fallback to onreadystatechange or onload ie or load standard

3257168
innodb	myisam
you probably want to use innodb for your data because myisam does not support foreign keys or transactions
you can create separate dedicated tables that use myisam and fulltext indexing just for searching purposes

3257852
unixodbc	iodbc
there s no need for unixodbc on macs and it can lead to lots of errors if you re not a serious expert
there is a specific guide to using php with iodbc on mac os x

3258304
bash	subshell
this will not be csh but most probably bash or some simpler version of it
btw note that what you do with shell environment in os.system will not affect subsequent calls to os.system because each is run in different subshell

3258367
udp	tcp
note that udp is a datagram protocol not a stream like tcp
each read from udp socket dequeues one full datagram

3260304
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome has console defined be default so it is not a problem
on firefox however there is no such global object not without firebug so when you try to call a property on an undefined object like console.log ..

3262461
firefox	safari
firefox v3 and v3.5 supported
latest safari safari v4 and latest chrome chrome v3 supported but not previous versions

3263232
config	ini
in your example above the code to parse the config files should not be inside this method or even in the same class
an ini file parser has one responsibility parsing ini files

3266286
super	self
you should not call super from loadview and you must set the view property in the view controller
you should not invoke the getter for view self view from inside loadview because the getter calls loadview

3266481
dbcontext	objectcontext
you might think that having one dbcontext per thread is actually thread-safe but this is usually not the case since asp.net has an asynchronous model that allows finishing requests on a different thread than where it was started and the latest versions of mvc and web api even allow an arbitrary number of threads handle one single request in sequential order
this means that the thread that started a request and created the objectcontext can become available to process another request long before that initial request finished

3266668
opera	firefox
it seems that only certain versions of opera will allow you to modify page margins from css background images and colors aren t usually printed by browsers to save ink - there s an option in most browsers to enable printing bg
in firefox look in about config in ie i think it s under file- page setup.

3266699
directx	gdi
pix has privileged access to the directx driver so i wouldn t expect to be able to use that as a model to emulate
if an the target app is running in windowed mode hooking directx still work but you could also just use gdi instead

3266955
profiling	debugging
you shouldn t avoid it but you ll definitely need a profiling if you want stl containers stl containers are extremely slow in debugging builds
this might be a problem because if you re frequently accessing them there will be a huge performance drop say from 300 fps to 50 in debugging build when compared to release build

3267405
ssl	https
its main message is ssl tls is not computationally expensive any more
apart from the previous answers since people tend to want to go from https to http for performance reasons this article about https at google might be of interest

3269795
factors	mean
in webforms applications a common technique for factors out application and or business logic out of the code behind is to use the mvp pattern
this doesn t mean all the code typically found in the code-behind just gets moved to another class as this really isn t any different than a code-behind

3270860
persistent	transient
when to use onetoone i may use onetoone if the entity manager needs to handle the persistent of the related object
the point is i can always live without specifying onetoone but then the responsibility is on me to manage the relationship and making sure that the referred objects are not in transient state

3272139
implements	extends
wx may not be the ideal framework to implements this but you can subclass wx.event -- or you could use a separate event system like pydispatcher for the higher-abstraction events that flow between separate subsystems in order to decouple the controller from the specific choice of gui framework
i normally use qt whose signals slots model imnsho extends scales better than typical gui frameworks event systems

3273580
google-chrome	firefox
your code works for me on google-chrome 5.0.375 and safari 5.0
doesn t loop on firefox 3.6

3277049
ftp	telnet
since you only want to issue a command then you don t need to use ftp but can use the telnet protocol
the ftp protocol in rebol2 does not support site specific commands such as chmod

3277407
super	self
so for instance if you had class first object def __init__ self print first class second first def __init__ self print second class third first def __init__ self print third class fourth second third def __init__ self super fourth self .__init__ print that s it the mro would be by the way if python cannot find a coherent method resolution order it ll raise an exception instead of falling back to a behaviour which might surprise the user
there s no obvious expectation and python will raise an error typeerror error when calling the metaclass bases cannot create a consistent method resolution order mro for bases second first edit i see several people arguing that the examples above lack super calls so let me explain the point of the examples is to show how the mro is constructed

3277433
innodb	myisam
if you are going to use mysql as your dbms note that the innodb storage engine supports foreign key constraints while the default myisam engine does not
however only the myisam engine supports full text indexing

3279052
super	implements
and rightly so doing any operation on an instance field before a call to super or this results in a compilation error. an method can contain three kinds of code an invocation of another method code that implements any instance variable initializers and code for the body of the constructor
if a constructor begins with an explicit invocation of another constructor in the same class a this invocation its corresponding method will be composed of two parts an invocation of the same-class method the bytecodes that implements the body of the corresponding constructor if a constructor does not begin with a this invocation and the class is not object the method will have three components an invocation of a superclass method the bytecodes for any instance variable initializers the bytecodes that implements the body of the corresponding constructor if a constructor does not begin with a this invocation and the class is object and object has no superclass then its method cant begin with a superclass method invocation. if a constructor begins with an explicit invocation of a superclass constructor a super invocation its method will invoke the corresponding superclass method

3280591
jquery	scriptaculous
ui library i prefer jquery
i think all of these frameworks will do that for you reverse isn t supported by all of them i see jquery fx scriptaculous yahoo

3280937
backgrounding	multitasking
when you click home it directly navigate to the home screen and your app will run at backgrounding
so your scenario is not possible yet and also its not a effective multitasking environment

3282014
avr	microcontroller
if you lean toward microcontroller learn arm thumb avr pic blah msp430 maybe 8051
read some data sheets microcontroller can teach you this even if that is not the field you want tons of sub 50 development eval boards sparkfun.com for example that give data sheets simple schematics assembler c etc

3283859
jar	war
the problem with embedding a config file inside a jar is absolute path or the physical path of the file in case you need to update it
if your container will not explode your ear and war files then placing the config file alongside the code is a bad idea - the administrator will have to deploy a newer version of the ear war jar

3284328
jboss	glassfish
if upgrading to a el 2.2 java ee 6 compliant container tomcat 7 glassfish 3 jboss 6 etc is not an option and you re currently using el 2.1 java ee 5 tomcat 6 glassfish 2 jboss 4 etc then your best bet is to install jboss el
jboss el is an el 2.1 compliant implementation which supports the same features as el 2.2

3286542
exponent	addition
where the exponent bits are all 1 and the mantissa bits are not all 0 that s a nan signalling or quiet is decided by the sign bit but you re probably not concerned with that
in addition nans are never equal to one another so you could test for equality between and itself - false means it s a nan

3286802
innodb	myisam
however you have to use the myisam engine to use full-text index because innodb doesn t support it
in a mysql database you can have a heterogeneous mix of engines for each table so you would just need to make your posts table use myisam

3290994
google-chrome	firefox
i think what mozilla means is that it can only be accessed by privileged javascript javascript running in firefox google-chrome either extensions or firefox itself and not by unprivileged javascript in web pages from inside the browser
if you are worried about someone getting the file directly via the os then there is little firefox can do to help you

3292349
udp	tcp
you have to split up your data into multiple packets. using tcp instead of udp will make the thing much simpler since completeness and receiving order are guaranteed
the udp specification gives you 16bits in the udp header for the packet size that means you cannot send more than 65k at once

3292745
ienumerable	iqueryable
use asenumerable instead of the first tolist calling asenumerable will cause cast to be evaluated on a ienumerable not iqueryable so the cast will be done on the actual object returned from the db rather than directly in the db
what you re doing is correct you can t call cast directly on the iqueryable but it s sub-optimal because you re creating 2 lists when you really only need one

3293449
rpm	yum
the job of rpm is to install the packages it s told to install not to go and look for other packages
pulling in dependencies is the job of higher-level tools such as apt urpmi or yum

3294275
jruby	rubinius	jruby	mri
therefore you need to run jruby on a modern high-performance jvm such as the server version of oracle hotspot 1.6.0u21 with the c2 compiler or oracle jrockit r28.0.1 for it to really shine
the difference becomes really dramatic when running multithreaded code on a multicore machine such as for example azul systems 864-core java appliance because mri yarv ree and rubinius cannot actually run multiple threads in parallel and thus are only ever going to use at most one core whereas jruby and ironruby will happily use all available cores

3294275
jruby	rubinius	jruby	mri
the difference becomes really dramatic when running multithreaded code on a multicore machine such as for example azul systems 864-core java appliance because mri yarv ree and rubinius cannot actually run multiple threads in parallel and thus are only ever going to use at most one core whereas jruby and ironruby will happily use all available cores
in most benchmarks yarv is equal to or slightly ahead of jruby but i have found that those benchmarks tend not to be very representative of the code i write so for my code jruby is almost always significantly faster than yarv

3296490
client-side	server-side
update you re still not showing how your are creating your client-side service proxy and how you re calling your service
you ve posted just about all the server-side code - but not a shred of client-side code

3296490
client-side	server-side
you ve posted just about all the server-side code - but not a shred of client-side code
ok here s how to do it spin up your service host and make sure it s running in visual studio create two separate console application projects for your clients - call them client1 and client2 in both those new client projects use add service reference to add a service reference to your service that will create a bunch of files under that service reference globe you now need to instantiate an instance of the client-side proxy in both your client projects client1 will call your first method getdelayedresponse while client2 will call getdirectresponse in client1 instance1.getdelayedresponse

3298091
opera	firefox
the animation was really smooth in firefox but did stutter a bit in opera
on my thinkpad z61p running linux i do not think firefox does any gpu acceleration yet but when that kicks in i suppose the cpu load would be a lot less

3298226
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
not all but a few more than the web browsers that have native support for websockets today i know that at least google-chrome has native support for it since 6 months or so
from the readme it should work on google-chrome 4 or later just uses native implementation firefox 3.x internet explorer 8 + flash player 9 or later it may or may not work on other browsers such as safari opera or ie 6

3299144
bazaar	git
this thread mentions sadly git-bzr is sufficiently broken that you will not be able to push your changes with git bazaar push upstream as the docs indicate
instead we have to use git format-patch and then turn each patch into a bazaar commit manually which get pushed with bazaar push

3301276
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
edit apparently in google-chrome and presumably by extension safari as well pressing control-i control-b control-u cause the same behavior you might expect from a rich text editor
i also tested in firefox and found that unlike google-chrome and not quite contrary to the spec it does in fact insert new tags instead of s with a attribute added on

3301788
jax-ws	jax-rs
incidentally apache does make cxf a jax-ws jax-rs stack in addition to the older axis axis 2 products
i haven t tried this in helios but i know some of the earlier eclipse versions did not have the ability to generate jax-ws artifacts

3304679
jboss	glassfish
these libraries may reference other libraries either bundled with the application or installed separately using any of the techniques described herein. this does not mean that method b is incorrect it is the one to be used for application servers like jboss 4 that did not support the library-directory element in application.xml
i believe glassfish also supports the lib directory concept without a corresponding library-directory element

3304679
glassfish	weblogic
i believe glassfish also supports the lib directory concept without a corresponding library-directory element
coming back to the question placing classes alone in a directory in the ear file appears to be supported only in weblogic server via the app-inf classes structure needless to say this is not a platform standard

3307240
uiview	subviews
to intercept all touches you should use uiview subclass for your controller view and override hittest withevent method in it for more information see event delivery section in event handling guide for ios
i may be not 100 accurate here but if you place -touchesbegan withevent in your view controller or its main view then you will get only those touches that have not been handled by some subviews in the view hierarchy

3307757
implements	extends
i do not think that there s some standard way so something has to be implements
i do not know perl much and i use java so this is just a heads up i would extends the defaultselenium class for my tests that will use extended httpcommandprocessor that will logs all commands performed and then i would extends selenesetestcase for use as the base in my tests import com.thoughtworks.selenium.selenesetestcase

3309555
inline	inlining
the inline keyword does not actually cause functions to be inline
any recent compiler is going to make better decisions with regards to inlining than you will

3309674
jsf	seam
you can also take a look at its comparison with spring in google insights for search q seam 2cspring cmpt q i only know one other company here in athens where they use it and i know a handful of companies that use plain jsf struts or spring of course athens is not representative for all the world
i like seam have been using it for the past year professionally

3311391
client-side	server-side
as such i think mvc2 is a better platform because you re leveraging your web server to process all the work and not bogging down processes client-side
i liken this to why we do certain things server-side vs

3311502
ssl	https
if you are expecting mysite.com to use an ssl certificate that isn t trusted by default in the browser but you have another way of knowing it should be trusted then you could use a javascript tls implementation to make cross-domain requests to that other site
however this requires that your website be served on https and trusted in the browser to begin with and the other site to provide a flash cross-domain policy file

3313727
client-side	server-side
but javascript is for client-side code only and should not be used for server-side for security reasons and you could use ajax jquery to retrieve and send data to server but that depends on your needs and application
if the webapp is highly client-side then java ajax and jquery are good ways to go

3313897
tortoisegit	svn
in general working with git this way has been pretty seamless and i must admit to having learned git while using the tortoisegit interface and it must be conceded that this was a hindrance to my education
the tortoisesvn-like log viewer doesn t really work for a distributed-vcs workflow it works well enough it you use git as if it were svn and you only find this out later because the problems only come in when there are many many development branches the gitk tool is much better at handling this display

3314674
single-quotes	double-quotes
variables in single-quotes are not evaluated
use double quotes the shell will expand variables in double-quotes but not in single-quotes

3319405
apache	nginx
apache isn t really a typical setup for python in my experience
python webapps are usually daemons that are exposed to the public with a reverse proxy webserver in front nginx is very common

3320381
oncreate	onstart
try overriding the oncreate method of your service
if the service is killed and then restarted it s oncreate is called but not onstart

3320722
cvs	svn
it s not the sexy distributed source control that all the cool kids are using but and this is the reason i am suggesting it svn should be an easy migration from cvs
it s established well-used and conceptually similar to cvs in some respects

3320866
equals	gethashcode
a hash function must have the following properties if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values

3320866
equals	gethashcode
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values
the gethashcode method for an object must consistently return the same hash code as long as there is no modification to the object state that determines the return value of the object s equals method

3323006
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
the main reason not to do this as thorbjørn ravn andersen says in a comment below is that you don t wan t to mix real bad nullpointerexception with nullpointerexception thrown intentionally
so until you re confident that you re able to recognize valid npe i d recommend to use illegalargumentexception when you want to tell to your api user that null is not a valid argument value

3323561
xna	spritebatch
in this version of xna you can easily specify your own vertex shader for spritebatch
2 you could use a custom vertex shader with spritebatch in xna 3.1 it s just not as easy

3323561
xna	spritebatch
2 you could use a custom vertex shader with spritebatch in xna 3.1 it s just not as easy
a good starting point would be the source code for the vertex shader used by xna up until xna 4.0 see above

3323594
lisp	sml
if you look at a language like sml for example and compare it with lisp the functional core of each is almost identical
as a result it doesn t seem like you would have much trouble applying some kind of static typing to the core of lisp function application and primitive values

3325635
cpython	pypy
the current version of pypy is 99 compatible with cpython version 2.5 and can run django twisted and many other python programs
there used to be a limitation of not being able to run existing cpython c extensions but that is also being addressed with cpyext module in pypy

3326952
.htaccess	httpd.conf
you cannot map to a filepath when using mod_rewrite in a per-directory context that is using .htaccess
you should be able to however map to an absolute path when you place your rules in a per-server context httpd.conf either in the main server or virtual server configuration

3327022
bash	zsh	bash	tcsh
if however the executable doesn t match your actual shell bin sh is actually bash or ksh you need heuristics
here are some environmental variables specific to various shells is set on tcsh is set on bash lowercase is set to actual shell name in csh or tcsh is set on zsh ksh has and set whereas normal bourne shell sh only has and set

3327227
client-side	server-side
so you can tell your client that extjs is no more or less secure than any other client-side technology
that s because security is the server-side code s job and not the client

3327563
setinterval	settimeout
there is another function setinterval but you don t want the event to occur while the user has not yet clicked on the notification ie after 15 minutes a notification pops up but if the user has not dismissed the notification you don t want the event to run again
settimer works in the following way settimeout code millisec lang code is a reference to the function or the code to be executed. millisec is the number of milliseconds to wait before executing the code lang is optional

3328026
rpm	yum
one of the design guidelines for rpm specs is that they should not print error messages or in any way interact with the user
you don t know if they will be installed manually or via yum gui

3329131
lisp	scheme
common lisp tends to prefer practicality and power over elegance and was an attempt at consensus-building so seeing an existing two-namespace solution broadly accepted and working well accepted it
in practice however it mostly means three things in common lisp and other lisp-2 s you have to use funcall a lot in scheme and other lisp-1 s you have to be careful not to override needed function names with variables

3329510
inline	inlining
in order to have a call site not inline you can use a pointer to a function
please remember that inlining is relevant at the function call site the same function can be inline in some situations and not inline in other

3329510
inline	inlining
please remember that inlining is relevant at the function call site the same function can be inline in some situations and not inline in other
if your function is visible outside the compilation unit then even if it s inline in all the current places it s used the body of the function must still be available for anyone who wants to call it later on by linking with the object file

first and foremost nginx does not support any application execution directly. it can serve static files proxy requests to any other webserver and some other small things. historically nginx aimed to handle many network connections true but the rationale was this until apache respond to the request of someone on slow connection it can do nothing. apache has a limit of workers so when there are lots of slow clients anyone new have to wait until a worker finishes the transfer and resumes accepting new request. so the classic setup is nginx accepting external requests proxying them to the local apache
apache handles the requests and gives back the responses to the nginx to transfer to the clients. thus apache is eliminated from dealing with clients

sudo	passwd
you could create an entry for the user you run eclipse as in the etc sudoers file using visudo or your sudo permissions editor of choice to allow ant to run as root without a passwd
you would need to then get eclipse to invoke sudo ant instead of just ant - i m not familiar with eclipse so maybe someone else can suggest if that s possible or not

3337830
ubuntu	linux
here s a quick comparison of the existence of the interpreter language runtime by os cpython windows - probably not installed and you d have to make a non-python installer install it with your software -p linux - probably installed ubuntu gentoo and redhat all have system tools that are written in python and run on cpython mac - preinstalled on osx jython windows - probably installed at some point in my experience though it doesn t come with linux - probably installed but more importantly nobody would hate you for depending on it like mono mac - preinstalled on osx mac os x leopard comes with j2se 5.0 preinstalled based on jdk 1.5.0_13_b05 -- apple s site ironpython windows - will probably run fine because i bet most people have at the very least .net 2.0 if they have a recent version of windows linux - probably not installed -- the only application with which i ve used mono on linux was rasterbator which worked well but i felt weird putting .net on linux mac - see above i would choose a gui toolkit first since that will very much impact the user experience and overall difficulty i would choose wxpython but swt would be a close second then consider the above as well maybe as a tiebreaker
well mono does not come with the base of most linux distributions

3339163
set	bag
here s the opposite approach the worst time to use an auto-complete box is when you have a finite and relatively small set of options and the user doesn t know the range of valid options
for example if you re selling used cars and you have a mixed bag of brands simply listing the brands in a combobox is more efficient and easier to browse than an auto-complete method

3341363
multiplying	multiplication
to multiplying this number by a normal non-big integer n do something like if you know n will never be bigger than 100 or some other small number and want to avoid going into the 64-bit range or if you re on a 64-bit platform and want to use uint64_t for your bigint array then make the base a smaller power of 10 so that the multiplication result will always fit in the type
now printing the result is just something like if you want to use a power of 2 as the base rather than a power of 10 the multiplication becomes much faster however printing your result in decimal will not be so pleasant.

3345417
scheme	racket
racket also includes a lot of standard libraries web server that other scheme do not
for one big example racket lists are immutable by default whereas scheme s are mutable

3345751
client-side	server-side
there are other frameworks like jquery that can be used to script client-side activities but they aren t web frameworks in the same sense
usually when someone says web framework they mean server-side

3347862
super	implements	super	extends
super t since you may have a class a that extends a class b which implements but a doesn t implements
super a so you can call the compareto method defined in b even for a objects

3348618
profiling	debugging
if i m not mistaken it should do this automatically as long as the profiling is set to debugging
edit oh i forgot one thing in the debugging options for the managed project make sure you have the option enable unmanaged code debugging

3354420
google-chrome	firefox
i consider watir-webdriver with the firefox driver ready for production use at this point with some notable exceptions frame support still needs more work alerts prompts not supported table api is incomplete unfinished having a stable and usable firefox driver is my #1 priority so i haven t yet spent much time testing ie google-chrome or htmlunit remote
the results from our spec suite the watir2 branch of watirspec should give a nice indication of how well the browsers are supported firefox passing 94 total time 201 seconds

3356370
umbraco	dotnetnuke
umbraco still wins hands down
i used kentico dotnetnuke sitecore joomla cms made simple yes admittedly not mojoportal

3356370
umbraco	dotnetnuke
umbraco isn t for you
imo kentico dotnetnuke are the ones

3356875
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
specifically note the following any runtimeexception triggers rollback and any checked exception does not
the default behaviour for spring s declarative transaction management tells the transaction manager to rollback for any unchecked-exception and to ignore any checked exceptions

3358638
scheme	racket
there are probably more but on most other parts racket is a superset of scheme
racket is ultimately based on r5rs and not r6rs and not a strict superset of either

3358638
scheme	racket
i don t think it can be called scheme because it s not backwards compatible with any scheme standard
most implementations offer extensions but are otherwise backwards compatible of course the compiler that comes with racket can also run in r5rs or r6rs mode

3358638
scheme	racket
valid r5 6rs scheme that runs in racket mode may either be rejected cause runtime errors or behave differently than it should
with that said the main points where it is not backwards compatible are racket has no set-cdr

3358940
spaces	delimiter
white spaces is not permitted between the markup declaration open delimiter
and the comment open delimiter -- but is permitted between the comment close delimiter -- and the markup declaration close delimiter

3361661
profiling	debugging
if you only need this for debugging dev purposes and not in the final system you can use eclipse profiling
eclipse profiling allows you to define probes that are executed at various times e

3363425
client-side	server-side
that way they will fail quicker than on the server side where n incorrect commits can be pushed and will fail in other work here a client-side hook would be more appropriate
the trick is git hooks are not published pushed pulled so if your project members push to a bare repo where a server-side hook pre-receive or update check for the commit message pattern which i am not sure it can be done that push will fail

3366523
udp	tcp
you might use a simple udp protocol - the advantage being that if you understand the concepts of simple packet protocols on rs232 you ll find it easy to transfer that knowledge to sending the packets via udp
if you want a reliable as in other parts of the system will worry about errors and retries stream of bytes between the two pcs then tcp ip is not much more complicated to use than udp

3366987
inline	inlining
if you are really interested in doing a test of function call overhead you should check the resultant assembly to ensure that the function really was or wasn t inline
i m not intimately familiar with vc++ but it may have a compiler-specific method of forcing or prohibiting the inlining of a function however the standard c++ inline keyword will not be it

3366987
inline	inlining
i m not intimately familiar with vc++ but it may have a compiler-specific method of forcing or prohibiting the inlining of a function however the standard c++ inline keyword will not be it
so i suppose the answer to the larger context of your investigation is don t worry about explicit inlining

3366987
inline	inlining
that s why the inline keyword is often entirely ignored
you should not worry about explicitly forcing or prohibiting inlining of a function unless you have a very specific need to do so as a result of profiling your program s execution and finding that a bottleneck could be solved by forcing an inline that the compiler has for some reason not done

3367081
awt	swing
it should always print out a thread name and you ll see the letters awt embedded in there somewhere
you could even store off that thread test against it on every call into swing and assert if it s not the same

3368322
jruby	mri
asking your clients to switch their deployment environment to jruby may not be feasible but if you can set up a service in java that speaks xml or json then they will be able to easily use it from rails
first i should mention that ruby on rails is simply ruby code and the same code can run in the jruby environment on the jvm or the mri written in c runtime

3368623
exponent	modulo
worked out on irc documenting it here for the rest of the world it s completely undocumented but crypt rsa key does have methods called n e and d that correspond to the modulo the public exponent and the private exponent
modulo bugs in the check function which is supposed to work if p and q are unavailable but n is but actually doesn t it s possible to create a working key with those methods

3370240
serializable	deserialization
about serializable of collection types see
what you mean is serializable and not deserialization

3370240
serializable	deserialization
what you mean is serializable and not deserialization
if you prepare a class for serializable applying the attribute to the class only the members of the class that has attribute will be serialized in some more complex cases the usage of can solve your problem

3375612
mongodb	bson
mongodb update i found great comparison of nosql databases
mongodb 3.2 written in c++ main point json document store license agpl drivers apache protocol custom binary bson master slave replication auto failover with replica sets sharding built-in queries are javascript expressions run arbitrary javascript functions server-side has geospatial indexing and queries multiple storage engines with different performance characteristics performance over features document validation journaling powerful aggregation framework on 32bit systems limited to 2.5gb text search integrated gridfs to store big data + metadata not actually an fs data center aware best used if you need dynamic queries

3378927
postgresql	mysql
because then you can make more complex logic than the database provides and it is also database independent i can move from mysql to postgresql and vice versa and it won t be if you are putting these things in the database
the logic depends on the database - mysql for example doesn t have recursive query support nor analytic functions

3379793
quicksort	heapsort
a reasonably written quicksort won t blow the stack anyway it ll sort the smaller partition first which limits stack depth to logarithmic growth
introsort goes a step further though -- to limit the worst case complexity if it sees that quicksort isn t working well too much recursion so it could have o n 2 complexity it ll switch to a heapsort which guarantees o n log 2 n complexity and limits stack usage as well

3381181
backgrounding	multitasking
xmpp will allow your iphone app to receive data even when in the backgrounding using the new multitasking features listening for a socket and i m pretty sure you should find ready to use servers for lamp or at least open source implementations
note that the ios4 multitasking api doesn t support polling in the backgrounding so your only other option should be push notifications

3385295
prepare	execute
sometimes prepare statements are not as effective as stored procedures especially when a sequence of operations need to be performed in the same transaction
when you have a business process that requires multiple selects updates and deletes to be execute against a variety of tables stored procedures are often better than a bunch of prepare statements execute one after the other

3388394
pascal	delphi
if your source code compiles on delphi 7 it will work as well with free pascal so cross-platform and 64 bits are open to you
delphi 7 runs well on my windows seven 64 bits system if you install it not in c program files but in c progs for example

3391202
yslow	pagespeed
3 hour expiry might not be enough time for the yslow pagespeed stuff and they might complain about it
i have seen this with static content on my sites with 4 hour expiration yslow havent tried with google s stuff

3396411
dictionary	map
shows a dictionary running 5-40 faster than a map in the very similar setting of counting the frequencies on ints as a function of the number of unique keys
in general purely functional data structures like map are not only extremely slow in the serial case but they destroy scalability of entire parallel programs

3397127
backtracking	greedy
in fact in some flavors you can do even better and use what is called possessive quantifier which doesn t backtracking at all
references regular-expressions.info repetition - an alternative to laziness negated character classes and possessive quantifiers example 2 from a to zz this example should be illustrative it shows how the greedy reluctant and negated character class patterns match differently given the same input

3399430
lisp	scheme
i own a copy of this book and it is really good for anyone interesting is lisp but maybe not your cup of tea
this is a comprehensive account of the semantics and the implementation of the whole lisp family of languages namely lisp scheme and related dialects

3401376
mktime	strtotime
you may use mktime to create your month
strtotime expects a date string not a single month

3401795
multiplying	division
this is common and is defined as such because when multiplying two integers a fraction will never occur
therefore a fraction-handling methodology is never assumed when multiplying integers but the same cannot be said for integer division

3412016
equals	compareto
but compareto gives the ordering of objects used typically in sorting objects in ascending or descending order while equals will only talk about the equality and say whether they are equals or not
compareto not only applies to strings but also any other object because takes a generic argument t

3412016
comparator	comparable
comparator not only applies to strings but also any other object because takes a generic argument t
string is one of the classes that has implemented the comparator method by implementing the comparable interface

3412331
serializable	deserialization
you can even serializable non-public members such as private or protected members
and you dont need a set on a property either however without a setter you can serializable but not deserialize is about 10 faster than xmlserializer to serializable the data because since you don t have full control over how it is serializable there is a lot that can be done to optimize the serialization deserialization process

3413343
innodb	myisam
error 1062 23000 duplicate entry 1-1 for key primary if you will be using the innodb storage engine it will also be wise to use foreign key constraints on the comment_id and user_id fields of the intersection table
however note that myisam the default storage engine in mysql does not enforce foreign key constraints these foreign keys guarantee that a row in comments_votes will never have a comment_id or user_id value that doesn t exist in the comments and users tables respectively

3414937
serializable	deserialization
the repository probably contains or manages a connection to the db and a connection is not serializable for good reasons
because on deserialization it would be complex and possibly unsecure to establish another connection

3415260
listview	gridview
we need a better listview the gridview is not suitable for a lookless interface though i appreciate what they original architects were trying to do by divorcing the itemspresenter from the presentation
many features of the gridview are hard-coded into the class

3415770
dictionary	map
if the table is static and the combination of search values is known you could combine both search search values into a hash and map that hash into the table using a dictionary with a list
if the search values are not known you could build a multi-level dictionary or dictionaries and use the same technique

3417411
junit	testng
for functional or end to end integration system whatever term you prefer testing testng offers a few features that junit doesn t have and that users have found very useful groups
once you have compiled your tests you can just ask testng to run all the front-end tests or fast slow database etc.

3418457
division	subtract
consider for example the case of 0 3 0 1 3 1 2 3 2 3 3 0 doing the division first as stephen canon and jonathan fischoff already told you will cause you to subtract 1 from these valid indexes causing the problem you saw
doing the division second is not much better it solves the problem of coming up with an index of -1 but you re still cutting off the last possible index 0 count - 1 2 0 1 2 1 2 2 0 3 2 1 notice how index 3 never comes up

3420912
comparator	comparable
if they re not comparable then you ll need to do something along the lines of these may be applied to a treemap as ordering extends comparator or a linkedhashmap after some sorting nb if you are going to use a treemap remember that if a comparison 0 then the item is already in the list which will happen if you have multiple values that compare the same
to alleviate this you could add your key to the comparator like so presuming that your keys and values are comparable apply natural ordering to the value mapped by the key and compound that with the natural ordering of the key note that this will still not work if your keys compare to 0 but this should be sufficient for most comparable items as hashcode equals and compareto are often in sync... see ordering.onresultof and functions.formap

3420912

implementation so now that we ve got a comparator that does what we want we need to get a result from it

3425016
subtract	addition
in some application an exception is appropriate in such cases in others the last day of the previous month is ok to use but that s truly crazy arithmetic when subtract a month then adding a month is not overall a no-operation
in others yet you ll want to keep in addition to the date some indication about the fact i m saying feb 28 but i really would want feb 30 if it existed so that adding or subtract another month to that can set things right again and the latter obviously requires a custom class holding a data plus s thing else

3430100
hex	binary
also nitpick the output of a hash function is not a hex string - that s just a common representation
the output of a hash function is some number of bytes of binary data

3430860
inline	inlining
the compiler is free to ignore the hint just as it s free to ignore the older register hint for a variable s storage class i believe nowadays most optimizing c++ compilers do ignore register but fewer ignore inline -- iow the compiler is free to inline all or some of the calls to a function whether that function is declared inline or not
of course it won t inline calls when they re done through an explicit pointer to the function that is stashed away at some points and used at others or when the function s address is passed as a parameter to some other function - but that might affect the inlining of specific calls not necessarily other calls to the same function that are done differently

3430860
inline	inlining

just in case your compiler takes your inline hints very earnestly it s often worth measuring code size and speed with and without inline around unless your compiler offers an option flag for the purpose just a #define inline will definitely disable the effect of inline and thereby allow such measurement

3433937
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
you ll probably really want to work with uinavigationcontroller and the push- and popviewcontroller methods. i hope this helped anyway. kind regards
in some scenarios where you are not using an uinavigationcontroller you can create a uinavigationbar yourself

3434544
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
it can also extends any subclass of runtimeexception illegalargumentexception or indexoutofboundsexception may be more appropriate in some cases
this will allow you to compile the code as you desire but note that the choice between choosing checked vs unchecked-exception should not be taken too lightly

3434732
jtextfield	jtable
jtextfield has a notifyaction named notify-field-accept and typically bound to keyevent.vk_enter that signals the celleditor to stopediting and ultimately invokes the defaulttreecelleditor method valueforpathchanged
it s not clear how you indicate that editing is complete for your jtable

3435959
google-chrome	firefox
here are little instructions set width of columns to width height height which you want have images to be images of same height set width of all images in table to 100 don t set height of images and here s changed code edit because it will not work in google-chrome set width of columns to width height height which you want have images to be images of same height
i ve fixed it and tested it with firefox

3436104
move	drag
another possibility would be to make a simple applescript droplet that uses a shell script to move the file you drag onto it to the path you want
paste the following code into script editor and save it as an application or application bundle doesn t matter which when you drag a file to the application you made it will move it to your directory

3438087
mvp	presenter
i m still experimenting with different mvp approaches myself but the way i m currently doing it is like so you say you want to avoid writing any code on the form itself but this doesn t make sense to me
in passive view you pass on all application-specific requests to the controller or presenter

3441872
client-side	server-side
instead you can use a normal client-side tag like this if getprofileimage doesn t return html tags make sure to escape it
you cannot use literals to set properties of server-side controls

3443785
gridview	checkboxlist
i wouldn t use a gridview for this at all
checkboxlist can lay out checkboxes in two columns automatically

3444902
implements	extends
the c language doesn t specify the implementation of various types so that it can be efficiently implements on as wide a variety of hardware as possible
this extends to the integer types too - the c standard integral types have minimum ranges eg

3447785
entity-relationship	diagram
classical entity-relationship modeling doesn t include foreign keys and the gist of your question revolves around how the foreign keys are going to work
i think that what you are really doing is relational modeling even though you are using entity-relationship diagram

3449064
calloc	malloc
calloc is initializing the memory before you use it but malloc does not
refer to this link the calloc function shall allocate unused space for an array of nelem elements each of whose size in bytes is elsize

3449073
calloc	malloc
since you typically would want to use and initialize the memory yourself this additional benefit of calloc may not be necessary
from malloc is faster since calloc initializes the allocated memory to contain all zeros

3449087
calloc	malloc
it just means that if you allocate memory with calloc whatever you allocate is 0
if you allocated space for an array of integers they d all be set to 0 whereas with malloc the memory there isn t initialized in any way

3452573
ssl	https
ssl tls mutual authentication is supported by both client and server but again the server side really supports it only when integrated with ad not a real option see configure client certificate mapping authentication
this is why i believe the only realistic options for an application that is not intended to be used over vpn in a corporate environment is to use basic or forms authentication over a secure channel https

3453835
cassini	iis
if this is the case then visual studio uses the internal cassini web server rather than iis
the cassini web server does not run classic asp

3453835
cassini	iis
the cassini web server does not run classic asp
iis does

3454414
octal	binary
for each of u g and o just replace each r w or x with a binary 1 and each - with a binary 0. the result is a binary number. that number cannot be larger than binary 111 which is equal to 7 in both decimal and octal
so you have one octal number for each of u g and o

3458525
google-chrome	firefox
i m working in a vaguely similar scenario and i mostly go for google-chrome s developer tools or sometimes safari developer tools that s far from perfect but at least something
however i often try to isolate out problems not directly tied to the interface and then go back and solve them with firefox firebug which i find the absolutely superior development environment

3461635
decimal	ieee
a double can at least represent 10 most significant decimal digits correctly
ieee 754 is not mandatory for representing floating point numbers

3462982
octal	binary
using a 0 on the start of the number when declaring it means it s octal so 0345 is actually 229 in decimal
i m not sure how you expect to add a zero to a number using bitwise operations which work on the binary representation of the number

3467818
opera	firefox
usually the tug-of-war is between safari and opera
firefox is not really that far behind but typically implements them as -moz- rules and is slow at converting to non -moz- rules

3468269
punctuation	words
since you have punctuation characters parentheses in your search string it is not as such a words
if you searched for a words consisting only of words characters then b would do what you expect

3469092
tabcontrol	tabitem
2 3 it should always appear at the end and it s not a tab so hopefully not part of tab cycling 4 well your tabcontrol should use a observablecollection of tabitem as itemssource to be notified when a new one is added removed some code the newtabbutton user-controls .cs file and the main window now we would need to find a way to let it always appear bottom right and also add the event and style for it the plus sign is there as a placeholder
define the controltemplate of the tabcontrol like this the upper row in the grid would be the tabpanel but you would put that into a stackpanel with a button following the tabpanel and style the button to look like a tab

3469105
alloca	malloc
it is really just another useful memory allocation function is alloca not in the c standard but widely available and similar functionality is available with variable length arrays in c99
it is great but works differently from malloc

3470560
nunit	mstest
i had to recreate the project as a test project and not merely a class library -- because i had started development with nunit and specflow i had created a vanilla class library to hold my specs that had the nunit attributes decorated
i thought i could simply change the app.config of this existing project to point at the mstest framework and stop using nunit but vs2010 never recognized the tests despite the correct creation of the stubs by specflow s custom tool

3472272
client-side	server-side
getting the username client-side in standard inbrowser silverlight app just isn t going to happen it would be a really bad thing security wise if it were possible
personally if i had this requirement i would probably use some web service wcf or a simple ihttphandler server-side

3472288
apache	nginx
if you need help installing certificates for your server try the links below apache nginx
rack isn t a webserver it s an interface between webservers like apache nginx and applications middleware

3475240
backgrounding	multitasking
however this method may be called in situations where the application is running in the backgrounding not suspended and the system needs to terminate it for some reason
you should use applicationdidenterbackground method if your app and os support multitasking

3475530
client-side	server-side
the fragment cannot be seen from the server-side it can only be accessed by client-side scripts
the way it s usually done is that the server-side generates a non-parameterized page which is then modified by scripts in accordance with the fragment parameters

3475585
equals	compareto
this looks like an equals method
if the intention simply is to compare if the two are the same i would do something like if it s not the intention you re probably breaking the contract of compareto since your method doesn t seem to adhere to the transitivity requirement

3475783
kerberos	ntlm
basically configure sharepoint to use kerberos in authentication provider in central administration create a spn for sharepoint on your application pool account with command line setspn create a spn for the website runnong on server b on the application account running this site configure delegation between the 2 yes kerberos is not that easy to put in place.
ntlm cannot delegate credentials to a remote server

3476022
client-side	server-side
you can extract fragment on client-side convert it and send to the server via ajax
watch this question and especially the answers jsp servlet anchor fragment cannot be seen on server-side

3476153
postgresql	mysql
looks like you re working on the wrong database no fk s or mysql with the wrong engine and or settings postgresql works fine when having a fk
postgresql doesn t accept corrupt data don t worry

3476153
postgresql	mysql
postgresql doesn t accept corrupt data don t worry
in mysql it all depends on the engine must be innodb and the connection settings for the parameter foreign_key_checks

3476826
realloc	malloc
if your running a custom allocator then its a little more situational eg i use a binary bin with a slab type system in which case realloc is simple
if you re already using malloc free why not just use realloc

3480169
inline	inlining
just adding a try catch block is unlikely to change the performance noticeably when exceptions aren t being thrown although it may prevent a method from being inline
different clr versions have different rules around inlining

3480385
ssl	https
answer found here short version is i added the following line to the ssl vhost in my nginx config proxy_set_header x_forwarded_proto https
detailed version is basically the issue came down to the nginx server not passing the fact that the source request was an https protocol on to the mongrel cluster

3483217
ubuntu	linux
if you learn to take these in your stride and accept you re learning and not failing an install of ubuntu and a desire to learn will do you better than any ubuntu tome
some might argue that learning specifically a distribution of linux is counter-intuitive to the whole linux mindset. i m afraid i can t answer your question specifically in terms of good guide resources but i ve found in my quest to learn something new a place to be able to ask questions is more important than an all-inclusive tome

3483882
client-side	server-side
server-side validation is a must because client-side validation does not ensure not-validated data will arrive in the server
client-side validation is not enough because its scope of action is very restrict

3484122
hex	binary
edit sadly it seems .net doesn t have a built-in method to convert to from hex strings but this subject has been covered before convert byte array to hex string and vice versa
well the iphone id looks like a hex string so converting both to binary and xoring the bytes ought to do it

postgresql	mysql
some dbmses such as sql server 2005 postgresql 8.4 and oracle 11g support recursive queries using common table expressions with the with keyword
this feature allows queries such as this to be written with ease but unfortunately mysql does not support recursive queries yet

3484471
webstorm	aptana
if you don t mind to pay a price i advice jetbrains webstorm
recently purchased a license myself it s not that expensive and am very happy with it. before i used eclipse and aptana but seriously webstorm is quality

3489586
spaces	delimiter
the spaces character is not valid in a class name
it s a delimiter

3489687
skip-lists	tree
not a skip-lists but seems to match the problem description clojure s persistent red-black tree see persistenttreemap.java
the source contains this notice these tree maintain the order of elements and are persistent in the sense in which rich hickey uses the word immutable and able to maintain their performance guarantees as updated versions are constructed

3490293
stateless	stateful
if you re already familiar with the http request lifecycle and have written web applications in a similar stateless fashion as you do with php you shouldn t have a big problem jumping right into using a framework
if you come from a stateful background or no background at all though the abstractions a framework offers can become a problem

3490527
sbt	scala-ide
finally as jackson davis reminds me in the comments sbt simple build tool also include some kind of incremental compilation through triggered execution even though it is not perfect and enhanced incremental compilation is in the work for the upcoming 0.9 sbt version
the latest revisions of scala-ide eclipse are much better atmanaging incremental compilation

3494586
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
the issue was that i needed to have a uinavigationcontroller connected to the tab bar item not a uiviewcontroller
the uiviewcontroller would then be the rootviewcontroller of the uinavigationcontroller which would then allow me to use the pushviewcontroller and popviewcontroller methods

3495077
postgresql	mysql
if you need to support mysql as well i d recommend to use the native auto increment type in each database serial for postgresql auto_increment for mysql identity for sql server sequence + trigger in oracle and so on and let the driver return the generated id value in jdbc there is a getgeneratedkeys method and i m sure other interfaces have something similar
that s what sequences were created for and which is supported by most databases mysql being the only one that does not have sequences - not 100 sure about informix though any algorithm that relies on the select max id anti-pattern is either dead-slow in a multi-user environment or will simply not work correctly in a multi-user environment

3496568
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
what you have to do is have a uiviewcontroller called loginviewcontroller as your root controller but this controller does not have a uitabbar it s just a controller with the login uiview
and also have your uitabbarcontroller with all of its content set but don t include the login just have your basic content

3496645
addition	multiplication
i m not sure if this actually answers your question but my understanding of the text you quoted simply says that the mandel function is just another function like multiplication min max addition etc that can appear in your genetic program
the mandel function like the multiplication function takes two arguments in_1 and in_2 and returns a single value

3497211
lisp	scheme
this isn t exactly for lisp but for scheme a lisp derivative but we used this free as in beer text in my programming languages class
here s the link sk publications books proglangs keep in mind however that they re teaching how to write a scheme interpreter in none other than scheme

3497882
vbscript	jscript
you want to sort an array classic vbscript asp does not offer that
so you got 4 options use jscript gather from .net convert the array to a dictionary and sort there or roll your own algorithm a.k.a

3498214
asterisk	ivr
in that configuration the call will be processed on the cloudvox asterisk servers and make calls to your adhearsion daemon to control the call
if you want to build your ivr quickly and easily you d be better off looking at something like tropo.com tropo s parent voxeo own adhearsion or twilio.com they ve done a lot of the grunt work for you and setting up asterisk is not for the faint hearted

3498689
vim	emacs
personally i use emacs but i ve seen folks who know vim really well and can honestly say it doesn t matter which you choose
i tried vim first but emacs ended up sticking for me

3501161
equals	compareto
so here you d write a that allows two flows that are not equals to compare to 0 by directional-insensitivity
difference between compare and compareto comparable and comparator contract with regards to null why does the java collections framework offer two different ways to sort

3502027
comparator	comparable
to fix create a comparator for class
when instantiating treeset without an explicit comparator it expects inserted elements to implement comparable but class does not implement this interface

3503896
client-side	server-side
what you can do instead is to leave on the user control and put it into a hidden wrapper div which can then be shown client-side
if you have set on the user control then you can t show it with client-side code because it is simply not rendered by the server-side it is not part of the resulting html page

3505063
jar	war
when you add jar in the web-inf folder they are packaged as part of your war file assuming using some build tool like ant and when your application is deployed or run it resolve dependencies using those jars
but when you add jar in the eclipse using add external jar it is just part of .classpath file for eclipse and resolve dependencies with in eclipse and doesn t get packaged

3507128
ssl	https
it s not difficult and ssl certificates aren t expensive startcom s free startssl certs might be sufficient for your purposes
if https is really too much work assuming you re using custom session-management code it s not too difficult to return a random mac key on login and sign future requests using the key and a sequence number to prevent replays

3513977
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
instead what you should do is have all the uiviewcontroller that appear in your uitabbarcontroller return yes for shouldautorotatetointerfaceorientation
if even one of them does not the uitabbarcontroller will not autorotate

3515077
google-chrome	firefox
you can see a much simpler version of the same thing here source code url if you view source with google-chrome the php code isn t displayed
if you do it with firefox it is

3515279
gif	png
after that you should have all the necessary frames any maybe more to create an animated gif via imagemagick this website makeagif.com or other app
side note if for some reason you need to output as gif of jpg instead of png just update as needed this to one of these support for output as gif or jpg may not be in all browsers should be most

3517513
viewdidload	viewdidappear
we ll now move on to the code for the viewdidload we load the stack of images into the mutable array then set the properties of our imageview with the image stack duration and repeat count
next in the viewdidappear we start the image view animating once the imageview is animating as an infinite loop we need to handle when leaving the view in the viewwilldisappear last which should be the second thing we add the .m file we cleanup in the mutable array in the dealloc this is how we handle it and works for us but then again we re normally not loading 4mb of images into memory to animate

3518236
queue	fifo
a queue is typically a fifo structure a stack is a lifo structure
i cannot off the top of my head envisage any simple combination of 2 fifo s that will yield a lifo though i simply may not have had enough coffee yet today

3518296
google-chrome	firefox
when your page is rendered you ll see your contentplaceholder inside a form element like so as a result when you clicked the button to show the simplemodal dialog the form was being submitted...at least it was with google-chrome
i didn t test it on firefox but ie8 was not re-submitting the form

3520111
setcontentview	findviewbyid
there are rules around this method you have two options to call it either you use it to query a view you already have in the layout you called in setcontentview or you use it on a view contained in a layout you inflated manually with a layout inflater if you try to use it in your activity to call a view from any other layout than the one in setcontentview that you have not inflated yourself it will return null
i think your issue is not the bytearray but the findviewbyid

3520318
typemock	moles
typemock can mock anything but isn t free
you could use microsoft moles to mock these out

3522471
queue	fifo
the javadoc clearly states this queue typically but do not necessarily order elements in a fifo fifo manner
among the exceptions are priority queue which order elements according to a supplied comparator or the elements natural ordering and lifo queue or stacks which order the elements lifo last-in-first-out

3524035
coalesce	isnull	coalesce	nvl
the return type for isnull matches the type of the first argument that is not true for coalesce at least on sql server.
coalesce is supported in both oracle and sql server and serves essentially the same function as nvl and isnull

3527546
postgresql	mysql
postgresql and oracle for that matter use objects called sequences for sequencial value generation
unlike mysql and sql server s approach to sequencial value generation sequences are not tied to the table

3527657
realloc	memmove
however should the macro method need resizing you need to realloc the whole chunk which may not exist contiguously
even worse the data is no longer in the right place to be accessed by the macro because the math has changed so you will need a series of expensive memmove s

3529775
awt	swing
swing awt windows being programatically created and not dispoed when no longer used
the native widgets behind awt don t live on the heap as well

3532044
hex	binary
all versions ignore higher-order bits byt convert 8 lsb s of argument into a byte getsi getui getsl getul each takes a byte array and an offset and returns the little-endian signed word unsigned word signed 32-bit word or unsigned 32-bit word at that offset putsi putui putsl putul takes a byte array offset and a value to put there in little-endian format hexarr converts a byte array or portion thereof into a hex string hextoarr converts a hex string to a byte array zap of t as idisposable takes a byref idisposable
if not nothing disposes it and sets it to nothing many of those are only useful when fiddling with binary data but none of them is really domain-specific

3533390
innodb	myisam
with anything from 100 s to 1000 s of concurrent read write requests think typical oltp usage innodb will out perform myisam hands down
it s not about other people s observations it s not about transactional acid support it s about the architecture of innodb which is far superior to that of the legacy myisam engine

3533390
innodb	myisam
it s not about other people s observations it s not about transactional acid support it s about the architecture of innodb which is far superior to that of the legacy myisam engine
for example innodb supports clustered primary key indexes

3533582
datamapper	activerecord
by the by datamapper and arel the query engine in rails 3 feature a lot of lazy loading - this means that code such as would most likely result in a join query that only did a count operation as the first line wouldn t result in a query being sent to the db
join queries are not bad in fact they are good and activerecord has them at its very heart

3536009
xna	slimdx
i m not familiar with opengl but i ve written a tile based engine in manageddx later ported to xna
manageddx is depricated but there s the slimdx project which is still under active development

3536969
udp	tcp
transport field is first sent in setup request 1 udp 2 tcp 3 rtp over rtsp and rtp over rtsp over http s as we can see transport type request is sent by client side
if you want to support tcp only server you can send 400 bad request or 461 unsupported transport in response to setup request as suggested by you or another way is to send 200 ok but do not transmit any rtp packets

3537722
multiplying	modulo	multiplying	division	multiplying	multiplication
after that i think you re just mopping up small cases meaning small numbers of values to multiplying divide although i m not sure without a few tests
on the plus side 1009 is prime so arithmetic modulo 1009 takes place in a field which means that after casting out multiples of 1009 from both top and bottom you can do the rest of the multiplication and division mod 1009 in any order

3539794
inline	inlining
in other words inlining large functions or functions that call other possibly inline functions is not a good idea
inline functions are oft overused and the consequences are significant

3540710
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
since you can t disable exception checking in the compiler the only way to do this is to use only runtimeexception and its subclasses
one observation that imo supports this view is that the conventional wisdom of use unchecked-exception only for programmer error is in fact mainly a rationalization of backwards-reasoning there is no code safety reason why the compiler should not force you to deal with programmer errors

3542431
inline	inlining
think of the inline keyword more of a suggestion than an instruction
assuming that the compiler doesn t calculate the whole thing at compile time inlining is not completely possible without other optimizations applied see edit below since it must have an actual function to call

3543855
persistent	transient
transient properties are properties that you define as part of the model but which are not saved to the persistent store as part of an entity instances s data
core data does track changes you make to transient properties so they are recorded for undo operations

3546914
activemq	rabbitmq
there is a comparison of the features and performance of rabbitmq activemq and qpid given at personally i have tried all the above three
rabbitmq is the best performance wise according to me but it does not have failover and recovery options

3547526
vb.net	vb6
you didn t mention whether or not you are making an asp.net web site or a different type of vb.net application but if you re building an asp.net web site this might be something to look at since you ll already be building a web site
use the vb6 vba script control in a com component and use com interop to communicate with the component in vb.net this is where it starts to get really complicated

3547961
gif	ico
since ico is vendor specific some choose to go with gif
not to mention that there is an abundance of .gif editors and few ico editors

3549227
super	self
finally this is very bad style if the super implementation of initwithcolor calls self init - which is often the case and even if not could change with future releases of cocos2d - it would call your implementation of init resulting in an endless loop stack overflow
to fix this simply either rename your init method or call super init and provide the parameters some other way usually there will be a property or setter method to do so

3549342
implements	extends
google maps api v3 doesn t implements the polyline.getbounds function though
so you can extends the polyline class to include a getbounds function polyline.getbounds on a line with only 2 points will contain the area to include this line

3549940
cpython	ironpython	cpython	pypy
cpython in particular as rawheiser s mention uses a global interpreter lock
other implementations pypy ironpython jython ... do not so they can use multiple cores effectively with a threading model while cpython requires multi-processing for the same purpose so you should not count on that if you want to write code that s portable throughout python implementations

3550347
mongoid	mongomapper
i also tried to use devise warden for authentication and it worked seamlessly in rails 3.0 but did not have support for rails 2.x + mongoid although mongomapper was supported
i personally used mongoid recently and it was working really good

3551614
spaces	delimiter
no spaces delimiter spaces delimiter
not having a spaces delimiter between attribute name and its value actually improves the readability as it visually shows the coupling between these

3552210
comparator	comparable
if you do use as a map key i d use a custom comparator that dereferences the pointers and compares the type_info objects themselves using the aforementioned before or hash_code for ordering
the fact that type_info is not less-than comparable isn t as much a problem for using it as a map key as the fact that type_info is non-copyable

3553255
onclick	onchange
the onclick handler is not consistently applied to tags cross browser
to get around this you could add an onchange handler to your and then check in that function if you should show or hide the address html javascript in the above i use the select s value as the css display style i want to apply however you could do whatever processing you wanted based on its value

3553522
super	implements
it is not super fast but reasonable
just for fun i implements one in bash

3554080
inline	inlining
most of the time you should just let the compiler determine when to inline the function for you
inlining is not magical or free

3554355
hex	binary
you could write it out as 1001010 etc but it s more common to show each byte at a time so x16 is just hex 16 the decimal byte 22
basically binary here is used to compare it with textual data not to say that it s actually base 2 in particular

3556714
client-side	server-side
to avoid loading jquery multiple times it might be best to use a client-side script like the one given here
in the server-side you can load jquery library in the page header during the page.init or page.load event protected sub page_init byval sender as object byval e as eventargs handles mybase.init page.header.controls.add ... end sub you may want to use a helper method to create the htmlgenericcontrol like public function headscriptresource byval src as string as htmlgenericcontrol dim include as new htmlgenericcontrol script include.attributes.add type text javascript include.attributes.add src src return include end function this way you can add any script to header using the source path as parameter page.header.controls.add headscriptresource resources shared scripts jquery jquery.min.js dnn 4.9.1 and above are shipped with jquery located in resources shared scripts jquery jquery.min.js if every server you need has web access which is not evident in corporate environments you can use hosted jquery for example with hosted jquery you have to use the https url if the site uses https

3557114
implements	extends
just by the way the reason why java does not implements full multiple inheritance is because it creates ambiguities
suppose you could say a extends b c and then both b and c have a function void f int

3563602
vaadin	wicket
again i can t say much for vaadin having never worked with it but if you re looking for architectures to start off with i d also recommend you have a look at gwt
i ve worked extensively with wicket but i ve not had any experience with vaadin so this might be a little biased

3563602
vaadin	wicket
i ve worked extensively with wicket but i ve not had any experience with vaadin so this might be a little biased
i d recommend wicket for obvious reasons but what s probably of interest to you is wickets openness

3565100
ssl	https
if your file is local to the server either make it a relative url like this or if it s not on the same domain use a protocol relative url like this this will switch between http and https as needed it ll be whatever the page is just make sure that other domain is setup to service with an ssl cert as well
some users have their browser set to exclude non-secure content you can t include a script from http on an https page and reliably have it work

3566735
wxpython	textctrl
here is a thread from the wxpython mailing list regarding the problem which may also be of interest to you
try calling the refresh method on the textctrl update a question has already been asked regarding this problem here is the answer which pretty much solves it -its not perfect but maybe you can improve on it.

3567650
bazaar	svn
if you decide to go mercurial - svn - bazaar using hg convert the help file says history on branches isn t preserved
according to the help for hg convert hg help convert it only converts to type of mercurial or svn bazaar is only supported as a source repository

3568407
jsf	seam
seam uses jsf so there isn t a lot of difference in protecting a jsf application and seam application from xss and csrf
most of the advice in those pages are bound to hold good in a jsf application

3568847
equals	gethashcode
if you want them to be the same you need to override gethashcode so it is based on your field and then you should remember to override equals also
the default implementation of gethashcode is based on the reference not the fields of the object

3569882
serializable	deserialization
the javadoc for the serializable interface has this to say about what happens if you don t declare a serialversionuid at all if a serializable class does not explicitly declare a serialversionuid then the serializable runtime will calculate a default serialversionuid value for that class based on various aspects of the class as described in the java tm object serializable specification
however it is strongly recommended that all serializable classes explicitly declare serialversionuid values since the default serialversionuid computation is highly sensitive to class details that may vary depending on compiler implementations and can thus result in unexpected invalidclassexceptions during deserialization

3570528
google-chrome	firefox
now google-chrome shows a little indicator area at the window top that shows the url but it s not really the complete location bar
in general you can never guarantee that the user won t see window features you ask to be hidden because some browsers firefox i know and maybe others allow the browser user to control what features can be disabled

3571442
awt	swing
jframe has a defaultcloseoperation int which can often replace the awt windowlistener
why a script changing awt to swing component names will not be sufficient

3571442
awt	swing
why a script changing awt to swing component names will not be sufficient
swing components must be constructed updated on the edt

3571442
awt	swing
this restriction does not apply to awt
components needed to be added to swing top level containers using getcontentpane .add scrolling is different between an awt textarea built-in swing jtextarea wrapped in a jscrollpane constructors may vary

3572747
emacs	textmate
emacs is a good example of this
but from what i have read the textmate plugin api is simply not powerful enough to do this

3573500
inline-functions	inlining
a good article explaining inline-functions in c99
you should add the static specifier to your inline function definition if the function is intended for use only in the same translation unit internal linkage if you omit static in the example above in debug configuration where no optimization is performed and no inlining is carried out the linker will exit with error complaining _add is referenced but symbol s not found

3573500
inline-functions	inlining
you should add the static specifier to your inline-functions definition if the function is intended for use only in the same translation unit internal linkage if you omit static in the example above in debug configuration where no optimization is performed and no inlining is carried out the linker will exit with error complaining _add is referenced but symbol s not found
in c99 an inline-functions declaration without any storage specifier will not generate an actual callable function body so the linker gives an error when it needs one

3573940
backgrounding	multitasking
the only thing you could do is create an app that protocols the time at which it has been sent to the backgrounding or became inactive because you r appdelegate will be notified - but that will happen on many occasions not only when a phone call is received
it won t work while the app is in the backgrounding on multitasking enabled devices alltogether

3574101
clutter	cairo
i must admit i ve never heard of clutter before probably because it s not a windows library and the majority of games developers work on windows platforms
similarly most game developers even indie hobbyist ones are not considering cairo or openframeworks either

3574721
webclient	httpwebrequest
if i m not mistaken webclient is capable of abstracting away multiple distinct requests in a single method call correctly handling 100 continue responses redirects and the like
i suspect that without using httpwebrequest and httpwebresponse a distinct status code may not be available

3575132
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
generally speaking when you add a uiviewcontroller to a uinavigationcontroller that viewcontroller is retained and you should release it
if you add a uiviewcontroller s view as a subview of another view that view is retained but not the viewcontroller

3578852
scrypt	md5
theoretically scrypt claims to improve upon bcrypt
building your own is not recommended but iterating md5 sha1 sha256 thousands of times ought to do the trick ie key strengthening

3579223
spaces	delimiter
in javascript get data mailto links + equates to a spaces
the plus sign is a reserved delimiter according to uri spec so it cannot or shouldn t be used in a file folder name in a url

3579609
udp	tcp
for udp i think it goes without saying that some way of reporting what has or has not been received is a must
lets assume you are using tcp

3584585
lisp	scheme
if that doesn t do it for you but you still want a lisp clojure is a lisp though neither scheme nor common lisp
it shares with scheme a single namespace for functions and variables however and i ve found it pretty comfortable in my short acquaintance with it

3585832
gif	png	gif	bmp
beware that some browsers may not support certain advanced features of these formats progressive display download in gif png and jpeg
so you should be able to do where the url specifies a bmp png jpeg gif animated gif etc

3587844
ienumerable	iqueryable
checklistbox.items only implements ienumerable not
you get the overload of asqueryable that returns iqueryable not the generic one

3589603
cassini	iis
other file extensions with the cassini web server may not work
if you were using iis you could configure file extensions to be processed through ssi.dll

3590228
consistency	acid
as it stands your data seems to be easily structured by the relational model and has a quite rigid schema so i don t see a need for a schemaless db mongodb couchdb riak... . usually stock quotes need to have strong consistency always be up to date so i don t see any point in a dynamo clone cassandra voldemort... . and unless you already have a tremendous amount of data and hit a wall in regards to processing speeds and resource usage i wouldn t go for a column based db hbase hypertable
tom financial data tends to have strict consistency and persistence requirements. at first glance and without further knowledge of your application i would expect you to need the acid properties of an rdbms as opposed to the base properties which usually define the nosql solutions

3592441
nsstring	nsobject
using to compare nsobject instances in this case nsstring instances is a pointer comparison since objective-c instances cannot be created on the stack
thus your code asks whether the nsstring instance employee.department.division is the same pointer same memory location as a static string

3592708
antialiasing	transparent
it can be related with antialiasing
antialiasing essence is that the more pixel is closer to the edge boundary of something the more pixel color is blended with background color or we can say that it is more transparent . so the problem may be that you need not only to replace source color to destination color but also pixels which were blended from source color to background color. to achieve this you need 1 run edge detection algorithm of some kind - it may be simple or advanced as you want

3598429
realloc	malloc
realloc doesn t take a pointer to a pointer as first parameter
it s supposed to be used like this if you want to handle out-of-memory conditions you would have to check if malloc or realloc returned null

3599400
jruby	mri
as far as you questions go jruby is just an other runtime like mri or rubinus since jruby is within the jvm using java is very easy but you can also use rjb from mri some gems are not compatible when they use native c libraries that do not run on jruby the jvm and your application container need startup time and some time to load your app but that is all there is no need for keep alive that is wrong you can use whatever you want most gems are updated to be compatible with jruby
afaik rails 3 is 100 compatible with jruby so there should be no problem on that path

3599693
subtraction	addition
while pointer subtraction is fine because it indicates memory distance which is often useful
the first thing that comes to mind is that it doesn t make sense to do pointer addition so it s not supported

3600804
firefox	safari
firefox gecko 1.0-3.6 1.2-1.9.2 -moz-background-clip padding | border 4.0 2.0 background-clip padding-box | border-box | content-box safari webkit 3.0 522 -webkit-background-clip padding | border | content see the mdc document here as to what you re trying to achieve i believe the content-box value is what you re looking for
note that firefox 3.6 and below do not appear to support this value

3602156
ssl	https
look at the action in this case a form s action is set to use https and the ssl handshake takes place before any data is sent so the connection is secure
whether or not the original form is displayed using https doesn t matter

3602188
factors	mean
what i meant to say is that if the application is more framework dependent than static content dependent the limiting factors would be the webserver - framework and i ve found negligible differences in the performance of nginx - uwsgi - pylons and apache2 mpm-worker - mod_wsgi - pylons as the limiting factors is pylons
this isn t to mean that pylons is slow

3602188
apache	nginx
nginx s static file performance is better than apache
apache mpm-worker is much faster than mod-prefork if mod_php isn t needed

3602581
xslt	xquery
anyway you asked for an xpath solution and current is not xpath. at this point i m going to agree with alejandro that it s impossible in pure standard xslt 1.0
if you specify the environment you re using xpath in xslt or javascript or xquery we can probably suggest an efficient way to get what you need

3602616
google-chrome	firefox
it works on google-chrome but fails on firefox
on google-chrome i am signed into facebook while on firefox i am not

3602819
prepare	execute
from the docs if you do not use mysqli_stmt_store_result and immediatley call this function after executing a prepare statement this function will usually return 0 as it has no way to know how many rows are in the result set as the result set is not saved in memory yet
mysqli_stmt_store_result saves the result set in memory thus you can immedietly use this function after you both execute the statement and save the result set

3603272
awt	swing
you use a swing tag but you also use a textarea text which is an awt component not a swing component
i would suggest that you do use swing and that you use a jtextarea

3605068
google-chrome	firefox
your html was invalid and google-chrome did not accept it
firefox was more lenient in what it allowed

3605194
jar	war
you can configure either up as much as you want but maven follows has defaults that almost everyone follows source in src main java tests in src test java resources necessary for running in src main resources language files spring config files resources necessary for running tests golden results config files in src main config eclipse is an ide and maven is a built build management tool case in point if you ask eclipse to build a jar war you have to manually tell it what to include and where
because you placed your files in maven s defaults you get things like jars wars contain the compiled java classes from src main java but not the ones from src test java config files from src main config don t go into the jar war kinda defeats the purpose of a config file if it did test resources from src test resources don t go into the jar war if you decide to build an assembly maven speak for a distribution of your code you can put on your website that includes documentation source binaries etc. it can make a jar the config files and javadocs into a zip file

lxml	celementtree	lxml	elementtree	libxml2	celementtree
also offered in the standard library since 2.5 lxml based on libxml2
offers a rich superset of the elementtree as well xpath css selectors and more here s an example of how to generate your example document using the in-stdlib celementtree i ve tested it and it works but i m assuming whitespace isn t significant

3611451
ssl	https
regarding the overhead of using ssl tls this article by google engineers should be of interest more specifically ssl tls is not computationally expensive any more
regarding the vulnerability i ve put examples in another answer it doesn t seem desirable to maintain session between http and https using the same cookie or url token

3611982
implements	extends
this would be a fast way for two programs on the same type of machine using the same cpu memory width to share trees or other graphs but is likely to be difficult to implements
the lisp-esqe version of this is super easy to implements but does not easily extends to things that aren t trees where there could be a cyclic reference or more than one parent for a particular node though it can be done

3611982
super	extends	implements	extends
the lisp-esqe version of this is super easy to implements but does not easily extends to things that aren t trees where there could be a cyclic reference or more than one parent for a particular node though it can be done
it also does not easily extends to handle storing more than one structure in a particular file

3613423
primes	modulus
primes are chosen to best distribute data among hash buckets
if the distribution of inputs is random and evenly spread then the choice of the hash code modulus does not matter

3613434
cpython	ironpython
update apparently there are projects underway to get support for some of the cpython stuff which in turn would help support numpy update 2 apparently you can use numpy with some other open source product update 3 official link to ironclad sorry i m not sure if this is of much help
i don t believe numpy is supported for ironpython unless it s changed since that update

3614260
asp.net-mvc	html.actionlink
static content links if you re linking directly to actual files not asp.net-mvc views than you can just statically write them down or use to make them more application root folder aware
so a certain static link with application root folder awareness would look like this asp.net-mvc views but if you re referring to views then you should simply provide controller and action names to your html.actionlink call

3615305
ssl	https
solution if you want ultimate security you need to use ssl https
it s not free you need to buy the ssl certificate first

3616437
memcpy	strcpy
it s not just checking for null it s ensuring that dest points to enough allocated memory to hold src it s checking the return value of fopen to make sure the file really did open successfully knowing when memcpy is safe and when memmove is required and so on
getting strcpy to check for null won t change the language paradigm

3618137
nunit	mstest
1 assume in junit and nunit i believe
i would not use a vanilla assert for that but rather assert.inconclusive mstest ¹

3620457
memcached	apc
if and only if your website has to live on different webservers loadbalancing you have to use memcached for distributed caching
if not just stick to apc and its cache

3621243
directx	gdi
the only good way to do that is to use a 3d api similar to how you re doing it now directx or opengl
any alternative gdi + or say directdraw will not use the full graphics hardware for accelerating blending and will have to perform it on the cpu greatly reducing performance

3627913
postgresql	mysql
some dbmses such as sql server 2005 postgresql 8.4 and oracle 11g support recursive queries using common table expressions with the with keyword
this feature allows queries such as this to be written with ease but unfortunately mysql does not support recursive queries yet

3627970
union	distinct
union all optimal performance comparison
union all will perform better than union when you re not concerned about eliminating duplicate records because you re avoiding an expensive distinct sort operation

3627970
union	distinct
union all will perform better than union when you re not concerned about eliminating duplicate records because you re avoiding an expensive distinct sort operation
see sql server difference between union vs

3628094
union	distinct
union without all will always perform the distinct check regardless of what the data actually is
it is better to use union all when you know you want all the result rows whether or not you know they ll be distinct or not

3628842
perforce	svn
the old stalwarts like tfs and perforce do allow this
but i d be curious why they need this feature just because someone has a modified copy of a file doesn t really mean anything in management terms branches can still be protected very effectively using repository security any task tracking system like trac or redmine will tell you who s doing what and integrate with svn perfectly

3630236
super	implements
edit super user has some discussion revealing that .ds_store does indeed store information about trashed files but no specifics about the format
i guess there really is no cross-platform solution provided by qt and it s not a totally trivial task to implements the trash concept in linux since it s slightly different based on which file manager is in use

3630273
serializable	deserialization
this is related to object serializable but i have not seen a single serializable framework my info is likely outdated which was capable of supporting several version of the same class
i personally did end up several times with the following serializable deserialization class hierarchy abstract reader interface very slim by definition utility classes implementing the reading and writing of the actual objects from to the streams fat highly reusable code was used for network transfers too versioned implementations of the reader interface relatively slim reuse the fat utility classes writer interface class i was always writing up-to-date version of the file

3631560
boost	allocator
malloc free memory lifetime management boost object_pool helps reduce both these costs at the costs of not being as general as malloc free
so as an example let s say we have a simple node like this so instead of allocator node with new i use boost object_pool

3631870
shadowing	named
so i m calling the result thelist an arbitrary anodyne just fine identifier not list shadowing a built-in
don t use as your identifier built-in named -- that s a horrible practice without any advantages and it will land you in some peculiar misbehavior eventually

3632636
fiddler	charles
i seem to remember previously using charles fiddler and wire shark for this as well
i m a big fan of fiddler and wire shark also but you already said these aren t working for you

3632807
domcontentloaded	onload
browsers give you two signals the page is ready for scripting domcontentloaded event and onload
if you need to read dimensions from the document or its elements you probably need to wait until all images and css are loaded wait for the onload event if not you can use domcontentloaded

3635081
apache	nginx
thus the apache child or thread cannot do anything useful
nginx worker on the other hand simply keeps this slow connection in epoll set of descriptors all the while processing other connections

3639370
bufferedreader	ioexception
as the bufferedreader documentation says public int read throws ioexception reads a single chars
returns the chars read as an integer in the range 0 to 65535 0x00-0xffff or -1 if the end of the stream has been reached so each call to the read method of bufferedreader actually consumes one or two bytes based on chars encoding from the input stream which is not what you want

3641030
udp	tcp
one simple approach that was used in the past but may or may not be used today would be to use udp instead of tcp
udp has lower overhead

3642966
gridview	repeater
if you want to do it though check out the following article real world gridview bulk editing i would recommend not using a gridview and using a repeater to show your data
then when you want to edit use a different page or a panel with a different repeater to display your edit controls

3642988
realloc	malloc
this won t work the realloc would likely cause a segmentation fault and assigning the new pointer to buffer isn t allowed by c
finally stealing from the other answers you need to to use malloc and friends

3645574
octal	decimal
09 is an illegal octal number since those numbers count from 0 to 7 and not to 9
so after 07 comes 010 which is 8 in the decimal system followed by 011 which is decimal 9

3645850
division	modulo
the increment could be done by a simple lookup table to avoid comparisons and branches testing for 3-divisibility is now comparing to 0 - which is significantly faster than integer division
two very simple optimizations you could really only store the value modulo 3 in the array and not the actual value

3648365
intersect	contains
if any edge of solid 1 intersect any face of solid 2 you have a collision
that s not quite comprehensive because there are case when one is is fully contains in the other which you can test by determining if the center of either is contains in the other

3651513
daemons	systemd
the reason a daemons crashes is the same any other program crashes attempting to read or write memory that is not allocated for reading or writing by that application segmentation fault or x86 specific general protection fault attempting to execute privileged or invalid instructions attempting to perform i o operations on hardware devices to which it does not have permission to access passing invalid arguments to systemd calls attempting to access other systemd resources to which the application does not have permission to access bus error attempting to execute machine instructions with bad arguments depending on cpu architecture divide by zero operations on denorms or nan values memory access to unaligned addresses etc
a daemons is just a long lasting forked process

3652447
jruby	rubinius
jruby itself is production-ready and it implements both ruby 1.8.7 and ruby 1.9.2 but the ruby 1.9.2 implementation is not yet complete
ironruby and rubinius are also working on implementations of ruby 1.9.2

3652535
innodb	myisam
i m facing exactly the same problem and i do not want to use myisam tables for my system because of the peace of mind given by innodb tables
so what i m planning to do with my problem is to create an index table using myisam so i can have only the information to be indexed on it

3654581
ssl	https
ssl is meant to protect data in transit it does nothing to protect you and your customers from web servers and their administrators that you may not trust
secure login there is also a performance hit normally when using ssl so some sites will configure their pages to only use https when the user is sending sensitive information for example their password or credit card details etc

3654782
dictionary	map
dictionary is actually a hash table rather than a b-tree
but then map isn t defined to be a b-tree so it doesn t let you do things like detaching sub-trees as a new map it just has the same performance complexities

3656085
apache	lighttpd
lighttpd doesn t support .htaccess files like apache does
that s where the light in lighttpd comes into play

3656085
apache	lighttpd
you can however migrate these rules from apache s mod_rewrite to lighttpd s mod_rewrite
but be aware that the nc flag case-insensitive matching is not supported by lighttpd s mod_rewrite

3658663
richtextbox	textblock
you can use a richtextbox in which case this technique will work but you will need to use passwordsendmessage.document.contentend and passwordsendmessage.document.contentstart instead of passwordsendmessage.contentend and passwordsendmessage.contentstart
instead of setting the property on the entire textblock create a textrange for the last six characters and apply the formatting to that if passwordsendmessage is a textbox rather than a textblock then you cannot use rich text like this

3660461
innodb	myisam
also interesting read for you count vs count col performance count for innodb tables performance
if you re using myisam tables it does not hit performance

3661558
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i was accessing a child of the uinavigationcontroller and not the root uiview. i assigned the code above to the viewwillappear to the root uiviewcontroller of my uinavigationcontroller and it worked
so to show it only on my sub uiviewcontroller i had to set to all the uiviewcontrollers that i do not want the toolbar to be visible on

3662752
postgresql	mysql
some dbmses such as sql server 2005 postgresql 8.4 and oracle 11g support recursive queries using common table expressions with the with keyword also see quassnoi s comment below
this feature allows queries such as this to be written with ease but as omg ponies mentioned in a comment above mysql does not support recursive queries yet

3663012
rsa	dsa
the reason this edge case might turn out to be your problem is due to the default behavior of the keytool utility when generating secret keypairs - dsa and not rsa is the default algorithm
adding to erickson s answer if your certificate does not use a rsa key-pair and instead turns out to use a dsa key-pair then no amount of rsa cipher suite stuffing will aid in resolving this issue

3663012
rsa	dsa
adding to erickson s answer if your certificate does not use a rsa key-pair and instead turns out to use a dsa key-pair then no amount of rsa cipher suite stuffing will aid in resolving this issue
you ll need to enable the dsa related cipher suites they re usually indicated by the dss keyword in them and also have the client utilize the same cipher suites

3663930
draggable	droppable
there are some wtfs along the way mostly to do with weird behaviour of dragging dropping in ie 7 8 and some weirdness around snap to grid behaviour in jquery ui s draggable but i think it would take longer if i just took an existing control and tried to customise it
as it turned out writing my own calendar based on jquery s draggable droppable ui component is not that hard and is way more flexible and extensible

3664464
division	multiplication
it seems to me that all of denominators of the division operations are constants width height max... and these will not change throughout the course of the image
if my guess is right then these are simple variables that can change based on the image loaded so that any size image can be used at runtime now this allows for any image size to be loaded but this also means the compiler cannot optimize them into the much simpler multiplication operation which it could do if they were declared const

3666241
dictionary	map
implementing it as a dictionary in my mind isn t implementing a trie - that s implementing a dictionary of dictionary
when i ve implemented a trie i ve done it the same way as suggested by damien_the_unbeliever +1 there this ideally requires then that your trie will only support a limited subset of characters indicated by no_of_chars and that you can map input characters to output indices

3667392
icmp	udp	icmp	tcp
the port concept belongs to the transport layer of the protocol stack either tcp or udp while the ping is at the lower network layer the icmp protocol
you cannot ping a port but you can try to connect to a specific port using either tcp ip or udp

3669982
gridview	datalist
from this question the accepted answer deals with a gridview
unfortunately the datalist doesn t function the same

3670866
allocator	stl
you could also experiment with writing a custom allocator for the stl containers although it seems that that sort of work is generally advised against
i ve done it before and it was tedious but i don t remember any specific problems. mind- writing your own memory allocator is not for the faint of heart

3671312
ssl	https
archived copy of another related bug is bug #41631 - default_socket_timeout does not work with ssl the code mentioned in the blog post has undergone some changes and can be found in it s latest form with support of http authentication here on github soapclienttimeout.class.php in any case the workaround shouldn t be needed any longer as this problem has been fixed in the php soapclient extension
looks like default_socket_timeout is not taken into account when making soap calls over https bug #48524 - timeout setting is not considered on soap+https calls

3671745
hex	binary
writing sample code a quick cl ehsc foo.c later and you get 0x666f6f 0x0d0a 0x626172 separated for convenience in foo.txt under a hex editor
it s important to note that this translation does not occur if you are writing to a file in binary mode

3671944
multiplying	division
if you want accuracy two a fixed number of decimal points multiplying by 100 for 2 decimal points then round it and divide it by 100
so long as the number isn t obscenely large occupies more than i think 57 bits then you should be fine and not have any rounding problems on the division back down

3672066
rsa	aes
you can encrypt an rsa public key using aes encryption if you wish but it is unnecessary as it is not something you need to keep secret
you can encrypt an rsa private key using aes encryption

3672347
serializable	deserialization
note that maybe you could serializable using some tricky code like finding the size of the elements contained in the any but the any code relies on the compiler statically putting the any type_code and the proper types inside the placeholder
you surely cannot do that in deserialization in c++ as the type that you d get from the deserialization is not known at compile time as required by the newly formed boost any

3672449
postgresql	mysql
if you re looking for a reason to switch to postgresql sunoracle bought mysql isn t a good one
mysql is going to be around for a while

3675060
postgresql	mysql
consider parameterised queries especially as with the postgresql module you get pg_query_params which makes it really easy
insert into advertiser_regidetdir backticks are a mysql quoting feature that is not part of standard ansi sql and not available in other databases

3675486
rdf	owl
rdf reification just makes the things always more complicated
as you commented it will inflate your ontology but not just that it ll also make your ontology very difficult for applying owl reasoning

3677028
updatepanel	scriptmanager
but remember to keep your fileupload control outside the updatepanel otherwise the fileupload will not work
here s a quick workaround you can use add a scriptmanager to your page

3677717
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
well i updated my google-chrome to the latest version and this code is all it takes to display my custom font in ie firefox and google-chrome
i ve not tested in safari yet

3679179
onchange	onblur
i tested to see if the reset would fire an onchange event for the inputs whose values are reset but it does not appear to
a workaround for doing something after resetting might be to set a flag on reset and then use the onblur event of the reset button so after you reset it would run the next time you click on something else

3679552
bash	zsh
in bash and likely ksh zsh you could just use ...
here s a solution that doesn t shell out to bc and uses only portable standard syntax nothing bash zsh or ksh specific or somewhat more simply you need the to be portable

3680381
client-side	server-side
when rendered into html the web control turns its server-side id value into a client-side id attribute
ideally there would be a one-to-one correspondence between the value of the server-side id property and the generated client-side id but in reality things aren t so simple

3680381
client-side	server-side
ideally there would be a one-to-one correspondence between the value of the server-side id property and the generated client-side id but in reality things aren t so simple
by default the rendered client-side id is formed by taking the web control s id property and prefixed it with the id properties of its naming containers

3680381
client-side	server-side
in short a web control with an id of txtname can get rendered into an html element with a client-side id like ctl00_maincontent_txtname
this default translation from the server-side id property value to the rendered client-side id attribute can introduce challenges when trying to access an html element via javascript which is typically done by id as the page developer building the web page and writing the javascript does not know what the id value of the rendered web control will be at design time

3680381
client-side	server-side
this default translation from the server-side id property value to the rendered client-side id attribute can introduce challenges when trying to access an html element via javascript which is typically done by id as the page developer building the web page and writing the javascript does not know what the id value of the rendered web control will be at design time
the web control s client-side id value can be determined at runtime via the web control s clientid property

3681009
allocator	stl
if you re not careful it is easy to introduce all sorts of inefficiencies virtual function calls cache misses excessive memory allocator unnecessary copying of objects all of this can cripple the performance of c++ code if you re not careful
with care you can write code that s about as efficient as the stl

3681075
fgets	fread
you should be using fread instead of fgets
also when calling send you need to specify only the number of bytes that fgets fread actually return do not send the entire buffer unless the entire buffer was actually filled in

3681472
apache-poi	docx4j
if you are processing spreadsheets only ie not docx or pptx and preceding paragraph is not a concern for you then you would probably be best off using apache-poi
docx4j now covers xlsx as well

3685360
vbscript	vba
it is possible to do you ll need to reference microsoft vbscript regular expressions 5.5 in your vba project then.
this is obviously just a really simple example as i m not very knowledgable of regexp it s more just to show you how it can be done in vba you d probably also want to do something more useful than debug.print with the resulting tokens

3686559
comm	grep
here s an even better way to write that conditional by using ps -e -o comm you avoid having to do the silly grep -v grep thing because only the actual process name appears in the ps output not the arguments
and grep -cfi counts up the matches and gives you a number so you don t have to deal with the exit status of a pipeline

3687615
directx	gdi
in theory you can intermix gdi with opengl or directx if and only if the opengl directx is set up to use single buffering not double buffering
that however is little more than a theoretical possibility because virtually all use of directx and opengl is with double buffering

3688951
opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
firefox google-chrome and opera all committed to supporting webm
microsoft and apple have not yet embraced it though microsoft has said they will support vp8 video when the user has installed a vp8 codec. this sounds like a situation similar to that of safari

3690060
google-chrome	safari
same here people this works perfect btw in google-chrome stable dev and canary just not in firefox and safari
it also works perfect on my iphone and ipad safari

3691262
factors	mean
theres a few factors in the pro s and cons of validation the most important con of validation is speed as keeping your documents valid usually uses more elements it makes your pages slightly larger
companies like google do not validate because of there mission statments in being the fastest search engine in the world but just because they don t validate don t mean they do not encourage it

3692155
google-chrome	firefox
alas google-chrome while based on webkit and seemingly supporting the proper css attributes will not apply perspective transformations
they will be supported at some point on firefox no clue about ie

3694393
super	self
new-style classes are derived from object and are what you are using and invoke their base class through super class x object def __init__ self x pass def doit self bar pass class y x def __init__ self super y self .__init__ 123 def doit self foo return super y self .doit foo because python knows about old- and new-style classes there are different ways to invoke a base method which is why you ve found multiple ways of doing so
for completeness sake old-style classes call base methods explicitly using the base class def doit self foo return x.doit self foo but since you shouldn t be using old-style anymore i wouldn t care about this too much

3695374
strcpy	malloc
the call to strcpy will try to write a 0 to memory that does not belong to test1 hence ub
undefined behaviour in 2 if the call to malloc fails to reserve the requested memory test1 will be assigned null

3695838
dictionary	map
python provides hash-based sets dictionary so i use those
c++03 provides set and map but not unordered_set and unordered_map so i use those

3696143
boost	allocator
personally i would go for the one parse scheme trying to keep the allocator down using boost variant and the strategy pattern as much i could
well i ll add my own answer as well not that i know or have coded such a library but to answer to the keep the memory allocator down bit

3699352
backtracking	greedy
on the .net engine with greedy backtracking + while the pattern was originally written with the necessity for possessive quantifier in mind in fact a backtracking repetition will still yield the correct answer assuming the engine isn t buggy like java s
here s a c# implementation on the .net engine see also on ideone.com as you can see the output is correct even with a backtracking + loop

3699826
pdcurses	ncurses
that would be based on a very simple framework which writes directly to the video to draw the underlying shadows drop down menus etc not alone that since edit.com would be written in assembler for speed in relation to drawing this is quite ancient by today s standards you can however take a look at pdcurses which will enable you to do this kind of thing
the neat beauty is pdcurses is compatible with the unix equivalent of ncurses

3700187
ienumerable	ilist
edit the other method with the predicate which i now see you are talking about is not as optimised and relies on the ienumerable interface to perform a foreach rather than ilist
i looked in reflector it tries to do it with a list if the collection can be cast as ilist and implements the count property

3701196
onclick	onchange
onclick doesn t work well in all browsers
bind a javascript function to the onchange event that changes the url of the a element or redirect to the correct url if you want to change it instantly

3701215
memcpy	memmove
in summary this means if you can guarantee the regions are not overlapped then selecting memcpy over memmove avoids a branch
if the source and destination contain corresponding page aligned and page sized regions and don t overlap some architectures can employ hardware accelerated copies for those regions regardless of whether you called memmove or memcpy

3704402
division	subtraction
performance testing - intel x86_64 core 2 duo 3.06 ghz macos x 10.6.4 this platform is probably not representative of your microcontroller but the test shows that on this platform the subtraction is considerably slower than the division
compiling with gcc 4.5.1 and working in 32-bit the average timings were optimization -o 0.13 seconds using division 0.65 seconds using subtraction compiling and working in 64-bit the average timings were 0.13 seconds using division 0.48 seconds using subtraction clearly on this machine using subtraction is not a winning proposition

3708080
content-length	content-type
any content-length greater than or equal to zero is a valid value. section 4.4 describes how to determine the length of a message-body if a content-length is not given
note that the meaning of this field is significantly different from the corresponding definition in mime where it is an optional field used within the message external-body content-type

3708443
onclick	onchange	onclick	onfocus
also i don t think onclick will be fired if a user tabs onto the checkbox which may or not be how you intend it to work
try using a different event such as onchange or onfocus to see if that solves it

3708538
updatepanel	scriptmanager
you are probably setting the style in js in the onload event but this event is only fired once and then in every postback the updatepanel does not pass through it
you have to attach to the pagerequestmanager pageloaded event like this after the scriptmanager declaration you write this code and the script will run each time you do a postback inside

3709664
google-chrome	firefox
doesn t work in google-chrome
in firefox you can hook the mousemove event

3710960
serializable	deserialization
wcf serializable entity to wire format and deserializes the entity on the other side
deserialization process needs to know what type have to be deserialized - such information is not part of serialized data

3711301
apache	nginx
your app will be the bottleneck in performance not apache or paste
nginx is used in lots of production servers so that bit will be fine

3711956
ssl	https
one other note..the package you ve referenced does not appear to include ssl support - so you will not be able to deal with https urls using that library
grab one of the ssl packages if you need to support https

3712777
profiling	instrumentation
the downside of a sampling profiling is that the result is not as detailed as with an instrumenting profiling
check the documentation for your profiling if you can run with sampling instead of instrumentation

3712946
vbscript	jscript
but i guess qtp cannot run two scripts in parallel so you ll probably need an external shell script written in vbscript jscript powershell etc
edit try the following create an external vbscript file .vbs with the following contents this script calls wshshell.appactivate to activate a window whose title contains open replace it with the actual dialog title

3713147
ssl	https
this is not an ideal situation i m not sure how to use a custom sslcontext sslsocketfactory in axis 2. alternatively according to this axis 2 document it looks like axis 2 uses apache http client 3.x if you want to perform ssl client authentication 2-way ssl you may use the protocol.registerprotocol feature of httpclient
you can overwrite the https protocol or use a different protocol for your ssl client authentication communications if you don t want to mess with regular https

3713983
vim	emacs
as far as i know viper mode is an emulation of common vim functionality in emacs
it is not an implementation of vim

3714060
bash	zsh
a bash ksh and zsh support compound conditional ternary operators bash doesn t do floats though php s ternary operator syntax is similar
form support this style showing bash s version which can be done in a compound form

3716598
rtp	rtcp
you should add a new participant when an unknown ssrc is received -- only after verifying it as per section section 6.2.1 you can t use the packet s source ip port as the destination of packets for that participant -- it is saying that you cant expect that endpoint a s rtp rtcp pair is same as endpoint b s pair unless specified though
in section 11 rfc is not talking about ip address. sdp doesn t define the ssrc that will be used by each of the rtp participants -- yes as ssrc can be changed on the fly

3718665
cassini	iis
i think the issue is with the use of cassini built in to vs.net to debug
cassini doesn t support authentication like iis does

equals	gethashcode
distinct doesn t just use equals
it uses gethashcode as well

3720662
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
for google-chrome its upgrade cycle makes it very unlikely
not sure how safari and opera compare but they definitively don t have massive market share so they really have no chance of becoming ie6-like i am not considering the mobile world . as for firefox it also includes free and simple upgrades making me think that firefox users will upgrade soon enough to the new version when it becomes available

3720771
opera	firefox
note that webkit and opera do not support the exact same features - webkit has a bit more presentational css available to it but for the most part they have similar features available
bottom line keep your javascript lean and clean and keep your html and css limited to what would normally work between webkit and opera and to a lesser extent firefox

3721549
g++	gcc
you need to compile with g++ not gcc
when you compile with g++ it automatically links in the c++ runtime libraries

g++	gcc
when you compile with g++ it automatically links in the c++ runtime libraries
when you compile with gcc it does not

matplotlib	colormap
for what it s worth you re slightly misunderstanding what imshow returns and how matplotlib axes are structured in general.
an axesimage object is responsible for the image displayed colormap data etc but not the axis that the image resides in

3721949
dns	spf
dkim stands for domain keys and is a dns entry containing an encryption key for authorising your domain as a sender
it ll look something like below although i m not sure if google have implemented it spf is sender protection framework and entails adding to your dns a txt record that authorises other servers to send mail on behalf of your domain

3721949
dns	spf
it ll look something like below although i m not sure if google have implemented it spf is sender protection framework and entails adding to your dns a txt record that authorises other servers to send mail on behalf of your domain
an spf for google will look something like both of these will massively help reduce your spam score which you can measure with tools like litmusapp.com

3722463
implements	extends
abstract classes cannot be instantiated but they can contain both implements and abstract empty functions
note that a class can only extends a single parent class or abstract class but it can implement as many interfaces as it needs

3722613
memcached	apc
depending on your exact needs this could be as simple as a text file or as complex as a relational database nosql database or other key-value store like memcached
it s not possible using apc s data cache

3722987
viewdidload	viewwillappear
i found viewcontrollers was not nil where i was calling popviewcontrolleranimated and from there experiment showed i could get the title i was after in viewwillappear . so viewwillappear seems to be a reliable place to touch self.navigationcontroller while viewdidload is not
this is one of those things where viewdidload is the wrong place to do it - after comparing various view controllers and finding no real difference in how they were invoked yet had nil viewcontrollers while others didn t it struck me that if it was really nil popviewcontrolleranimated shouldn t work either

3723486
jar	manifest.mf
add the target like as follows in the build.xml file code to access such resources the code needed to access such resource files shall be as follows this will not work in design time but surely from the jar file note the files manifest.mf and build.xml located in the root directory of the project are accessible from the files panel in netbeans ide
adding resource folder to classpath when you clean- -build a netbeans ant based project it creates a manifest.mf file in the root directory of the project

3724850
vim	textmate	vim	emacs	emacs	textmate
actually most functionality of both editors can be replicated in vim and i m sure in emacs too
i m really surprised no on has mentioned these two yet textmate mac e text editor windows it recently gained vim features but i wouldn t call it innovative

3725587
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari
will not return a thing since you re not in a function opera ie and firefox are right to throw an error because this code is really not valid since you re not able to return unless you are in a function
if it works in safari and google-chrome it must be because the javascript engine they use is ready to handle buggy code

3725925
lisp	scheme
don t forget that lisp is not one language there are diffrent kind of lisp dialects
scheme common lisp or clojure and all have diffrent focuses

3726526
prepare	execute
for emulated prepare statements there is no check in prepare emulated prepare statements does not communicate with the database server so pdo prepare does not check the statement
but there will be one in execute when the query gets sent to the server

3726590
nginx	lighttpd
i actually found the setup of nginx much easier than lighttpd not to mention that you can install a macport of nginx port install nginx +ssl that does not contain the ssl-breaking bug that lighttpd suffers from here
for what it s worth i did eventually end up jumping ship to nginx and everything seems to work fine so my suspicion that it was lighttpd s fault rather than a buggy fcgi impl in django seems to have been well-founded

3730040
multiplying	multiplication
as an analogy to the 0.333333 example if you take the floating-point value for 0.1 and you multiplying it by 10 you won t get 1
representing money as a double or float will probably look good at first as the software rounds off the tiny errors but as you perform more additions subtractions multiplication and divisions on inexact numbers errors will compound and you ll end up with values that are visibly not accurate

3731639
apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx
the main problem with this solution is that it need to be allowed by the web server and either isn t installed by default apache isn t active by default lighttpd or need a specific configuration nginx
apache under apache if you use mod_php you need to install a module called mod_xsendfile then configure it either in apache config or .htaccess if you allow it xsendfile on xsendfilepath home www example.com htdocs files with this module the file path could either be absolute or relative to the specified xsendfilepath

3732071
ssl	https
make sure ssl is enabled for your server
i got this error when trying to use a https configuration file on my local box which doesn t have that certificate

3732628
postgresql	mysql
some dbmses such as sql server 2005 postgresql 8.4 and oracle 11g r2 support recursive queries using common table expressions with the with keyword also see omg ponies comment below
this feature allows queries such as this to be implemented easily but unfortunately mysql does not support recursive queries yet

3732874
lxml	elementtree
as i understand it in prototype searches and returns an element that has a particular id in which case could be translated in xpath to like so i think the python standard library includes support for a subset of xpath in elementtree too so you might be able to implement that there somehow if you do not wish to install lxml which isn t included in stdlib .
python has lxml which has the xpath method wherein you could use xpath expressions to select elements

3734460
onclick	onsubmit
without the behavior it s an onclick call to postback through javascript...but this is actually harder to deal with on the client when you want your own javascript
for example if i m adding an onsubmit handler to the this is much easier more straightforward when the natural submit behavior from a button is happening it s also easier with any js library tying in your functions in the right order when not set server-side when it renders is much easier when there is no client-side onclick interfering

3734460
onclick	onsubmit

you can tie into event bubbling the onsubmit set onclick events yourself to prevent any default behavior etc...just easier to deal with all around

3735726
super	self
to understand this behaviour you have to understand that super calls not the base class but searches the next matching method along the order in the __mro__
so the call super a self .__init__ looks at the sees b as the next class with a matching method and calls the method constructor of b

3735918
mvp	presenter
secondly an application designed using mvp lends itself easily to unit testing since it is very difficult to test a form
with this in mind then you realize that view-centric objects like grid should not be manipulated in the presenter layer since when the view changes the controls are also likely to change

3736269
mp3	wav
the trick is to get the decoded audio from the mp3 - if they re just short hello sounds i d store them inside the app as a wav instead of decoding them though i ve never used coreaudio or any of the other frameworks before so mp3 decoding into memory might be easy
when you ve got your reference wav and your recorded wav follow the steps in the post above 1 do whatever is necessary to convert .wav files to their discrete- time signals 2 time-warping might or might not be necessary depending on difference between two sample rates 3 after time warping truncate both signals so that their durations are equivalent

3740137
firefox	safari
as for why it only occurs in firefox i m not entirely sure
on my osx machine safari and chrome don t exhibit this behavior with flash objects

3740254
clang	llvm
my recommendation is to use clang + llvm llvm compiler 1.5 if you can for faster build times more performant applications and much better compiler errors
if you use c++ code or something else that the clang parser cannot handle right now use llvm gcc to still get the performance benefits in your compiled application

3741079
consistency	acid
as an example of what acid might mean when a printer is involved in a transaction atomicity an entire document gets printed or nothing at all consistency at end-of-transaction the paper feed is positioned at top-of-page isolation no two documents get mixed up while printing durability the printer can guarantee that it was not printing with empty cartridges
acid are desirable properties of any transaction processing engine

3743807
postgresql	mysql
considering your points i m familiar with the dbms setting up a postgis database on windows is easy using pgadmin3 management is straight-forward too it does well with gis queries postgis is definitely strongest of the three only oracle spatial would be comparable but is disqualified if you consider its costs low cost +1 for postgis for sure not antagonistic with microsoft .net framework you should at least be able to connect via odbc see postgresql wiki compatible with r shouldn t be a problem with any of the three
if you are interested in a thorough comparison i recommend cross compare sql server 2008 spatial postgresql postgis 1.3-1.4 mysql 5-6 and or compare sql server 2008 r2 oracle 11g r2 postgresql postgis 1.5 spatial features by boston gis

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	webkit	gecko
tested good firefox 3.6.8 and seamonkey 2.0.7 webkit safari 4+ google-chrome 3+ etc
tested working on safari 4 on osx safari 5 on winxp google-chrome 5.0.375.127 stable channel midori 0.2.7 the new flock epiphany 2.30.2 luakit and uzbl untested but should be fully supported fluid webkit-based macos alternative to mozilla prism and google-chrome s create application shortcuts... limited support in internet explorer 8 microsoft implemented an xdomainrequest object instead and using security as an excuse didn t implement the flag to pass credentials and cookies with the request sleipnir support is determined by which version of mshtml it s embedding notably unsupported opera as of 11.01.1190 no support whatsoever camino as of 2.0.5 still based on gecko 1.9.0 firefox 3.0 arora as of 0.10.2 inherits webkit s cors api but has a bug that causes requests to fail old mozilla-based flock based on gecko 1.9.0 firefox 3.0 it s not a complete list but it s every browser with userscript support i could find to test

3745138
udp	tcp
udp is a lightweight protocol that by design doesn t handle things like packet sequencing
tcp is a better choice if you want robust packet delivery and sequencing

3745203
udp	tcp
udp does not guarantee that your packets will arrive in order
it does not even guarantee that your packets will arrive at all. if you need that level of robustness you are better off with tcp

3745374
uiview	subviews
i ve seen many other posts floating around where this seemed to be a major point of confusion for some folks. during my research however i did notice that there does not seem to be any sort of event message notification or otherwise when a uiview gets resized whether automatically or not
while not necessary for resizing subviews it would be nice to know when it s happening in the situation where you would like to cause a scrollview or tableview to scroll should it s frame size ever change

3745830
super	extends
this only mimics multiple inherited because it essentially uses a for-loop to iterate over the properties of the other objects and attaches them to the targeted one -- if it actually provided multiple inherited you would be able to add remove modify attributes from one of the super objects and have the changes inherited by the sub object but that isn t the case
to use jquery.extend you provide the target object as the first parameter and the others with which to extends it as following parameters

3748523
qabstractitemmodel	qstandarditemmodel
if not you would probably subclass that instead of qabstractitemmodel
if you are representing a tree of qobject then qstandarditemmodel will probably suit your needs

3749029
google-chrome	firefox
go to sambro.is-super-awesome.com videofirstframe you need to open this in google-chrome
firefox doesn t support mp4 i think

3749063
move	drag
safe git stash + git checkout -m since you really only want to move a subset of the changes back to safe branch it may be better to focus on just those changes
one method is to use git stash to temporarily save your current changes so you do not have to drag all of them back to the safe branch and later drag some most of them back to your working branch

3750895
codeigniter	cakephp
as far as beginners are concerned documentation and community support of codeigniter is very helpful hope this helps
regarding your question here are the points in favor of codeigniter very quick to get started with that means not too much switching time does not bind you with naming conventions and directory structures in cakephp you can configure it to your satisfaction but again you should know where to configure will give you a basic idea of mvc design pattern and how to make use of it to create a web application

3751020
icomparable	compareto
a class may need more than one implementation of the methodimplementation of the method another well put explanation from msdn one good example of using a single-method interface instead of a delegate is icomparable or icomparable
icomparable declares the compareto method which returns an integer specifying a less than equal to or greater than relationship between two objects of the same type. icomparable can be used as the basis of a sort algorithm and while using a delegate comparison method as the basis of a sort algorithm would be valid it is not ideal

3752753
realloc	malloc
the malloc free realloc that come with your compiler are almost certainly better than some functions you re going to plug in
it is possible to improve things for fixed-size objects but that usually doesn t involve trying to replace the malloc but rather supplementing it with memory pools

3752856
factories	presenter
it is said that there is no problem in computer science which cannot be solved by one more level of indirection if you just don t want the dependency in your presenter inject a factories interface the real implementation could do new commentforoverridegetter or whatever
edit i have no problem ignoring best practices when i think the complexity benefit ratio is too high neither do i but as i said in the comments i don t like hard dependencies on ioc containers in code i want to unit test and presenter are such a case

3753823
translation	localization
you are getting it wrong community translation is an ongoing process or lets say never ending approach
this doesn t meant that is wrong but you have to live with the fact that localization is always a compromise and that usually it is better to have 20 languages with 50 translation than having 10 languages 100 translated

3753823
translation	localization
this doesn t meant that is wrong but you have to live with the fact that localization is always a compromise and that usually it is better to have 20 languages with 50 translation than having 10 languages 100 translation
if one language is important it will have more users so it will have more contributors and the translation rate will be greater

3755220
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
runtimeexception are those indicated by runtimeexception and its subclasses
because illegalaccessexception is not runtimeexception is checked exception and illegalstateexception is a runtimeexception is unchecked-exception

3755427
client-side	server-side
think of a client-side twitter widget that goes directly to twitter api using jsonp and you want to linkify all the urls in the tweets dynamically.
doing this server-side is not an option sometimes

3755627
spaces	delimiter
for a delimiter format you choose a character that you will not use as a valid part of the filename or size a pipe a spaces a tab character newline etc and insert one in between the filename and size and between size and file contents
then read one byte at a time into the array until you hit a delimiter

3758064
implements	extends
example your class does not have to implements traversable as suggested elsewhere and in fact the class above doesn t var_dump new foo instanceof traversable
false you can implements one of the iterator or iteratoraggregate if you need more control over how the iteration should behave because iterator and iteratoraggregate extends traversable your class will now also be an instance of traversable but like shown above it s not necessary for iterating the object

3758593
primefaces	richfaces
i am not using primefaces but richfaces on my projects
so i am not really aware on how the refresh process is done by primefaces

3762611
implements	extends
you must cast the toarray call as you said since resources implements parcelable this should get rid of your exception
toarray returns a type of which is why you re getting object is not a valid substitute for the bounded parameter object does not extends parcelable

3764612
super	implements
here is the solution i ended up implements for a checkbox s ischecked property i m not super familiar with templatebindings or anything wpf for that matter so maybe this only works because my checkbox is in a datatemplate.
i had the same problem but i can t use multibindings since i need to correctly implements the convertback method

3765187
google-chrome	firefox
it doesn t seem to be possible in google-chrome as answers to this question say
but with firefox you may have a look at several extensions mentioned here or at this one and try to figure out how they did what they did

3765641
jar	manifest.mf	jar	war
jar xvf q3762049-1.0-snapshot-uberjar.jar created meta-inf inflated meta-inf manifest.mf created org created org apache created org apache commons created org apache commons lang created org apache commons lang builder created org apache commons lang enum created org apache commons lang enums created org apache commons lang exception created org apache commons lang math created org apache commons lang mutable created org apache commons lang text created org apache commons lang time inflated meta-inf license.txt inflated meta-inf notice.txt inflated org apache commons lang arrayutils.class ... created meta-inf maven created meta-inf maven commons-lang created meta-inf maven commons-lang commons-lang inflated meta-inf maven commons-lang commons-lang pom.xml inflated meta-inf maven commons-lang commons-lang pom.properties inflated my-webapp-1.0-snapshot.war created com created com stackoverflow inflated com stackoverflow app.class
how do i create an assembly.xml that will do both the jar with dependencies unpacking all of those jar files and include a war file from another project which is not unpacked

3766121
ssl	https
unauthorised devices are seen as a much greater risk than not using ssl because they pose additional threats like introducing a virus an external network connection or some other kind of attack vector
inside of large companies is it standard practice to use ssl https for running corporate apps over the lan

3766121
ssl	https
inside of large companies is it standard practice to use ssl https for running corporate apps over the lan
generally ssl for lan only internal applications is not common practice

3766444
realloc	malloc
realloc is not required to leave the block in place even if it would fit and in fact the simplest stub implementation is an example where it might not malloc call sbrk
realloc call malloc and memcpy

3768794
decimal	ieee
so for financial calculations use decimal not float
for financial calculations use decimal according to ieee 754 floats were always binary only the new standard ieee 754r defined decimal formats

3770193
super	extends
it gets the stakeholder involved in the architectural and technical aspect of the product right from the super user story which helps create good understanding of the vision between the business and the technical side and one cannot live without the other
i may have intentionally tried to extends the answer beyond the questions scope so that i may get some feedback on my ideas as well

3770607
allocator	stl
that s why dynamic allocator when not done on a memory pool or with a pooled allocator can slow things down
for a heavy stl application if you re doing multi-threading there is the hoard allocator or the tbb intel version

3771062
allocator	stl
memory allocator like in libc actually handle the problem of a lot of small allocator which is typical for std string for instance in my server application there are lots of stl strings but as i see from running info heap they are not causing any problems
my impression is that you need to avoid frequent large allocator

3771574
onkeyup	onkeydown
i wrote a blog post earlier today on why onkeyup isn t a great idea for detecting user input
the better option is to either use onkeydown with a 0ms timer or a combination of the newer html 5 event oninput for standards compliant browsers and onpropertychange in internet explorer

3772124
primefaces	richfaces
richfaces 3.x isn t fully jsf 2.0 compatible while primefaces 2.x is hence this conflict
richfaces 4.x should be fully jsf 2.0 compatible

3772583
erlang	lisp	erlang	scheme
a lisp dialect for the code-as-data homoiconicity thing and because they are good if not the best examples of dynamic more or less strict functional programming languages prolog as the predominant logic programming language smalltalk as the one true oop language also interesting because of its usually extremely image-centric approach maybe erlang or clojure if you are interested in languages forged for concurrent parallel distributed programming forth for stack oriented programming haskell for strict functional statically typed lazy programming especially lisp cl not as much as scheme and prolog and haskell embrace recursion
although i am not a guru in any of these languages i did spend some time with each of them except erlang and forth and they all gave me eye-opening and interesting learning experiences as each one approaches problem solving from a different angle

3772732
prng	random
the state of the prng is stored internally in sort of global variable
generating a new random number either will not be thread safe hard to tell but the output stream won t be reproducible or will be slow in multithreded code you end up with some serialization around the state value

3772942
spaces	delimiter
in ruby will only ignore leading spaces for the ending delimiter allowing it to be properly indented
it does not strip leading spaces on lines inside the string despite what some documentation online might say

3774036
multiplying	addition
you re allocating one less pointer than you need here it should be left_brack_ptr_stack_size + 1 that you multiplying by
in addition p is the correct printf format string for printing pointers not lli

3774805
persistent	transient
for something so big i would suggest some investigation first ensure that you are not trying to persistent the entire jvm heap
look for member variables that can be labeled as transient to avoid including them it the serialization perhaps you have references to service objects consider possibility that there is a memory leak and the object is excessively large

3778103
implements	extends
for mootools 1.11 implements is done differently
you should use the options class as a mixin and the setoptions to do the merge properly having said that in your example i get a different response - as expected - but via merge and not extends merge does unlink yet what s the point in this as you have no this.options that exists you need to pass on an object to extends it merge it with another one

3781158
gif	png	bmp	png	tiff	png
pros binary access much faster than getpixel does not require additional libraries nor wpf works with any format supported by gdi+ bmp gif jpeg png tiff exif wmf and emf
cons requires unsafe is slower than reading png file directly

3783333
jsf	seam
in jsf 1.x which lacks the view scope you could achieve the desired behaviour by placing the bean in the request scope and using either tomahawk or richfaces or seam s conversation scope or myfaces orchestra
again this problem is not jsf specific

3783636
uiview	calayer
if you want a button that actually works on top of a calayer put that calayer into a uiview which is a subclass of uiresponder and add a uibutton to that view so it can get added to the event response chain
a calayer is not an event responder so trying to hook it up to a touch event handler will do nothing

3784067
uiview	subviews
probably the reason you see all the buttons despite the container being too small is that uiview do not clip their subviews by default
i don t think actually takes in to account its subviews

3787117
fixed-point	fractions
then again this depends on how expensive your fixed-point arithmetic operations are
powers do not easily convert to bit shifts because and this will give you a fractions number of bits to shift

3787479
ati	nvidia
not sure if it s been tested on windows aside this is my gripe with ati you can t develop with their system unless you have an ati card installed
nvidia has no such requirement

3787488
wxpython	pyqt
i came to the conclusion that pyqt is currently the best choice for a modern powerful well-maintained and portable gui mainly because of some of the shortcomings of its main contender wxpython see below
tk and themed tk would be good for simpler needs. two words of warning against wxpython it is not possible to install it via the popular fink package manager on mac os x currently which makes it far less portable than pyqt and tkinter

3788674
svg	vml
for those of you unfamiliar with it it s an svg dom library first and foremost
if you know a thing or two about svg you ll know that ie doesn t support it but it does support vml

3788884
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
you say i m using a uitable subclassing uitableviewcontroller i guess you are using a subclassed uitableviewcontroller which naturally holds a uitableview. your problem is caused by the fact that you inserted the navigationbar into the uitableview or more precisely into the uiscrollview which is part of the tableview. depending on your needs you have two options if you want your app to behave like mail so your tableview will be just one element in a structure of views through which you can dig down you should a uinavigationcontroller and make your tableviewcontroller the navigationcontroller s first view like when you open the navigation based -template in xcode
the uinavigationcontroller will already contain a uinavigationbar so there isn t much you have to worry about

3788884
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
the uinavigationcontroller will already contain a uinavigationbar so there isn t much you have to worry about
if for some reason that s not what you want you will have to create a uiview which holds your uinavigationbar as well as the uitableview

3789039
memcpy	memmove
memcpy isn t but that s not a problem here as for the efficency of memmove memcpy that s pretty much an unknown area
memmove does a bit more range checking then memcpy so it ll be a hair slower the memcpy

3789764
cassini	iis
my company makes a product called the neokernel that might help you www.neokernel.com the neokernel is not based on cassini
it is a professional embeddable asp.net web server in a small self contained assembly with logging ssl support for multiple asp.net apps programmatic configuration support for virtual directories and it runs any web app that iis does

3789814
allocator	stl
at best you can write an allocator that uses a vector to provide the memory used by set which may or may not be what you want
there is no way to specify the underlying structure of an stl set

3791384
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
this message will appear if you are presenting the uiimagepickercontroller within another uiviewcontroller
because it isn t pushed like a uinavigationcontroller stack there is confusion at the uiwindow level

3791406
cdr	cons
recursively search the rest list for the binding write-lookup cdr binding-list pattern fact t
the list doesn t have the binding. cons cons pattern fact

3791471
calloc	malloc
calloc is likely just implemented as something similar to so it just adds a multiply before and a clear after the malloc
malloc could be but probably isn t ever implemented as since you can pass realloc a null pointer as the previous pointer but malloc is most likely not implemented like that because it would slow down all mallocs and because realloc probably uses malloc

3791471
realloc	malloc
malloc could be but probably isn t ever implemented as since you can pass realloc a null pointer as the previous pointer but malloc is most likely not implemented like that because it would slow down all mallocs and because realloc probably uses malloc
the main thing to know about realloc is that it is often capable of determining the actual size of the block of memory that any of the heap allocation routines returned and see if the block is big enough already or in some cases if it would be best try to shrink the block or move it

3791814
cube	skybox
i believe opengl may include this in its fixed function pipeline but in case you re taking the shader approach fixed function is deprecated anyway you ll want to use cube map samplers samplercube in cg not sure about glsl
when drawing the cube map you also want to remove translation from the modelview matrix but keep the rotation this causes the skybox to follow the camera but allows you to look around at different parts of the sky

3791877
lisp	scheme
emacs lisp s age isn t the only reason why it s dynamically scoped
true in those days lisps tended towards dynamic scoping scheme and common lisp hadn t really taken on yet

3793155
udp	tcp
as said above udp is not a reliable protocol
it s a connectionless protocol which puts much less overhead on ip packets than tcp does

3793160
persistent	transient
i m not sure if this is generic jpa or hibernate-only but note the difference between hibernate s persistent and save
from the docs emphasis mine persistent makes a transient instance persistent

3793160
persistent	transient
from the docs emphasis mine persistent makes a transient instances persistent
however it does not guarantee that the identifier value will be assigned to the persistent instances immediately the assignment might happen at flush time

3794995
haskell	scheme	scheme	racket
there are a number of curry implementations for scheme -- none can be as elegant as haskell since there functions are always unary functions so everything can be curried
but this can of course be implemented in a sufficiently powerful scheme like racket . as for the macro that you ve dug up -- it s a pretty bad one not only does it use an unhygienic macro it s also calling eval explicitly and relies on an implementation of environments etc

3798461
persistent	transient
it is only possible to mark certain properties on the domain object as transient so that they are not persistent to the database
otherwise all domain objects are persistent

fossil	git
there is now a gui for fossil on mac sort of.
i have been working on a simple gui which while not a finder plugin like tortoise cvs svn git ... works together with finder

udp	tcp
bonjour is just a way to announce services not a replacement for tcp udp
the services still use tcp or udp

3800494
google-chrome	firefox
safari 5 google-chrome 6 webkit browsers seem to allow sizes up to but not including 1 000 000 pixels after which the text does not render at all
in firefox 3.6 the maximum practical font-size appears to be 2000px

3801070
equals	compareto
while equals doesn t receive a compareoptions argument and it can tell you true false only
from reflector so compareto has an additional reference check than compare

3804998
ienumerable	iqueryable
so casting an iqueryable as an ienumerable will cause the second extension method to be called where it will be treated as an ienumerable
since the interface iqueryable inherits from ienumerable why not edit there are two extension methods which one is called is statically decided by the compiler

3807546
inline	inlining
if the callee is inline by an optimizing compiler it is possible that the compiler will simply pass the integer value split across two registers
if however the callee cannot be inline if it s third-party api code for example then the compiler cannot perform this kind of inlining and indeed passing a pointer might be more efficient though it s unlikely you ll find library that functions that take an integer pass by reference unless it s so that the callee can modify the caller s value which introduces a whole different set of issues

3808558
erlang	scheme
in some languages scala scheme lua standard ml mozart oz erlang the two can actually be written to perform exactly the same
that is the following scheme code will not use a stack and hence perform the same as an iterative approach

3809595
realloc	malloc
if there is not enough room to enlarge the memory allocation pointed to by ptr realloc creates a new allocation copies as much of the old data pointed to by ptr as will fit to the new allocation frees the old allocation and returns a pointer to the allocated memory
if ptr is null realloc is identical to a call to malloc for size bytes

3810720
super	self	super	implements
if the base classes don t also all use super it won t work and unless the method is in object you have to use something like a common base class to terminate the chain of super calls
class foobase object def foo self pass class a foobase def foo self super a self .foo print a.foo class b foobase def foo self super b self .foo print b.foo class c a b def foo self super c self .foo print c.foo marcin asks why there has to be a common base without foobase that implements foo but doesn t call super the last class that does call super will get an attribute error as there is no base method to call

3810720
super	self	super	implements
class foobase object def foo self pass class a foobase def foo self super a self .foo print a.foo class b foobase def foo self super b self .foo print b.foo class c a b def foo self super c self .foo print c.foo marcin asks why there has to be a common base without foobase that implements foo but doesn t call super the last class that does call super will get an attribute error as there is no base method to call
if there were separate base classes class a afoobase and class b bfoobase the super call in a would call the method in afoobase and the method in b would never be called

3810810
implements	extends
i m not quite sure how to answer this conceptually anymore but in practice i use interfaces for the following reasons to indicate different classes have a shared interface that you can manipulate them use them in the same way you can implements multiple interfaces but only extends one class reasons for using abstract classes to share functionality between similar objects
for example porshe911 could extends car overwrite a few methods and keep the rest

3811238
haskell	ocaml	haskell	scheme
the type system in haskell is touring-mighty and more expressive and easier than the templates in c++ and d
if you like to learn some languages i recommend learning in this order any lisp scheme python prolog ocaml then lisp again in not more than 1-3 days each

3812371
ubuntu	linux
as this the provision of binaries is all volunteer effort on the part of the cran maintainers r core and other devoted members of the community dirk vincent and michael for the debian and ubuntu packages the main effort has gone into providing binaries for systems where self-compilation is more difficult as the necessary tools are not easily available unlike on linux
cran packages are available in the ubuntu package repository but are updated with cran only when ubuntu is updated

3813221
rsa	dsa
with rsa this makes private key usage quite expensive rsa key generation is not easy
however with dsa diffie-hellman this would be very inexpensive the private key is only a random number modulo q the group order which can be generated with much less cost than using the private key for a digital signature or an asymmetric key exchange

3818664
base	fractions
the log base 10 will tell you what you want to know numerically that is if then
unfortunately if your number is not an exact power of 10 you will have a fractions part to deal with

3825328
xna	slimdx
based off of your concern of slimdx documentation and the fact that you want to use multitouch which i can t determine if that is accessible from slimdx - refer to documentation comment i d suggest going with xna
xna doesn t have immediate support for ogg but there are several nice converters out there

3828361
strcpy	strncpy
c sz strings is not a type at all just an array of chars as normal as say an array of int but string manipulation functions strcmp strcpy strcat printf and many many others understand and use the 0 ending convention
that also means that if you have a chars array that is not zero terminated you shouldn t call any of these functions as it will likely do something wrong or you must be extra carefull and use functions with a n letter in their name like strncpy

3828932
datamapper	activerecord
the datamapper is not more modern or newer but just more suited for an orm
the main reason people change is because activerecord does not make for a good orm

3829092
inline	inlining
there are multiple phases where inlining might occur for example at compile time the compiler may decide or not to inline the call
at link time if lto are enabled the linker might decide to inline some calls

3829092
inline	inlining
in c++ you can hint to the compiler that a function might be worth inlining using the inline but it ll still perform a performance analysis with its own heuristics
the main use being that free functions declared inline do not lead to link failures because of duplicate symbols

3830096
jsf	seam
on jsf 1.x you need to either put bean in session scope not recommended or to preload the list in bean s constructor or postconstruct based on customername
i am not sure what seam is doing about this but in normal jsf this is unnecessary

3830096
jsf	seam
i am not sure what seam is doing about this but in normal jsf this is unnecessary
normally jsf has already updated the list property during update model values phase

3831819
cassini	iis
edit i dont put the service host projects websites in my solution as otherwise when running my wcf client vs opens up a cassini instance for each of them which is irritating and i anyways dont need or use
because i have a lot of wcf services used by my project and i do not want to have to run too many instances of vs for debugging this is what i do - if you are ok with having a local iis you could consider this

3832352
inline	inlining
our conclusions were to inline the css against having them as separate downloads and relying on expires headers to cache on the phone
some of our key considerations were there is a lot of latency establishing a connection so inlining the css has a big advantage on feature phones that do not support caching the files locally with expires header

3833311
vim	emacs
vim has rails.vim a great plugin to help in rails development
i m not aware of anything comparable for emacs

3834673
mdpi	hdpi
hdpi ldpi mdpi refers the density of pixels on the screens not the screens size
thus one mdpi screens might be 320x480 while another might be 480x854

3835340
inline	inlining
visual c++ will do auto inline expansion if you tell it to via the ob2 switch but only if optimizations are turned on o2
it could be that this was turned off or perhaps the compiler isn t as aggressive at inlining as you want

3835640
pthreads	fork
fork and exec work the same on mac os x as on linux and other pthreads environments with one catch in a cocoa app you can t just fork and not exec because core foundation will not allow you to use any cf- or cocoa-based apis in the new process
if you fork in a cocoa app you must exec pretty much immediately afterward

3837124
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
it contains a stack of uiviewcontroller that you can push or pop. the title displayed in the navigation bar is the title of the uiviewcontroller that is on the top of the stack the last pushed uiviewcontroller
in you sample you did not push any view controller on your uinavigationcontroller

3837527
tapestry	wicket
tapestry s community is not very large
apart from howard lewis ship there are a few other committers but nothing like the support wicket has

3837527
tapestry	wicket
thus tapestry evolves rather slowly
tapestry s approach to templating instrumenting html with types and ids is one of the better ones i ve seen but it doesn t go as far as wicket in keeping code out of the html

3839650
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
bypass 1 actually expands into controller salescontroller action getalertsaction view sales getalerts.phtml the issue is you re naming your action method slightly wrong so if the old local server isn t case-sensitive most pcs and macs are case-insensitive when tested locally it doesn t matter
when published to a webserver likely unix it s case-sensitive so it breaks

3839765
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
i ran a few browsers against this test and found that firefox 3.6 and google-chrome 6 support file reader api and local storage
safari 5 on windows supported local storage but not file reader api

3840675
ubuntu	linux
download ubuntu
imho ubuntu is best for starters or anyone as a matter of fact because it has a lot of support a good user base and is compatible with pretty much any linux software installer rpm deb etc. you can choose any other distribution it doesn t really matter but i recommend this one

3840675
ubuntu	linux
imho ubuntu is best for starters or anyone as a matter of fact because it has a lot of support a good user base and is compatible with pretty much any linux software installer rpm deb etc. you can choose any other distribution it doesn t really matter but i recommend this one
1 start virtualbox and create a new ubuntu virtual machine

3840749
floating-point	fractions
floating-point numbers are normally represented as binary fractions times a power of two for efficiency
this is about as accurate as base-10 representation except that there are decimal fractions that cannot be exactly represented as binary fractions

3842515
equals	gethashcode
the values 12m and 12.0m are logically equals but they don t have the same bit pattern
gethashcode will say that they are not equals

3842647
umbraco	dotnetnuke
i am intrigued by sitefinity umbraco and kentico for sites where all that s really needed is a cms but not enough that i ve bothered trying them over dotnetnuke
i evaluated many of the different portal cms systems out there back in 2004 and dotnetnuke ended up being my choice and i ve been very pleased with it for everything but e-commerce ever since

3842816
google-chrome	firefox
same problem here. changing background-position in a css sprite on a visited is working for me in firefox 3.6 but not in google-chrome 6
but probably soon it will stop working in firefox too

3843982
spaces	delimiter
you re missing a required spaces between both angle brackets and the url
try this the extra spaces is mandatory according to perldoc perlpod scroll down from here to find it a more readable and perhaps more plain way is to use an alternate set of delimiter that doesn t require a single to be escaped

3843982
spaces	delimiter
try this the extra spaces is mandatory according to perldoc perlpod scroll down from here to find it a more readable and perhaps more plain way is to use an alternate set of delimiter that doesn t require a single to be escaped
with the pod formatters that are standard starting with perl5.5.660 doubled angle brackets and may be used if and only if there is whitespace right after the opening delimiter and whitespace right before the closing delimiter

3844173
helpers	actioncontroller
so in library my controller helpers inject.php then register an instance of the helpers in application bootstrap.php and as always be sure to include my_ as an autoloader namespace in configs application.ini then in the controller access the value directly as a public member variable one thing to note since the helpers uses the predispatch hook i believe it will get called on every action even an internal forward
the actioncontroller is not directly accessible directly from a front-controller plugin

3846490
vb.net	vb6
this is supported by the following links q a microsoft s lisa feigenbaum talks about c# luca bolognese pdc 09 - future directions for c# and visual basic luca bolognese c# and vb.net co-evolution - the twain shall meet
microsoft is focusing on making c# and vb.net not vb6 similar in what is being termed as a co-evolution of the languages

3846490
vb.net	vb6
microsoft is focusing on making c# and vb.net not vb6 similar in what is being termed as a co-evolution of the languages
we can see this with c# 4.0 adopting optional parameters and vb.net 10 adding support for automatic properties and multi-statement lambdas

3846503
persistent	transient
following code snippets shows the use of transient proerties digitalcopy property included in transient declaration notifies gorm not to persistent digitalcopy
using transient key word gorm can be directed not to persistent specific property

3846750
decimal	ieee
think of it as a bigint for decimal
decimal is a built in python class that handles floating points correctly as base 10 not as ieee 7somethingsomething standard

3847173
super	extends
the passed list is a will work number fits in you can add any subtype of number to a the passed list is a or any subclass of number won t work integer is a subclass of number so it is exactly what we want to avoid even if an integer fits in a number you wouldn t be abble to add any subclass of number in a for example a float super doesn t mean a subclass
the passed list is a or any class not extends number nor in the super hierarchy of number ie

3847173
super	extends
the passed list is a or any class not extends number nor in the super hierarchy of number ie
number and object won t work string doesn t fit in number super hierarchy even if string fits in object which is a super class of number you woudln t be sure to be able to add a number to a list that contain any subclass from one of the super classes of number super doesn t mean any subclass of one of the super classes it only means one of the super classes

3848762
innodb	myisam
generally speaking for non-critical data i d use innodb tuned for speed
e.g. i wouldn t flush binary logs on every commit. i d only use myisam for things like logging tables

3848762
innodb	myisam
in fact that is one of innodb s major advantages over myisam it has row-level locking
in short if you are unable to set up an external indexer and your site does not experience too much traffic then myisam will work fine despite it being less robust

3850092
operands	scalar
note in an expression that is evaluated more than once during the execution of a program unsequenced and indeterminately sequenced evaluations of its subexpressions need not be performed consistently in different evaluations. end note the value computations of the operands of an operator are sequenced before the value computation of the result of the operator
if a side effect on a scalar object is unsequenced relative to either another side effect on the same scalar object or a value computation using the value of the same scalar object the behavior is undefined

3850256
backtracking	greedy
possessive quantifiers are also greedy but as mentioned once they return a match the engine can no longer backtracking past that point
so if we change our pattern to match any character zero or more times possessively followed by a b and try to match aaaaaaaab again the will consume the whole string but then since it is possessive backtracking information is discarded and the b cannot be matched so the pattern fails

3851290
decimal	ieee
sqlite internally uses ieee binary floating point arithmetic which truly does not lend itself well to maintaining a particular number of decimal
to get that type of decimal handling would require one of fixed point math or ieee decimal floating point rather uncommon or handling everything as strings

3852746
ssl	https
i could not ensure security such as ssl connections with the other websites
however in order to get myself into that capability https connections i had to buy the enterprise level eventhough on every other capability i could have used the free service

3853439
boost	stl
stl gains because you can pass your project around and not require a download accompanyment of boost
stl has quite a few problems with it as documented here by eastl on an embedded system or small scale system the main problem is generally the way in which it manages its memory

3856084
lisp	scheme
atom has a similar definition in common lisp where the function atom object is defined to be not consp object
in scheme an atom is anything that is not a pair thus symbols are atoms just as numbers and strings

3856488
sudo	passwd
add something like this to the top of your shell script this way the user can get to be root however they choose su or sudo
you can setup the account not to need a passwd for sudo in etc sudoers if you don t want to do that you can force them to run the script as root

3856502
super	self
apply the staticmethod decorator to method1 you will no longer be able to reference self or cls in staticmethod1 but you can hardcode references to a into it though obviously these references will be inherited by all subclassing of a unless they specifically override method1 and do not call super
some examples note that in the same way that the name of the self variable is entirely up to you so is the name of the cls variable but those are the customary values

3856633
awt	swing
not related to your question but based on the code you posted it looks like you ve copied some old awt code and are trying to use it in a swing application
i would suggest you only use swing components

3856915
division	subtract
mod is about the same speed as division on most cpu s these days that means about 5-10 cycles.
in other words hardly anything slower than multiply add subtract but not enough to really worry about

3858302
allocator	stl
container classes rely heavily on dynamic memory allocator reallocation and object copying and this is most often highly non-deterministic so when used in time-critical code you have no way of guaranteeing the meeting of deadlines
that is not to say that it stl cannot be used even in real-time applications

3859667
intersect	contains
for each of the given rectangles for each rectangle in uncovered space if they intersect divide the uncovered space into smaller rectangles around the covering rectangle and add the smaller rectangles if any to your list of uncovered ones
if your list of uncovered space still has any entries they contains all points not covered by the given rectangles

3860812
wordpress	joomla
i would tend to stay away from wordpress as extending it is not nearly as simple as drupal or joomla
it takes a lot more work to get wordpress to do the same thing and its feature set out of the box is very limited

3860930
profiling	instrumentation
some of the most crucial tools leaks allocations time profiling another suggestion alongside using instrumentation is to compile with the -pedantic flag
i think that using instrumentation is not only good practice it s strongly recommended by the ios development community as a whole

3861643
primefaces	richfaces
you can t use richfaces 3.3.3 and primefaces together
primefaces needs jsf 2.0 features and richfaces 3.3.3 doesn t work with them

3861643
primefaces	richfaces
primefaces needs jsf 2.0 features and richfaces 3.3.3 doesn t work with them
richfaces 3.3.3 needs facelets-1.1.15 and old viewhandler so new one is not used

3864311
ubuntu	debian
alex ubuntu 10.04 doesn t have a full python 2.5 packaged as evidenced by the lack of python2.5-dev
you need to use python 2.6 or if you absolutely must use python 2.5 build it from source try a debian package or switch distro

3866067
codeigniter	cakephp
i ve spun up two codeigniter applications both relatively simple and both took twice the work twice the amount of new code than if i had gone with say cakephp
cakephp database querying doesn t have to be horrendous

3866544
equals	compareto
from the javadoc of bigdecimal equals public boolean equals object x compares this bigdecimal with the specified object for equality
unlike compareto this method considers two bigdecimal objects equal only if they are equal in value and scale thus 2.0 is not equal to 2.00 when compared by this method

3868143
opera	firefox
it plays nice on safari and other new browsers safari mobile opera mobile included
but for even firefox 3.x this css3 solution doesn t work unfortunately

3868994
move	drag
you can call dodragdrop with a data object containing or representing the control to begin a drag drop operation then handle the container s dragdrop event and move the control
if you want to see the control as it s dragged you can either make a transparent handle wm_nchittest form under the mouse showing the control call drawtobitmap or not use drag drop at all and instead handle mouse events and track state manually

3869263
typemock	moles
in my opinion moles typemock are not really comparable to mocking frameworks and they are surely not a replacement
here are my top arguments for it while it s worth every penny typemock comes with considerable initial license costs 800 per seat why some managers hesitate to invest this amount of money

3869263
moq	typemock	moq	moles
if you re starting a new project you re doing a greenfield project then use a mocking framework i personally like moq because of its simplicity and use ms moles as a complementary for things you can t have an interface for .net framework types
even roy osherove the lead dev of typemock puts it that way hopefully he s not getting into trouble with his boss because of this a customer switches to moq and i m happy there s one exception though if learning test-driven development from scratch it may be beneficial to use typemock even for new code

3869555
firefox	safari
jsfiddle with raphael - all browsers though it might look nicer speeded up in ie the first attempt jquery solution is below this jquery attempt pretty much failes in ie and is slow in firefox
chrome and safari do well jsfiddle example for all browsers ie is not that good i didn t implement the fade in ie and ie doesn t have rounded corners.

3869631
imagemagick	magick++
as for libraries you could have a look at imagemagick with pythonmagick it does resizing with respectable interpolators and writes to several formats offers text overlays out of the box or simple compositing if you have your own watermark you want to paste in
used that and not pil in the last couple places where i had to deal with the problem and for the simple stuff i needed i was satisfied that was through magick++ though not with the python bindings but i doubt the experience would be very different

3874183
spaces	delimiter
also you could skip the header lines by doing previous variants another thing to do is simply allow user to decide what to do with questionable entries uhm i was all the time under the impression that the second element might contain spaces since it s not the case you could just do
it still seems tome that there s some format in your files regex is quite straightforward the only things you need to pay attention to are the delimiter s and the word breaks b in case of the first delimiter

3874612
firefox	safari
here s a firefox example although i m not sure the spec is completely finalized yet
apparently ff4 chrome and safari all support web sockets

3874657
floating-point	fractions
certainly not all decimal floating-point values have exact binary floating-point values and vice versa but i m not sure that s a problem here
so long as your floating-point input has no fractions part then a suitably large biginteger format should be able to represent it exactly

3878651
jruby	mri
it does work correctly with jruby i tested with 1.5 so it goes to show it s an implementation-specific thing
but note that jruby only provides escape continuations not general-purpose ones. callcc do |cc| begin puts body cc.call ensure puts ensure end end to test with mri 1.9+ you need to either run with the -rcontinuation option or put require continuation at the top of the file. for readers who don t know what a dynamic-wind is it s a way to specify code to be run when the code being covered is exited much like ensure as well as code to to be run when the covered code is re-entered

3880025
ssl	https
so you have to either change your security setting or enable ssl
wcf does not allow for clear text authentication over http it requires https and this behaviour is by design - i would actually not agree but well i am not microsoft

3882058
cpython	ironpython
a lot of the extensions for cpython don t work with ironpython
so if you want to use django or something like that it s probably not smart to use ironpython because it isn t really cross-platform doesn t work with some frameworks and it performs worse than cpython

3882058
cpython	ironpython
so if you want to use django or something like that it s probably not smart to use ironpython because it isn t really cross-platform doesn t work with some frameworks and it performs worse than cpython
the real advantage to ironpython is access to everything that .net has to offer including asp.net a web framework and silverlight

3882122
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
that is when the thrown exception is an instance or subclass of runtimeexception . errors will also - by default - result in a rollback. checked exceptions that are thrown from a transactional method will not result in the transaction being rolled back
by default spring only rolls back for unchecked-exception

3884469
realloc	malloc
depending on your implementation of malloc your system may be using the memory in between p and q to store bookkeeping information that is used by realloc free and friends
two malloc calls aren t necessarily going to return consecutive memory areas

3885599
ienumerable	iqueryable
if it s an ienumerable t change your code to call enumerable.firstordefault t ienumerable t
if not you can t pass it to queryable.firstordefault t iqueryable t

3890571
opera	firefox
changing the scrollbar color in firefox is not as trivial as it is in internet explorer and opera
firefox only allows the style of the scrollbar to be set by the theme

3895428
.htaccess	httpd.conf
check that your mamp httpd.conf has allowoverride all otherwise your local .htaccess will be ignored
i m not familiar with mamp but it s possible that it s having a problem reading interpreting your .htaccess though this is unlikely

3895968
nsmutablestring	nsstring
nsmutablestring on the other hand can be modified after it s initialized
an nsstring instance cannot be modified once it s initialized - it is immutable. no nsstring methods can modify the string s value

3899277
innodb	myisam
engine innodb will ensure you get foreign key support
the default myisam engine doesn t support foreign keys

3899467
macports	homebrew
version 6.6.1-0 doesn t seem to be available but probably 6.6.1-10 which is available is fine too. all the troubles with macports were probably mostly red herrings
still macports does not seem to have a way to install a previous version of imagemagick so i installed it from source. homebrew might be a better option

3899467
macports	homebrew
still macports does not seem to have a way to install a previous version of imagemagick so i installed it from source. homebrew might be a better option
the errors i was getting with imagemagick were solved for me by removing usr local lib libfreetype and reinstalling imagemagick. i also purged and reinstalled macports but i don t know that that was necessary

3899615
serializable	deserialization
when you come to a reference you need to serializable look through the references you ve already serializable - if you find it output an appropriate id or whatever so you can restore the reference appropriately on deserialization
if not serializable the object and remember the reference and associated id so that you can spot it if the same reference is used elsewhere in the tree

3900293
kerberos	ntlm
i guess that you have possibly 2 simultaneous conditions for this failure to happen sql server is not local on another machine the trust is configured kerberos only or other specific security network server ad machine configurations
the issue was caused by a down active directory server which of course could not authenticate the windows account it is not of course - because if ad is not available then kerberos authentication falls back to ntlm domain account credentials are cached locally one can login with it even if ad kerberos is not available

3900409
direct3d	gdi
imho the right way to go is direct3d or opengl but given delphi is windows only maybe direct3d is better
it was introduced exactly because the gdi is not good at such tasks

3901134
awt	swing
the thing is awt containers do not paint their children
this is true even for swing containers by the way

3901979
strcpy	strdup
strcpy does not allocate new memory area for the string it only copies data from one buffer to another
you need to allocate new buffers using strdup or create the array pre-allocated

3904332
h.264	webm
they use either h.263 h.264 mpeg-4 or vp8 to encode video
if i m not mistaken they are currently porting everything over to vp8 which they acquired from on2 and has been released as open source and should be the code used in webm as well

3905805
email	dkim
you may need to recycle the sending process periodically or even better decouple the creating email and sending email altogether surprisingly that was the easy part
the hard part is actually sending it some servers will ban you when you send too many mails close together so you need to shuffle and watch your queue send one mail to joe example.com then three to other domains only then another to otheraddress example.com you need to have correct ptr spf dkim records handling remote server timeouts misconfigured dns records and other network pleasantries handling invalid email and no regex is the wrong tool for that handling unsubscriptions many legitimate newsletters have been reclassified as spam due to many frustrated users who couldn t unsubscribe in one step and instead chose to mark as spam - the spam filters do learn esp

3906989
mp4	h.264
the ipad doesn t support all the varieties of mp4
it looks like your over sepc ipad supported video format h.264 video up to 720p 30 frames per second

3908265
ssl	https
similarly communications between an smtps client and an smtps server can be secured using ssl tls there are two variants smtps over ssl tls directly on a specific port or tls initiated via starttls within the smtps protocol
either way https isn t used to connect to an smtps server

3911440
qthread	qobject
in short you should not subclass qthread to contain code that you want to run in that thread
you should wrap your code up in a qobject subclass instantiate it and use a qobject movetothread to move your object into the qthread context so that processing will occur in the context of that qthread

equals	gethashcode
hashes are not 1-to-1 you can have multiple different values that hash to the same value but which should compare as not equals
so you cannot really implement equals in terms of gethashcode

3912526
tiff	bmp
doc and tiff are two completely different things
it s not like converting from bmp to tiff two image formats or wav to mp3 two audio formats

3923406
opera	firefox	firefox	safari
the mdc docs are pretty clear note gecko firefox accepts a length value for tx and ty. safari webkit and opera currently support a unitless number for tx and ty
after a lengthy post explaining the logic of the matrix brendan kenny concludes that one must add units to e and f for firefox which doesn t really make any sense but for now fine . which is true - for the computer - as the linear translations are technically no different than the other entities of the matrix. but it is unfair as - for us humans - it makes logical sense for the linear translations to be in value amounts and there is no other good way to get the browser to do percentage calculations

3923460
touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchesended
so my solution to this is to override touchesbegan withevent and touchesmoved withevent and call them from there as follows
note that multi-touch is not enabled for this control and that i don t care about touchesended and touches canceled events but if you want to be complete thorough you should probably implement those too

3925068
inline	inlining
there are various ways you can guarantee a method isn t capable of being inline but no way to force the compiler to inline
it will almost always know better than you anyway when inlining will help vs

3926023
jar	war
an apk is like a java jar file which holds metadata and class files
android doesn t have an equivalent to a java war file

3929252
implements	extends
if i m not missing something and fread method ought to be implements
you can call extends it and add an fread method that calls the fgetc method repeatedly the desired number of times

3929308
daemons	systemd
yields root 130 unutbu 55 www-data 7 avahi 2 haldaemon 2 daemons 1 messagebus 1 syslog 1 debian-exim 1 mysql 1
parsing the output of ps aux is not very pleasant and can be tricky because the format is not guaranteed to be the same on all linux systemd

3930060
profiling	debugging
it will seem to create the archive correctly but will fail upon installing the .ipa the device if you are set to a debugging profiling when you do the build and archive
be sure that when you build and archive that you are building for device and your configuration is not debugging

3930757
cvs	svn
i ve worked on an svn repository that had well over a hundred active commiters a revision number of over 80.000 and had been migrated from cvs 3 years before
generally i d say that svn is not a likely bottleneck when it comes to large projects and large development teams

3931290
gif	png
for testing you can use a png and check whether the problem is actually causing by gif or not
uiimage already support gif file

3931932
union	distinct
union all will be same as union except that it doesn t fire a distinct internally sparing us costly operations
union implement internally two queries. 1

3934540
postgresql	mysql
my conclusion was basically to stick with what i know php and mysql postgresql
yeah mongo or another nosql might be a better fit for the data but it d take me time to learn how to install and use them and frankly unless you have a massive amount of traffic mysql postgresql will not cause performance issues

3936414
super	extends
the superclass of entityhome which is home is in scope scopetype.conversation either you did not override the scope in your userhome declaration or seam ignores scope annotations in subclassing if one of the super classes already have an scope annotation
i assume your userhome class extends seam s entityhome class

3936712
innodb	myisam
nfs support unlike myisam innodb may have problems on nfs
from configuring innodb mysql version 5.5 caution if reliability is a consideration for your data do not configure innodb to use data files or log files on nfs volumes

3938726
des	aes	3des	aes
also it is quite slow des was meant for hardware implementations not software and 3des is even three times slower than des
thus aes was defined with the following requirements 128-bit blocks solves issues with cbc accepts keys of size 128 192 and 256 bits 128 bits are enough to resist exhaustive key search

3939107
innodb	myisam
since you select innodb when creating tables all of your tables are innodb not myisam
myisam is the default storage engine on your server

3939862
serializable	deserialization
these are used among other things to generate a serialversionuid which is written to the stream as part of the serializable process
if the serialversionuid of the class doesn t match the loaded class during deserialization then it will fail

3941956
primes	modulus
the primes are kept in three sse registers and their moduli with the running counter are kept in another three
if the modulus of any prime with the counter is equal to zero the counter cannot be prime

3941956
primes	modulus
if the modulus of any primes with the counter is equal to zero the counter cannot be primes
also if any modulus is equal to one then counter+2 cannot be primes etc up to counter+30

3943451
jtextfield	jlabel
if you re using a jtextfield trust the value in the jtextfield as the user s actual donation amount so that he can edit it and pick a value that s not on the slider and update the slider to an appropriately close tick mark when the jtextfield changes
to add to brunodecarvalho s answer make a jslider with tick marks but no labels couple it with a jlabel or a jtextfield so that when the slider s value is changed the appropriately mapped value appears in the jlabel or jtextfield

3943615
kerberos	ntlm
so if anyone else out there can t get their sharepoint web services to work with ntlm see if you can convince the sysadmins to switch over to kerberos
after a lot of trial and error followed by a stagnant period while i waited for an opportunity to speak with our server guys i finally had a chance to discuss the problem with them and asked them if they wouldn t mind switching our sharepoint authentication over to kerberos

3944857
onkeyup	onkeydown
starting from android 1.5 and later the android framework moved the action activation from onkeydown to onkeyup
so you ll also need to implement the blocking in the onkeyup handler not just the onkeydown handler

3946114
junit	testng
i am not familiar with phpunit but in junit you use static member create a base test class that holds the selenium instance and all tests should extend it
in testng you can use test context

3948588
apache	nginx
etc nginx magento_server etc nginx conf.d php.conf each store then has it s own server block similar to this etc nginx sites-enabled yoursite.com and since .htaccess files are ignored because this is not apache it helps to put .user.ini in each web root var www .user.ini
i have some experience with nginx in this regard and have even written about it

3949253
dictionary	map
note that the object is not retained so you should release this dictionary when you are going to release your uiimageview instances
you can use nsmutabledictionary to map your uiimageview with another object

3952353
ssl	https
i believe i had something like this problem when i configured a site to run over ssl but not all the urls in the system were being properly adjusted or redirected
i set the base_url variable in settings.php to use https www.example.com and the error stopped

3952529
innodb	myisam
i suppose you are using innodb tables and not myisam ones
as described in the innodb transaction model all your queries including select are taking place inside a transaction

3953650
memcached	apc
since then i ve used apc well with php5.4 and since the upgrade to php5.5 which removed apc moved to memcached
on windows seems php5.3 cannot work with apc

3953736
swt	swing
it does have flaws and an overcomplicated api but by design i often find it more appealing than swt though it also comes with its shares of nice features
it is possible to produce very good interfaces with swing and that aren t sluggish as the old fashioned argument goes

3954689
jruby	mri
i highly recommend you install a separate ruby anyway whether or not it is mri ruby because if you use the built-in netbeans versioning of jruby which is often not the latest and then upgrade netbeans you ll lose all the gems you ve installed
installing ruby jruby outside of netbeans helps you to better manage the versions and gems

3955408
mbunit	nunit
all those tests specify the mbunit rollback2-attribute and both insert the data they need and query it in the same round so that the database doesn t get modified by the tests
nunit + sharptestex are used for the unit tests

3956977
macports	homebrew
i strongly prefer homebrew over macports for installing software from source
homebrew sequesters everything in usr local cellar so it doesn t spew files all over the place

3957104
jar	war
i ve also tried reloading from the manager web app however this too does not take changes from the war this can be useful when the web application context is not reloadable and you have updated classes or property files in the web-inf classes directory or when you have added or updated jar files in the web-inf lib directory
the manager docs are more clear on this currently application reloading to pick up changes to the classes or web.xml file is not supported when a web application is deployed directly from a war file

3958962
haskell	ocaml
you ve gotten some functional exposure with clojure and even python but you ve not experienced it to its fullest without haskell
if you re really against haskell then good compromises are either ml or ocaml

3960539
clang	llvm
clang llvm has a bug in the ios 4.1 sdk that causes compilation errors when targeting the simulator but not the device
the clang static analyzer is probably exhibiting this same bug

3961887
innodb	myisam
as for mixing innodb myisam - mysql fully supports mixing matching table types in queries
you can select join update insert delete alter in any order you want just remember that doing anything to a myisam table within an innodb transaction will not make myisam magically transaction aware

3961887
innodb	myisam
you can select join update insert delete alter in any order you want just remember that doing anything to a myisam table within an innodb transaction will not make myisam magically transaction aware
the myisam portions will execute commit immediately and if you roll back the innodb side of things myisam will not roll back as well

3961887
innodb	myisam
the myisam portions will execute commit immediately and if you roll back the innodb side of things myisam will not roll back as well
the only major reason to stick with myisam these days is its support for fulltext indexing

3963193
udp	tcp
losing messages is normal with udp - the transport layer does not guarantee order or delivery of datagrams
if you want them in order and or always delivered switch to tcp or implement sequencing and or ack timeout retransmission yourself

3963236
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox
other things of note the javascript engine in ie 8 is not as fast a firefox 3.6+ safari or google-chrome
opera has made improvements to their scripting engine but still not as fast as firefox safari or google-chrome

3963236
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
opera has made improvements to their scripting engine but still not as fast as firefox safari or google-chrome
however opera does out preform ie 8 in some things but is sluggish in others

3963781
mp3	ogg
you re not likely to find one for mp3 as there are a handful of licensing issues
ogg is simply a container format that can hold audio video and more

3966257
google-chrome	firefox
works for ie 8 and firefox 3.6 but it doesn t work for google-chrome
but making height to 50px works for google-chrome in addition to ie and firefox edit you have given the solution yourself in another post here

3967562
prng	random
you have to be careful when doing monte carlo simulation or cryptography but otherwise you can probably use the standard prng as that s usually much quicker.
it s not exactly obvious but rand is typically more random than

3968177
svg	vml
they perform roughly the same task but vml is specific to internet explorer while most other browsers support svg
ie9 will support svg as well but it s not in widespread use yet

3968177
svg	vml
ie9 will support svg as well but it s not in widespread use yet
again you can work with these using javascript and the best way to do it in a cross-browser way is to use the raphael libraray which gives you an api to create your graphics and then translates it to vml or svg behind the scenes according to the browser

3968966
mbunit	mstest	nunit	mstest
in nunit mbunit you simply put the initalize cleanup methods with the respective attributes in the base class then inherit from it
i haven t tried this yet with mstest but i wouldn t recommend this framework anyway

3970050
cloudant	couchdb
some of these questions are based on your specific implementation but here s a generalization not in any particular order unless they have cloudant mirrored on numerous servers around the world effectively a cdn in its own right just sans static files a true cdn would probably have better response time depending mostly on how you used cloudant eg you might get good response times but if you load the entire file into memory before outputting it you re losing the cdn battle
couchdb has to process more data server-side before it can output an attachment

3970244
google-chrome	firefox
i ve been having the same problem as you and i realized that in my case the thing that was messing up the offset .top value in google-chrome was having one or more images without the height attribute above the element
before offset.top was 100 in google-chrome offset.top was 150 in firefox and ie7 beleive or not it worked just fine in ie

3970244
google-chrome	firefox
before offset.top was 100 in google-chrome offset.top was 150 in firefox and ie7 beleive or not it worked just fine in ie
after offset.top is 150 in both firefox ie7 and google-chrome

3970705
ssl	https
some browsers these days display extra information in the url bar about which legal entity owns the ssl certificate which would help as it s unlikely an attacker would be able to persuade a legitimate certificate authority to issue a certificate in your name
some of the other comments here said that https can be intercepted by intermediate proxy servers which is not actually true

3971217
java.util.calendar	java.util.date
so in my jpa model object i changed all java.util.date into java.util.calendar
using a java.util.date in your domain objects is not really a good idea anyway

3973458
serializable	deserialization
just after the serializable of the object we ident the resulting string for more readability
then we write the string into a file the identation is actually the reason why the deserialization was not working

3973765
profiling	debugging
i assume to provide a better user experience and better response time in order to debugging your approval you need to log into your market profiling and change the test response option
you need to use a device that has the same account as your publisher profiling for the test response to work for a app that isn t released to the market yet

3974380
backgrounding	multitasking
when your app is backgrounding the place to handle notifications is via application didreceivelocalnotification which fires in two scenarios when user taps the view action button to launch your app from the alert notification while your app is backgrounding when the notification fires while your app is running in the foreground
application didfinishlaunchingwithoptions handles just one scenario when user taps the view action button to launch your app from the alert notification while your app is not running in the background devices that do not support support multitasking eg iphone 3g will not use scenario 1 at all but exclusively scenario 3

3976590
persistent	transient
if the entity has field-based access the persistent provider runtime accesses instances variables directly
all non- transient instances variables that are not annotated with the transient annotation are persistent

3976590
persistent	transient
if the entity has property-based access the persistent provider runtime accesses persistent state via the properties accessor methods
all properties not annotated with the transient annotation are persistent. the properties accessor methods must be public or protected

3977637
firefox	safari
according to html5 doctor this won t work in firefox without some js help
the html 5 spec says it should be as simple as adding the following attributes to the markup of the elements in question however this doesn t work completely for safari or firefox

3979037
profiling	benchmarking
an alternative approach is to design first code from the design and then profiling benchmarking the resulting code to see which parts should be optimized
a simple and elegant design is often easier to optimize at this stage and profiling may reveal unexpected performance problems that would not have been addressed by premature optimization

3980508
google-chrome	firefox
i m pretty sure i was able to get google-chrome to behave properly when i was sending vorbis data
firefox was still being a brat though maybe it doesn t like the chunked encoding all shoutcast servers respond with a http 1.0 version response which hadn t defined transfer-encoding chunked yet

3981630
serializable	deserialization
if you use the page.state to store data it serializable your state bag when you leave the page and deserializes when you return to the page rather than when you add or read an object from the state bag
if you use the phoneapplicationservice.state serialization happens when you tombstone and deserialization when the application is re-activated though i m not sure if this is tied to the phoneapplicationservice.activated event or not

3981786
apache	nginx
as i had nginx in front of apache i did not need to change the http.conf configuration
i ended up buying single multidomain certificate ucc for two domains. and modified the nginx configuration to direct two sites to the same apache server

3985245
implements	extends
there is no implements keyword in generic bounds
it s only extends furthermore - you should specify the type parameter only in the class definition and not in supertypes

3987796
innodb	myisam
as for the database -- a few important constraints table engine innodb myisam ... size indices usage most mysql tips on stackoverflow will tell you about 5-8 so called important settings
first off not all of them matter - allocating a lot of resources to innodb and not using innodb doesn t make a lot of sense because those resources are wasted

3988467
comparator	comparable
think best of both worlds like comparable it s implicit for the type in question but like comparator it s extensible and can be added retrospectively to types that did not have it
since java lacks type-classes it has to duplicate every such method once for comparable then for comparator

3991997
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
uri comparison rfc 2616 when comparing two uris to decide if they match or not a client should use a case-sensitive octet-by-octet comparison of the entire uris with these exceptions - a port that is empty or not given is equivalent to the default port for that uri-reference
- comparisons of host names must be case-insensitive

3997452
flac	ogg
note that other formats are capable of being embedded in ogg such as flac and speex
i imagine it s theoretically possible to embed mp3 in ogg though i m not sure why anyone would want to

3997452
mp3	flac
i imagine it s theoretically possible to embed mp3 in ogg though i m not sure why anyone would want to
flac is a lossless audio codec

3998287
vsto	add-in
not sure what is different about the vsto add-in projects that prevents them from being shown in the add references dialog
i just had the same problem when trying to add a vsto add-in project reference to a wix setup project

3998385
linefeed	delimiter
that is because the file i configure flat file connection with at design time has linefeed as a row delimiter
had i point to a file that have cr linefeed row delimiter then columndelimiter of the last column would be x000d _x000a_ and these are not overriten with values from config file

3998385
linefeed	delimiter
had i point to a file that have cr linefeed row delimiter then columndelimiter of the last column would be x000d _x000a_ and these are not overriten with values from config file
in my case if i desinged package with file that have cr linefeed as a row delimiter than at run time file that have linefeed delimiter is not being loaded into a table at all obviosly because it is unable to find cr linefeed which indicates the end of the row

3998385
linefeed	delimiter
in my case if i desinged package with file that have cr linefeed as a row delimiter than at run time file that have linefeed delimiter is not being loaded into a table at all obviosly because it is unable to find cr linefeed which indicates the end of the row
however if i design package poining to the file fith linefeed delimiter then at run time file with cr linefeed delimiter gets processed but cr is appended to the last field of the file

3999617
ssl	https
it feels like there should be a way to alter my program to force it to use ssl but i haven t found it
this turned out to be an interaction between the production core server the one calling the service and the destination server hosting the service not sharing an acceptable https algorithm

3999617
ssl	https
it turned out the destination server was not set up to accept tls 1.0 only ssl 3.0 was accepted
apparently something changed in windows 2008 server which means that outbound https connections would only be acceptable using tls 1.0 or better presumably

3999853
mp3	wav
your sound file should be a mp3 not a wav
try the same code with an mp3 version and it should play
