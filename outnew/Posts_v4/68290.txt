xctest	kif
though some have pointed out that the issue may not be because of kif and rather because of xctest itself the temporary solution was to avoid using beforeall and instead use beforeeach
fwiw i also had a very similar issue when using kif s beforeall

46008386
realloc	calloc
one cannot allocate an object greater than size_max with malloc realloc
but the api of calloc could allow that

46009622
swift	objective-c
the swift float type does not correspond to the metal half type
to my knowledge there s no good representation of half in swift or for that matter c or objective-c

46011684
noexcept	throw
beware that the exception-specification is nowadays deprecated instead since c++11 there is the noexcept specifier to declare functions that guarantee not to throw exceptions
additionally since c++17 the throw has become a synonym for noexcept true but with a slightly different behaviour

46011684
noexcept	throw
there it also says note that a noexcept specification on a function is not a compile-time check
it is merely a method for a programmer to inform the compiler whether or not a function should throw exceptions

46011886
noexcept	throw
in a noexcept function optimizers need not keep the runtime stack in an unwindable state if an exception would propagate out of the function nor must they ensure that objects in a noexcept function are destroyed in the inverse order of construction should an exception leave the function. functions with throw exception specifications lack such optimization flexibility as do functions with no exception specification at all
i wanted to show some quotes from scott meyers effective c++ third edition int dosomething throw

46018891
union	distinct
for example suppose that you get these results from the individual subqueries query 1 query 2 query 3 ------- ------- ------- 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 5 6 2 2 2 3 3 3 7 8 9 1 2 3 3 2 1 1 2 3 3 2 1 3 2 1 using union you will get 1 1 1 2 2 2 1 2 3 3 2 1 3 3 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and using union all you will get 1 1 1 2 2 2 1 2 3 3 2 1 1 1 1 3 3 3 3 2 1 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 3 2 1 if you really need the query returns only the distinct rows from the three subqueries you maybe need to add indexes on the columns returned by the query maybe they current query is relying on automatic indexes created by sql server and the changes made the optimizer stop using them
one thing that a lot of people overlook is that union will not just return the union of all the rows of the subqueries but it will check for duplicates so it could slow the query a lot

46021354
super	extends
firstly the this keyword is undefined until the super function is called
therefore you could change the constructor to something like below using a function to reference an instantiated variable to sel secondly keep in mind you are extends the promise type so when you are calling the then function on it it will return a new promise object not your new promise type so the progress function is undefined there

46025982
multiplying	modulo
it doesn t quite fit unto 16 bits of course but if you treat 0s a special case then it s still pretty easy to multiplying them in a 32-bit word
if you need a prime modulo you re going to make the decision based on the convenience of the size

46033231
swift	objective-c
protocols in swift and in objective-c are different add clas to your protocol update also add flag objective-c
your protocol doesn t confirm objective-c

46038155
spaces	delimiter
the key contains all of the characters in the line starting with the first non-white spaces character and up to but not including the first unescaped or white spaces character other than a line terminator
in application.properties you can specify properties in either of these forms using key value using key value all examples in the spring docs for application.properties use as the delimiter

46041331
icmp	tcp
therefore the timeout for connect means you have sent a tcp syn packet to a destination and this packet has been dropped somewhere in your local network or at the interface between your network and the internet in a firewall since you have not received any icmp icmpv6 packet saying something was wrong - a standard router should have sent you such an information
the problem is with the first packet tcp syn so your problem can not be relative to your addheader calls in your source code

46041569
swift	objective-c
here s what appears to be going on as you ve noticed swift doesn t seem to notice when an objective-c selector fulfills a retroactive protocol requirement which is the part i d probably file as a bug
when you explicitly try to add name and details properties to your extension swift 3 notices that the extension is on an nsobject subclass and automatically exposes the properties to objective-c

46041569
swift	objective-c
swift 4 doesn t automatically expose everything to objective-c anymore so you won t get this error there and in swift 3 you can work around this by adding the nonobjc keyword
but then once you do add the property in an extension it shadows the original objective-c property making it hard to get at the correct value to return in the property

46041765
implements	extends
here s an excerpt from the xamarin documentation using either interfaces or base classes defined in the shared code and implements or extended in platform-specific projects
writing and extends shared code with class abstractions is particularly suited to portable class libraries because they have a limited subset of the framework available to them and cannot contain compiler directives to support platform-specific code branches

46044285
ionic	angular
check out the ionic docs on how to work with 3rd party libs
you are trying to import a named export izitoast like you are used to in ionic angular but izitoast is not built on the es2015 standard which means we have to import it like this after running npm install izitoast --save import izitoast from izitoast

46047667
ssl	socks
note that this is not the method proposed in draft-aft-socks-ssl-00 in 1997 which proposed layering tls over the top of socks framing imo an unnecessarily complicated way of doing it which only provides a single benefit - being able to negotiate ssl or not - with a lot of down-sides
wingate socks server supports accepting a connection tcp and immediately performing a tls handshake on it prior to socks protocol

46047686
sudo	passwd
you can not only use the sudo command to run some program as administrator but the sudo command can also be used to run some program as certain user
i don t know if it is possible to configure sudo in a way that a certain command can be executed as certain user without asking for a passwd

46048509
virtualenv	conda
on windows you delete env-vars by setting them to nothing. i ve always used conda to manage my environments but as far as i know it s based on virtualenv so i don t see why something similar wouldn t also be possible with virtualenvwrapper
with conda you can create these files which will be executes when the environment is activated

46049165
ssl	https
it just means that you are allowing every type of url loading in your application whether it is with ssl https or not
if you don t set nsallowarbitraryloads to true then your app will block access to urls that don t use ssl https

46051246
build.gradle	gradlew
you need to add this filters abifilters to your app module s build.gradle files
so when your device try to run your app it will check gradlew file and understands that it should not generate any folder and use existing native library resources

46054536
pandas	dask
you can not safely modify a partition your second case when you map_partitions a function that modifies a pandas dataframe in place is not safe
dask expects to be able to reuse data call functions twice if necessary etc

46057237
bash	zsh
hence i was using just my assumption the zsh interpreter and not the sh or bash interpreter
by realizing that this could be a potential problem i googled and found the following how to iterate through string one word at a time in zsh so i tested the following and it works as expected note doesn t seem to work as i expected in zsh

46057318
csv	tsv
essentially it looks like you have a bunch of files with comma-delimited values but not actual csv since the data in the first row is not the header and is also different from the rest of the data and want to export that as a tsv tab-separated values file
since your input data is not really csv i wouldn t bother with import-csv

46063051
client-side	server-side
- the choices.js lib is available only for client-side
so nuxt tried to renderer from server-side but from node.js window.document doesn t exist then you have an error

46064531
implements	extends
so objects that extends an interface don t have to implements the method they could just use the default method
any object that implements ia doesn t have to implements addone because there is a default method that would be used

46065215
jspm	npm
i m going to guess you never ran npm install bootstrap 4.0.0-beta --save as you are mentioning copying files in to a versioned node_modules folder and npm doesn t use versioned folders like jspm does
so run npm install bootstrap 4.0.0-beta --save and things should start working

46066845
innodb	myisam
innodb is different in that the write itself is not actually committed until it is complete there s a mechanism for preserving database integrity during a modification so that if there s a failure there it can roll back to the previous state
myisam has no such mechanism and is at the mercy of the filesystem to save it from total corruption

46067068
fgets	fseek
we first read the first number in each line and if it is within the desired range that number is written to output file along with the rest of the line which is obtained with fgets
if the number is not within the desired range we just used fgets to skip that line but you can also use something like fseek for the same

46067068
fgets	fseek
if the number is not within the desired range we just used fgets to skip that line but you can also use something like fseek for the same
fgets will store the trailing new-line n as part of the string that was read into. so we removed it by overwriting the n with the 0 to mark end of string

46069365
jar	war
the webapp classes are packaged in a jar using the attachedclasses configuration option of the maven-war-plugin
i do not mind having this war deployed since it is very lightweigth

46069520
spaces	linefeed
also hwalters already noted that the will not match you need to account for a spaces inside
thus you regex might look like to make sure you have #include then some horizontal spaces and then capture any number 1 or more here with + of non-whitespace chars up to the end of string or a line break crlf or linefeed

46071219
libstdc++	libc++
i m using g++ libstdc++ 6.2.0 and a development valgrind 3.9.0 the problem appears to be with libstdc++ not g++ specifically. your code is correct
if you compile your sample code using clang++ and libc++ then helgrind and drd will not flag any races

46071223
hex	binary
again where dynamic loading linking is used the object file meta-data is required and such systems do not normally load a raw hex file or binary
the elements in points 1 to 3 are not included in the raw binary since they serve no purpose in the application

46071520
debian	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
in linux debian ubuntu this can be solved by selecting a java 1.8 sdk in sudo update-alternatives --config javac changing java_home env variable directly does not seem to have any effect
edit responding to the comments this probably has something to do with the fact that new debian and apparently ubuntu java installations through the package manager do not use the java_home enviroment variable to determine the location of the jre

46073414
google-chrome	firefox
i have tested this on edge s and google-chrome s pdf viewer and it doesn t work
however if i try this on pdf.js in firefox it works

46078610
google-chrome	safari
since that underlying component doesn t support service workers yet fcm push notifications cannot be delivered to google-chrome on ios yet
google-chrome on ios is built on top of the same basic web view as safari

46080594
jar	war
when you are building jar unlike war you will not find the dependencies only one jar without maven-shade-plugin where it will not have its dependencies so use maven-shaded-plugin in your pom.xml of project-1 for generating jar now if you see u will be having two jars after maven build one the original and the other jar with dependencies in pom.xml if you extract the one which is having more size the one with dependencies u can find the jdbc jar here now for project 2 when you include project-1 as a dependency make sure the one which is bigger is included instead of smaller one without dependencies if you are using remote repository when u are pushing the bigger one will get pushed so when u mention it in pom.xml project-1 then the bigger jar will be downloaded once after building it check the project-1 jar whether it is having its own dependencies and finally build the war and deploy source worked on the same kind of scenario and it looks similar to the one i worked before let me know the result mostly it will work if not mycontact es12b1005 iith.ac.in will try to help thanks
providing input as per my understanding you mentioned that i ve also noticed that in the jar file of the first project opening it as an archive there isn t the jdbc connector inside

46080670
wildfly	jboss
on a side note you may want to consider trying to upgrade to wildfly 11 current release is wildfly 11.0.0.beta1
i m not sure if hibernate 5.1.x will work with jboss 7.x

46081108
hive	hdfs
but kafka- spark- hive is not the optimal pipline for your usecase
hive is normally based on hdfs which is not designed for small number of inserts updates selects

46081108
hive	hdfs
hive is normally based on hdfs which is not designed for small number of inserts updates selects
so your plan can end up in the following problems many small files which ends in bad performance your window gets to small because it takes to long suggestion option 1 - use kafka just as buffer queue and design your pipeline like - kafka- hdfs with spark or flume - batch spark to hive impala table option 2 kafka- flume spark to hbase kudu- batch spark to hive impala option 1 has no realtime analysis option

46083308
knitr	latex
however surprisingly btw thanks for bringing it up as we see it here if you are trying to render from console since my assumption knitr or rmarkdown is trying to reuse some cached results this process failed to replicate
it turns out these latex package dependencies were not put into the tex file being generated and ends up with an error

46084655
wildfly	jboss
in addition note that the version numbers of the jboss eap are not the same of the used by wildfly
the jboss eap v 7.0 released in 2016 for java ee 7 uses the wildfly 9.x alias kenny released in 2015 the jboss eap v.7.1beta released in 2017 uses wildfly 10.x released in 2016

46085180
ssl	https
update if this still gives you the same error a redirect loop then it s possible that your ssl is managed by a front-end proxy not your application server
if this is the case then you won t be able to use the https server variable

46085859
opensuse	linux
there is nothing the project can do about that. opensuse repo is back up again
i m pretty sure amazon linux is rhel6 compatible not rhel7 this is what i have for my yum repo and it s been working fine for a while that said the opensuse repo are currently down see the note here note as of the moment sep 6 2017 the opensuse site s publishing of packages is offline

46086289
sse	avx
background on why sse avx is a problem see also agner fog s 2008 post on the intel forums and the rest of the thread commenting on the avx design when it was first announced
he correctly points out that if intel had planned for extension to wider vectors when designing sse in the first place and provided a way to save restore a full vector regardless of width this wouldn t have been a problem

46087731
ubuntu	linux
not all systems even support int 0x80 the windows ubuntu subsystem is strictly 64-bit only int 0x80 doesn t work at all
it s also possible to build linux kernels without ia-32 emulation either

46088687
spaces	delimiter
any character in ifs that is not ifs white- spaces along with any adjacent ifs whitespace characters delimits a field
a sequence of ifs whitespace characters is also treated as a delimiter

46090923
mathml	mathjax
this is due to mathjax s assistivemml extension which injects visually-hidden but accessible mathml into the dom alongside mathjax s output
while the mathml fragment gets user-select none to prevent copy paste this css feature is not supported on all browsers

46094500
serializable	deserialization
it can be done like this now we need to plug it into json-b engine and try serializable
you should not forget to pass a generic type to json-b engine during serializable deserialization

46096174
erlang	elixir
elixir strings called binaries in erlang are represented as a contiguous sequence of bytes in memory not a linked list of bytes characters if that s what you mean by list
they are immutable and a naive implementation of appending two binaries will be o n+m if the strings are of length n and m but the erlang vm optimizes the use case of building a large string if you have two strings a and b and a has free memory after its allocation and you concatenate them the vm only copies b and reuses the old value of a

46098537
dataframe	multi-index
using one of the correct ways to use loc for accessing the data using the same command on the original dataframe i get typeerror only integer arrays with one element can be converted to an index
update as i mentioned before you do not appear to be creating your multi-index correctly

46098918
decimal	ieee
you can not round float to particular precision as amount of decimal digits as internally the float value is sum
b i 2 i values with i being 1..24 for float when the platform does use ieee 754 standard floating point implementation

46103038
super	extends
this special super call will initialise the this keyword in the extends ing class with the instance
to call the parent constructor you need to use super not super.constructor

46103842
subtraction	multiplication
after which doesn t it doesn t perform the subtraction also and is simply written in memory as which would give a faster result as well is true the same holds as it becomes where the compiler sees the 1 and eliminates it in the multiplicand operand and simply writes then doesn t need to perform multiplication and simply writes it as a -a
the main portion when it does a-a it gets converted into bits first then finally after subtraction gives 00000 now these bits do no be converted back to the decimal 0 again by the compiler and can simply be written as 0

46104796
multiplying	multiplication
but remove the eval you re just calling it on a value which it makes no sense to eval . and fails because you re trying to multiplying two vectors something that has never worked you can take the dot-product using or dot or do element-wise multiplication though. the fact that you later try to pass the result of this into σ is irrelevant
the error you get dimensionmismatch cannot multiplying two vectors happens inside the function ig when is evaluated before the result is supposed to be passed to σ

46105118
memcpy	memmove
although it isn t a risk in the code shown nevertheless i normally recommend using memmove rather than memcpy because it works regardless of whether the source and target areas overlap
if you re not certain of no overlap use memmove

46108903
aggregate-functions	sum
date you must use what s called an aggregate-functions to specify what you want to do with all the various values that aren t part of the unique set
sometimes it will be max or min sometimes it will be sum count avg and so on

46117562
ciimage	uiimage
you can turn a uiview into a uiimage and then convert that into a ciimage but all coreimage filters that use an image for input there are some that generate a new image use a ciimage for input and output
please note that the origin for a ciimage is bottom left not top left

46119638
tensorflow	cudnn
if you are using tensorflow gpu v1.3 make sure you are using cudnn v5.1 not 6.0
as stated in the install guide cudnn v5.1

46119693
super	extends
but it seems more reasonable that you should just call super .__init__ in c.__init__ class c b def __init__ self super .__init__ self.draw def draw self super .drawrect it would be weird not to do that anyway
because inheritance sort of implies that you extends rather than override completely

46124303
swift	objective-c
what you re trying to do isn t possible in swift
it s possible in objective-c on nsurl by swizzling the methods but this should never be done in production code

46125270
rsa	dsa
if all of them are commented by default it will allow too the rsa see in man sshd_config the part of hostkey
# hostkey for protocol version 1 #hostkey etc ssh ssh_host_key # hostkeys for protocol version 2 hostkey etc ssh ssh_host_rsa_key #hostkey etc ssh ssh_host_dsa_key hostkey etc ssh ssh_host_ecdsa_key hostkey etc ssh ssh_host_ed25519_key for the client side create a key for ssh not a dsa like in the question by just doing this ssh-keygen after this because there are more options than ssh-dss dsa the client openssh v7 should connect with rsa or better algorithm

46129068
inline	inlining
adding the extra inline is a matter of style
that specifier has to do with linkage and odr violations not actual inlining

46132766
sudo	passwd
we can see this in your log messages locate your pg_hba.conf file inside your postgresql data directory vim the pg_hba.conf file and update the line host all all 127.0.0.1 32 md5 and change it to host all all 127.0.0.1 32 passwd and then restart your postgresql service and then try to authenticate again to expand on the other messages you are seeing when you run the command sudo -u postgres psql -u vpusr vpdb you are not passing the parameter so the connection will attempt to match the line so you will need to check which method of authentication it expects for local connections and authenticate that way or else pass the parameter and then it will match your line host all all 127.0.0.1 32 passwd which means you can then enter your passwd when prompted or else change your connection string to edit if this doesn t fix your problem can you provide all of the lines in your pg_hba.conf file
your application is trying to connect to postgresql using a passwd authentication method but in your pg_hba.conf file the connection type is matching the md5 method so it s expecting a md5 authentication

46134809
persistent	transient
the following rules apply when access field is applied to an entity class mapped superclass or embeddable class mapping annotations may be placed on the instances variables of that class and the persistent provider runtime accesses persistent state via the instances variables defined by the class
all non-transient instances variables that are not annotated with the transient annotation are persistent

46143745
equals	gethashcode
the other issue is that point.gethashcode does not do a stellar job in this test too many collisions so it hammers equals pretty heavily
string has an excellent gethashcode implementation

46151424
caffe	mxnet
direct conversion from tensorflow is not yet supported but you can use caffe architecture with tf to make it work
yes you can if your machine learning model is in one of the following format caffe keras xgboost scikit-learn mxnet libsvm . there s tutorial and examples for each of them on awesome core ml

46152537
vsts	tfs
source link also take a look at this similar question validate pull request with jenkins in vsts and you could vote up the related uservoice to get more attention
it is impossible with tfs for now where jenkins could not signal the result of the build which shows up in the code view of the branch

46154465
rdf	owl
protégé is not an rdf editor
rdf is an abstract syntax for owl serialization

46154465
rdf	owl
if you declare rdf object as an datatype property they can be literals but then they can not be objects with uris
the reason of this limitation is that protégé is not an owl full editor but rather an owl 2 dl editor

46154789
cashapelayer	cagradientlayer
the rasterization property of cashapelayer defaults to 1 for retina devices and results in blurry images
your issue is not with cagradientlayer but with cashapelayer progresscirclelayer in your code

46158732
subtraction	addition
it works d i only support addition just for this answer and it does not support addition of a negative which is subtraction
plain addition will work

46159416
super	self
the closure attached to meth is the original pre-decoration class and not the same class object as the new generated class this breaks the expectations super has making it impossible to use the 0 argument variant
the super derived self variant explicitly looks up the name derived as a global when called finding the new generated class so works

46166027
cdr	cons
car and cdr are accessors of objects of type cons
since t and hello are not cons you get an error message

46173048
inline	inlining
end edit one reason i think why unsaturated calls to bindings aren t inline is that mostly they don t bring any new optimization opportunities
inlining f 16 yields which isn t really much simpler than f 16

46173048
inline	inlining
no need to inline g also other call sites might share the code generated for g16
that s just one example of how inlining doesn t need to be done while still having efficient code

46173522
google-chrome	firefox
with basic i mean scripts that do not use variables and other advanced ide feature as all this is still missing in the google-chrome ide
problem as you noticed for some reason the ide is marked as compatible with firefox up to 34 only - even so it works just fine in firefox 54

46176028
bower	npm
this skips building installing purescript as a haskell library you can install pulp via npm install pulp - the binary will be installed to node_modules .bin pulp the sample code doesn t compile because you haven t downloaded the dependencies via bower
you can install them via bower install purescript-prelude purescript-console

46177021
ionic	angular
ionic does not provide native application
have a look at nativescript + angular

46179674
bash	zsh
bash regex flavor ere doesn t support backreference in regex
ksh93 and zsh support it though

46179878
ubuntu	linux
in ubuntu would be like this find more details in official documentation page
docker 17.xx + edit the daemon.json file whose default location is etc docker daemon.json on linux or c programdata docker config daemon.json on windows server if the daemon.json file does not exist create it

46185860
namenode	hdfs
hdfs namenode
hdfs namenode -format command just format the namenode it wouldn t bring namenode service up

46185860
namenode	hdfs
hdfs namenode -format command just format the namenode it wouldn t bring namenode service up
in order to run hdfs namenode you have you need to execute start-dfs.sh also you can run namenode in the foreground using the below command after namenode format for testing

46187355
prepare	execute
not need to prepare the statement inside the for-loop it also doesn t change
bindparam binds a parameter and when the parameter changes all you need to do is call execute again and it will run the query with the new parameter value

46188889
lxml	html5lib
if lxml does not exist you can install it using pip install lxml you could also use a different parser to the same effect
html.parser and html5lib are both available by default

46188971
kerberos	ldap
with kerberos after the first authentication the client holds a ticket that will be good for a default of 10 hours so that additional authentication attempts do not have to overload your directory authentication server again
and the client will take care of getting authentication tickets to target resources rather than the application server doing this on behalf of clients which is what those application servers have to do if ldap authentication mechanism is in play

46188971
kerberos	ldap
kerberos in pure microsoft active directory environments will do both authentication and authorization for you while directory look-ups is always ldap
also ldap is not single sign-on

46188971
kerberos	ldap
users must always manually enter username password while with kerberos they do not have to do this
now if you use kerberos for authentication and ldap for directory look-ups and or group-based authorization than that is the best practice as ldap was originally designed per the rfcs as a directory lookup protocol only

46191697
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
edit i m sorry i did not read that you re not using a uinavigationcontroller
an uinavigationbar without an uinavigationcontroller have no sense

46192822
swift	objective-c
and how to check screen size of iphone 4 and iphone 5 programmatically in swift the iphone x height is 2436 px from device screen sizes and resolutions from device screen sizes and orientations swift 3 and later objective-c xamarin.ios based on your question as follow or use screensize.height as float 812.0f not int 812
for more information you can refer the following page in ios human interface guidelines adaptivity and layout - visual design - ios - human interface guidelines swift detect with topnotch objective-c update do not use the userinterfaceidiom property to identify the device type as the documentation for userinterfaceidiom explains for universal applications you can use this property to tailor the behavior of your application for a specific type of device

46199148
equals	compareto	comparator	comparable
note that the ordering maintained by a tree map like any sorted map and whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if this sorted map is to correctly implement the map interface
see comparable or comparator for a precise definition of consistent with equals. this is so because the map interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a sorted map performs all key comparisons using its compareto or compare method so two keys that are deemed equal by this method are from the standpoint of the sorted map equal

46205072
sudo	passwd
quoting the relevant parts of the answer actually a typical invocation of sudo does not read the passwd from stdin at all
instead sudo will directly access the controlling terminal a tty or pty via the dev tty special file and output the prompt and read characters directly

46208435
allocator	stl
it also says that for some allocator implementations it should return rather than the stl containers - std vector std map or std list use max_size to calculate container size in terms of object count not byte count
therefore max_size should not return the number of bytes available on the operating system but use the number of available bytes to calculate the number of objects the allocator can hold

46208435
allocator	stl
therefore max_size should not return the number of bytes available on the operating system but use the number of available bytes to calculate the number of objects the allocator can hold
if you wrote an allocator class for stl containers you could implement the max_size function like this to provide an accurate object count instead of over-estimating by using

it s not a matrix multiplication

listview	gridview
in xamarin there are many ways to achieve it because it isn t supported by default use a custom listview as flowlistview
use a wraplayout maybe in a future we will have a gridview such as in wpf that is exactly what you are looking for

46216845
voip	sip
either way unless you are doing this for learning or academic purposes it may be easier to use a voip library which will have solved these issues for you - there is quite a lot of complexity in both the signalling and the voice commuicaton for voip calls
android has a built in sip library now this does require a sip server of some sort even if you build it into your client which may not be what you want

google-chrome	firefox
short answer it s needed in google-chrome but not firefox
google-chrome does not load content scripts into matching pages at extension load which includes extension updates not just initial load

46222473
consistency	acid
cqrs systems tend to be based on the concept of eventual consistency although this isn t essential - the alternative is to use transactions and an acid db if scalability isn t a major concern
with eventual consistency after a command has executed queries to any particular view might see the pre-command state the post-command state eventually all views will be updated with the post-command state

46223606
division	multiplication
we also use div over since div is an integer division
we know for sure that we will not lose data by performing an integer division since either a or a+1 is even and the multiplication of a number with an even number is always even

46226678
ubuntu	linux
i m not sure about services but assuming that your vps is ubuntu or some other debian-based distro you could perform sudo apt-get install lamp-server phpmyadmin on the command line to get your lamp stack setup
this will setup apache web server php and mysql on your linux server

implements	extends
you could also implements it as self.extend otherlist or for extra cleverness don t even bother to write a python level implementation at all and just alias the existing list method since the definition of add is basically identical to existing or list.extend behavior just under a new name aliasing concisely gets the performance of the built-in function
the only downside is that introspection print newline.add will not indicate that the function s name is add because it s __iadd__ or extends

portrait	landscape
device orientation when using uiwebview on ios 11.0 rotating from portrait landscape portrait causes the safe-area-inset not to be re-applied causing the content to be obscured by the notch again as highlighted by jms in a comment below
also happens if app is launched in landscape then rotated to portrait this doesn t happen when using wkwebview via cordova-plugin-wkwebview-engine

46232871
portrait	landscape
this way image view for portrait will be visible and text view pinned to image view and in landscape image view will be hidden and text field pinned to top of the view
when using auto layout you can leverage size classes. see description below or example here set image view for compact width and height wc hc - iphone in landscape and for wr hc iphone plus in landscape to not installed constraint between text field and image view not enabled for wc hc and wr hc and finally for wc hc and wr hc you have to define text fields s top contraint - i did it to the top of the view

ssl	https
and if you re not you probably should be as heroku now handles ssl certificates for you automatically and for free for all applications running on paid dynos
if you re not using https you can just set up a 301 redirect record with most dns providers pointing name www to

46234766
ssl	https
if you want to know why check out these short and long explanations but basically since your dns provider or other url forwarding service doesn t have and shouldn t have your ssl certificate and private key they can t respond to https requests for your domain
to handle the redirects at the application level you ll need to add both your apex and www host names to the heroku application heroku domains add example.com and heroku domains add www.example.com set up your ssl certificates point your apex domain record at heroku using an alias or aname record as described above add a cname record with name www pointing to www.example.com.herokudns.com

in general asymmetric encryption such as rsa is not used to encrypt data data is in general encrypted with symmetric encryption such as aes.the choice usually boils down to the need for separate encryption and decryption keys and or pki
both are as secure at comparable key sizes and aes is much faster

all major browsers support h.264 video
ie 9+ supports mp4 but not webm unfortunately

46247463
spaces	linefeed
you can keep this from being a problem by telling the read command to treat the carriage return as whitespace like spaces tabs etc since read automatically removes whitespace from the beginning and end of lines note that since this assignment to ifs which basically lists the whitespace characters is a prefix to the read command it only applies to that one command and doesn t have to be set back to normal afterward
your database_list file is in dos windows format with carriage return + linefeed at the end of each line

profiling	debugging
below is what would work once selenium driver is patched to allow sending encoded profiling
so i have digged into this issue debugging the code and this seems to be limitation bug currently in selenium web-driver when getmulticapabilities returns multiple browsers then protractor creates a fork of the process to run the test this forked process is then sent the profiling you created as json the childprocess can only receive json data in form of text and not in form of a profiling object later creategeckodriver function is called with profiling object

but as the code of creategeckodriver it is always expecting a profiling object so this code needs to be fixed in selenium webdriver itself and it should check if the profiling sent is already encoded or not

if you need higher maxclients increase ulimit -n . i have seen a lot of posts telling you to modify etc security limits.conf redis soft nofile 10000 redis hard nofile 10000 or that might work in ubuntu 14.04 but it certainly not works in ubuntu 16.04
i guess it has something to do with changing from upstart to systemd but i am no expert of linux kernel

multiplying	division
what do you think about explanation this solution try to achieve two objectives do not overflow avoid to use if then else condition and be pipeline friendly to avoid overflow we first divide and the multiplying
once division is done to half the number by 2 it has an interesting property if number is odd the division is exact and can be done by a simple right sifting by 1

46270023
division	modulo
the two times that 60 goes into 135 is not returned so you ll need to find that value with a standard division operator
you can divide by 60 to get minutes then also use the modulo to return the remaining seconds

46272470
keras	tensorflow
otherwise just for making it work you can use tools provided by keras so that you do not have to go through the complexity of tensorflow
keras can use both theano and tensorflow as backend

46273787
swift	objective-c
this is basically due to bs in the swift - objective-c bridging magic
if you check the dynamic type on the value returned by notification.object you ll see it s not actually your error type but rather an opaque type called _swiftvalue that is used to wrap swift value types for objective-c apis which only take classes

46275579
build.gradle	gradlew
i guess if you are having different build.gradle files for your respective modules and these modules are linked by some parent build.gradle file then there should not be any issue
i m not an expert on gradlew but using maven for a long time and these are somehow similar in nature

multiplying	subtract
multiplying by 24 and rounding it does not change the data type
and subtract one timestamp from another give the difference as a interval day to second data type longer answer note to_date 18-09-18 06 30 yyyy-mm-dd hh24 mi will give a year of 0018 not 2018

46280785
octal	decimal
alternatively and more portably you can convert the number with an arithmetic expansion first this uses the base # n notation to indicate that n in our case is in base 10 and not octal
it s because numbers with a leading zero are interpreted as octal by bash and octal 50 is decimal 40

46287889
floating-point	fractions
...because of course that method overload has to return a floating-point type since by definition an int type could not store fractions of a value
thus and contain floating-point values specifically double so when this line.

google-chrome	firefox
not just limiting this answer to webkit-based browsers... google-chrome if you launch it from a command line terminal with then it provides window.gc

ionic	angular
using this you can create a simple doughnut chart with click event as follows template component live demo this shouldn t be too hard to implement in ionic 2 note this is just a basic example of a doughnut chart and you can customize it further to fit your need following the official documentation
you should use ng2-charts which is a chartjs wrapper for angular 2 4

multiplying	addition
the bias is added to the recurrent cell after the matrix multiplying
it doesn t matter whether it s added to inputs after the matmul or to the recurrent data after matmul because addition is commutative

46310230
portrait	landscape
for me this did the trick while max-aspect-ratio takes care of triggering portrait mode simply by resizing the window useful for pcs and other landscape-only devices max-device-aspect-ratio helps with smartphones or other devices with variable orientation
and because i m not declaring specific settings for landscape mode even if max-aspect-ratio is reporting 1 to the system portrait mode will still be triggered by max-device-aspect-ratio if the android device is oriented that way

dplyr	purrr
data modify op s ldf for better demonstration edits as per op s additional requirement in the comments to also extract transmitance ratio columns just change the regex for grep start_with in select does not take regex so use matches instead library dplyr lapply ldf function x select x matches transmitance f|ratio .+ library purrr map_dfc ldf function x select x matches transmitance f|ratio .+
you can try this to actually extract the columns not just the name if you want all extracted columns to be reduced to a single dataframe you can use map_dfc from purrr library purrr map_dfc ldf function x select x starts_with transmitance f map_dfc basically applies the function to each element of the provided list and combines the output of all elements into a dataframe with cbind

apache	nginx
if you develop on apache you need the htaccess in public folder
in nginx this is not needed

46332994
.htaccess	httpd.conf
just because the extension ends in mp4 it doesn t mean there is an mp4 file somewhere . consider .htaccess can change extensions and using mod_rewrite or similar people can redirect a given clean url to any php program
so there may be a php interpreter behind the mp4 requests and apache may have a modified httpd.conf or .htaccess file which routes

hex	binary
of course the iv and encdata should be suitably encoded for instance using hex as in the linked answer or base 64
this is not often done as the iv is always 16 bytes for aes so it is easy to simply prefix the binary iv to the encdata instead

46333706

that tells angular that the template of the component is just

46344026
pyenv	virtualenv
python versions you install using pyenv go into its directory by default pyenv root is .pyenv so are more global than virtualenv
ordinarily you can t duplicate python versions installed through pyenv at least doing so is not the main idea

46344026
pyenv	virtualenv
ordinarily you can t duplicate python versions installed through pyenv at least doing so is not the main idea
to create a virtualenv with a specific python version you need to have that version somewhere in your system whether it s on the path or not and essentially clone it into your newly created virtualenv

octal	hex
finally es2015 also called the 6th edition it s where tc39 decided to start using years introduced an unambiguous octal notation a leading 0o prefix case-insensitive analogous to the 0x prefix for hex
during all this curfluffle about whether a leading 0 should mean octal crockford was defining json and not allowing the leading 0 simplifies things and avoids confusion both of which were important when json was defined

swift	objective-c
the swift key path syntax doesn t only work with those though
it can also be used to refer to properties of non- objective-c classes and structs

bower	npm
the issue is because bower is not installed in your windows machine. try to install bower before installing this angularjs template
use the following command to install bower npm install -g bower also check if gulp - task automation tool is install or not

use the following command to install bower npm install -g bower also check if gulp - task automation tool is install or not
use the following command to install the same npm install -g gulp now use npm install to install the project and its package dependencies

46351943
google-chrome	firefox
browsers like google-chrome wait for a certain time and if they do not receive a response assume request is lost and send another request on it s own which is quite possibly the case on your end.note that the same issue does not happen in browsers like firefox and ie
what we did to avoid that situation is to get the method work asynchronously and have the response back to the ajax method within that interval of time to avoid google-chrome from issuing a request again

46352965
tensorflow	cudnn
it appears that tensorflow v1.3.0 now uses cudnn v6
tensorflow installation with pip did not give any errors but i fixed my problem by installing cudnn v6 instead of cudnn v5.1

46353070
virtualenv	conda
you need to do this every time you open a new terminal if you want to use the copy of python you ve made in that virtualenv
source activate my_super_env if you re curious you can check which python you re using which python to check which modules are installed in the active environment you can use conda list if you re missing keras tensorflow or any other dependency this will do the trick conda install keras 2 i m assuming you mean this demo model which does have plenty of print statements so i would take the lack of output to mean it s not really running

46353161
swift	objective-c
the cellclass parameter in objective-c is simply class with the swift equivalent being anyclass
unlike in swift objective-c doesn t support declaring that the value of class anyclass be any specific type

46353161
swift	objective-c
unlike in swift objective-c doesn t support declaring that the value of class anyclass be any specific type
so when this api is translated for swift you are left with the generic anyclass in swift

46357314
swift	objective-c
depending on what you re actually doing you re probably better off using a mutable swift array declared as a var
however if you really do need reference semantics for some reason you can make an nsmutablearray like this the reason you cannot just cast it is because the objective-c bridge bridges a swift array to an immutable nsarray which would throw an exception if you tried to call the mutating methods on it

46360311
swift	objective-c
update for swift 4
initialize is no longer exposed method initialize defines objective-c class method initialize which is not permitted by swift so the way to do it now is to run your swizzle code via a public static method or via a singleton

46361376
inline	inlining
some functions cannot be inline functions using alloca or vararg functions functions whose definitions are not available but member functions do not prevent inlining
when an inline member function is called the compiler does what it does for any function call prepare the arguments and invoke the function

46361469
inline	inlining
it is unrelated to static or not functions marked or not as inline
so you should not care about inlining it is an implementation and optimization detail but you hope that the compiler will do a good job

icmp	udp
by default most unix traceroute implementations linux osx will not use icmp echo requests
they use udp packets to an unlikely port

46386334
google-chrome	firefox
however the difference is not that important and google-chrome is running for...of faster than native for-loop so i would recommend to use for...of when dealing with object.values in any cases 4th and 6th tests
in firefox the for...in loops is really slow so when we want to cache the key during the iteration it is better to use object.keys

46386520
swift	objective-c
with swift code being present in the framework you cannot do that
all c++ code must be confined to the objective-c++ wrapper s implementation files .mm extension not .m used for objective-c files

46386572
bash	subshell
when an interactive shell that is not a login shell is started bash reads and executes commands from etc bash.bashrc and .bashrc if these files exist
with bash you can invoke a subshell interactively using the -i option

46391371
mockito	jmockit
with easymock jmock mockito static methods constructors and new -ed objects cannot be mocked at all
powermockito supports full mocking as well but still focused on mock objects specifically new-ed objects must be replaced with mock objects through whennew recording while with jmockit a test can simply declare a mocked field

46391371
mockito	jmock
also in the mocking api expectations can be explicitly verified after the tested code was exercised just like in mockito
easymock jmock do not support this verification model

the problem also applies for greenplum like you later declared which is not postgresql
it was forked from postgresql in 2005 and developed separately

46392396

postgresql	greenplum
obviously you are using the one shipped with postgresql 8.2.15 but the rdbms is still greenplum not postgresql

46397321
laravel	codeigniter
if you that is huge number you might be interested in hosting your application to cheap and yet powerful virtual private server vps if you do not have a real time requirement then meteor is overkill and not really required definitely there are other frameworks available as in php you may use yii2 php framework which is very mature framework or you may use laravel 5.x
codeigniter is little immature and lacks many advanced feature that can make application real secure and developed fast

46405960
keras	tensorflow
from keras import backend as k and put this at the end of predict k.clear_session or you can just build one model and feed that as input to the predict function so you are not building a new one each time
if you are using tensorflow backend you will be building a model for each img in the for loop

46407420
bower	npm
first install the bower by following npm install -g bower then run the app by gulp serve
the issue is from bower as bower is not installed into the system

46408045
swift	objective-c
part of it is that swift does not have a very strong type system
compared to objective-c or ruby sure it s incredibly powerful but it s still fairly weak around generic types and there are many concepts you can t express there are no higher-kinded types there is no way to express covariance or contravariance no dependent types and there are weird quirks like protocols don t always conform to themselves

46414732
addition	modulo
i ve added an additional time setting as well as an addition including milliseconds and time period for others use dt_format datetime format to check against in your case it s date time - separation by a space character following the define block is which simply matches the dt_format as specified above ensuring what precedes and supercedes it is a word boundary character or no character b leap year to further understand the leap year section of the regex.
i am assuming the following all years are not leap years unless the following is true year modulo 4 is 0 and year modulo 100 is not 0 or year modulo 400 is 0 source leap year calculation leap years have always existed at least since year 1 - since i don t want to start assuming and do even more research

46415999
avr	microcontroller
on avr 8-bit risc microcontroller which use 16-bit pointers it would be cheaper to just take a lock on the data structure instead of letting std atomic use locks for every load store in this algo
especially since there aren t multi-core avr cpus so locks are probably very cheap to implement. also gets the compiler to assume that a value could be asynchronously modified by another thread

the queueing really happens inside the zip function which carries an internal queue
as far as switching between fifo and lifo i m not sure what criteria you want but here s a fifo version of drain

46435950
namedtuple	dictionary
maybe even return a namedtuple from your function so you have the semantic information what value is what
or return a custom object or store it in a dictionary if you are just mapping names to positions but functions returning multiple things at the same time are usually not that easily understood on their own

46439745
dictionary	map
if it is guaranteed that all array elements are present as keys in the dictionary then you can do to avoid a runtime crash if a key is not present use to ignore unknown keys or to map unknown keys to a default string
you can map each array element to the corresponding value in the dictionary

46440564
pthreads	fork
the problem is that when you have multiple threads in a process after fork system call you cannot continue safely running the program in pthreads systems
for example linux manuals fork 2 after a fork 2 in a multithreaded program the child can safely call only async-signal-safe functions see signal 7 until such time as it calls execve 2

it was when i did the swift migration to 4 and selected the first option recommended which did not attach objective-c property to variables that needed it
mainly my entire node class needed objective-c property on the variables which the second option match swift 3 behavior did do and my desktop application ran without any crashes

keras	tensorboard	keras	tensorflow
since the loop over epochs is not exposed in the keras sequential model one way to collect scalar variable summaries with a custom frequency would be using keras callbacks
in particular you could use tensorboard assuming you are running with tensorflow backend or csvlogger any backend callbacks to collect any scalar variable summaries training loss in your case setting will save loss every 10 epochs

hive	hdfs
creating table with and without location option creating table with and without partition option adding new data using the hive load and insert statements adding data files to the table location outside of hive using hdfs commands and refreshing the table using the msck repair table command dropping the tables
the only difference in behaviour not the intended usage based on my limited research and testing so far using hive 1.1.0 -cdh5.12.0 seems to be that when a table is dropped the data of the internal managed tables gets deleted from the hdfs file system while the data of the external tables does not get deleted from the hdfs file system

tripledes	3des
i am going to talk about tripledes but i guess this would apply to other algorithms used by this site step 1 it first checks if the key entered has the length that it expects it to be you can find a table at the bottom of that site telling the length of key for each encryption algorithm if it does not it will complete with 0x00 bytes like this so for example the length that it expects for 3des is 24 bytes
if you happen to enter just 15 bytes like this 112233445566778899aabbccddeeff it will be like if you entered 112233445566778899aabbccddeeff00 step2 in the case of tripledes the algorithm to expand the 16 bytes to 24 bytes key which is the key length required by the algorithm this site has a simple approach to do that it copies the first 8 bytes and append it to the end of the key like this and that is the key that is going to be given to the 3des encryption function to work with this simple approache is not used by openssl for example open ssl uses the first 8 bytes of the md5 of the key and append them to the 16 bytes of the original key to get the 24 bytes key that is required by 3des like this summary in that tool if you enter the key 112233445566778899aabbccddeeff is the same as if you entered 112233445566778899aabbccddeeff00 and same as if you entered 112233445566778899aabbccddeeff001122334455667788 so to solve your problem you should give your function the complete 24 bytes of key that you gave to that site and you will surely get the same results beacause nodejs is probably is doing the same thing as openssl does to expand the key uses md5 ps if you are using the cbc mode which is your case try to specify the iv to be 8 bytes of x00 like this 0000000000000000 the results will be the same

multiplying	subtract	multiplying	multiplication
first multiplying the whole image with the row vector then the column vector
taking the row vector -1 0 1 across the image we end up with 2 2 2 2 2 -3 2 -3 -3 and then passing the column vector through to be multiplied and summed we again get 8 3 -7 one other nifty trick that may or may not be helpful depends on your tradeoffs between memory and efficiency note that in the single row multiplication you ignore the middle value and just subtract the right from the left values

we need digest of messages that counts how many times a given message has been received a digest of messages that have been received and are already over the magic number so we don t re-send one if it is way late and a list of processes enrolled in our system so we know to whom we are broadcasting the following example is in erlang because i just trip over elixir syntax ever since i stopped using it... here i am using a uuid but it could be whatever
an erlang reference would be fine for a test case but since gossip isn t useful within an erlang cluster and references are unsafe outside the originating system i m just jumping to the assumption this is for a networked system

uiview	cashapelayer	uiview	calayer
read now time for some qna question 1 my understanding is that uiview as part of uikit uses a normal calayer under the hood to draw its content
if this is correct then cashapelayer or calayer in general would be the exact same thing only without the extras uikit gives you again quoting apple doc layer-backed views create an instance of the calayer class by default and in most cases you might not need a different type of layer object. however core animation provides different layer classes each of which provides specialized capabilities that you might find useful. choosing a different layer class might enable you to improve performance or support a specific type of content in a simple way clearly when you try to draw various shapes using cashapelayer is beneficial in terms of performance when compared to calayer

for all that it takes to have a generic config file with custom defined variable substitution rules ready a bash script is still needed to carry out the actual substitution and you still have to code your command line to accept all the variable substitutions so either you have config files with no variable substitution which means you hard code and repeat the config file for different scenarios or the substitution logic with custom variable substitution rules make your in-app config file logic much more complex

keystore	jks
as far as i know you need to put your certificates into a jks keystore because tomcat only accepts certificates from within keystore so tomcat is ignoring your configuration params and is searching for a keystore within the default path
tomcat currently operates only on jks pkcs11 or pkcs12 format keystore see tomcat documentation see documentation for importing certificates into keystore in addition from the tomcat website when tomcat starts up i get an exception like java.io.filenotfoundexception some-directory some-file not found

factors	matrix
conclusion so the original absurd factors of x10 000 difference was largely due to mistakenly comparing element-wise multiplication in python numpy to c code and not compiled with all of the available optimisations and written with a highly inefficient memory access pattern that likely didn t utilise the cache. a fair comparison ie
correct but highly inefficient single-threaded algorithm compiled with -ofast yields a performance factors difference of x350 a number of simple edits to improve the memory access pattern brought the comparison down to a factors of x16 in numpy s favour for large matrix 10000 x 10000 multiplication

furthermore numpy automatically utilises all four virtual cores on my machine whereas this c does not so the performance difference could be a factors of x4 - x8 depending on how well this program ran on hyperthreading

the way you re implements allauthmixin by also calling dispatch means you need to have them both in its mro and trick super into choosing the appropriate one which is not a good idea

note if your compiler supports the c99 variable length array objects you can use a vla instead of dynamically allocating that is not addressed here you have three tools to allocate memory dynamically malloc calloc and realloc
calloc does the same thing as malloc but initializes all bytes to zero -- useful when you want to insure all memory is initialized and only slightly slower than malloc for your example you could allocate memory dynamically for your objects as follows note the additional information in the below example use output memory use error check in any code you write that dynamically allocates memory you have 2 responsibilities regarding any block of memory allocated 1 always preserve a pointer to the starting address for the block of memory so 2 it can be freed when it is no longer needed

however ssl will not work with the useurls method --- so that means if you try to add a url starting with https the program will throw the exception system.invalidoperationexception https endpoints can only be configured using kestrelserveroptions.listen . endpoint configuration
using https and binding a ssl certificate https endpoints can only be configured using kestrelserveroptions

46625043
pandas	seaborn
just plot with pandas bar plot
most often a seaborn countplot is not really necessary

46625706
uicollectionview	uitableview
if you need something to get you started with uicollectionview here is a starter for you
what you are trying to achieve is not possible with uitableview since it allows data to only be listed as linearly from top to bottom

46630451
implements	extends
the method getscreenshotas is implements in remotewebdriver class
you can t use it from your driver instance because you used the webdriver interface which doesn t extends takesscreenshot interface to create the driver instance

46635698
shadowing	named
however it does mention the possibility of accidental shadowing
it may be that an earlier go version supported this but has since been changed to prevent bugs due to this kind of named collision however i have not found anything pertaining to this

46638930
ionic	angular
references ionic navcontroler angular lifecycle hooks es6 classes
constructor a constructor is not an angular feature it is called by the javascript engine

46641124
explode	substr
you can inputds.selectexpr split substr value 2 length value - 2 s+ as value and explode the output
exception is thrown by from_json col value arraytype stringtype not explode specifically input schema array must be a struct or an array of structs

46641323
factors	matrix
that means that to be able to create model 2 you just have to chance the order in which to specify the factors
model 2 instead do this model 2 same model but not triangular matrix

46645615
spaces	delimiter
i would advise you to simply stop wanting the spaces -- it is a hassle to deal with delimiter identifiers in any database
but as the documentation explains firebird does not necessarily support them delimiter identifiers are available in dialect 3 only

46648442
bash	subshell
i am not very good in shell-stuff but as far as i understand this code its explanation would be like the search results of your find will be passed on to a bash-command bash -c where your search result will be inside of 1 as source file
the target that follows is the result of a substitution within a subshell where the content of 1 here just 1 inside your parameter-substituion 1 find replace will also be your search result

46649861
octal	hex
clue #1 clue #2 per the docs python interprets ooo as the ascii character with octal value ooo and xhh as the ascii character with hex value hh
since 9 is not a valid octal number 195 is interpreted as 1 and 95

46649861
octal	hex
since 9 is not a valid octal number 195 is interpreted as 1 and 95
hex 195 is 0xc3

46650083
bash	tcsh
to fix this you can modify the first line of that file to read in tcsh setenv serves a similar purpose to export in bash so using just set would not reliably change your path
as a side note you appear to be making the same modification to your bash path over and over.

46654419
ssl	https
so in short if the original page was downloaded via plain http there is almost no point in making a subsequent request over ssl - anything in the ssl request can be known to the attacker already
note that some special cases may be exceptions from this but in general this is the case. one notable exception is when it s not the request that needs to be protected but the response - that will be encrypted in an ssl exchange and i think a different protocol https vs http will count as a different origin so it will be harder to get info from the response even if javascript is injected into the original plaintext page

46662661
build.gradle	gradlew
put this in to your build.gradle
as stated by miensol you cannot put your file to main and flavor specific folders and expect gradlew to work the same way android resource system works

46662898
dictionary	map
just use the enumerate function it produces your key-value pairs out of the box dictionary enumerate arg dictionary takes an iterable of key-value pairs the dictionary in arg are not copied
if that s an issue you can use a map over dict.copy dictionary enumerate map dict.copy arg or use a single dictionary comprehension your code created a double loop

46663148
ssms	sqlcmd
it is not a tool which is used within ssms itself or any other sql client
the reason you are getting that error is because you need to execute sqlcmd in a windows command prompt environment not in a sql editor environment such as ssms

46663148
ssms	sqlcmd
the reason you are getting that error is because you need to execute sqlcmd in a windows command prompt environment not in a sql editor environment such as ssms
sqlcmd is a separate executable .exe utility which has some equivalence to a gui such as ssms in that it is another type of client program for communicating with the database server

46664889
awt	swing
note every call to awt included swing of course must be encapsulated in a call to eventqueue.invokelater to ensure you are running stuff in the awt thread because setting a label must not be done outside the awt thread
do not forget to create a thread when you receive an input from awt that takes time

46665023
debian	linux	centos	linux	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
in short this will affect rhel related distributions centos fedora and debian related distributions debian ubuntu
this is not just a ubuntu issue but also a linux world wide issue

46669568
punctuation	words
that can be fixed by preprocessing the document or postprocessing the result of the split with a function that removes the punctuation
the following code is not exactly equivalent to your slow version but it demonstrates the idea differences limitation in your version a words is counted even if it is contained as a substring in a words in the document

46669568
punctuation	words
my solution doesn t account for punctuation in the documents
for example the words again in the second document comes out of split with the full stop attached to it

46671494
google-chrome	safari
gmail app on ios user clicks on link in email and gmail opens external google-chrome browser which opens a google link which redirects to link a which redirects via 302 to universal link b
this case works only if google-chrome is installed and in gmail settings the user explicitly changed the default browser to google-chrome these cases do not work apple mail user clicks on link a in email and external safari is opened

46674473
direct3d	directx
see anatomy of direct3d 11 create device if you are new to directx development i recommend taking a look at the directx tool kit tutorials
the most likely cause is that you have set the d3d11_create_device_debug creation flag but your system does not have the direct3d debug device installed

46674473
direct3d	directx
the most likely cause is that you have set the d3d11_create_device_debug creation flag but your system does not have the direct3d debug device installed
running the legacy directx sdk doesn t work on windows 7 sp1 with directx 11.1 or later to get the developer runtime

46677939
apache	nginx
nginx is like apache or iis and will run as a service
phusion passenger is a plugin for nginx so doesn t need to be run separately

46678633
virtualenv	conda
i for one will be running pip install from a virtualenv without ever touching docker conda unless i have a good reason
your lack of requirements.txt is not a good reason conda came out in 2012 - well before docker

46678736
prepare	execute
and pl pgsql functions handle all sql statements like prepare statements internally
with the notable exception of dynamic sql with execute . each for the scope of the current session not beyond

46681141
decoder	encoder
based on your questions 1- decoder layers are not always mirrored version of the encoder layers
you can check mask r-cnn yolo and similar network architecture to check that decoder is consisted by 1-2 layers while encoder is consisted by multiple layers

46684171
aggregate-functions	sum
exceptions include aggregate-functions which generally remove null prior to doing the aggregation
this means sum a just doesn t consider rows where a is null while sum a + b will discard rows where either a is null or b is null because a+b is null if either of them is null

46689231
implements	extends
the autocloseable states to match to it- it is possible and in fact common for a base class to implements autocloseable even though not all of its subclasses or instances will hold releasable resources
which is how the basestream extends it and the close doesn t impact far more than the streams over the ones using the resources such as files.lines ...

46692515
union	distinct
use union all
the following gives a row count and the sum of the unique counts from each table if you are not using the count distinct then remove it from the subqueries

46692865
implements	extends
as far as i know label does not implements the java cloneable interface and so does not have any built in way to deep copy itself nor does node
you could create your own class which extends label and implements cloneable and in that class override the clone method and do that for every other node you wish to deep copy as well this is the most robust solution but it may be more than you need

46695247
required	placeholder
while the ui does treat package as a required field you can certainly employ bakes that do not required an os package
you will most likely still want to pass some placeholder package argument that can be used to dedupe bake requests

46696098
express	node.js
in both configurations load files from in html express as static file server nginx as reverse proxy express app quick side note the use of __dirname in express.static is not required
under the hood actually it s here on line 65 express uses the native node.js path.resolve

46697643
union	distinct
union all does not
i find select distinct to be more succinct than using the group by

46697756
bash	subshell
much of the remaining time will be in the external retrieval of information by curl bash cannot do anything about that
you can eliminate 80 of your subshell overhead simply by using parameter expansion with substring removal

46706809
noexcept	throw
implicitly defaulted functions the auto-provided copy move operations generally follow the logic of declared as noexcept if and only if all functions which it calls are noexcept
the rule is simple a function is treated as if it can throw exceptions unless it s marked as a function which cannot

46711678
vsto	add-in
microsoft office applications can disable vsto add-in that behave unexpectedly
if an application does not load your vsto add-in the application might have hard disabled or soft disabled your vsto add-in

46711678
vsto	add-in
if an application does not load your vsto add-in the application might have hard disabled or soft disabled your vsto add-in
hard disabling can occur when an vsto add-in causes the application to close unexpectedly

46711678
vsto	add-in
it might also occur on your development computer if you stop the debugger while the startup event handler in your vsto add-in is executing
soft disabling can occur when a vsto add-in produces an error that does not cause the application to unexpectedly close

46711678
vsto	add-in
soft disabling can occur when a vsto add-in produces an error that does not cause the application to unexpectedly close
for example an application might soft disable a vsto add-in if it throws an unhandled exception while the startup event handler is executing

46711678
vsto	add-in
when you re-enable a soft-disabled vsto add-in the application immediately attempts to load the vsto add-in
if the problem that initially caused the application to soft disable the vsto add-in has not been fixed the application will soft disable the vsto add-in again

46711678
vsto	add-in
if the problem that initially caused the application to soft disable the vsto add-in has not been fixed the application will soft disable the vsto add-in again
read more about that in the how to re-enable a vsto add-in that has been disabled article

46711706
dictionary	map
if you do not need to update the values it tends to be safer to construct a new list since it could be possible that some part of your code can reference to the old list or old dictionary and you do not per se want to change these pandas in case the number of items is huge you can boost performance by using a pandas dataframe then the dataframe is you can keep processing the dataframe or if you want a list of dictionary you can use
pure python yes you can use a generator or list comprehension to obtain the minimum and maximum from operator import itemgetter def min_value rank_norm return min map itemgetter score rank_norm def max_value rank_norm return max map itemgetter score rank_norm your code to normalize the dictionary is fine

46712418
noexcept	throw
unless you mark your functions and methods as noexcept the compiler and standard library may not realize this and may assume your code throw exceptions even though it cannot
in some cases this could cause the compiler to allocate memory and throw an exception out of caution that your code could throw an exception or call a different method copy instead of move for example in certain vector operations

46712958
stateless	stateful
for trivial stateless operations like map or filter it would be much easier to provide support as has been even remarked in a code comment abstract wrapping spliterator that binds to the spliterator of a pipeline helper on first operation. this spliterator is not late-binding and will bind to the source spliterator when first operated on. a wrapping spliterator produced from a sequential stream cannot be split if there are stateful operations present
but it seems that currently this detection has not been implemented and all intermediate operations are treated like stateful operations

46715394
required	placeholder
although not required it is recommended to set parametername to a string beginning with
instead of named values like for the parameter placeholder

46719572
inline	constexpr
having inline applied to variables is a new concept in c++17 but it effectively means that they do not need an explicit definition anywhere
this is really a flaw in c++11 - as others have explained in c++11 a static constexpr member variable unlike every other kind of constexpr global variable has external linkage thus must be explicitly defined somewhere

46720423
ssl	https
here s a good excerpt from the linked resource now that ssl is encouraged for everyone and doesn t have performance concerns this technique is now an anti-pattern
if the asset you need is available on ssl then always use the https asset

46722145
inline	constexpr
live since c++17 constexpr static data member is implicitly inline then such definition is not required again so your code works well from c++17
if a static data member is declared constexpr it is implicitly inline and does not need to be redeclared at namespace scope

46724649
fgets	fread
so fgets wrong method to use and this is the main issue
instead you should pick less smart fread which does not know about lines and stuff and just reads what you told

46726727
opera	google-chrome
note i recommend using opera - it is much faster than google-chrome as it doesn t have memory leaks and comes with a built-in ad blocker
the only issues i have with it is the fact that you can only reorganize the extensions bar by resizing opera to as small as it ll go then using the drop-down menu to move the extensions around but the first 4 will always be in their position - even editing the json doesn t change the order for some reason - looking into it because the json file is edited the same way it would be if done manually so i d recommend installing 4 toolbar extensions first which you won t use and disabling them - then when you want to reorder enable resize order disable

46727446
inline	constexpr
cppreference the inline specifier when used in a decl-specifier-seq of a variable with static storage duration static class member or namespace-scope variable declares the variable to be an inline variable
a static member variable but not a namespace-scope variable declared constexpr is implicitly an inline variable

46727963
implements	extends
or maybe just implements compare as a normal method in the ancestor class instead of using a trait
well i m not an expert but the message seems clear to me the definition is cyclic because derived uses ibase and ibase references derived . according to the documentation require extends should be taken literally

46729053
octal	hex
pedantic the octal escape sequence is a problem on rare machines whose char range exceeds 9 bits
this can be handled with a hex escaped sequences at the string level and not on a char by char basis as hex escaped sequences need a limit

46729888
google-chrome	firefox
as such this question is relevant check whether user has a google-chrome extension installed
however some of the best methods available in google-chrome are currently unavailable in firefox you can t use external messaging from a webpage through externally_connectable as it s not available in firefox

46729888
google-chrome	firefox
however some of the best methods available in google-chrome are currently unavailable in firefox you can t use external messaging from a webpage through externally_connectable as it s not available in firefox
you can t use web-accessible resources for checking presence since firefox intentionally shields them from fingerprinting the files will then be available using a url like this uuid is randomly generated for every browser instance and is not your extension s id

46731661
move	drag
confused about what you re going for based on the description but here s my best guess clicking the map should drag the map as expected clicking the button should click the button as expected moving the cursor around the map should move the button around the map clicking and dragging the button should drag the map not expected by most users i ll reiterate my initial concerns that this ui is a bad idea
users are familiar with seeing buttons overlaid on maps like zoom buttons on google maps and know that to drag the map they click anywhere but the buttons

46732621
realloc	calloc
the problem with your approach is that realloc does not make any guarantees about expanding your array in place
to make a huffman tree it s needed that i create another array pno with pointers to the original array since you have pointers to calloc -ed array inside other struct sno objects calling realloc on the block that has these structures may invalidate all external pointers to these structures

46732943
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome supports it on but not on or elements
firefox doesn t support table elements at all

46734781
multiplication	modulo
the optimal way to calculate b e is not easy to determine but all the ways involve calculating intermediate powers of b the only practical uncertainty is in what order. when you want the result modulo n do all the successive multiplication modulo n calculate b 2 mod n then square and reduce modulo n to get b 4 mod n etc
each time you perform a multiplication take the remainder of the division by n before you do anything else

46735256
dictionary	map
what you probably want is bookmaker_urls to be a dictionary
13 is not a valid property name in .net and the tool you re using seems to try to map each json property to .net class property

46737124
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc
the returned pointer must be deallocated with std free or std realloc
i suspect the intended purpose of the text describing c++ is to make clear that other means of releasing storage including delete are not suitable for use with storage received from std malloc or std calloc

46738871
swift	objective-c
i have adapted my answer to swift 4.0 and xcode 9.0 - swift 4 has its own little issues with this problem
i am having an ibinspectable variable with enum type and xcode 9.0 is not happy showing me this property cannot be marked ibinspectable because its type cannot be representing in objective-c eporediese answers this problem for swift3 in part

46739433
content-length	content-type
edit for the sceptics the following code does not set the content-length and yet correctly returns a 405 response code after having sent a content-length 9 r n header on the wire provided automatically by httpurlconnection and also a request type of post and a content-type application x-www-form-urlencoded r n header neither set by this code
httpurlconnection.setrequestproperty content-length 0

46742692
subtraction	multiplication
for example access-control is equivalent to access - control that s a subtraction and spaces around the operator don t make a difference for the parser
the value you give it isn t valid javascript either because is the multiplication operator which expects two operands left and right

46745945
queue	fifo
if they allowed task2 to succeed then the queue order would not be preserved and you would have successfully removed the second item from the queue rather than the first
there are a number of locking issues with an ireliablequeue because of this fifo behavior

46751421
uicollectionview	uitableview
uicollectionview will lose track of the original number of items in some condition just add a dummy line before insertitems command will avoid this kind of crash hope it could help in your situation
it is a bug in uicollectionview even in ios 11 but not exist in uitableview very easy to reproduce assume the following swift code is working change it to it will crash.

46752631
rpm	yum
as mentioned here ubuntu natively uses deb packages not rpm
yum is for the redhat rpm variant

46758496
hive	hdfs
note confluent s hdfs kafka connect will automatically create hive table partitions for you if you must use hive you can improve the queries better if you convert the data into orc or parquet format
you can use hive for analysis over static datasets but if you have streaming logs i really wouldn t suggest hive for this

46758731
pandas	dask
so since you seem to need an inner merge you should simply do the dask from_pandas method might also be useful in case you want to convert the dask dataframes to pandas ones
johne is right - dask dataframes have a merge method which not coincidentally is very similar to the pandas one

46760367
spaces	delimiter
for example insert a spaces after the quarter or put it into default format first note
unfortunately the implementation does not understand that a quarter can be only one digit so it needs to be delimiter by a non-digit

46761581
fseek	fread
fseek however is not what you are looking for- this moves the file pointer without actually doing anything ie it doesn t read the file
what i think you are actually looking for is fread and fwrite which actually manipulate the file binary

46763316
memcmp	strcmp
for memcmp or carefully-implemented strcmp the best you can do with sse4.2 is slower than the best you can do with sse2 or ssse3 on most cpus
maybe useful for very short strings but not for the main loop of memcmp

46763316
memcmp	strcmp
it looks like you re using explicit-length strings so after checking that the lengths are equal it s just memcmp
or i guess if you need to find the sort order instead of just equal not-equal you d have to memcmp out to the end of the shorter string. for strcmp with 8-bit strings on most cpus it s faster not to use the sse4.2 string instructions

46764889
fgets	getline
if you aim for portability just use fgets
it s not too complicated to write a function similar to getline based on fgets -- here s an example this one removes the newline if it was found and returns a newly allocated buffer which the caller has to free

46766548
libstdc++	libc++
gnu libstdc++ and llvm libc++ are two different implementations of the standard c++ library
apparently your libstdc++ doesn t yet support the coroutines ts so you have to stick to libc++

46770953
realloc	malloc
not to mention you call realloc to not change the size after the first call
and don t use arbitrary values for the malloc call either

46771201
keras	tensorflow
maybe pip install keras could be better in case the conda version doesn t work
again use the proper options not to replace your existing packages - don t let this keras installation replace your numpy packages or your tensorflow packages

46772127
clang	llvm
clang-c2 should support this when msvc updates it to the clang 5.0 compiler last i checked it was 3.8
clang 5 llvm for windows can be downloaded but its integration with visual studio is challenging and some things you want to do may simply not work

46777670
express	node.js
since you re using node.js you ll likely be using express
one thing to note if you ll be using the actions-on-google library is that it expects that express has already populated the req.body with a json object - not with the string body

46780555
uiview	subviews
so since all views in the stack view s arrangedsubviews array are also in the stack view s subviews array you should be able to use the standard uiview apis to rearrange the views z-order bringsubview tofront sendsubview toback exchangesubview at withsubviewat i don t know whether this is possible to do in interface builder or not
from the uistackview documentation the order of the views in the subviews array defines the z-order of the subviews

46786896
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome link
firefox not support

46788573
noexcept	throw
it doesn t need to have a noexcept overload consider this c++17 code there s no need to have a noexcept overload of is_noexcept_callable because in c++17 the exception-specification is part of the type so all the information is already encoded in the type t
when you instantiate std mem_fn with a pointer to a noexcept true function it knows that invoking that function can t throw

46791641
super	extends
if the superclass doesn t have no arguments constructor you get a compile error in the subclassing if you don t call the super constructor with proper arguments because this cannot work automatically
when you create a type particle it first creates an object then extends that object to a geometry and then to a particle

46796329
noexcept	throw
had it not been defined like that it would skew exception specifications of functions that use it in their application of noexcept
because it s considered potentially throw without the specification

46798827
seaborn	matplotlib
as you found out yourself you need to call seaborn.set to get the default style of seaborn or use any other of the seaborn styles
you can also use seaborn styles with matplotlib and not using seaborn at all

46799284
build.gradle	gradlew
the following example sets the android plugin for gradlew to version 2.3.3 from the build.gradle file plugin version required gradlew version
this error is for android plugin version for gradlew not gradlew version

46801370
daemons	systemd
try to change the command you use to sbin init start the container in daemons mode with -d and then look around in a shell using
when you do docker run with bash as the command the init systemd systemd doesn t get started nor does your start script since the command you pass overrides the cmd in the dockerfile

46801731
udp	tcp
for a tcp socket no it is not possible for a udp socket it is allowed
once a tcp socket has been closed it cannot be reused

46807253
google-chrome	firefox
see sluggish scroll behaviour of large ish html table in google-chrome
i can confirm your observation looks like ie and firefox are doing some optimized rendering presumably by using the hardware acceleration but google-chrome isn t

46807253
google-chrome	firefox
i can confirm your observation looks like ie and firefox are doing some optimized rendering presumably by using the hardware acceleration but google-chrome isn t
and i have to disagree with other answers stating that you simply must use smaller tables because the google-chrome slowdown comparing to other browsers is observable with even smaller tables with only a few hundred rows but more complex content

46811669
required	placeholder
in this context sql required the subquery to have a name of some kind and so the z is added as an alias to meet that requirement
you could put anything you wanted there but since the name doesn t matter to us a single-letter placeholder is fine

46813203
spaces	delimiter
it strips all leading trailing whitespace from the line and then splits the line into a list of strings using a single spaces as the delimiter
this may not do what you want if the line contains runs of more than one spaces or if it contains tabs

46813231
keras	tensorflow
2 the second problem was that keras did not use the same session as the native tensorflow objects
this meant that to be able to run the tensorflow object model2 v with my session sess it needed to be reinitialized

46813806
vfork	posix
you could use vfork nptl implementation doesn t call fork handlers
although posix has removed vfork from the standard it s likely available on your implementation

46813806
pthreads	fork
although pthreads has removed vfork from the standard it s likely available on your implementation
fork handlers established using pthread_atfork 3 are not called when a multithreaded program employing the nptl threading library calls vfork

46815810
oncreate	findviewbyid
this way if your edittext is part of the r.layout.fragment_fingerp you can do or just move your code from oncreate to onactivitycreated
method findviewbyid is not implemented in class fragment

46818820
exponent	modulo
what is kept secure is not the modulo but the private exponent and - generally also available - the parameters required to perform the fast exponentiation using the chinese remainder theorem crt
these are basically the parameters such as prime p and q used to calculate the private key and indeed the modulo

46818820
exponent	modulo
the private exponent and the crt parameters are of course not printed
the modulo is enough to identify the private key and you would not want to destroy the security of the private key by printing them out

46820408
decoder	encoder
how it works when encoder encodes number n+1 packet it add there some information about packet n that is useful for decoder if it supports recovery
if decoder does not support recovery then this information is useless and wasting bandwidth

46821201
super	extends
classes have a super binding which part of it is related to 1
the prototype of the class not the prototype property is the super constructor when there s an extends clause

46825073
fgets	realloc
the call of realloc is not affecting fgets - at least not directly predictably or reliably
the first call of fgets input int_max stdin in stringparser has undefined behaviour because the pointer input is uninitialised

46825073
fgets	realloc
practically the call of fgets is probably overwriting some area of memory that it shouldn t
by adding or commenting out the call of realloc the result will be some adjustment of the layout of memory used by your program changing whether code or data is located at the memory location s being overwritten by fgets

46825073
fgets	realloc
by adding or commenting out the call of realloc the result will be some adjustment of the layout of memory used by your program changing whether code or data is located at the memory location s being overwritten by fgets
but this is not because realloc directly affects fgets

46825073
fgets	realloc
but this is not because realloc directly affects fgets
it is simply a side-effect of the fact that calling realloc changes something in your program

intersect	contains
so add more if statements testing intersect with appropriate ranges - so if test is fixed something like if application.intersect range namedrange.namelocal range a2 f2 is nothing then if test is variable then the range at the top would be range cells range test .cells 1 1 .row-1 range test .cells 1 1 .column _ cells range test .cells 1 1 .row-1 range test .cells 1 1 .column + range test .columns.count -1
application.intersect range namedrange.namelocal range type is not nothing if any part of the two ranges overlap - to prove that one is contains within the other you should check that namedrange does not overlap with the ranges above below to the left and to the right of type

46828813
ssl	https
a small guide for nginx or apache2 on how to redirect your traffic from http to https can be found here redirecting to ssl using nginx force redirect to ssl for all pages apart from one
as i already mentioned it in the comments i strongly suggest you to not only serve the login page via https

46831210
factors	mean
i believe determining the y value for the annotation will work as mentioned with the mean of the factors as long as they are numeric
if they are not numeric factors will be assigned counting numbers 1 2 3 .

46833275
division	subtract
you just need some modulo and division to get the hours and minutes from that
you shouldn t calculate the difference between two times expressed in int s by subtract them

46833822
n-gram	words
something to experiment with using tf-idf is different sized n-gram and other pre-processing strategies for your corpus
given your example you may not want to tokenize your words based on word-boundary-splits

46835646
build.gradle	gradlew
in my case i put ndk file at users tomo temp android-ndk-r10e so export android_ndk users tomo temp android-ndk-r10e or if you do not want to change android_ndk you can update reactandroid build.gradle then update reactandroid local.properties and run app from android studio
you have to change your path to android_ndk to run gradlew command locally

46835965
hex	binary
be sure to use a proper hex editor so that all bytes are properly preserved and not reinterpreted as a text editor might do
if you can identify the place in the binary where test.examples.out lives you can replace it with a new string assuming the new string is not longer than the current string

46838940
memcpy	realloc
see also reinterpret_cast creating a trivially-default-constructible object or constructing a trivially copyable object with memcpy for further discussion of the fact that copying bytes to a new location does not create an object in that location
no realloc cannot be used to safely move objects even of trivially copyable types because realloc cannot create new objects in uninitialized storage

46838940
realloc	malloc
so the realloc call ends the lifetime of the old objects and does not create new objects
not only does this imply that realloc isn t suitable to copy trivially copyable objects it also implies that using malloc or operator new size_t to obtain uninitialized storage followed by a memcpy from an existing object into that storage does not create a usable copy of the object as the destination object has also not been created in that case

46839429
nunit	mstest
mstest doesn t do nunit output
nunit3-console can only run nunit tests

46843080
google-chrome	firefox
if you swap to google-chrome you d be much better off just doing something like page.fill_in original password with blah or one final point the resynchronize option went away a long time ago you might want to find a more up to date guide to follow
the reason it s not working for you is due to an unfortunate bug in geckodriver firefox - which is probably also going to affect watir - whereby it assumes any element with a hidden attribute is actually non-visible if the display style is set to anything other than default it actually overrides the hidden attribute but not as far as selenium is concerned

46843700
setinterval	settimeout
you never call clearinterval so the timer you create using setinterval will hang around forever being called every 6 seconds
remember this is setinterval not settimeout so the timer doesn t stop after it has fired the first time

46844770
vsts	tfs
some tfs features are not supported in vsts at all for example vsts does not support integration with sharepoint or project server
some preview features added in earlier version may not be stable enough so tfs team will test the feature and release the stable one in next versions

46846965
jar	manifest.mf
avoid fat jar for example using but i guess that s not the point here tweak the merge strategy see details at
more specifically you could try to set the mergestrategy.concat strategy for merging meta-inf manifest.mf

46849836
swift	objective-c
documentation swift without the objective-c runtime swift on linux does not depend on the objective-c runtime nor includes it
while swift was designed to interoperate closely with objective-c when it is present it was also designed to work in environments where the objective-c runtime does not exist

46849836
swift	objective-c
whereas in objective-c a properties s accessor and instance variables must follow certain patterns a standard properties declaration in swift automatically guarantees this
on the other hand many of the protocol s features are either not relevant or are better handled using native swift constructs or techniques that do not exist in objective-c

46849836
swift	objective-c
on the other hand many of the protocol s features are either not relevant or are better handled using native swift constructs or techniques that do not exist in objective-c
for example because all swift properties are objects you never exercise the default implementation s special handling of non-object properties

46849836
swift	objective-c
also requiring dynamic dispatch swift apis that are callable from objective-c must be available through dynamic dispatch
however the availability of dynamic dispatch doesn t prevent the swift compiler from selecting a more efficient dispatch approach when those apis are called from swift code

46849836
swift	objective-c
however the availability of dynamic dispatch doesn t prevent the swift compiler from selecting a more efficient dispatch approach when those apis are called from swift code
you use the objective-c attribute along with the dynamic modifier to require that access to members be dynamically dispatched through the objective-c runtime

46854319
rpm	yum
the rpm command would also work if you ve already installed or downloaded the package you want to query.
if yum install doesn t find a package with a specified name it will look for packages providing a feature with that name

46855310
pyenv	virtualenv
the trick is that if setuptools can find the test-dependencies in the current environment virtualenv pyenv system python whatever else it will not install them as the eggs and will just use the installed versions
actually you do not even need to declare in that case as the libraries are assumed to be installed into the virtualenv

46862489
realloc	calloc	calloc	malloc
there are older interfaces as well such as brk and sbrk but they are difficult to use an not thread-safe. an implementation of the malloc family of function usually allocates larger blocks using mmap and keeps a watermark pointer for each block which indicates which part has already been allocated to the application at least once via malloc realloc calloc does not matter
calloc checks the watermark pointer before returning an allocation and if the memory was used by the application before it clears it

46865119
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
if you re on windows try installing one of the following super simple web servers web server for google-chrome thttpd or quickshare
you are using an old safari version safari mobile or some other browser that is not recent google-chrome firefox or edge

46870269
strcpy	memmove	strcpy	strncpy
this will result in undefined behavior when strcpy accesses values in the src argument outside the array bounds looking for a nul-terminating character that isn t present
though technically providing a properly sized array for each src and dest and sizing n in strncpy to copy bytes can copy rows by virtue of limiting the read to n chars where no nul-terminating character is present -- but don t do it -- that s what memcpy or memmove is for

46870614
hive	hdfs
users who do not have an existing hive deployment can still enable hive support. when not configured by the hive-site.xml the context automatically creates metastore_db in the current directory and creates a directory configured by spark.sql.warehouse.dir which defaults to the directory spark-warehouse in the current directory that the spark application is started you need to add a hive-site.xml config file to the resource dir. here is the minimum needed values for spark to work with hive set the host to the host of hive
from the spark sql programming guide i highlighted the relevant parts configuration of hive is done by placing your hive-site.xml core-site.xml for security configuration and hdfs-site.xml for hdfs configuration file in conf

46870870
pandas	pytables
the documentation is here the complication of course is that it looks like you are using pytables via pandas and not raw hdf5
pytables is hdf5 but adds a layer of structure and semantics on top of hdf5 s groups and datasets

46871047
mdpi	hdpi
allowed values are 120 160 213 240 280 320 360 400 420 480 560 640 please note that those are densities 0.75 1 1.33 1.5 ... please note that 1.33 does not fit the android list of ldpi mdpi hdpi .
it was needed so there was a value between mdpi and hpdi

46871125
tensorflow	cudnn
if you ever have this problem again make sure to check the official documentation on which exact version of cuda and cudnn to use with your version of tensorflow
just to answer this tensorflow currently on version 1.3 doesn t support cudnn 7 but they will in 1.4

46874473
noexcept	throw
from std vector push_back if t s move constructor is not noexcept and t is not copyinsertable into vector will use the throw move constructor
if it throw the guarantee is waived and the effects are unspecified

46879818
spaces	delimiter
it looks like you are trying to match the spaces after the request url and before the protocol but that is not what is going to happen here at the end of the condpattern
the problem is that the spaces is also the argument delimiter in apache config files

46884863
pthreads	fork
the normal way on a pthreads system would be to use the preexec_fn parameter of subprocess.popen to call a function before starting the command detailed lower in this answer
unfortunately this is intended to occur between the fork and exec system calls and windows do not create processes that way

46891258
sum	coalesce
if you want all div code agent name combos -- even those with no cancels -- use conditional aggregation select div code agent name sum case when cancel date is not null then gross sale else 0 end as gross sale from salessummary group by div code agent name
if the issue is that gross sale could have null values i would recommend select div code agent name coalesce sum gross sale 0 as gross sale from salessummary where cancel date is not null group by div code agent name

46891258
sum	coalesce
if the issue is that gross sale could have null values i would recommend select div code agent name coalesce sum gross sale 0 as gross sale from salessummary where cancel date is not null group by div code agent name
coalesce is the ansi standard function that replaces a null values with the specified value

46892213
mp4	webm
but that won t work for mp4 input
it doesn t look like the mediarecorder supports ogg output but you can try switching to webm by doing mediarecorder.setoutputformat mediarecorder.outputformat.webm

46892294
super	extends
if you try super instead of extends your initial example will compile here is the full example as i have it the reason for it not to compile is that you can read subtypes via extends but only write to subtypes via super
extends e indicates that this method accepts a collection of objects of e or some subtype of e not just e itself

46893281
bash	subshell
ad 2 you can start any bash script either by calling sh myscript.sh or
myscript.sh in the first case this will create a subshell that will not affect the environment variables of your system and they will be visible only to the subshell process

46894847
lxml	elementtree
i think the root cause of the confusion is that lxml has this .text .tail concept of representing a content of nodes which avoids having to have a special text node entity to quote documentation the two properties .text and .tail are enough to represent any text content in an xml document
this way the elementtree does not require any special text nodes in addition to the element class that tend to get in the way fairly often as you might know from classic dom apis

46896454
bower	npm
many browsers cache javascript files so using will download a few times and stop using the google maps module through bower will not change anything
the official google maps npm package google maps does this

46903255
ganglia	metrics
there are a few options ganglia is one if you re running on your own cluster hdp or cloudera both have real time cpu memory consumption charts
if you want specific jvm metrics then i d recommend flamegraph though it s not real time

46906032
erlang	elixir
all public functions can be accessed by full-qualified module.function syntax in python java golang you need to import module before you can use functions in that module e.g python then what import in elixir does might surprise you we use import whenever we want to easily access functions or macros from other modules without using the fully-qualified name so if you want to type sqrt instead of integer.sqrt trim instead of string.trim import will help this might cause problems for reading code and when there is name-conflicting so it is not recommended in erlang the language that influences elixir
but there is no such convention in elixir you can use it at own-risk

46908658
google-chrome	firefox
in a html you can use below code i have tried this in google-chrome 61 and ie11 it is working fine
but this is not working with firefox 57. in firefox we can only close windows which opened using below command

46909010
swift	objective-c
implicit objective-c entrypoint mainly refer to the objective-c inferences that were used implicitly before swift 4
but swift 4 doesn t allow these objective-c implicit inferences

46909010
swift	objective-c
but swift 4 doesn t allow these objective-c implicit inferences
before swift 4 the compiler made some swift declarations automatically available to objective-c

46912180
equals	compareto	comparator	comparable
it s documented in the javadoc for treemap emphasis mine note that the ordering maintained by a tree map like any sorted map and whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if this sorted map is to correctly implement the map interface
see comparable or comparator for a precise definition of consistent with equals . this is so because the map interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a sorted map performs all key comparisons using its compareto or compare method so two keys that are deemed equal by this method are from the standpoint of the sorted map equal

46913596
keras	tensorflow
in the latest tensorflow keras has been moved to another package now it looks even simpler from keras.backend import clear_session clear_session
this may a bug or an unsupported case in tensorflow keras backend session is cached globally and is not cleared

46914815
spaces	delimiter
give it the optional second argument that s how you show spaces in macro language by the way
third you have some issues with macro variables not being delimiter properly

46915983
rpm	yum
you can use this to reinstall the base python package from a centos mirror rpm -ivh --replacepkgs --replacefiles for example
the yum package manager is relies on an underlying tool called rpm which does not require python

46917796
seaborn	matplotlib
ax.xaxis.set_major_formatter matplotlib.ticker.scalarformatter complete code using a seaborn pointplot may not be the best choice here
a usual matplotlib plot makes much more sense

46918469
opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
hope it helps someone else. important note this appears to work in google-chrome and opera currently definitely not in firefox 6-2018 .
until firefox supports visualviewport i recommend not using this method and i hope they do soon.

46920456
g++	gcc
g++ cclient.o allocator.o ... all other c++ objectives ... that should work as it not only links the objects but also includes the c++ standard libraries that include new and delete
your problem is here gcc cclient.o allocator.o ... all other c++ objectives ... you are using the c compiler to link the objects

46921068
spaces	delimiter
filter each output using findstr to find lines that do not v begin b with the constant string a single spaces - which excludes all lines except the report on the file in a
then bang out just the first 2 tokens using spaces as delimiter

46922828
coldfusion	railo
the tag variant offers item and index starting with coldfusion 2016 or railo lucee
all coldfusion versions prior to 2016 do not so you would have to do it by yourself the script variant doesn t support it and most likely never will

46925736
implements	extends
if you are using other components like daggerdialogfragment or daggerbroadcastreceiver you need to create your own implements but i guess that should not be too hard implementation stop using daggerapplication
either extends your custom application again from the standard application or get rid of the custom application entirely

46930675
pdfsharp	itext	pdfsharp	itextsharp
however i found pdfsharp to work using the below code
i came across this question and couldn t use the itextsharp library due to the license on the free version the itext agpl license is for developers who wish to share their entire application source code with the open-source community as free software under the agpl copyleft terms

46930947
rcurl	httr
rcurl geturl seems to not be detecting either the content-encoding gzip header nor the tell-tale first two byte magic code that also signals the content is gzip encoded
i would suggest as michael did switching to httr for reasons i ll go into in a bit but this wld be a better httr idiom the content function extracts the raw response and returns an xml2 object which is similar to the xml library parsed object that you would likely have been using given the use of rcurl geturl

46931035
google-chrome	firefox
on safari and google-chrome the url bar does not resize vh units nor percentage based heights unless they re used in position fixed elements
unfortunately firefox does cause vh to resize with the url bar even outside position fixed and there s nothing you can do about it

46936065
comparator	comparable
binarysearch invocations without passing a comparator assume that your objects are sorted based on their natural ordering which implies they are comparable which we cannot know with your code
if your objects were not comparable you would get a classcastexception when invoking binarysearch as you do

46942976
profiling	benchmarking
i would absolutely use a profiling but if benchmarking take a look at the generated il pre-jit and also ensure you benchmarking post-jit il - machine code
one easy way is to simply run both benchmarking once not measured as a cold start before you start the actual benchmarking

46943193
prepare	execute
you cannot use that with a prepare statement
mysqli_stmt_excute has already execute the query on your database

46944498
move	drag
this will move the .jar file into your sketch folder and you can use it just like you can use any other library
see my answer here processing cannot find library if you re using the processing editor the easiest way to install a non-standard library is to just drag the .jar file onto your processing editor

46948076
ssl	https
even if it is not ssl that traffic should not be exposed to outside world
the connection between any client computer where report is being viewed and data studio will always be https

46949985
build.gradle	gradlew
the solution is same as rotemitz said just add this line to your defaultconfig of build.gradle module app and to dependencies of the same build.gradle compile com.android.support appcompat-v7 23.1.0 note you may change the appcompat version refer to your compile sdk version
the problem is because the new gradlew cannot refer to color library which you use to get the color green value

46949988
daemons	systemd
the directive should be at user s space -v switch instructs docker daemons to mount local directory to the container for example
i found that any directory laying under systemd directive like var usr etc could not be mount under the container

46950757
express	node.js
appear you should look at the guides for express to learn more on how it all works
node.js is not explicitly made for running web applications you need to create the web server using your own code in node.js a popular framework for running a website on node.js is express which can be installed simply by opening command prompt in the folder you have stored server.js in and run the following steps run the command npm install express to install express edit server.js in your favourite editing program notepad insert the following code run the app by running node server.js from the command prompt open localhost 3000 in your browser and you should see the text hello world

46954027
perforce	svn
it is great that you have the context menu set with perforce with windows explorer plugin
in order to make it work one needs to set up the environment variables that point to correct workspace in contrast to svn perforce does not have .svn directory in each versioning folder

46954699
sum	coalesce
demo the fundamental issue is you need the coalesce to occur on the sum of a column not the individual row
and then only display that rows value not the sum

46955135
punctuation	words
i would read the file and split like you did create triplets and feed them to collections.counter using tuple type so it s hashable filter sort to display the ones above 5 occurrences like this note that splitting using just str.split doesn t work well when there s punctuation because for instance hello world splits into hello and world so we would be better off with a regex split on non alphanum char i get this result more occurrences than with naive str.split in the jacket 19 of the yard 13 captain of the 12 i was a 12 me in the 11 in the prison 11 in the dungeons 10 hours in the 9 in san quentin 9 i don t 8 he was a 8 are going to 8 i had been 7 i have been 7 in order to 7 times and places 7 five pounds of 7 and i have 7 the captain of 7 darrell standing s 6 i did not 6 five years of 6 warden atherton and 6 board of directors 6 thirty five pounds 6 that i had 6 pounds of dynamite 6 other times and 6 of san quentin 5 the forty lifers 5 and captain jamie 5 i darrell standing 5 in the dungeon 5 going to take 5 ... optionally we could get a different result by converting words to lowercase in order to merge words starting a sentence in the woods vs in the woods
it s a nice variation of computing the frequency of words but not that different

46960801
vbscript	vba
you re using vbscript - it doesn t understand what wdnormalview means
this is an internal value for vba

46961975
swift	objective-c
for swift this is objective-c
swift without objective-c would simply not work

46961975
swift	objective-c
swift without objective-c would simply not work
therefore swift has never been called the official language

46962473
queue	fifo
this part has already been figured out by you. next instead of putting them in a set put them in a queue so that the fifo funda actually allows you to address each vertex in the level-wise order
if the current vertex s value cannot be computed put it back in the queue otherwise put the vertex that are reachable from the current vertex in the queue

46964780
setinterval	settimeout
we don t want to have two concurrent requests going on so setinterval does not exactly meet our needs
one good approach is to call our function one first time do the request process it and then call settimeout and reschedule for another run

46965401
multiplying	multiplication
log n so this runtime is actually o log max n1 n2 2 if you re multiplying two numbers n1 and n2
this is not the fastest way to do multiplication though for a while there was a conjecture that it was

46965401
multiplication	exponent
this is not the fastest way to do multiplication though for a while there was a conjecture that it was
karatsuba s algorithm runs in time o log max n1 n2 log 3 4 where the exponent is around 1.7ish

46966373
viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidload	viewwillappear	viewdidappear	viewwillappear
when we set the constraints in viewdidload those control will not finish rendering before viewdidappear
print the frame of those textfields in viewdidload viewwillappear viewdidappear you can find that only in viewdidappear the frame is not equal 0 0 0 0

46969700
clang	llvm
another index.file shows xcode llvm 9 map to clang llvm 4.0
apple s xcode ship with llvm but it is not the open source version

46971745
super	self
your class method resolution order mro is so creating third then results in third.__init__ super third self .__init__ second.__init__ # next in the mro for third super second self .__init__ first.__init__ # next in the mro for third super first self .__init__ object.__init__ # next in the mro for third return print first return print second return print third return so the code outputs first second then third but the methods were called in the opposite order
side note super is a type of object not a keyword

46972898
slug	permalinks
so check if course_type is correct slug of that category single-short_courses.php just in case try reload permalinks via settings- permalinks- save after making these changes
course_type is a term name not taxonomy name. so these are correct for your case category-course_type.php category- slug .php is correct format

46974619
apache	nginx	nginx	lighttpd
you can write to your nginx running on 8888 port configuration 4 as you already suggested running web server with native cgi support like your mentioned apache or lighttpd
as far as i know nginx does not have native cgi support

46975095
union	distinct
i have no mysql handy but the following should work delete from table_a where id not in select id from table_b union distinct select id from table_c
you can use union to join the results from table_b and table_c

46975839
viewmodel	caliburn
based on what i told you here is an example view mainwindowview.cs we assign the datacontext viewmodel mainwindowviewmodel.cs model mainwindowmodel.cs also i think you should look at some framework like prism or caliburn micro i prefer the first one to assist you in the correct implementation on the mvvm pattern and not reinventing the wheel as a plus you will get also a navigation system to navigate between views
for the sake of mvvm the view model should not contain a reference to the view is considered bad practice is the view that know the viewmodel and not the opposite. the view knows the viewmodel which in turn know the model or models the inotifypropertychanged interface should be implemented in the viewmodel to permits the view to update itself through binding in some circustances is perfectly legit to implement the interface on the model also

46977035
build.gradle	gradlew
android studio 3.0 using gradle-4.1 and android-gradle-plugin 3.0.0 gradlew 4.1 is not supported yet in libgdx there is an issue for the same which is now upgrade for gradlew 4.6 if you still want to use android studio 3.0 downgrade gradlew to 3.3 from 4.1 find gradlew folder inside your project open gradle-wrapper.properties and change distributionurl for 3.3 downgrade android-gradle-plugin to 2.3.3 from 3.0.0 open root build.gradle file and find artifact and change versioning classpath com.android.tools.build gradlew 2.3.3 comment delete google from repo list -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- edit update libgdx project to gradlew 4.6 - as user upgrade gradlew to 4.6 find root build.gradle file of your project and add google s maven repo in project repositories list as well as in buildscript repo list update android gradlew plugin classpath com.android.tools.build gradlew 3.1.3 known issues with the android gradlew plugin configuration on demand with gradlew 4.6 and above if you re using android gradlew plugin 3.0.x or 3.1.x with gradlew 4.6 and above you should disable configuration on demand to avoid some unpredictable build errors
if you are using android gradlew plugin 3.2.0 or higher you do not need to take any action to disable configuration on demand. disable configuration on demand in your gradle.properties file as shown below to disable configuration on demand in the android studio settings choose file settings android studio preferences on mac select the compiler category in the left pane and clear the configure on demand checkbox

46977221
build.gradle	gradlew
app build.gradle . build.gradle it s not ideal as it s back dating but it s something which worked for me and should get me there until a possible patch is released
i had this error com.android.builder.dexing.dexarchivemergerexception unable to merge dex and ended up changing back my gradlew in order to fix this issue

46977291
gson	jackson
let us discuss both the cases you have mentioned here case 1 creating instances for each and every json input using gson mapped to a class and case 2 create a document or similar type object itself and try accessing data from there
for case 2 you don t need to write a parser yourself there are parsers already available. i ll just write down a jackson example here there must be similar stuff available with gson as well as per my experience the performance difference hasn t been much in both these cases as the libraries handle the parsing quite efficiently but if you have a lot of different types of json then it doesn t make any sense to create pojos out of each and every json so much mapping

46977291
gson	jackson
i have personally not worked with gson because of performance reasons like this but you can create what s called an objectmapper using jackson and use it quite efficiently
i assume there should be similar thing in gson as well

46978537
implements	extends
you can create a class that has a x509certificate aka a wrapper and adds functionality by using it then you create this class using the certificate returned by the keystore x509certificate has lots of unimplemented methods and extends it will require you to implements them which is not worth doing imo
instead you can use the certificate returned by the keystore that already implements all those methods and add the functionalities you want

46980364
dictionary	map
it should be noted that a map which is a map of an object especially a dictionary of dictionary will only map to the object s insertion order which is random and not ordered
as i noted in the comments js objects does not have defined order of its keys so it is not a good idea to count on this when you know the dictionary will get much bigger

46980364
dictionary	map
sorting of this dictionary array can be done in js too you do not need to handle this by your own
you could also use es6 map it should have order guarantied

46981508
g++	gcc
incidentally it isn t a shortcoming of your version of g++ that it doesn t recognize -rpath
this has only ever been a linker ld option never a gcc frontend option

46981629
ionic	angular
also look that the value stored of phone01 is without mask i ve tested it with normal inputs as well as with ionic inputs ion-input with both reactive with formcontrolname not with formcontrol and non-reactive forms
angular 4+ i ve created a generic directive able to receive any mask and also able to define the mask dynamically based on the value mask.directive.ts remember to declare it in your ngmodule the numeric character in the mask is 9 so your mask would be 999 999-9999

implements	extends
only the subclassing child classes that have custommethod would then extends your superclass as well as implements this custominterface
this way the child classes that do not implements custommethod does not have the method in their class such as inheritclass1 in your example also remain just as they are

46988369
dictionary	map
production if this code is going to run in production then fetch is not going to work here unless you have setup a web server to serve that json file however you could import the local json file instead import dictionary from . _dict.json
then inside of your componentdidmount you can just map over it localhost if you just want to run this on localhost then i don t see why it wouldn t work unless and which i suspect is the case your react app is proxying http requests to a local webserver as is extremely common in reactjs development and that local webserver is not setup to serve your json file up

46988934
multiplying	multiplication
applies a mathematical reduction to the collected values having 1 as initial value and the reduction operation as a lambda expression multiplying each element with the previous result
you need to initialize your variable to 1 because multiplication by 0 doesn t make sense

46991121
octal	decimal
leading 0 in integer in most languages indicate it s in octal format not decimal
therefore 012 in octal is equal to 10 in decimal

46991999
primes	modulus
when rand_max is not equal to a primes this is of valid concern eg since the percentage of rerolls needed increases the closer n comes to rm this can be of valid concern at many different values depending on the constraints of the system running he code and the values being looked for
to negate this we can make a simple amendment as shown here this provides a more general version of the formula which accounts for the additional peculiarities of using modulus to define your max values

46992640
memcpy	strncpy
when passing the size parameter to memcpy it s a good idea to take the size of the destination memory into account
when using char arrays if you want to be safer about not overrunning memory you can use strncpy

46993553
spaces	delimiter
a technique similar to that applied to the second input could be applied to the first to enforce no leading spaces in the input format
multiple spaces tabs and newlines are not accepted as delimiter between the two input numbers

46994774
gdi	direct2d
it makes sense that the simpler gdi apis don t support color fonts as color fonts require using opentype tags and none of drawtext textout provide that level of control uniscribe allows for such tags but has simply not been extended to support color fonts
gdi does not support color fonts even if you go the full uniscribe route you have to use direct2d if you want color font support

46998245
xfce	kde
however xfce is not there either
i would recommend going with kde 4 5 or whatever you can find there as it has been tested for use with sled

46998277
laravel	codeigniter
using envoy would mean more shared code between the two codeigniter platforms. existing stack envoy task runner uses software that is already required for laravel deployment php and composer. gitlab on the other hand requires the installation of gitlab-runner on a machine in order to deploy
you are correct that the example shell script could be easily implemented in either a .gitlab-ci.yml file or an envoy.blade.php file so no envoy is not necessary for gitlab-ci deployments of laravel apps. i see three main reasons why a user might choose to have their deployment tasks in envoy over gitlab familiarity laravel developers are likely to have more familiarity with the languages that envoy uses for deployment php and the blade syntax than they are with the languages that gitlab uses yaml formatting with gitlab s pipeline syntax. keeping the less familiar .gitlab-ci.yml file simple and adding the bulk of the complexity to the more familiar envoy file may save the developer time

portability some developers may want the option to switch between codeigniter platforms

46999609
config	ini
for .net core apps the best way is to use the config api
this is a very flexible way and thanks to providers pattern it allows to use a different sources not only the most common appsettings.json file that by the way just a json file and could be named in a random way file formats ini json and xml command-line arguments environment variables in-memory .net objects an encrypted user store azure key vault custom providers which you install or create now about configurationmanager

47001373
ssl	https
provide a valid tls ssl certificate and also configure it correctly in project then it will work without the above error
usually webrtc requires a secure connection that is https . the error you have got is due to tls ssl certificates occupied may be they are not properly configured in your project

47008502
firefox	safari
firefox uses a different html rendering engine gecko which doesn t support -webkit rules such as custom scrolling styles it s possible to use javascript solutions though in firefox to emulate the scrollbar which can then be styled see the answers here custom css scrollbar for firefox
-webkit prefixed css rules are for browsers based on webkit only chrome safari etc

47008692
prepare	execute
if you need to query two different tables then create two prepare statements for those tables
by the way you said that the top one works c.execute insert into reddit_user username created_date values philzeey 08-09-17 actually while this might execute it almost certainly is not date data you want to be inserting into your sqlite database

47010041
bash	subshell
you could use bash to interpolate the string to a regex pattern used in awk by changing the ifs value to a | character and do array expansion as below the array expansion converts the list elements to a string delimited with | for 12|34|56 in this case
the runs in the subshell do that the value of ifs is not reflcted in the parent shell

47010050
ubuntu	debian
an analogous slurm.conf did not work on my native ubuntu 16.04
i would still prefer to run slurm natively but i caved and spun up a debian 9.2 vm

47010136
strncpy	malloc
in fact you are copying one character too few when you obtain the length with as stated in the strncpy manpage warning if there is no null byte among the first n bytes of src the string placed in dest will not be null-terminated
so make sure that when you use functions operating on null-terminated strings such as most of the standard library functions that you account for the 0 terminator with also as an aside the returned by malloc is implicitly converted to any object pointer type so instead of you should simply use or even better to avoid errors caused by changing the pointer type in the declaration but not the malloc call

47012825
client-side	server-side
that is not possible using client-side javascript
the only way to make these values accessible to javascript would be to output them in the server-side script logic that processes the request

47023744
ubuntu	debian
you can view list of available packages inside this ppa here ondrej +archive ubuntu php as you can see there s no php7.0 package build for debian it s just ubuntu
this is a ppa for ubuntu therefore it may be not be compatitble with debian as these packages are built for specific ubuntu s version

47024124
swift	objective-c
what i would recommend is that you implement your framework using objective-c and writing a swift wrapper around it
i would not have said this if you were creating an ios app but in case of a framework i still think you should go for objective-c

47024124
swift	objective-c
i have read tons of posts on how people have problems trying to use frameworks written in swift in their objective-c apps
swift will be the first and probably only choice in the near future but not just yet

47024124
swift	objective-c
swift will be the first and probably only choice in the near future but not just yet
on the plus side if you still haven t you will have learnt objective-c which will give definitely give you a better understanding on how things work

47024219
haskell	ocaml
this requires a feature of the type system that doesn t exist in ocaml and requires a langugae extension rank2types in haskell
yes this basically works and it s how haskell does things

47024592
rdf	owl
in owl full you can define a class that has itself as an instance isinstanceofitself a isintanceofitself . this is also possible in rdf rdfs but it does not make the logic undecidable
what leads to undecidability is the fact that you can define classes that are paradoxical in owl 2 full

47027152
swift	objective-c
well it s complicated appkit as we all know is not implemented using swift
it s implemented in objective-c

47027728
google-chrome	firefox
at first i thought this was a google-chrome issue but found the radio buttons would appear when i removed the reference to the bootstrap css
i realize that this post does not mention bootstrap css as a keyword or tag but one thing i would mention is that if you are having the exact same result which is that the radio buttons do not show up in google-chrome but are present in firefox and ie but you are also using bootstrap css then you will want to ensure that you do not have the class name form-control on the radio button input tag specifically

47028595
implements	extends
protected methods are accessible via extends and not with implements
protected methods are always accessible by sub-class only if subclass extends the base class

47043883
keras	tensorflow
i just started playing with keras and i incurred in the same problem
i followed the different workarounds proposed on different forums - including running an upgrade of tensorflow keras itself - but that did not seem to work for me

47044243
bash	subshell
or if you re sure you re using bash you can use here-string instead
it doesn t interpret escapes at all but you can use bash s construct to interpret them this doesn t involve a subprocess at all either bin echo or a subshell so no worries about the process table

47044565
shadowing	named
if you insist on shadowing list then you won t be able to call list.filter using list.filter
if you wanted something shorter you could define module alias note that your attempt to do something similar with does not do the same thing because functions such as filter are in a module named list rather than being static members of the type

47046769
ubuntu	linux
seems like adobe air isn t supported on linux. re installing air on ubuntu 16 ridhijain adobe employee ridhijain employee jun 12 2017 3 01 am in response to vurkkosturiumgajo hi adobe air is no more supported on linux platforms
please see tech specs and system requirements | adobe air for supported platforms. the last adobe air version supported on linux was version 2.6

47048597
implements	extends
in this example a class extends foo will have to override and implements bar but not add
a class that extends a trait has to implements all abstract function definitions that is the functions that are defined without a body

47049571
swift	objective-c
so swift 3.2 works
swift 4.0 does not works compiler fails users....viewcontroller.m 24 21 property s1 not found on object of type myclass as s1 is not prepended with objective-c

47050397
swift	objective-c
an objective-c method is exposed to swift as dosomething throws
so the swift method doesn t have a return value

47051396
apache	nginx
the test command curl -h x y -h x z | jq apache when executed using apache the output is below as you can see we passed two headers to apache and apache combined them using
if we change our first header to already contain it would still work fine nginx now same request on nginx yields now it is not that nginx is not sending those headers to php-fpm it does send them as it is

47066576
bash	subshell
took a look at bash s source code and there s no much magic update just found the original request in bug-bash mailing list for bash to deal with inside_emacs bash should look at inside_emacs not just emacs
according to emacs doc emacs sets the environment variable inside_emacs in the subshell to version comint where version is the emacs version 24.1

47071257
sudo	passwd
if you do not have a root passwd if you are not the admin you should probably work with virtualenv and then you should drop the sudo
the way is or in short sudo will ask to enter your root passwd to confirm the action

47072661
ucma	ucwa
the only option for you will be running a ucma instance for the purpose if you re on-premises and expose that functionality via a custom rest service
not with ucwa which isn t designed for doing operations on-behalf-of user

47078749
tabcontrol	tabitem
if you swap the order of the two tabitem or set on the tabcontrol you ll find that the one that s initially visible is always the only one that works
i added to the command binding and found that the binding in the tabitem that s hidden on startup tries to resolve its source property initially and doesn t try again when that tabitem becomes active

47080026
comparator	comparable
use a comparator to sort the list of files
your actual order a to z then 1 to 5 doesn t rely on a lexicographical order order used for the comparable implementation of string your requirement makes indeed appear alphabetical characters before numeric characters while the lexicographical order does the reverse

47080182
tensorflow	tensorboard
i fixed it by upgrading my version of tensorflow to the 1.4 release
i used to have the same problem as you with tensorboard not registering anything in my session run except the gradient and optimizer ops

47080581
viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidload	viewwillappear
please change it in viewwillappear or viewdidappear instead viewdidload
i am not sure why are you changing selectedindex inside the viewcontroller viewdidload

47080745
pycharm	spyder
pycharm also has an integration
there is a plugin for spyder which integrates notebooks spyder-notebook i have not used this

47083151
pyenv	virtualenv
i also have pyenv installed from brew which i use if i want a specific version that is not the latest in brew
after activating a specific version in a directory i will then create a virtualenv and use this to manage the package isolation

47083358
swift	objective-c
i noticed that the generated -swift.h file did not expose the weak delegate member in my swift file to the objective-c runtime
you can verify this by doing a command+click on your #import -swift.h file and search for you swift class name to see what methods members are exposed

47083446
mapply	do.call
i guess this has to do with the variable being stored in the mapply -environment and not being passed on to the plot
ps sorry for my too quick answer with do.call earlier

47083949
jar	war
weblogic 12c has additional libraries bundled and therefore an exception might be thrown because the jar contains older version of the same library and some classes methods might not be present in that jar
the workaround is to deploy ear that packages your war file and specifying the preferred libraries

47101961
debian	linux
which is probably not possible on debian 4
glibc is the standard c library implementation on debian and most other linux distributions

47104822
octal	decimal
here is a reference should you need it string format specifiers - apple while savedkey int works to get the intended result formatter if used correctly is going to be more powerful.for example what we did here is formatted the in to take at least three chars so different values would look like so 1 - savedkey 1 n 11 - savedkey 11 n 111 - savedkey111 n 1111 - savedkey1111 n added for output i and d may seem to be the same because the value stored in your variable is the same whether you assigned it a decimal octal or hex value so however as far as the meaning goes it is not the same
this would come into play if you were reading the value in. i would accept dec octal hex values whereas d would only accept decimal values

47107094
nstextview	nstextstorage
if you did not uncheck draw background and this does not look the way you want don t draw the background of either the nsscrollview or the nstextview select the invisible border for nsscrollview and then put an nsbox of the desired size and appearance beneath them
you can now set the attributed content string with note that this does work although the editable property of nstextview is set to no since you re modifying the nstextstorage not the nstextview itself

47110257
google-chrome	firefox
also note that trying to run these full screen commands from the console do not appear to work on google-chrome or ie
i did have success with firebug in firefox though

47111037
erlang	elixir
dr erlang doesn t allow to do rebinding elixir does
what s more important - elixir s pattern matching requires to use operator to have explicit match otherwise you do the rebinding

47111963
namedtuple	dictionary
so when the 3rd party simplejson is installed the app uses it and serializes a namedtuple to a json object a dictionary in python
on systems where that library is not installed the app falls back to standard json and serializes a namedtuple to an array list

47112353
dataoutputstream	bufferedoutputstream
dataoutputstream is not a particularly speedy solution
create a plain old fileoutputstream put a bufferedoutputstream around it and then write your own code to write your data as bytes

47114475
build.gradle	gradlew
the problem lies in your build.gradle file
notice from the output that gradlew is only running the task compilejava but not compilegroovy

i got ldc2-1.5.0-linux-x86_64 bin ldc2 lib64 libc.so.6 version glibc_2.15 not found required by ldc2-1.5.0-linux-x86_64 bin ldc2 ldc2-1.5.0-linux-x86_64 bin ldc2 lib64 libc.so.6 version glibc_2.14 not found required by ldc2-1.5.0-linux-x86_64 bin ldc2 i have to copy all dependencies from ubuntu to centos. the proper method is following first let s check all dependencies linux-vdso.so.1 is not a real library and we don t have to care about it
lib64 ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 is the linker which is used by the linux do link the executable with all dynamic libraries

47115688
spaces	delimiter
since the delimiter is spaces we enclose that in quotes
-f means just that cutting is made using the delimiter and not by bytes and -f1 means that we want to take out the first element of the list

47116492
jpql	hql
generally speaking writing native sql is the most powerful way to create a query because by end of the day jpql hql or whatever will be translated to the native sql and sent to the database
then if you could not write your query i mean with just one go with sql then you would not find a way to write it by jpql

47119583
getchar	fgetc
the return value of getchar is of the same format as fgetc
c11 defines the return value of fgetc in 7.21.7.1p2-3 if the end-of-file indicator for the input stream pointed to by stream is not set and a next character is present the fgetc function obtains that character as an unsigned char converted to an int and advances the associated file position indicator for the stream if defined

rsa	3des	rsa	aes	rsa	dsa
background asymmetric algorithms have three different purposes that i know of encryption rsa is the only standard algorithm that can do this directly
signature rsa dsa ecdsa elgamal signature key agreement diffie-hellman dh ecdh elgamal encryption the asymmetric startup phase mqv ecmqv because rsa encryption is space limited and was hard for computers in the 90s rsa encryption s primary use was in key transfer which is to say that the encrypted message was just the symmetric encryption key for des 3des aes not yet having been invented -

47127660
udp	tcp
if you need to transfer files between two end-points in the internet unless you manually implement a reliable transmission mechanism on udp at the application level you will want to use tcp
in my opinion it does not make much sense to do a pure udp bandwidth test with iperf as essentially it just results in iperf trying to put packets on the wire as fast as possible

47129219
strcpy	calloc
while you can achieve this with strcat and without storing the lengths you should always remember that string lengths are not stored anywhere in a c program and that everytime you use strcpy strcat or strlen the program will scan the string to find the terminating 0
i didn t notice this at first but this is wrong because none of calloc arguments makes sense to be 0

47136831
shadowing	named
in certain cases such as within a constructor or setter method it s beneficial to have local variables and fields with the same named and this is where shadowing is a useful feature
it doesn t throw an error because java has the concept of shadowing

47138089
junit	testng
but you can import third party libraries to your code to do all the automation stuff like in your junit test cases
at the moment release 5.0.1 it is not possible to import your junit testng code to katalon studio

47139757
tabcontrol	tabitem
the way your tabitem style is defined in tabcontrol s resources it will be applied to all tabitem within that tabcontrol including the tabitem within nested tabcontrol - the inner tab in your code comments
that is because it doesn t have explicit key so it is applied to all controls of tabitem type

47140972
jar	war
one advise you should extract classes used by other projects in a maven project with a jar packaging and not leave them in a war packaging
in maven generally dependencies are provided as jar

47140972
jar	war
in maven generally dependencies are provided as jar
it may also be provided as war by configuring the maven-war-plugin with some specific properties such as attachclasses but it looks like a trick and it also may create side effects. here are some information on how to do it. but the documentation doesn t advise this way if you need to re-use this jar war in another project the recommended approach is to move the classes to a separate module that builds a jar and then declare a dependency on that jar from your webapp as well as from any other projects that need it

47141557
postgresql	mysql
but for the sake of argument here s the deal mysql does not have expression indexes like expression indexes in postgresql in postgresql you include the expression in the index definition and when you use the same expression in your where clause it knows to use the index
mysql has something slightly different you define a virtual column based on an expression and then you can index the virtual column

47142779
ssl	https
you can verify this using google s webmaster tools my first suggestion would be to just get an ssl cert for your site
but if you are committed to not using ssl then you should find the sites that are linking to you using https and request that they use http instead

47142851
opengl-es	glsurfaceview
first create class myglrenderer and then add this to your oncreate method you can read more about opengl-es here
your glsurfaceview is not initialized you need to initialize it

opera	google-chrome
here is a little torch-app for a website edit 1 i also made a jsfiddle the code is heavily inspired by this repository this webseries and this blog-post edit 2 this does only works in google-chrome and maybe opera
it does not work in google-chrome on ios because google-chrome cannot access the camera . i cannot test it on android for now

47153817
swift	objective-c
for example an array of strings can be filtered case insensitively with if the array contains dictionaries you need to specify the keys same as nspredicate finally the objective-c expression can be written much more descriptive in swift or if you are looking for only one item you can even write
a literal translation from objective-c to swift is not recommended because in many cases it does not take advantage of the improved semantics of swift

47154705
scylla	cassandra
so if you re already considering cassandra you may want to consider scylla as well
besides the answers given above about when to use and when not to use cassandra if you do decide to use cassandra you may want to consider not using cassandra itself but one of the its many cousins out there

47156416
firefox	safari
it does work if you also set a small blur radius which shouldn t be noticeable except at the very extremes of the shadow however this will break firefox
you should detect the safari browser and only apply this style in safari

47156924
express	node.js
configure your node express app look for the comment solution here
ok here is the answer i m using node.js express as backend and even though headers are visible in the network tab of chrome it doesn t make them available for processing by angular

47158538
scylla	cassandra
scylla a cassandra clone which is generally more efficient than cassandra also has similar issues with huge partitions as in cassandra moderately large partitions are fine but these issues are actively being worked on including re-designing the file format so eventually scylla should support arbitrary-sized partitions
however we re still not there yet and today the recommendation of not letting partitions grow too huge still applies to scylla as well

47159242
http	spdy
most of the issues i ve seen have been obscure issues where http 2 is not as performant as it should be rather than show stopping issues and most people without as deep an interest as i have for example would struggle to notice them
20 of web traffic is using http 2 so it is a proven technology and it is heavily based on spdy which has been used by a number of sites servers and clients without major issues for the last number of years

47159367
google-chrome	firefox
your class solution does work in google-chrome s devtools at any rate
not it appears in firefox s devtools

47160214
set	bag
if it s the case indeed you don t need nested sets at all a simple set of foreign key constraints will suffice
if it s not though say if a bag can be promoted to a container or there can be containers containing other containers etc. you will need to have some kind of a hierarchy model indeed and nested sets can serve as one as well

47161859
git-svn	svn2git
for a one-time migration git-svn is not the right tool for conversions of repositories or parts of repositories
it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case

47161859
git-svn	svn2git
it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case
there are plenty tools called svn2git the probably best one is the kde one from

47161859
git-svn	svn2git
even though git-svn is easier to start with here are some further reasons why using the kde svn2git instead of git-svn is superior besides its flexibility the history is rebuilt much better and cleaner by svn2git if the correct one is used this is especially the case for more complex histories with branches and merges and so on the tags are real tags and not branches in git with git-svn the tags contain an extra empty commit which also makes them not part of the branches so a normal fetch will not get them until you give --tags to the command as by default only tags pointing to fetched branches are fetched also
with the proper svn2git tags are where they belong if you changed layout in svn you can easily configure this with svn2git with git-svn you will loose history eventually with svn2git you can also split one svn repository into multiple git repositories easily or combine multiple svn repositories in the same svn root into one git repository easily the conversion is a gazillion times faster with the correct svn2git than with git-svn you see there are many reasons why git-svn is worse and the kde svn2git is superior

47164125
google-chrome	safari
as of today a web app cannot receive push notifications on any ios browser safari google-chrome for ios ...
the reason is that ios does not yet include an implementation of service workers which are needed for push notifications to work. it is currently in development though and it is already working on safari for os x meanwhile you will have to settle for a native implementation of your app at least on ios

47166487
viewdidload	viewdidappear
logically one might argue that viewdidload is too soon since your view with your text field is not in the interface
perhaps viewdidappear would be a more logical place

47168238
equals	compareto
so you expect the treeset to have only one of these elements but it doesn t see them as equals to each other
treemaps order elements using their compareto methods if the elements are comparable or a given comparator

47168742
uiview	subviews
note that safeareainsetsdidchange is a method of uiview not uiviewcontroller so you ll need to create and use a subclass of uiview to override the method
it would probably be sufficient to override it like this and then you can set the subviews s frame in layoutsubviews

ubuntu	linux
you are running an ubuntu-based container from ubuntu line but you are trying to run a mach-o binary
by default linux will not run mach-o binaries

47172409
google-chrome	firefox
the datatransfer constructor currently only supported by blink and firefox 62 should create a mutable filelist google-chrome currently always return a new filelist but it doesn t really matter for us accessible through the datatransferitemlist
if i m not mistaken this is currently the only specs-wise way to do it but firefox had a bug in their implementation of the clipboardevent constructor where the same datatransferitemlist was and set to the mode read write which allowed a workaround for firefox 62

47173750
realloc	malloc
quoting c11 chapter 7.22.3.5 if ptr is a null pointer the realloc function behaves like the malloc function for the specified size
otherwise if ptr does not match a pointer earlier returned by a memory management function or if the space has been deallocated by a call to the free or realloc function the behavior is undefined

47174704
mvp	presenter
it s very similar to mvp but with a few key differences that make the code far more manageable and easier to standardize the code between developers making it easier jump into other peoples code
a few key differences the view doesn t talk to the presenter instead the view emits events that the presenter subscribes to called intents

this will give the jenkins user access to become root so you ll want to be sure your jenkins is secure or you do not care about users becoming root on this system sudo usermod -ag docker jenkins
you have given permission for any user on the machine to become root without any passwd

47184410
aggregate-functions	sum
another way is to use aggregate-functions like this given the complexity a helper column might be the preferable approach
you can do this without a helper column by using this formula offset effectively breaks the range down in to individual cells which are passed to subtotal function and that returns an array of 1 or 0 values based on whether each cell is visible after filter or not - this array is multiplied by the rounded values to give the overall sum of the rounded visible values

47186019
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
you can verify this by changing the text inactive instead you have at least two options to solve this you can enable case-sensitive matching 6th parameter boolean if that s enough for your needs you can enable regex 3rd parameter boolean and use word-boundaries to match only whole words
the problem is that the word inactive includes the string active and by default fnfilter does not search for whole words only and does a case-insensitive search

47190769
pthreads	fork
although they are not in pthreads linux also provides clone and vfork as alternatives to fork
on modern linux these use the same system system call that fork does but not the fork library function itself

47190769
pthreads	fork
both of these are specified by pthreads and on pthreads systems they are specified to operate via fork + exec
of course windows has system too and _popen but not fork or any direct analog

47191633
lisp	scheme
a final observation is that while lisp provides facilities which make manipulating lisp code easy this doesn t help much with decompiling as all these facilities can be used in compilation so there are infinitely more patterns one might want to detect than in a c decompiler
perhaps scheme style macros would be easier to unexpand although they would still be hard

47195458
google-chrome	firefox
the google-chrome devtools have integrated support for xpath searches within their inspector
just press ctrl + f to open the search and start typing your xpath the firefox devtools do not provide this feature yet though there s a request for it

47195782
daemons	systemd
each of the three clones has the following worker configuration sidenote for laravel 5.3 and later the --daemon option is deprecated and the queue work command runs in daemons mode by default.
if we ignore the actual logic processed by each job and consider the overhead of running jobs alone laravel s queueing systemd can easily handle 10 000 jobs per hour if not several times that in the environment described in the question mdash

47196941
firefox	safari
for example firefox displays the string this page is asking you to confirm that you want to leave - data you have entered may not be saved. -- from mozilla developer docs
starting with firefox 4 chrome 51 opera 38 and safari 9.1 a generic string not under the control of the webpage will be shown instead of the returned string

47199623
elasticsearch	kibana
it s not possible to query arbitrary existing elasticsearch indices with graylog as it s expecting the documents to have a specific format
you can query existing elasticsearch indices created and populated by graylog with kibana though

47200090
bash	subshell
just quote the command so does not have an special meaning for bash
as read in man bash if a command is terminated by the control operator the shell executes the command in the background in a subshell

47202748
prepare	execute
i m not 100 sure if access works the same way as a traditional database but with a mainstream rdmbs there are actually three distinct steps that happen when you run a query prepare execute fetch most are oblivious to the distinction because they just hit run and see results come back
it s the execute that actually compiles the statement before going off and pulling data

47205363
jar	war
an executable jar will not work because of a hard coded file pattern in tomcat
with jetty it should work if you use war packaging an executable war will work and will also be deployable to any standard container

47207230
implements	extends
it could also be shape itself or it could be an indirect subclass of shape or shape could be an interface which the class implements
what the author is trying to convey is that the keyword extends is used out of convenience adding a new keyword to a language is expensive and familiarity it does not mean that every type that can be used has to have exactly the string extends shape in its definition

47212058
sudo	passwd
sudo sed -i s passwordauthentication yes passwordauthentication no etc ssh sshd_config
i think the problem isn t the root login as that doc suggests but rather passwd authentication is disabled

47212153
swift	objective-c
you can fix this by just changing the swift language version build setting to swift 3.2 for that target and then running the migrator on it which will switch the version back to 4
after the migrator has run you ll notice that the swift 3 objective-c inference build setting has been set to on you ll want to test your program with this build setting to ensure you don t get any runtime warnings about objective-c entrypoints that aren t marked as objective-c and then change the build setting to default when done as discussed in this q a

47212153
swift	objective-c
after the migrator has run you ll notice that the swift 3 objective-c inference build setting has been set to on you ll want to test your program with this build setting to ensure you don t get any runtime warnings about objective-c entrypoints that aren t marked as objective-c and then change the build setting to default when done as discussed in this q a
additionally after migration feel free to look over the places where objective-c has been added you may be able to neaten code up by using a single objective-c extension of the given class to define a group of methods that you want to expose to objective-c

47212972
udp	tcp
just because the nat has established a tcp connection between two machines does not mean it will automatically forward udp packets as well
tcp is a connection oriented protocol while udp is a connectionless protocol so there is technically no such thing as a udp connection

47215753
google-chrome	firefox
in fact the caniuse page has a comment in the notes section to determine what commands are supported see document.querycommandsupported and if you check heading you ll see it is not supported in google-chrome console.log document.querycommandsupported heading it is not supported on ie either
firefox states that it supports it but it may or may not be in the way you expect instead of applying the heading styles to only the selected text it applies it to the whole block works like a formatblock which makes sense as a heading is a block level element and not an inline element as a bold italics would be

47216324
innodb	myisam
you have to use innodb
myisam is not supported in azure

47216916
hive	hdfs
spark on files or spark on hive
sparksql works on both and you should prefer to use the dataset api not rdd if you can define the dataset schema yourself spark reading the raw hdfs files will be faster because you re bypassing the extra hop to the hive metastore

47218620
imperative	declarative
scripted pipeline imperative start with node and def or if is allowed like below
it is traditional way. declarative pipeline preferred start with pipeline and def or if is not allowed unless it is wrapped in

47220460
memcpy	strdup
you just cannot do what you want to do basically lying to the compiler i would allocate just what s needed for the struct don t take the length of the string inside into account it s useless don t use gets as it s unsafe and obsolescent use strdup instead of the bug-prone memcpy code you re using since you re handling strings
strdup won t forget to allocate the nul-terminator and will set it in the target for you

47223907
build.gradle	gradlew
for android studio 3 inside build.gradle file of your project you have this the jcenter runs over https and hence if you are building in a network in most cases company network which uses https proxy and you forgot to include it in your gradle.properties file then you are likely to face the issue
you may feel that gradlew is behaving weird but its not

47226994
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
for me the second version gives the intended result in google-chrome 62 linux while the first version is washed-out as described
unfortunately both versions do not work with firefox for windows and safari

47227260
wxpython	kivy
wxpython or pyqt5 are good for uia
tkinter or kivy apps are not

47231306
build.gradle	gradlew
this makes it very nice for storing your project in version control while keeping your keys and passwords separate and not in your build.gradle file
it is possible to take any existing android studio gradlew project and build sign it from the command line without editing any files

47232148
pthreads	fork
getpid is one of a very few system calls that pthreads says cannot ever fail so we don t have to worry about that possibility
therefore the only things this program can print are 0 if fork fails or 00 if fork succeeds

47236715
google-chrome	safari
webview by default doesn t share cookies session data with safari google-chrome
so it is not ideal for login flow since it doesn t use the existing logged in session in google-chrome safari

47236715
google-chrome	safari
so it is not ideal for login flow since it doesn t use the existing logged in session in google-chrome safari
expo provides a webbrowser api that will open safari google-chrome instead of webview

47239932
debian	linux
to experiment with this and to get access to more recent compiler versions you can use pbuilder to create chroot environments and install debian sid or buster for example
first of all wsl does not come with a linux kernel

47241700
ocaml	sml
sml doesn t have support for class-based object-oriented programming like ocaml does and frankly it would be a pity to simulate this with the module system
you may want to look into ocaml s object-oriented programming

47242157
ssl	https
i want to ignore the ssl handshake
the ssl handshake can not be ignored with https since it is an integral part of a tls connection and thus https

47242179
multiplying	subtract
break it into smaller simpler pieces set the current result to zero get character from keyboard check if character is valid 0 to 9 and not something crazy like a then subtract 0 from it so that you get a number from 0 to 9 check if you can multiplying the current result by 10 without causing an overflow
then multiplying the current result by 10 check if you can add the new digit to the current result without causing an overflow

47244258
multiplying	modulo
the only reason the program stops is factorial eventually becomes 0 once you multiplying enough times by 2 or a multiple of 2
you cannot reliably detect overflow by testing the resulting value unsigned arithmetics are performed modulo 2 to the power of the number of value bits so you could compare the result with the previous factorial and break if it is smaller

47246845
fgets	getline
thankfully this is handled simply by setting a flag indicating that no end of line was read and then checking if the flag is set after leaving the fgets read loop
putting those pieces altogether a function taking an open pointer reading and returning the number of lines present could be a second line oriented function provided by posix that does not require the end of file check is posix getline

47257545
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
note that field values are case-sensitive but not field names
according to the http specification field names are case-insensitive so both of those field names refer to the same field and the second reference overwrites the first one

47261130
punctuation	words
there is a way to do that with see another php demo the pattern matches any punctuation that is not enclosed with words chars and this symbol is enclosed with spaces and then pattern is used to remove all whitespaces at the start end of the string and shrinks all whitespaces into 1 in all other locations
if you need to only add single spaces between punctuation symbols and avoid adding them at the start end of the string you may use the following solution see the php demo

47262755
rtp	rtsp
you are sending rtp over udp but do not provide any rtsp protocol
so your receiver which tries to connect via rtsp will fail

47262796
ubuntu	linux
rpc error code unknown desc image operating system windows cannot be used on this platform actually we install kubernetes on windows 10 bash on ubuntu in this way the bash on ubuntu works as a master base on linux we can t run windows docker image on it
as we know kubernetes master should be a linux you have not other nodes so we can t run windows docker image on it

47264219
noexcept	throw
i think this is good practice to add noexcept when you know a function doesn t throw
it is because a c function can throw if it calls back into c++

47266596
realloc	malloc
n1570 the latest c11 standard has the following to say 7.22.3.5 the realloc function p3 if ptr is a null pointer the realloc function behaves like the malloc function for the specified size
otherwise if ptr does not match a pointer earlier returned by a memory management function or if the space has been deallocated by a call to the free or realloc function the behavior is undefined

47267677
strdup	malloc
allocate memory for each new string or use strdup that does it under the hood btw that s probably what cause you program not to work
always free what you allocate be it with malloc of strdup or any other function internally using malloc always return a sensible value to the environment from main

47277360
ssl	https
edit some references create a self-signed server certificate in iis 7 import and export ssl certificates in iis 7 convert .pfx to .cer best practices for using servercertificatevalidationcallback i find value of thumbprint is equal to x509certificate.getcerthashstring retrieve the thumbprint of a certificate
when connect to https i got this error too i add this line before and connect successfully i know it from this answer and another similar anwser and the comment mentions this is a hack useful in development so putting a #if debug #endif statement around it is the least you should do to make this safer and stop this ending up in production besides i didn t try the method in another answer that use new x509certificate or new x509certificate2 to make a certificate i m not sure simply create by new will work or not

47280238
calloc	malloc
if you need zeroed memory use calloc
malloc only allocates the memory it does not zero it

47286779
vbo	vao
anyway as long you need vertices data to draw these data needs to be in memory and these data are not conceptually referenced by the vao but by the vbo
in the worst case i never tested if you request a vbo deletion while the vao still in use maybe you simply lose access to the vbo but data still in memory

47287125
google-chrome	firefox
i ve no idea what google-chrome does for other values for content-encoding
meanwhile 2017 things are fine in firefox but google-chrome does not show the progress for gzip d content

47289561
ssl	https
obviously it felt that this was dangerous if it isn t access via ssl
so all i did was made my restful service calls with https instead of http and all is fine

47289906
realloc	malloc
as per standard 7.22.2.35 the realloc function deallocates the old object pointed to by ptr and returns a pointer to a new object that has the size specified by size
it is good not to use the same pointer variable on which you are calling malloc because in case it fails you will lose reference to the old one too unless it is stored by other means

47294264
prepare	execute
finally execute the prepare statement and get the results
here is a way you can follow to search with multiples values the idea is simple in the where clause use to not get an error if the user not enter any value in this case your query is and it will return every thing the first part if to fill the query with the non empty fields the second if to fill the prepare statement with the right values

47296681
google-chrome	firefox
in addition to the information listed here i want to mention that in google-chrome whether you are using https or not will affect the availability of navigator.requestmediakeysystemaccess function
in your development environment that probably is running on http navigator.requestmediakeysystemaccess will return undefined for google-chrome whereas the same code will return a function in firefox

47297772
kerberos	ntlm
that s what the negotiate mechanism uses inside popular web browsers if kerberos fails - when not instructed by the web server otherwise. on windows operating systems the ie web browser on it and firefox if configured correctly basically says if you won t do kerberos i m going to send you an ntlm token. and the server replies no way i don t even know ntlm so i m calling what you sent me defective. since you seem to be setting this up for the first time you likely did not configure any fallback mechanism such as ntlm for when kerberos fails therefore that error message
we solve this by understanding why kerberos is failing. i think i see the reason for the failure in your question in two places related to spns and trusted sites

47303184
google-chrome	firefox
further google-chrome cannot even select which profile out of many is selected when google-chrome is started from the os call url to be opened function and not started by user-activated clicking on a google-chrome application shortcut with specific profile selection instructions
naturally the latter works 100 wonderfully on firefox which has built-in profile selector after the browser has been started and regardless of which method was used to start firefox user click on firefox icon or os pipe of open url to firefox

47305041
bash	subshell
since the bash script whenever started with a #
bin bash starts a new subshell the extended options set in the parent shell may not be reflected in the new shell

47309622
swift	objective-c
there s a section in apple s docs explaining this configuring swift interfaces in objective-c in
i think your class name might contain a character not supported by objective-c

47309765
sudo	passwd
so the solution is to run the sudo in the terminal
you do not want to type passwd in the sudo

47313183
keras	tensorflow
the argument pos_weight is used as a multiplier for the positive targets if you use the tensorflow backend in keras you can use the loss function like this keras 2.1.1 then in your model i have not found many resources yet which report well working values for the pos_weight in relation to the number of classes average active classes etc
tensorflow has a loss function weighted_cross_entropy_with_logits which can be used to give more weight to the 1 s

47316251
scikit-learn	nltk
now some additional remarks svm-theory is not much about probabilities and the support for this comes from extra-approaches using cross-validation and an additional classifier see platt scaling the core-solver of linearsvc liblinear has not inbuilt-support for this the approach of mdilip above is a valid workaround but svc is based on libsvm and therefore slower and maybe not ready for large-scale alternative build your own pipeline consisting of linearsvc scikit-learn s probability-calibration it seems someone observed this problem before
given your question there is no mentioning about some outside-wrapper like nltk except for the tag so it s hard to grasp what you really need

47322837
hive	hdfs
sqoop 1.4.6 doesn t support incremental import to a hive table directly
however you can import the incremental data without using the --hive-import option and place the incremental data in the hdfs location which is mapped to the hive table using the --target-dir option

47325216
udp	tcp
since javascript supports udp sockets link it should be possible
anyhow since it is not that easy to implement a sip useragent transaction-layer so i would google for javascript sip stacks that supports tcp udp

47326392
tensorflow	cudnn
if there is no process using the gpu tensorflow doesn t use cuda and cudnn
you can check with nvidia-smi if the gpu is used by the python tensorflow process

47328989
ciimage	uiimage
note as creating a context has overhead you do not need the cicontext if you are rendering that ciimage directly to a uiimage holder that already has a context
a uiimageview would have a context since it is displaying an image on the screen so remove the context creation and create assign the ciimage backed uiimage directly to the uiimageview in chaining filters you take the ciimage output of one filter and apply that as the ciimage input to the next filter

47328989
ciimage	uiimage
a uiimageview would have a context since it is displaying an image on the screen so remove the context creation and create assign the ciimage backed uiimage directly to the uiimageview in chaining filters you take the ciimage output of one filter and apply that as the ciimage input to the next filter
as apple puts it a ciimage object is a recipe for producing an image and since we do not render a uiimage|cgimage until the end of the chain above this chained filter rendering happens in one pass as we are only passing ciimage s through the chain

47331030
onclick	onsubmit
same for cause preventdefault is not a method of a generic jquery object it belong to the eventobject like the ones fired by a user click. i guess your console was full of undefined error. finally you can get rid of the onsumbit and onclick attribute
since you are using jquery i would try something like this the problem with your script was that event was actually undefined cause onsubmit doesn t pass any argument to the function joinusbuttoncalled

47333231
prepare	execute
but is is highly recommended to use prepare statements for protection against any sql injection attacks especially direct data from _post is used can be sanitized
checking whether query is execute or not in prepare statements is via stmt- execute

47335659
viewdidload	viewdidappear
so create the custom class for your tabbar controller and in viewdidload place the following code the imagewithcolor function is below for you hope this helps someone
my answer is similar to mehul thakkar but it is in swift 4 and to improve on his answer i would say that if you place the code in viewdidappear as he suggests users will see the change happening which is not good user experience

47336603
google-chrome	firefox
the reason you are getting different results with google-chrome edge is that firefox has its own certificate store whereas google-chrome and edge use the windows store
the error message simply means that firefox cannot establish a chain starting from a trusted certificate in its certificate store usually the root ca down to the website certificate

47338676
swift	objective-c
as mentioned apple does allow swift in static libraries as of xcode 9 beta 4
we attempted to do this on an existing project with an objective-c-based target and child static library projects and kept running into a linking error ld library not found for -lswiftswiftononesupport for architecture x86_64 also ld library not found for -lswiftdispatch for architecture x86_64 this is because the main target app is trying to build solely against objective-c and isn t told by the static library that it needs to include swift libraries

47340289
ssl	https
imo the issue is not with the extension of the keys rather the ssl configuration used
use https node module with correct ssl options for ca cert and key to enable https with express

47341784
inline	inlining
but this shouldn t worry you too much as in many cases inline code is much smaller than the original function due to the fact that it misses register saving restoring has some parts of it removed due to them being evaluated at compile time etc
if your function is relatively small inlining it might actually generate smaller code than the code required to actually call existing copy of a function

47349674
spaces	delimiter
you can load the spaces separated file directly without converting with a script like in particular not the use of skip_header to skip over the lines that don t have data
also if you explicitly specify then genfromtxt will treat each spaces as a delimiter and try to get values between the individual spaces characters so just leave that argument out

47352138
elasticsearch	kibana
there are some typos in your mapping and queries here are some fixed command which does not trigger any error when used on a instance of elasticsearch 5.6.3
you can copy and paste either in kibana or in a linux terminal in which case you should edit the first line and test them on your elasticsearch instance

47355657
arp	udp
you should not expect arp traffic to transit routers from inside to outside or vise versa
similarly udp broadcasts generally do not propagate outside the local network and it s a good thing that they don t for reasons related to both security and traffic volume

47356561
punctuation	words
i m end of line creates a words boundary after punctuation character creates a words boundary before punctuation character creates a words boundary start of line creates a words boundary there is no way to change the behavior of the words boundary metacharacter so you might be better off mapping regexes that include the full words with punctuation to the desired replacement note also that one of your examples contains a utf-8 right single quotation mark u+2019 0xe28099 not to be confused with the utf-8 ascii apostrophe u+0027 0x27
note that the apostrophe character creates a words boundary so your use of b in regular expressions is probably tripping you up

47358100
postgresql	mysql
configurations were set in the procfile rather than application.conf and were set to use postgresql on a different server
redeclaring db.default in application.conf cause securesocial to attempt to query the mysql database and thus the table token doesn t exist error

47358895
udp	tcp
now you should receive a udp packet with the content aaabbbccc on the first instance
in your second code snippet you are using tcp and you are contacting a web server on tcp port 80 not udp port 80 which responds

47361379
google-chrome	firefox
not in google-chrome let alone firefox firefox does not support event pages these events would be meaningless
running code in tabs content scripts upon extension disable uninstall a common pattern in google-chrome extensions is to use the port.ondisconnect event to detect that the background page has unloaded and use that to infer that the extension might have unloaded combined with option 1 of this method for a higher accuracy

47361379
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome s content scripts are kept around after an extension is disabled so this can be used to run asynchronous clean-up code
this is not possible in firefox because the execution context of a content script is destroyed when a firefox extension is disabled before the port.ondisconnect event has a chance to fire at least until bugzil.la 1223425 is fixed

47368862
ssl	https
we also had the same scenario and requirement 1000+ domains letsencrypt ssl and google loadbalancer but alas couldn t use google load balancer to do that
instead we made an tcp loadbalancer instead of an https one so that we could handle the 443 port

47370895
ubuntu	linux
finally from bash on ubuntu command line app you can run sudo apt-get install python3 to get latest for ubuntu
you can search your start menu for bash and get the app that will open a command prompt from within ubuntu linux not unix

47370895
ubuntu	linux
you can search your start menu for bash and get the app that will open a command prompt from within ubuntu linux not unix
afaik you cannot drag and drop into this from explorer.exe but you may be able to run a linux file app that can do this with x11 installed

47371837
awt	swing
unfortunately it works only with awt swing because it s too complicated to embed it in swingnode
you d have to change the structure of your application if you want to use jcef . it s not as hard as you think and remember - you can also embed javafx components in swing using jfxpanel

47372966
client-side	server-side
this way the server would execute confirm only once as it would not automatically redirect us anymore in case of our xmlhttprequest instead it would just tell us where we need to go and leave the responsibility to actually go there to the client-side javascript
this would mean a change of our server-side code the server would need to discern what type of response we want

i had the mimetype codec wrong and google-chrome was not as forgiving as firefox and safari

47375140
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i had the mimetype codec wrong and google-chrome was not as forgiving as firefox and safari
i changed it to and my mp4 that was encoded without audio played in google-chrome as well as the other browsers

47376980
division	modulo
the modular relationships above are not true of division
for example 12 2 m is 6 but if you applied the modulo first as the pow function does you d get 12 2 2 m which is 1 and not what you want

47381293
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu has kms support for the nvidia graphics card but openbsd only has support for the old ums driver
the openbsd kernel probably i m not sure is using 640x480 as resolution and the linux kernel is using the highest resolution supported by your monitor

47382139
couchbase	couchdb
unfortunately couchbase lite only allows filtered pull replications when the backend is couchbase server
you cannot perform a filtered replication when the backend is couchdb cloudant or anything else

47382139
cloudant	couchdb	cloudant	couchbase
you cannot perform a filtered replication when the backend is couchdb cloudant or anything else
filtered pull from couchdb pouchdb or cloudant since couchbase lite 1.2 filter functions in pull replications with non-couchbase databases are no longer available

47390307
bower	npm
for this you need to open command prompt with administrative rights type bower
if not exists then you have to install it by giving command type command npm at command prompt you will have details of path at the end

profiling	benchmarking
you may use jmh with built-in -prof gc profiling to get much more accurate estimate
here is a sample benchmarking to measure space occupied by a hashmap not counting the memory used by keys and values themselves

47391850
build.gradle	gradlew
so in the build.gradle file in the app directory add these lines the dependencies block might already be there if so just add the contents to the original block
you should not use compile when using gradlew build tools 3.0.0

47392567
build.gradle	gradlew
you need to define a bintray task in your build.gradle
since you do not have one gradlew cannot find and therefore execute that task

47395196
comparator	comparable
to use this comparison operation s it is necessary to call the method sorts the specified list according to the order induced by the specified comparator
all elements in the list must be mutually comparable using the specified comparator that is c.compare e1 e2 must not throw a classcastexception for any elements e1 and e2 in the list

47395819
dictionary	map
you could use str.count in a lambda and map the tuples to a dictionary that works result but once again collections.counter is the preferred way to do that
first in python 3 you have to force list iteration on map then your approach won t work you ll get all ones or zeroes because the expression doesn t accumulate the counts

47397971
super	implements
set in dummysslsocketfactory s costructor without this reference you would be able to reach sslsocketlayer using super but not the class even higher
i don t know what was the precise intent of who wrote this code but in this organization of classes is clear that using both composition and inheritance dummysslsocketfactory can use protected methods implements in sslsocketfactory and even of the class above to it using super

47398240
super	self
in python 3 super .__init__ in python 2 super parent self .__init__ or super child self .__init__ the error to answer your immediate question though the infinite recursion happens because of how you get the parent self will not stop being an instance of child no matter how many times you call your wrapper function
you end up calling parent.__init__ self indefinitely because the parent class never changes

47398241
implements	extends
but it doesn t seems like this has been implements yet
ideally you should create a rotationgesturerecognizer that extends onesequencegesturerecognizer

47399052
ssl	https
expanding on highercoding s answer and mrwhite s comment to get a php function to do this on a site where the https port exists but the ssl certification is invalid expired or non-existent this worked on my site in functions.php and was a combination of these two sources source 1 and source 2
as drew010 pointed out - this will still not prevent a scary prompt for users who type in https as part of your url

47401958
innodb	myisam
innodb does not have that feature
myisam does not handle foreign keys

47402504
inline	inlining
the max-performance way might be to write the whole inner loop in asm including the call instructions if it s really worth it to unroll but not inline
certainly plausible if fully inlining is causing too many uop-cache misses elsewhere

47406229
realloc	malloc
the program crashes because is uninitialized when realloc is invoked
i do not fully understand why you want to realloc instead of malloc in the allocate function

47406229
realloc	malloc
i do not fully understand why you want to realloc instead of malloc in the allocate function
but anyway let s assume realloc is what you need

47408077
fileinputstream	filechannel
also you are not closing the fileinputstream objects and only closing their channels
in that case you would not close that filechannel

47410672
git-svn	svn2git
for a one-time migration git-svn is not the right tool for conversions of repositories or parts of repositories
it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case

47410672
git-svn	svn2git
it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case
there are plenty tools called svn2git the probably best one is the kde one from

47410672
git-svn	svn2git
even though git-svn or the nirvdrum svn2git is easier to start with here are some further reasons why using the kde svn2git instead of git-svn is superior besides its flexibility the history is rebuilt much better and cleaner by svn2git if the correct one is used this is especially the case for more complex histories with branches and merges and so on the tags are real tags and not branches in git with git-svn the tags contain an extra empty commit which also makes them not part of the branches so a normal fetch will not get them until you give --tags to the command as by default only tags pointing to fetched branches are fetched also
with the proper svn2git tags are where they belong if you changed layout in svn you can easily configure this with svn2git with git-svn you will loose history eventually with svn2git you can also split one svn repository into multiple git repositories easily or combine multiple svn repositories in the same svn root into one git repository easily the conversion is a gazillion times faster with the correct svn2git than with git-svn you see there are many reasons why git-svn is worse and the kde svn2git is superior

47412963
serializable	deserialization
afaik it is not directly possible with only modifying the serializable attributes
but what you could do is introduce another type with different attributes and then adjust your deserialization logic to choose a proper serializer

47416251
addition	modulo
i ve added an additional time setting as well as an addition including milliseconds and time period for others use dt_format datetime format to check against in your case it s date time - separation by a space character following the define block is which simply matches the dt_format as specified above ensuring what precedes and supercedes it is a word boundary character or no character b leap year to further understand the leap year section of the regex.
i am assuming the following all years are not leap years unless the following is true year modulo 4 is 0 and year modulo 100 is not 0 or year modulo 400 is 0 source leap year calculation leap years have always existed at least since year 1 - since i don t want to start assuming and do even more research

runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
exceptions inheriting from runtimeexception are unchecked
you can but never need to declare unchecked-exception whether you declare them yourself or not

47426521
pandas	dask
as noted by others after some years an out-of-core pandas equivalent has emerged dask
though dask is not a drop-in replacement of pandas and all of its functionality it stands out for several reasons dask is a flexible parallel computing library for analytic computing that is optimized for dynamic task scheduling for interactive computational workloads of big data collections like parallel arrays dataframes and lists that extend common interfaces like numpy pandas or python iterators to larger-than-memory or distributed environments and scales from laptops to clusters

dask emphasizes the following virtues familiar provides parallelized numpy array and pandas dataframe objects flexible provides a task scheduling interface for more custom workloads and integration with other projects

47431988
hex	binary
if you consult the php docs for openssl_encrypt you ll note that with no options set the function will return the result of encryption as a hex string and not as raw binary data
in your java code you are base64 encoding the actual binary result of encryption as you should

jar	war
if you d like to run a spring boot webflux app please consider the executable jar deployment model
spring boot does not currently support webflux applications deployed as war

build.gradle	gradlew
and on . gradlew sourcesets it gives so there s no need to add sourceset to build.gradle if you are not using custom folder structure
ok so android studio had added sourceset to build.gradle cause i had marked change folder location while adding folder release for buildtype release

quicksort	heapsort	quicksort	mergesort
from the argsort documentation ... kind quicksort mergesort heapsort optional sorting algorithm
the default is quicksort and as wikipedia states in efficient implementations it is not a stable sort meaning that the relative order of equal sort items is not preserved

47441837
udp	tcp
tcp can t work this way because ack packets need to flow back but udp doesn t care
udp is connectionless and apparently your isp only blocks the data downlink to your phone when the data plan is exhausted

47443191
ciimage	uiimage
second the way that ciimage works is that its basically storing the image + the shader instructions for the filter
it does not actually compile and execute the shader s until you either implcitly for example by converting to uiimage or explicily create a cicontext

47445117
tensorflow	cudnn
installing tf version can be done with this helped me through the dark times tensorflow framework and listed a couple tests along the way for sanity checking
this is not much of a solution - but its the only one that worked cudnn 6 doesn t play nicely with tf

47448846
vsts	tfs
it s possible to manage tests using the tfs sdk on-premise and there is a restful api for vsts so a custom solution could be produced where time is permitting
unfortunately excel was out of the question as test plans and suites cannot be queried as usual and test cases when published were not possible to be linked to a test suite or plan. source here however you can have a try with the vsts sync migrator tool by following the steps mentioned in this article tfs 2017 migration to vsts with vsts sync migrator you can also try this tool opshub visual studio online migration utility if you want to migrate entire project from tfs to vsts then you can use the the official tfsmigrator tool and following the guide to do that

47452323
pthreads	fork
without it the com- mand would be in what pthreads terms an orphaned process group and it would not receive any job control signals
as a special case if the policy plugin does not define a close function and no pty is required sudo will execute the command directly instead of calling fork 2 first

47453086
postgresql	mysql
the basic problem while migrating from mysql i faced was i thought of the term database to be same in postgresql also but it is not
so if we are going to switch the database from our application or pgadmin the result would not be as expected. as in my case we have separate schemas considering postgresql terminology here. for each customer and separate admin schema

multiplying	multiplication
i wanted to multiplying sepal_length with sepal_width in that case you have not use for elementwiseproduct
just use standart multiplication how to use ft_elementwise_product elementwise product is a ml transformer used with pipelines

47470438
prepare	execute
when you change table columns then you change the semantic of query - you will got different execution plan and then this behave is not possible in prepare statements
the main use case of prepare statements is reusing of execution plans - plan once execute more

47474985
cdr	cons
if we break it down mapping with cdr first yielded b nil 2 3 but that is not new structure
for example the cons cell forming b is identical to the second cons cell in a b

google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested the code provided in google-chrome 62 and firefox 57
i cannot reproduce your described behavior ...in google-chrome version 62 the drop menu only appears if you first click elsewhere on the page and then on the menu icon button there is however an issue when you click the inside the which is caused by the being the event target in google-chrome

47478676
profiling	debugging
looking at the android support media types again at the time of writing... shows that high profiling is not in the listed supported types this is quite likely to be your problem - if you re-encode the video to h.264 main or baseline profiling and try again the video should work on mobile devices baseline is the most supported but does not offer as good compression as mainline so you may want to experiment to find the best match for your needs
accepting and agreeing with the comments that this is a borderline coding question answer i ll try to provide an answer but within a coding context ish... or at least referring to the tools a developer might typically use to debugging this type of problem

47479199
prepare	execute
rename table unlike alter table can rename multiple tables within a single statement prepare your new table the_table_next can be a long operation rename table the_table to the_table_prev the_table_next to the_table
very fast operation drop truncate table the_table_prev when you execute rename table you cannot have any locked tables or active transactions

47480515
serializable	deserialization
note export-clixml and import-clixml are being used because they enable robust round-tripping serializable deserialization of values although you cannot generally recreate objects of the very same type only deserialized look-alikes
by contrast using something like or its equivalent get-childitem env | out-file . env-vars.txt simply saves the get-childitem output as plain text the way it displays in the console which is not a format suitable for machine parsing deserialization

47486708
vsts	tfs
vsts build release has tasks for deploying test agents and running functional tests across your test agents
vsts does not support lab management features as they are deprecated -- tfs 2018 dropped support for it as well

47487341
cpython	pypy
for speeding up python itself the main supported method is cpython
python-for-android does not support pypy

47487470
swift	objective-c
check your swift bridging header project-bridging-header.h for problems
you might be importing an objective-c header that doesn t exist etc

47489400
serializable	deserialization
canwritetype in your case should always return false since you are not intersted in customizing serializable
as regards deserialization you could use standard jsonmediatypeformatter through inheritance or aggregation and set its serializersettings to use snakecasenamingstrategy remaining part is applying of such custom formatter on controller level

47492154
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
while i didn t found why safari wants to force ssl and doesn t want to use the non secure http version of my site on this vagrant homestead box like firefox or google-chrome i found a way to mark the self signed site certificate as trusted in macos keychain access
note that shouldn t be an issue with prior version of macos since safari used to allow you to add an exception directly in the browser and continue to a site with an invalid ssl certificate

47494457
client-side	server-side
as far as i can tell from this description and from personal experience of the editor it is an entirely client-side tool
it does not have any server-side component

47497111
google-chrome	firefox
reviewing the list of permissions for pages in both google-chrome 1 and firefox 2 doesn t suggest any explicit permission for this
server workers would be irrelevant to it. 1 if you click the lock info dangerous icon next to the page s url you can see all available permissions in google-chrome source

47497503
gson	jackson
some others are boon gson and java api for json processing. one advantage that jackson has over other libraries is its maturity
jackson has evolved enough to become the preferred json processing library of some major web services frameworks ... this good article of dzone may give you some highlights nonetheless since you didn t define what elegant means to you and as you are speaking about gson i agree this answer may not suit you and might disappear

47499066
memcpy	memmove
42 ... 42 by using for example the library functions 17.6.1.2 std memcpy or std memmove
it says for example because std memcpy and std memmove are not the only ways in which the underlying bytes are intended to be allowed to be copied

47500966
udp	tcp
i already did so with vmware but i only used udp and i mixed up c and assembly code it is not easy
you have to send raw ethernet packets which means you ll have to build the content of the whole ip packet yourself - and the tcp protocol is a lot more complex than the udp protocol so http would be very very complex

git-svn	svn2git

hive	hdfs
you need to drop the existing partitions that was pointing to the original location hdfs location1 partition x manually. use below command to drop all the partitions manually once all the partitions are dropped run the below command to update the new partitions in hive metastore msck repair table test
because since the location of table was changed but the hive metastore was not updated with the new partitions in new location

47502642
client-side	server-side
javascript can also run on the client-side in a visitor s browser
javascript on the client-side doesn t have access to anything server-side unless you create an endpoint

47502642
client-side	server-side
javascript on the client-side doesn t have access to anything server-side unless you create an endpoint
client-side javascript is really not much more capable than a user with a mouse and keyboard

47511964
division	addition
and while the floor division operator is supported in numexpr the problem is that the expression is made into a variablenode to be used in the expression for which floor division is not supported
keep in mind that for instance the addition operator is supported

47513737
wildfly	jboss
if you check the xsd defining this namespace which can be found in the docs schema dir of your wildfly install in this case as the wildfly-ejb3_3_5_0.xsd file you ll find as omoro pointed out that this tag should be at the root of your subsystem with a value boolean attribute
your subsystem tag s namespace is incorrect enable-graceful-txn-shutdown isn t defined in urn jboss domain ejb3 4.0 but in urn jboss domain ejb3 5.0 which is new in wildfly 11

punctuation	words
or a punctuation character such as an underscore that connects words
or any kind of punctuation character that is not a dash bracket quote or connector

47514786
erlang	elixir
the erlang fwrite function is expecting a list of characters not an elixir binary hence the double quotes don t work while the single quotes do
adding dogbert s comment as an answer try using single quotes a word of additional explanation single quotes in elixir indicate a character list see here for more details

47515179
prng	random
in that case you want a deterministic prng which you can seed
urandom on the other hand cannot be seeded and draws its source of entropy from many unpredictable sources making it more random

47516865
spaces	linefeed
the whole code will output the current character if it is not a spaces character
if it is a spaces character then the code performs a newline sequence carriage return + linefeed

47517581
scala	typesafe
the reason you see java.lang.object as the result of apply in java is originated from the richer type system of scala
is covariant in its return type which cannot be expressed on the jvm in a typesafe way that java can also interpret so the return type of the apply is going to be object

47518174
super	self
method attribute access on a super proxy object like ordinary method binding just passes the object implicitly as the first positional argument
change this super .__setitem__ self key val to this super .__setitem__ key val note that ordereddict doesn t use cooperative inheritance it just calls dict.__setitem__ directly

47518174
super	self
change this super .__setitem__ self key val to this super .__setitem__ key val note that ordereddict doesn t use cooperative inheritance it just calls dict.__setitem__ directly
ideally every object in the inheritance chain should be using super

47519050
prepare	execute
if you concatenate values into the sql string as you are doing there s not much benefit to using a prepare statement
instead prepare a statement with placeholders and execute it repeatedly for the various different values

47519891
google-chrome	firefox
if for some reason google-chrome wont be suitable for you it doesn t work with proxies in headless mode you can try headless firefox -headless flag or phantomjs
you can start a virtual x-server called xvfb. however latest google-chrome builds have headless mode just start it with --headless flag

47522753
keras	tensorflow
the heart of it is very similar to note the references and code in the post we aggregated helpful hints from others in the keras pages and here on stackoverflow
we solved this problem in the way mo-hossny described above not tied to the imagenet folder structure with keras tensorflow backend and described it in gory detail here

com.android.tools.build gradlew version from 2.2.3 to use as below you may or may not also encounter this issue please update your build tools

47532110
wildfly	jboss
you have two possibilities chown somewhere in the entrypoint making an .sh for entrypoint to make this possible from inside the container something like chown jboss jboss opt jboss wildfly standalone log change permissions directly outside the container in the host you will not have jboss user or group you need to do directly with de id
look the container etc passwd and get the jboss user id docker exec jboss cat etc passwd write down the id and make chown in the host chown 1001 1001 tmp michael best way is 1 of course

47534390
elasticsearch	kibana
here are a few recommendations if your elasticsearch cluster is running on the same node as your local machine try the following uninstalling xpack use kibana i prefer using kibana to postman for elasticsearch query
it makes it very easy to write query in es dsl and provides autosuggestion if the elasticsearch cluster does not exist on your local machine or you don t want to uninstall xpack try passing the authorization token via the header

47535642
noexcept	throw
if we don t want objects copy construction to be used when a reallocation of the container occurs it is indeed possible with a move constructor but only if it has the noexcept specification
containers refuse to move construct elements if the constructor might throw an exception because it could lead to a container in a bad state that cannot be cleaned

47537925
implements	extends
the fake class created doesn t extends anything since it wouldn t know what to extends implements
so the type hint in the willthrowexception will not be matched because your mock object didn t extends exception

47539562
serializable	deserialization
first define mongoextensiondatasettingsnamingstrategy as follows then serializable your root object as follows notes here i am inheriting from defaultnamingstrategy but you could inherit from camelcasenamingstrategy if you prefer
the naming strategy is only invoked to remap extension data names and dictionary keys during serialization not deserialization

47539937
punctuation	words
you can use a words boundary b for john or with case_when from dplyr note b matches a words boundary which could be either a space or punctuation
for example johnatan would not be matched since john follows another letter a not a words boundary

47540532
ssl	https
sftp ftp over ssh is very different than ftps ftp over ssl which is probably what you want instead
but either way wininet simply does not support sftp or ftps the internet_flag_secure flag is only supported for https

janusgraph	titan
quoting my own answer on the janusgraph-users mailing list in response to the same question has some results for various graph databases including titan but that framework does not support janusgraph so it is not represented in that list
if you re interested in adapting this framework to support janusgraph please go ahead

47542166
build.gradle	gradlew
however i had disabled jar task in build.gradle that caused it to fail to resolve classes in the dependent modules and fail with the above error
if you are using gradlew as your build tool then ensure that jar task is not disabled

prepare	execute
confer with the following reference mysql question execute multiple semi-colon separated query using mysql prepare statement however you can rephrase your update query into a single statement
this is not possible because prepare execute stmt can only handle one statement at a time

47552168
portrait	landscape
chrome crops and scales the video coming from the webcam to fulfill your constraints so you should get a portrait image if you use a resolution where the height does not go over the sensor s max height 270x480 which is 16 times smaller than 1080x1980 you can use the getusermedia camera resolution finder to find the landscape resolutions supported by your webcam browser combo
the imac and all desktop devices has a landscape positioned webcam image sensor so you ll only be able to capture at the sensor s max resolution in landscape mode 1920x1080

sudo	passwd
if you want to keep using keychain -- you may not have necessary components installed if they are available for your environment -- sudo apt-get install gnome-keyring might be needed
it seems that your passwd tokens are not saved remembered across ide sessions

47559389
n-gram	words
the stop words removal will not affect your n-gram
a vocabulary tokens list is first created according to your tokenizer and ngram range then stop words are removed from this list so only unigrams will be affected as the stop words list contains ungrams only

47561274
ssl	socks
instead the operator of the socks server might in this case easily man-in-the-middle your insecure ssl connection since he is alreafy in the right position in the network to do this
socks by itself does not encrypt anything nor does it break any encryption

47561274
ssl	socks
in your specific case you are using ssl inside the socks connection which means that the application data will be encrypted the same way as without socks proxy if you use ssl properly strong ciphers proper server authentication it will also be strongly protected when using a socks proxy
if instead you fail in doing ssl correctly like not validating the servers certificate properly socks will not help to protect the data

addition	multiplication
now to your addition operations
as much as you play with them before and after the multiplication it doesn t do more than change the result by a constant

47564824
stateless	stateful
for example create service proxy of stateful service in stateless service and call its method and stateful service
you do not use ireliablestatemanager directly in stateless service rather call stateful service from stateless and pass object needs to be saved

47566148
swift	objective-c
short answer yes it is possible by wrapping swift code in objective-c code written in such a way that it is callable from c as already suggested by josh homann
however here are some things to note if the c code you want to call swift from is part of a command-line utility you may run into a problem loading swift libraries at runtime see and osx command line tool with swift cocoa library library not loaded you cannot use swift-specific data types in c code so the objective-c wrapper will have to do all the data type translation

47566800
viewdidload	viewdidappear
we should never initialize subviews in loadview so i try to move that code to viewdidload but it looks like this the subviews doesn t locate as expected
after moving that code to viewdidappear the problem disappeared

47569077
required	placeholder
the cost tensor is a function of the placeholder tensors and this required them to have a value
since the call to sess.run cost isn t feeding those placeholder you re seeing the error

47573889
ssl	https
if you want to access the api via https the port is 6984 not 5984 and for a non-google app engine server you need something like nginx set up to provide a ssl certificate
on google app engine ssl certificates are provided

47576148
super	self
it does not run because you call super wrong
as kivy launcher uses python 2 you need to pass your class view and the instance self to super

47576482
bash	subshell
bash extension
and || true logical and syntax error parsed as an and command separator equivalent but deprecated by posix³ posix and reliable equivalent false syntax error is interpreted as a subshell equivalent but is deprecated by posix posix equivalent 5 word splitting and filename generation upon expansions split+glob true quotes not needed syntax error expands to syntax error if there s more than one file in the current directory

47579122
punctuation	words
... + of any 1+ words chars letters digits _ - due to w+ that are not all digits followed with a dot note that to match only letters and digits you need to use or instead of w or if you are really after matching the blocks that may even have symbols or punctuation replace w with - any char but whitespace or dot d+ - 1 or more digits - 1 or more occurrences of
- a dot - not followed with 1+ digits d+ followed with a dot or end of string w+ - 1 or more words chars - end of string

47583062
spaces	delimiter
the problem with your use of strtok is that you didn t include spaces in the delimiter list
also if you want the i character to be part of the token it should not be in the delimiter list

47584093
noexcept	throw
since the standard is not very explicit about noexcept for main function as we ve seen we can try to deduct some behaviour and check the implementations
from here whenever an exception is throw and the search for a handler encounters the outermost block of a non-throwing function the function std terminate is called

47584201
queue	fifo
it uses a fifo queue to record which nodes need processing
the queue is moderately robust but it stops abruptly if asked to add an element for which there isn t room

47584721
spaces	delimiter
just process file line by line split each line by spaces and have each value in its own place in the array as example btw there are tons of possibilities more complex more simple more elegant etc.
if you have fixed format file as you showed then you do not need to complicate it with dateformat scanner delimiter etc

47596165
portrait	landscape
issue you re experiencing with a video working in landscape but not portrait sounds more like an issue with the email client than your code
there are a few examples here to help bulletproof your video code for email though i m not sure anything in there directly addressed the landscape vs

arp	udp
arp is essential part of communicating via ip camera without arp support makes no sense
and arp isn t a result of converting udp it s a preliminary step before sending actual udp datagram

47598814
arp	udp
and arp isn t a result of converting udp it s a preliminary step before sending actual udp datagram
once arp reply is discovered with destination mac-address udp packet is sent to that destination

47598814
arp	udp
once arp reply is discovered with destination mac-address udp packet is sent to that destination
the issue you see isn t about hardcoding mac to avoid arp

47602580
keras	tensorflow
keras predict indeed returns probabilities and not classes
cannot reproduce your issue with my system configuration python version 2.7.12 tensorflow version 1.3.0 keras version 2.0.9 numpy version 1.13.3 here is my prediction output for your x_slice with the loaded model trained for 20 epochs as in your code i suspect some rounding issue when printing or you have trained for much more epochs and your probabilities for the training set have gotten very close to 1 .

47603007
multiplying	multiplication
you re basically multiplying the grey values with the rgb color you want to make the patch
by inverting the patch and the color first and inverting the result the multiplication makes the patch brighter not darker

47603746
comparator	comparable
note that the definition of is int comparator t o
and not you commented i added the extends comparable but it was conflicting with my interface and i didnt want to change my interface because this was for an assignment

47603798
inline	inlining
gcc already knows how to optimize an absolute-value and hiding that process from the compiler inside inline asm will make your code optimize worse not better
writing absolute value in pure c is always at least as good unless the compiler decides to make branchy code after inlining into something and profiling shows that branching was the wrong choice. the advantages over inline asm include the compilers knows the result is non-negative and can optimize accordingly

47605374
single-quotes	double-quotes
putting it together write like this as edmorton pointed out it will be more robust to use single-quotes and break out of it as needed to double-quote only the specific parts where variables are used like this this is more robust because this way you don t need to scan the entire string if there is something that might need to be escaped like the in my first proposal
variables are not expanded inside ... . change the single-quotes to double-quotes. on the other hand the inside double-quotes will be interpreted to escape the newline that follows it but in this case you need it to be a literal for the i command of sed . inside double-quotes you need to write that as

47607166
super	self
calling self.get_dough may be not possible if you are overriding the get_dough method of the parent class like here class abdullahstore doughfactory def get_dough self return abdullah s special + super .get_dough i think this is a frequent scenario in practice
if we call doughfactory.get_dough self directly then the behaviour is fixed

47612740
union	distinct
the one exception to this being union all
if you wanted a unique result set using not in or not exists you would also need to include distinct or group by all the columns which you want to be unique

47614433
opera	firefox
before | after not working with firefox okay with opera chrome.
i can t find a hack for firefox about 3d transforms because i think it s the problem

47621197
swift	objective-c
while direct equivalent is not available with swift this can be achieved relatively elegantly with objective-c and categories
myclass should still inherit from nsobject and have a class static swiftyload method which gets invoked from objective-c in myclass.m which you include in compile sources alongside myclass.swift the best part there s no need to mess with bridging headers or anything else it just works

47621561
swift	objective-c
aleclarson nailed it but as of recent swift 4 you cannot directly override initialize
you still can achieve it with objective-c and categories for classes inheriting from nsobject with a class static swiftyinitialize method which gets invoked from objective-c in myclass.m which you include in compile sources alongside myclass.swift if your class cannot inherit from nsobject and using +load instead of +initialize is a suitable fit you can do something like this there are couple of gotchas especially when using this approach in static libraries check out the complete post on medium for details

47622759
namenode	hdfs
the url that start with hdfs points at a hdfs that in the above example is managed by a namenode at localhost 8020
that means that hdfs does not require hadoop yarn but is usually used together because they come together and is just simple to use together

47624811
vsts	tfs
this feature is only available for accounts that have been migrated to vsts using the tfs database import service
but since i didn t import my vsts i m on the inheritance process model. which does not currently support this feature as confirmed here in comments rohandaniel ehofman msft devmartechops you are correct

47625037
single-quotes	double-quotes
the issue is that shells including bash do not expand variables when they are inside single-quotes
your command will work if you switch to double-quotes

47626041
exponent	modulo
for rsa the public exponent may not be known but it is usually set to a fixed number 65537
this together with the modulo - also part of the private key - makes the public key

47629148
ubuntu	linux
the pyimagesearch website by adrian rosebrock has a tutorial on how to download and compile opencv for ubuntu with this functionality
to install the opencv-python package without the optional contrib modules into python3 pip3 install opencv-python --user to install the opencv-python package with the optional contrib modules into python3 pip3 install opencv-contrib-python --user then to import the module import cv2 for both of these installations their pypi sites state this version does not support video related functionality for macos and linux

47629390
memcpy	malloc
moreover notice that you need to pass buf_copy just like you did for buf without taking the address of it or something since memcpy expects pointers for its two first parameters and and are pointers already
it cannot be done without ireation because malloc may not have returned contigeous memory

47631392
flask	django
flask is micro what-does-micro-mean the micro in microframework means flask aims to keep the core simple but extensible
flask won t make many decisions for you such as what database to use so you should understand many options that django has in box not in flask for many solution you need to find extension which is better for your project

47631758
spaces	delimiter
for a bit less complexity instead of using temporary files you can load your whole source file into the working memory and then just overwrite it but that would work only for files that can fit your working memory while the above approach can work with files as large as your free storage spaces
the format itself seems to be using multiple lines as delimiter while your r t is not doing anything you re instructing python to split on a literal t

47636742
scikit-learn	liblinear
you can take a quick glance into the sources here which shows that only coefficients intercepts and number of iterations are processed by scikit-learn s python-api
whatever else is available in liblinear s output is not grabbed

47640306
keras	tensorflow
if both are installed than keras will use only cpu version
i solved it with the answer given by keras with tensorflow backend not using gpu you need to uninstall both tensorflow and tensorflow-gpu

47644026
shadowing	named
but to quote from the rust book note that shadowing a named does not alter or destroy the value it was bound to and the value will continue to exist until it goes out of scope even if it is no longer accessible by any means
somebody mentioned variable shadowing but i m pretty sure that only applies in different scopes

47646020
qqmlapplicationengine	qquickview
when you create your project you should get the default main.cpp main.cpp main.qml so let s analyze the elements and use the documentation for it qqmlapplicationengine qqmlapplicationengine provides a convenient way to load an application from a single qml file
... unlike qquickview qqmlapplicationengine does not automatically create a root window

47646150
hex	binary
thus 2 hex characters per byte
binary bits msb on left and hexadecimal 0000 0 0001 1 0010 2 0011 3 ... 1001 9 1010 a ... 1111 f to say 10 f 11 e is not hexadecimal

47647534
des	aes
though key length is 64-bit des has an effective key length of 56 bits since 8 of the 64 bits of the key are not used by the encryption algorithm function as check bits only
advanced encryption standard aes the more popular and widely adopted symmetric encryption algorithm likely to be encountered nowadays is the advanced encryption standard aes

47647552
innodb	myisam
this is not an issue as long as the following criteria is met your database schema is well designed 2nf compliant at least you use foreign keys to link the tables mysql s docs you join the tables by their fk you have the hardware resources necessary to run your data efficiently on mysql with innodb on 2nf compliant schema using foreign keys the join performance by the fk will be among the last things you d ever be concerned
historically there was a db engine in mysql - the myisam - that did not support foreign key constraints

47653377
stateless	stateful
if you create two stateless widgets using the same arguments then they will be the same
a stateful widget however is not necessarily the same as another built with the same constructor arguments

47653377
stateless	stateful
the parent widget is stateless because it does not care about its child s state
the stateful child itself or technically flutter will take care of its own state

47657534
hex	binary
encrypted string after one base64 decode after a second base64 decode displayed in hex because it is not binary 8ce5c8ef312ef4b0a1a8b3cf95bc978a0ba32506c01a0b5f9264689486cb7dc8 that is what needs to be provided to the decryption function
the decrypted result is in hex 257531362a2179704b40577255516272 in ascii u16

47658741
boost	stl
so either use boost as suggested by other in this thread or write your own function which you essentially already did -
indeed the stl does not have a simple std contains function

47660225
vsts	tfs
but at the moment it s not showing up on the tfs vsts feature timeline
there is no easy import export option either though there are a few tools like vsts sync migration tool that can copy over work items and map them to a new structure

47663051
n-gram	words
example note that this assumes the n-gram are pairwaise different for fixed n they shouldn t have a common words since subn will delete that words the firs time it sees it and thus won t be able to find occurence of other n-gram containing that particular words
as a complement to tilak putta s answer note that you are searching the string twice once when counting the occurrences of the n-gram with .count and once more when you remove the matches using re.sub

47665936
punctuation	words
i am not sure why you want to match embolden the trailing punctuation and onde where substring
i would recommend this pattern to optionally match referente then the à then the all-caps words to follow

47666036
client-side	server-side
for now only client-side hooks such as pre-push hook pre-commit hook etc are supported for vsts git repo
the server-side hooks is not available for now but already in our backlog for vsts git repo you can also find it in this user voice

47666571
virtualenv	conda
i made tox and conda work together in windows by installing virtualenv with conda in the environment which i use tox conda install virtualenv creating directory junction symlinks from c pythonxy to my actual environment path
this gets around the interpreternotfound -error mklink j c pythonxy c real path to mypythonxyenv i have installed anaconda in e anaconda3 and all my environments in e anaconda3 envs e anaconda3 envs py27 see below for a script to make this quick and easy. step 1 - create environments with conda step 2 - create all the symlinks note i call conda create from a directory on the e-drive so the --prefix -p option is not required in order to install new environments in e anaconda3 envs

47669527
google-chrome	safari
this is not the system webview which uses the latest google-chrome from android. we are going to change this at some point in the future to use the system webview because crosswalk development has been discontinued
on ios airconsole uses the system webview which uses the internal safari

47675263
build.gradle	gradlew
add to build.gradle then you can do gradlew dependencyupdates to get a report of new versions
unlike the eponymous maven plugin there doesn t seem to be a way of automatically updating the build.gradle yet

47675959
division	addition
int len array batch_size will round the division down to the nearest integer so the last batch wouldn t be processed
to round up the division you can use in addition you might end up with the last batch being very tiny compared to the rest

47677790
profiling	debugging
use profiling whatever-name-profile-to-activate-if-needed on your security configuration class that extends websecurityconfigureradapter nb
i need to debugging to know why why exclude auto configuration did not work for me

47681187
innodb	myisam
my guess is that myisam will never be fully removed because there are too many sites that wouldn t be able to upgrade without doing expensive testing to make sure their specific app won t experience any regression issues by converting to innodb
but you might notice that in the mysql 5.7 manual the section on myisam has been demoted to alternative storage engines which should be a clue that it s receiving less priority

47681187
innodb	myisam
all system tables are innodb in mysql 8.0
myisam still does not support any of the properties of acid

47681187
innodb	myisam
see my answer to myisam versus innodb
myisam still does not support foreign keys for what it s worth

47681187
innodb	myisam
innodb or other mvcc implementations doesn t keep this count persisted because every transaction viewing the table might see a different row count
only a storage engine that has table-level locking and no transaction isolation like myisam can optimize this case

47681187
innodb	myisam
again this requires table-level locking so it s not supported in innodb
it s still easy to move a myisam table from server to server because the .myd and .myi files are self-contained

47682225
ionic	angular
you have done a number of things which were against the ionic 3.9.2
you must never use the latest angular since the ionic team has not tested it yet

47682225
ionic	angular
you must never use the latest angular since the ionic team has not tested it yet
you used angular 5.0.1

47684337
equals	compareto	comparator	comparable
note this from the treeset documentation however note that the ordering maintained by a set whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if it is to correctly implement the set interface
see comparable or comparator for a precise definition of consistent with equals. this is so because the set interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a treeset instance performs all element comparisons using its compareto or compare method so two elements that are deemed equal by this method are from the standpoint of the set equal

47691862
swift	objective-c
a key-path expression accepts property references and chained property references such as animal.name.count using swift with cocoa and objective-c there are detail
in swift all class inherit nsobject are kvc compliant there is type not instance any for type anyobject for instance objective-c is for objective-c class call it

runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
runtimeexception doesn t have to be declared or caught
it s an unchecked-exception that s its purpose

47698399
entity-relationship	diagram
strictly speaking normalization pertains to the relational model of data but not to the entity-relationship model of data
entity-relationship diagram are frequently used to depict either one of these two models or some kind of hybrid model that combines features of both entity-relationship and relational

47699714
realloc	malloc
.... so you re not allowed to use pointer aritmatic go generate a new address pass that to realloc and expect to re-allocate partially that makes no sense
no you can only realloc on the actual pointer previously returned by malloc or family

47699714
realloc	malloc
otherwise it s undefined behavior quoting c11 chapter 7.22.3.5 if ptr is a null pointer the realloc function behaves like the malloc function for the specified size
otherwise if ptr does not match a pointer earlier returned by a memory management function or if the space has been deallocated by a call to the free or realloc function the behavior is undefined

47701408
inline	inlining
2 with inlining the process will be called only under certain logging level and our important bussiness logic wont be able to run the compiler in this case has to figure out how the message string is created and not inline the method if it calls any other method during its creation
raffi lets look at an example on how the compiler inlining you are talking about will change the program logic and compiler needs to be very smart enough to be able to figure that out 1 without inlining the process will be callled regardless of logging level log level.fine very expensive string to construct ... + process

47708838
rvm	bundler
you can ssh to the remote server and check yourself ssh deploy my-ip ruby -v # it s probably not 2.3.1 which bundle rvm use 2.3.1 # this is the actual version will be used by capistrano which bundle if you cannot see the bundle installed within ruby-2.3.1 you can manually install it by rvm use 2.3.1 gem install bundler after that the capistrano deployment should work as expected
when deploying a rails app using capistrano with rvm you have to be carefully that capistrano will switch the ruby version and it might not the same ruby version as you see

47711564
elasticsearch	kibana
the rest of the configuration is about log parsing and is not relevant in this context. the only other important part is the output 99-output.conf send data to elasticsearch hope you got the point here
pros of this approach once deployed filebeat and logstash as long as you don t need to parse a new type of log you don t need to update filebeat nor logstash configuration in order to get a new log in kibana

47711602
required	placeholder
it doesn t seem to required ddl or any real action in the first sub-block though just doing null
as a placeholder doesn t trigger it possibly because the compiler removes it but it does seem to need the if inside both exception handlers as with your example the exception is thrown by line 13 so should be reported as re- raised at line 18

47711943
margin	text-align
stack snippet as an alternative you could drop the col elements and add the built-in class justify-content-center to the row element stack snippet the main difference between the two besides their markup is that the small gap margin between the icon title are in the first sample in their parents center and in the alternative it is not there the icon title center as a group
with the existing markup two main things need to be done col has predefined paddings which needs to be reset use text-align right to align the svg to the right additionally svg elements w o a width set can cause trouble on some browsers so i gave it one here added to its markup with this you can now either add a margin or a padding of your choice to the col elements in the alternative below to the elements and in these samples i used margin

47712091
google-chrome	firefox
this is really annoying to deal with but mapping the local website to something other than .dev i personally use .devo does work and fixes the problem in google-chrome
also you can add an exception for the page in mozilla firefox and not deal with this at all

47712414
comparator	comparable
here the lambda expression does not do much but in situations where you have a class that doesn t implement comparable and you want to compare objects of that class using a property of that class that is comparable this is very useful. the call to get is required because max comparator return an optional object
to solve this please use the following code comparator.comparing method requires a function that takes an input and returns a comparable

47713560
innodb	myisam
because of that not only is a query on a innodb primary key one fewer b-tree lookup than a secondary index but the primary key b-tree can be significantly smaller because of the physically ordering of the data on disk
it stands to reason even if there were a mechanism to make a secondary index that pointed directly to a data record like an index myisam it wouldn t perform as well as innodb s primary clustered index

47716294
matplotlib	colormap
that means if you read an image with opencv but want to display with matplotlib you need to convert the image from bgr to rgb before displaying that s the reason the colors are weird
also not that important but color images are not displayed with a colormap so showing the colormap does not do anything for you

47719111
fgets	getline	fgets	fgetc	fgetc	getline
the most portable way is to use repeated calls to fgetc or the like instead of fgets
i recommend fgetc or the common but not c standard getline another alternative use it is very cumbersome yet a portable way is possible

47719139
dplyr	purrr
i m not sure how this would affect the dplyr count function but installing the cran version of purrr solved the problem
i had the development version purrr_0.2.4.9000 of purrr installed

47719143
inline	inlining
inlineonly specifies that the method should never be called directly specifies that this function should not be called directly without inlining so i feel like this is a case where the call to set should have been inline but it was not
had the call been inline you would have ended up with compiled code that is practically identical to the working version since the method only contains a call to put

47724063
set	bag
instead of having layout update_layout to set loading true your reducer could just know that whenever there s an add_item and load_item that means it should be loading true
if that implicitness isn t your bag your could instead use extra metadata as the signal rather than the action type itself

47726681
entity-relationship	diagram
entity-relationship diagram aren t a good fit for document databases
the entity-relationship model supports many-to-many binary as well as ternary and higher relationships composite keys and attributes on relationships all of which aren t directly supported in hierarchical network model dbmss

47727402
queue	fifo
the behavior you see is because there are multiple types of queue in the event loop and the system runs events in an order according to their type
it is not just one giant event queue where everything runs in fifo order based on when it was added to the event queue

47727402
queue	fifo
it is not a strict fifo queue among all types
events are fifo within a group

47727687
uicollectionview	uitableview
as you describe the uicollectionview s are actually each children of their own parent uitableviewcell and as such are not direct descendants of the uitableviewcontroller
this is because the cells will be added to the uitableview at run time

47729299
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome firefox edge i didn t test in safari. basically in firefox and edge the range input looks like its locked into the first column and doesn t honor the grid-template-areas rule
this is because of a default setting on this type of input set by these browsers firefox so basically these inputs are set to width 12em

47730528
xlib	xcb
i didn t exactly need unicode but i was still lost because there was nothing to let me obtain composed input from the keystrokes pressing shift and 7 should result in unfortunately to quote xcb s to-do list current status currently xcb only implements the bits given in the x window system protocol and even this support is not complete compared to xlib character encoding no xlookupstring ...
so if you have to use xcb it makes things all the harder as there are no equivalent functions for the key press event returned by xcb - xcb_key_press_event_t

47734231
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
the second solution has the problem that you are using the viewport coordinate and not the scene if you add an item and then enlarge the qgraphicsview without moving the item then you see a scroll
initial after changing the size a solution that corrects both errors is to overwrite the drawbackground method of qgraphicsscene the advantage of this solution is that it does not load any new object besides that the graph is in the coordinates of the scene so there is no displacement of the second solution

47734874
rtp	rtsp
i was thinking of another desktop app that will run on the server hosting the webapp and then it will stream the same content again and then the webapp can simply display the content by acceding to the local ip with the rtp port but this doesn t solve the mystery of transferring a live streaming from the client to the server
all the libraries above follow strict rtsp rtp specification which requires opening a listening port on your host side which is undoubtedly going to be behind a nat d address

47739868
implements	extends
also an interface cannot implements any other interface. when it comes to a class it can extends one other class and implements any number of interfaces
it is not possible for an interface to inherit or extends multiple interface

haskell can not optimize coerce as an unsafe cast unlike agda coq
there is another aspect of haskell that the quoted paragraph mentions the coercion language

ionic	angular
however i created a typescript file to stub the methods and call through to the plugin if your interested i then mock out the plugin to be used with ionic serve selecting a mocked barcode and calling barcode scanned events here s a full example using 3 types of barcode scanners linea honeywell and camera honeywell-barcode-scanner.mock.ts plugin-factories.ts then in app.module.ts
using honeywell at the top of any provider page you need it in should be enough there s no need to amend app.module.ts its not a dependency angular can handle

47753013
queue	fifo
a true quick sort requires the ability to swap elements something not easily done with a queue probably requiring moving portions of the queue to temp queue in order to swap elements
a quick sort like algorithm can be used for fifo type containers like a queue

47758688
build.gradle	gradlew
the idea cloud tools plugin supports new project generation but only for native intellij projects and doesn t generate a build.gradle for you
i wouldn t recommend it as a starting point for a gradlew based project anyway due to its directory structure

a good difference is given in this tutorial side by side testng vs junit what s the difference
the declaration of beforeclass and afterclass method has to be static in junit whereas there is more flexibility in testng in the method declaration it does not have these constraints

47765625
junit	testng
the declaration of beforeclass and afterclass method has to be static in junit whereas there is more flexibility in testng in the method declaration it does not have these constraints
in testng we can parametrize tests using 2 ways

47765625
junit	testng
a similar feature exists in junit categories but lacks the beforegroups aftergroups testng annotations that allow initializing the test tearing it down
parallelism if you d like to run the same test in parallel on multiple threads testng has you covered with a simple to use annotation while junit doesn t offer a simple way to do so out of the box

junit	testng
parallelism if you d like to run the same test in parallel on multiple threads testng has you covered with a simple to use annotation while junit doesn t offer a simple way to do so out of the box
testng dataprovider can also support xml for feeding in data csvs or even plain text files

google-chrome	firefox
on google-chrome a maximum of 3 notifications is displayed at any time even if the other notifications are not related to your site or from onesignal
this means you can only show 3 categories of notifications to your user not counting for other notifications that might be displayed at that time. on firefox on windows many more notifications can be shown at a time 6+

47769559
firefox	safari
this means you can only show 3 categories of notifications to your user not counting for other notifications that might be displayed at that time. on firefox on windows many more notifications can be shown at a time 6+
on firefox on mac and safari on mac only one notification can be shown at a time even if the other notifications are not related to your site or from onesignal

47769780
prepare	execute
by default ole db provider for db2 uses 128 package sections which allows client to execute 128 concurrent prepare statements for each initiated connection
if outstanding concurrent statements exceeds number of default predefined sections it not able to execute new statement

47772255
udp	tcp
of course in some cases -think of remote neurosurgical robots- that might not be enough i surely have misunderstood the benefits of tcp vs udp
if you just used udp a given packet could be fragmented lost or received several times

47774217
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
illegalargumentexception inherits from runtimeexception
runtimeexception and all classes that inherit from it are unchecked-exception and do not have to be declared

47785541
vmware	virtualbox
i know this was posted some time ago and i am not sure if you came right but the only way i have managed to get it working is by installing android in a vmware virtual machine
the steps i used are as follows 1 downloaded the android iso from i downloaded the android-x86_64-7.1-rc2.iso 2 downloaded vmware from www.vmware.com 3 followed instructions on here it is possible to install on virtualbox from what i see but i have never tried it

47785863
factors	mean
i use the latter below the factors which must be integers are of up- and down-sampling
that is 1 2 means size divided by 2 2 1 means size multiplied by 2 2 3 would mean up by 2 then down by 3 so the size is multiplied by 2 3 possible downside the process happens independently in each dimension so the spatial structure may not be taken into account as well as by ndimage methods

47795626
prepare	execute
i ve used cqrs+es in similar case. i created projection with prepare data that i could only update but not rebuild. and on every query i built result info from this quickly
if you need to execute some long operations like update in db use sagas

47797812
listview	gridview
there is really no concept of binding and viewstates out of the box like in webforms and not much built-in controls like gridview listview unless you are going to use mvc extensions like these as for links for good resources you can t go wrong with this site and this one too
in mvc there is no gridview to bind to and no viewstates unlike in webforms

47797820
implements	extends
hence it is desired that if the wrapped list is a random access list the wrapper should implements randomaccess too so that methods receiving such a wrapper are still able to detect whether fast random access is available or not
if you look at the implementation of synchronizedrandomaccesslist you will see that all it does is extends synchronizedlist and implementing randomaccess to inherit the behavior and marking itself as having fast random access

47797881
swift	objective-c
i don t believe swift currently has a native not dependant on the objective-c runtime api for doing this kind of reflection
however if you re on an apple platform and therefore have objective-c interoperability you could get a list of all classes registered with the objective-c runtime and then filter those that conform to a given protocol

47798765
stateless	stateful
however if you aren t using redux you generally will have the state in a high level stateful component with stateless components beneath it
the base component will pass the data from your ajax request to its stateless children by way of props which are read-only

47799736
fgets	getchar
you can store it as a char array and use fgets for that this is only if you want to print the number otherwise not needed
you can use getchar also and do the sum as shown in the proof here

47800773
direct3d	directx
it s not actually part of direct3d at all and is an optional side-by-side component that only ships in the legacy directx sdk
as noted you need to link with d3dx9.lib and have the legacy directx sdk installed and have your include lib paths set up correctly for using the legacy directx sdk

47805771
keras	tensorflow
the accepted answer is super helpful however it uses an outdated keras api as qululu mentioned and an outdated tf serving api exporter and it does not show how to export the model so that its input is the original tf placeholder versus keras model.input which is post preprocessing
following is a version that works well as of tf v1.4 and keras 2.1.2 update doing pre-processing for inference with tensorflow is a cpu op and is not carried out efficiently if the model is deployed on a gpu server

47808546
daemons	systemd
first check if rngd.service hardware rng entropy gatherer daemons is running on your systemd
if you are using virtual machine then it will not be running and to fix it use the following link second check if your systemd has enough entropy using command cat proc sys kernel random entropy_avail if entropy of your systemd has not enough entropy then increase it

47809241
google-chrome	firefox
.dev belongs to google and they enforce hsts now through preloading within google-chrome
probably firefox and other broswers will do this too soon if not already since they use the hsts preload list from google i encountered the same error this week after the last google-chrome update

47815327
tensorflow	tensorboard
i recreated the problem here by downloading firefox 38.5 from and running tensorflow 1.1
it seems tensorboard doesn t run smoothly on that particular version of firefox

47816233
google-chrome	firefox
unfortunately this only works on google-chrome currently but not on firefox
basically it seems that google-chrome only likes textlength when it is on a leaf child element

47817691
build.gradle	gradlew
the build task is actually provided by the java-base plugin and includes the following tasks compilejava processresources classes jar assemble compiletestjava processtestresources testclasses test and check instead of running gradlew build i recommend the use of defaultstasks defaulttasks build shadowjar putting that line in your build.gradle will allow gradlew to be invoked without arguments such that both build and shadowjar are both run
i am not familiar with the shadowjar plugin but if it exposes a task named shadowjar the use of a dependson line in build.gradle could simplify the defaulttasks line

47819680
google-chrome	firefox
see this answer to suppress google-chrome failed to load resource messages in console
only google-chrome displays an error when a resource i am fetching doesn t exist aka a 404 i m seeing this as an error in firefox google-chrome and safari

47819844
calloc	malloc
calloc allocates memory for an array of nmemb elements of size bytes each linux man page but we know that arrays in c cannot have padding between array elements they must be contiguous in memory
on the other hand malloc allocates size bytes so either of malloc 10 or calloc 2 5 will give you those ten bytes

47820092
ienumerable	iqueryable
because database.sqlquery already start to return records as ienumerable
it fetched by sql server already it s form is not iqueryable

47828334
comparator	comparable
why not use a specific map for your use case the following constructor is used here public treemap comparator comparator constructs a new empty tree map ordered according to the given comparator
all keys inserted into the map must be mutually comparable by the given comparator comparator.compare k1 k2 must not throw a classcastexception for any keys k1 and k2 in the map

47828967
swift	objective-c
so nsdata or nsmutabledata and even data in swift are all just data containers that make your developer life easier
and in objective-c conversion from data to c buffers is as easy as it gets the nsstring is not really that different

47831186
vsts	tfs
the alm rangers vsts bot comes closest to what you want unfortunately it s not yet available for tfs
i would recommend upgrading tfs and vs to the latest versions

47833150
pickle	dill
or you can define the required model implicitly rest endpoint testmodel initialises a testmodel . if you really want to store your model class definition in yaml you may serialise the class definition with pickle dill if you just want to store the current state you can serialise your machine instance directly this is way less transparent than the previous approach though. in any case you should avoid defining callbacks with function references since this might lead to problems later on
maybe pickle dill can handle this as well but i would not count on it

47835787
gif	png
according to the background pic must be a gif
png is not supported

47837031
apache	nginx
for apache to work you should also enable a few modules i put up a github repository with a basic docker configuration that showcases feel free to have a look at that to see the full working configuration
i was intrigued to make it work but i really could not find anything in the haproxy documentation so i googled a bit and found that nginx might do the trick but it didn t for me after a bit more of googleing i ended up finding a configuration for apache that works

47837031
apache	nginx
i was intrigued to make it work but i really could not find anything in the haproxy documentation so i googled a bit and found that nginx might do the trick but it didn t for me after a bit more of googleing i ended up finding a configuration for apache that works
here is the important part listen 80 sslproxyengine on proxypass example proxypassreverse example proxyremote proxypass google proxypassreverse google proxyremote i m quite sure there should be a way to translate this configuration to nginx and even to haproxy.

47839827
couchbase	couchdb
pouchdb is a good option if your want to write your application in javascript but if your preferred language is c# i ll recommend you to have a look to couchbase lite for .net
there is not a standard mechanism for synchronizing data between a relational database and couchdb pouchdb

47840795
centos	linux	ubuntu	linux
because linux from different distro say centos and ubuntu share the same linux kernel they could be on the same host
however linux kernel is not compatible to windows applications so this is not possible

47842394
ubuntu	debian
note on some versions of debian ubuntu you may receive the following error the virtual environment was not created successfully because ensure pip is not available
on debian ubuntu systems you need to install the python3-venv package using the following command. apt-get installpython3-venv you may need to use sudo with that command

47848960
vbscript	vba
note that things like click-to-run protection and antivirus policy not liking vbscript files can ruin this approach
i recently stumbled into this question and some things i encounter in answers here are just plain wrong you can t compact and repair an access database through vba while it s open

47849867
subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication
your intuition about looping is correct for addition and subtraction - it s like moving back and forth on a clock face around 12 o clock
however this doesn t apply to multiplication as this example demonstrates live demo

47853832
prepare	execute
execute block is an anonymous stored procedure and is not normally used to execute prepare statements this way
your use of execute block is particularly unsafe as you are opening yourself to sql injection because of your use of string formatting and because of execute block this form is more dangerous than executing normal statement

47860743
interpolation	splines
as mark mikofski wrote the objects returned scipy s interpolation routines cannot be added or multiplied by a scalar etc
their values can be combined after the splines are evaluated on the same grid

47862888
ssl	https
note do not mix gitlab ssl settings and gitlab ssh keys
if what you have configured in your gitlab profile is an ssh public key then your https url would not use it

47864095
decoder	encoder
having said that happens to be a valid json array and a json decoder can parse it back to an integer array here is a self-contained example how you can reliably encode and decoder an integer array to from a base64 encoded string
you should not rely on the description method to produce a particular predictable output better use a json encoder for that purpose example below

47864467
memcpy	strdup
you need copy it either using strdup or malloc - memcpy or malloc-strcpy
in case posix strdup is not available you can use what jonathan leffler mentioned

47867848
comparator	comparable
it should be clear that for min max and sorted adding a method to stream that does not require a comparator introduces a way to lose the generic type safety
the reason is that the current version of the java language does not support restricting methods to instances of a specific parameterization limit them to streams of comparable elements

47874429
keras	tensorflow
ps2 beware of the batch size usually it s the first dimension in keras tensors that you haven t created yourself
yes you can the layer ps output_shape is not necessary if you re using tensorflow

47876811
scipy	sympy
to find the integral numerically use n integral f x x 0 3 returns 1.24063... though of course for numeric integration one is more likely to use scipy
in sympy 1.1.1 your code works as expected integrate_f_from0 3 returns which means sympy could not find a symbolic expression for that integral so it returns it unevaluated although transformed in the process of searching for antiderivative

47877940
icmp	tcp
read this short answer - ping works via icmp echo requests
you cannot ping a port because ports are a concept in transport layer protocols like tcp

47880284
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome seems to always use value while firefox uses textcontent
since google-chrome doesn t look at the textcontent property range#selectnodecontents will select nothing on this browser.

47882479
vfork	posix
the vfork function was part of posix 2004 but is not part of posix 2008 which is the current edition aka posix 2016
what you can do with vfork is very very limited

47885631
rpm	yum
use yum with the download only plugin to only download all the needed dependencies you must have the yum-plugin-downloadonly package installed beforehand in a local directory like so copy the packages downloaded at step #2 to your affected machine and install them using the rpm utility as so
if the firewall is not the issue i would suggest a simpler approach just by going to rh s site and downloading the appropriate rhn-client-tools rpm package copying it to your server and installing it

47891403
ssl	https
the problem maven tries to pre-validate the package-list file but under some versions of java fails because it rejects the ssl certificate of javadoc.io a certificate that javadoc itself accepts. oh and it appears to be important to use a url specifically from static.javadoc.io not javadoc.io
also i would recommend https not http in case someday starts issuing redirects to as javadoc currently doesn t handle such redirects

47892326
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
navigation controller will push the default items if custom items left middle right has not been set of the uiviewcontroller
in your case what you can do is implement the uinavigationcontrollerdelegate within the uinavigationcontroller and implement this method navigationcontroller uinavigationcontroller willshow uiviewcontroller animated bool method

47893200
concave	convex
threecsg cannot subtract a concave mesh correctly
but there is a workaround since both halves of a heart or convex

47893348
super	extends
this is not super elegant but may be a possible solution
you can create an extra service class that extends your biesbroeckhttpservice then in your component use extraservice as the token but use biesbroeckhttpservice as the provider defintion

47894303
hive	hdfs
if you aren t doing anything special with spark then it s worth pointing out that kafka connect hdfs is capable of registering hive partitions directly from kafka
check hdfs for the dt partitions on the file system you need to run msck repair table on the hive table to see new partitions

47904845
google-chrome	firefox
these are the results edge and google-chrome exhibit the behavior you presented
your code in internet explorer 11 and firefox developer edition latest simply doesn t work

47920707
prepare	execute
you can use the following to make sure you get a result make also sure to use the prepare statements
your statement can t be execute failed so the object is not available

47921548
uicollectionview	uitableview
uicollectionview is a more recent addition 4-5 years old and provides a much more flexibility
yes uicollectionview duplicates much of the functionality of uitableview but not all

47923404
ssl	https
i have found out why the solution suggested by angel politis was not working for me and it has to do with ssl protected page. in essence i have visited the other link as suggested and copied the script but it did not work when i had upload it to my server which is not using the https protocol
howwever i have tried on a different server https and it works flawlessly

47926225
csv	tsv
consider for example an excellent tool for fixing csv that does not even consider padding truncating as an option
one approach is to use a csv2tsv tool to convert the csv file to a much more manageable tsv file and then fix it using awk

47928387
concave	convex
you need a concave fill algorithm which dear imgui doesn t provide
generally it tends to be easier faster to decompose your shapes into convex shapes

47928857
treemap	linkedhashmap
if however you prefer to have the map being sorted by keys use treemap instead
just use a linkedhashmap to store your values it will keep the insertion order the request to json will result in but if you use regular map the result will be this assumes you would like to keep the insertion order it s not clear from your question

47934624
inline	inlining
saying that there are jit optimization techniques that can optimise virtual method inlining for the common case but these come with a fallback for when the inline method doesn t match the desired method call at runtime which means certain code paths may benefit more from the inlining that others
i found a great read here regarding this my conclusion is instance methods can be inline but virtual methods can t because the actual method called can change at runtime and can not be established using static analysis of the source code

47942848
dictionary	map
so you can first write a function that map the hierarchy of a given code then here is a naive implementation to create the nested dictionary this is a naive implementation because it is highly redundant but you got the logic
you actually do not need to iterate through the whole code_order_dict but only on the highest level code values your leaves as they contains the information about the whole dictionary tree

47944093
lisp	scheme
just like hal abelson called scheme lisp in the sicp videos this book does the same however the language in the book is a predecessor to scheme and not common lisp
when you see define name lambda arg ... body ... this is the same as this in cl defun name arg ... body ... the reason is that in scheme it s the same namespace for operator as well as operand bindings

47944527
arraylist	treeset
when using a linkedlist the elements do not have to be shifted but here you can t binary-search as well finding the index where to insert is about o n 4 according to this overview and another o n 4 for actually inserting the element adding to o n 2 same as for arraylist
you could create a custom skip list providing faster lookup and simultaneous insertion but afaik java does not provide something like this . if the numbers are unique you could consider inserting them into a treeset and then calling toarray at the end

47947360
implements	extends
this will give you an iprincipal instance for the authenticated user which includes .isinrole string role note if your configured role provider doesn t automattically support using .isinrole you can implements your own db lookups using user.identity.name
assuming your controller extends system.web.mvc.controller then you can access the user property on the base class

47952616
sudo	passwd
you can also make it so that only certain commands can use sudo
you could make it so that your user account does not require a passwd to use sudo

47952616
sudo	passwd
you could make it so that your user account does not require a passwd to use sudo
do as root then add to the file i3 and any other program such as your shell should now be able to execute commands without requiring your passwd

47955960
decoder	encoder
the camel documentation for netty4 also states this at camel netty4 as follows if your encoders or decoders is not shareable eg they have the shareable class annotation then your encoder decoder must implement the org.apache.camel.component.netty.channelhandlerfactory interface and return a new instance in the newchannelhandler method
this is to ensure the encoder decoder can safely be used

47956127
serializable	deserialization
under the hood restsharp uses simplejson for json serializable
unlike json.net this serializer doesn t have built-in support for polymorphic property deserialization custom converters or surrogate replacement

47956906
google-chrome	safari
overscroll-behavior google-chrome 63 introduced the overscroll-behavior property that lets you disable scroll chaining or overscrolling altogether
however still not supported in safari final advice the most reliable method is setting a background color on html and another on body

47959495
postgresql	mysql
i would chose postgresql over mysql
it s also been suggested by django and you have some features which aren t available on mysql

47959841
istream	getline
and istream has a member function getline or two actually
when you call an unqualified getline inside the class member the compiler finds the inherited getline member and then doesn t look any further

47959862
spaces	delimiter
then care must be taken with the xargs wc -l invocation as it will not properly account for special chars in the printed file names spaces for example
to avoid that problem use the -z flag for git ls-files which will cause the file names to be separated by a 0 byte instead of a newline and then use the -0 argument to xargs so that it expects the file names as 0 byte delimiter then there s no guarantee that xargs can fit all of the file names onto one invocation of wc which means that it may have to call wc -l multiple times

47965301
interpolation	splines
positivity-preserving interpolation is hard if it wasn t there wouldn t be a bunch of papers written about it
the splines of low degree 2 3 usually do pretty well in this regard but your data has that large gap in it and it happens to be at the end of data range making things worse

47969606
scikit-learn	libsvm	scikit-learn	liblinear
not scikit-learn although i m unsure what exactly happens with 3rd-party software like liblinear libsvm and co
in use and brought by scikit-learn

47971095
build.gradle	gradlew
i guess the root cause for this problem is that a new versioning of the build tools were released but android studio did not trigger any notification to me which would have indicated that i should manually fix this since android studio does not seeem to have the ability to upgrade this build.gradle file internally which leaves the onus on the user to find the problem and fix it
after opening my project in android studio i opened the app versioning of the build.gradle file located in the gradlew scripts folder of the project

47972203
margin	text-align
you icons are display inline by default so aren t affected by margin
try putting the text-align center on the parent div.

47973690
implements	extends
.net core think of it as the continuation of the old .net framework just it s opensource and some stuff is not yet implements and others got deprecated
it extends the .net standard with extra functions but only runs on desktops

47975105
realloc	malloc
... p3 ... if ptr is a null pointer the realloc function behaves like the malloc function for the specified size
otherwise if ptr does not match a pointer earlier returned by a memory management function or if the space has been deallocated by a call to the free or realloc function the behavior is undefined

47976140
super	extends
if you don t explicitly call the parent s constructor using the super keyword it s assumed you re invoking its default constructor same as calling super with no arguments which would of course fail if the parent class does not have a default constructor
e.g. this is somewhat of a moot discussion in this case though since java.lang.long is final and you can t extends it anyway

47978291
ubuntu	linux
this image mimics an ubuntu os in the sense that it has a very similar filesystem structure to an ubuntu os and has many tools available that are typically found on ubuntu
the main and fundamental difference is that the docker ubuntu image does not have it own linux kernel

47983655
ubuntu	linux
i see dotnet publish -c release -o out used in dockerize a .net core application and the repo dotnet dotnet-docker-samples with images starting with from microsoft aspnetcore-build 2.0 as build-env it is a tag which is multi-arch meaning it will pull either windows or linux containers depending on the host here ubuntu but you mention in your previous question following the pluralsight.com course docker-images-containers-aspdotnet-core and that one might only work when done on windows meaning windows server 2016 2017 able to execute windows images
first if you are using ubuntu docker for windows is not relevant

47983951
sse	avx
there are three factors at play that solve the bigger problem a faulting behavior may be good for debugging performance but not as good for production code - especially when a mix of 3rd party libraries is involved - very few would take a crash over slightly slower performance of their software product at a customer site b intel microarchitecture solved the unaligned instruction forms on aligned data performance problem starting with nehalem they are same performance as aligned forms amd did it even before that i think c avx+ improved the architectural behavior of load+op forms over sse to non-faulting so since for avx+ we want the compiler to still have the liberty to use either standalone or load+op instruction forms when generating code from intrinsics for code such as this with avx+ a compiler can use the vmovus vmovups vmovupd vmovdqu for the all loads and maintain uniform behavior with load+op forms it is needed for when the source code changes slightly or the code generation of the same code changes between different compilers versions or due to inlining and code generation switches from a load+op instruction to standalone load and op instructions the behavior of a load is the same as with a load+op non-faulting
so avx with the above compiler practice and the use of unaligned store instruction forms overall allow a uniform non-faulting behavior for simd code without a performance loss on aligned data

47984738
google-chrome	firefox
the following solutions seem to work not using google-chrome eg ionic serve -w firefox instaling this specific version of ws npm install ws 3.3.2 --save-dev --save-exact updating ionic app-scripts to 3.1.6 worked for me
just saw a solution on github the problem seem to be caused by a google-chrome update

47984899
keras	tensorflow
the solutions found here are quite good but if your model has some different types of layers not supported by these libraries i would recommend doing the following converting the keras model to a tensorflow model
freeze the model and use tranform graph tool provided by tensorflow you ll have to build it from source with bazel compile the c++ api tensorflow library to use it in your project

47985041
prepare	execute
note this is not the optimal way and an open invite to sql injection you should use prepare statements and parameterized queries either use pdo or mysqli
don t know why are you trying to use var_dump to execute the sql statement that makes no sense and then a

47985505
prepare	execute
in a nutshell with prepare statements malicious code introduced via user input will not be execute
i read through the answers and still felt the need to stress the key point which illuminates the essence of prepare statements

47989499
lxml	elementtree
for instance if you are using lxml to process the xml documents then will produce the same dictionary as above
for transforming xml from to python dictionaries xmltodict has worked great for me xdict will now look like if your xml data is not in raw string bytes form but in some elementtree object you just need to print it out as a string and use xmldict.parse again

47989739
asp.net-mvc	html.actionlink
here should match div with id using asp.net-mvc check difference between html.actionlink vs url.action here
so finally in server side both generates url with trailing slash before hash # as shown below and thus above link doesn t match div with id because of before # solution using asp.net-mvc create custom urlhelper create a folder named helpers and add a class named urlextensions finally add below code in view note best solution would be using plain html as you did before instead of using server to return the hash link

47991842
implements	extends
you cannot extends other more than one class however you can implements many interfaces
if you are developing an interfacing you can make use of other interface and can extends many other interfaces

47992005
keras	tensorflow
so if you want full control of your tensors but still want to use keras layers you can easily achieve that by using keras as-is for more on that keras creator made a pretty cool post about it
this is a couple of months old but it s worth noting that there is absolutely no reason to not use keras with tensorflow

47992005
keras	tensorflow
this is a couple of months old but it s worth noting that there is absolutely no reason to not use keras with tensorflow
it s even part of the tensorflow library now

47998251
jar	war
your issue is that netbeans needs them to compile your application and since your project is a web application netbeans automatically puts the jar files into the war
you need to configure netbeans so that it doesn t package the jars into the war

47998251
jar	war
netbeans will then exclude the jar in the war file
payara micro doesn t need those jars in your war

47999406
factors	matrix
depending on whether year is numeric or a factors the term could blow up to 600 columns or nyears 300 columns it s not clear to me whether bam uses sparse matrix for terms
if not you ll be in big trouble 2 10 5 columns 10 6 rows order of magnitude a vector of 10 6 numeric values one column of your model matrix takes 7.6 mb so 500 gb 7.6 mb would be approximately 65 000 columns .

if you are using vsts then you can use nuget tool installer to install nuget version 4.3.0
for tfs on-premise just follow below workaround see using the latest nuget in your build for details. because the nuget tool installer is not available in tfs versions prior to tfs 2018 there is a recommended workaround to use versions of nuget 4.0.0 in team build

48006427
listview	gridview
i have had this issue a while back which was because virtualization not working since the listview i was using was allowed to stretch vertically off the page bounds forcing it to load all items 400+ at that time which caused the app to crash with a similar attach debugger dialog
so first thing i d try it to move your gridview outside of the scrollviewer so that virtualization can kick in

48008032
jar	manifest.mf
standard class loader will not load jar files from inside your jar see
with the given class-path entry in manifest.mf those jar files need to be placed to folder .. lib meaning lib folder in the parent folder of the directory where the executable jar is executed

48011606
realloc	malloc
if the buffer is not large enough to hold the line getline resizes it with realloc 3 updating line and len as necessary
ok so if it must point to a buffer allocated by malloc of size len

48016729
serializable	deserialization
this serializable is intended for xml deserialization but does not support xml attribute deserialization
deserialization of sequences such as as collections without an outer element

48017515
viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidload	viewwillappear
example viewwillappear viewdidlayoutsubviews viewdidappear dispatchqueue.main.async viewdidload code inside dispatchqueue.main.async from viewdidload even is called after viewdidappear
so using dispatchqueue.main.async in viewdidload gives you right frame but it isn t earliest as possible

48026686
interpolation	splines
one simple way to achieve equidistant sampling is to interpolation linearly between the returned samples as it has been discussed for instance in this post
the specification of the tangents is optional however bpoly.from_derivatives does not ensure smooth transitions between the splines at this position

48027407
daemons	systemd
this error may also indicate that the docker daemons is not run ning. then i run my docker quickstart terminal in administration mode and stop one image that was in virtual box running and finally now it is ok
i did this commands from prasad revanaki but is not ok yet when i send a docker ps a recieve error during connect get json open . pipe docker_engine the systemd cannot find the file specified

48030464
inline	inlining
for example to sort an array of numbers you ll use std array and std sort in genuine c++ and the compare operations in the sort are likely to get inline
with c code you ll just use qsort and each compare goes through an indirect function call because the compiler is not inlining qsort even if in theory it could...

48034264
build.gradle	gradlew
are you placing the above code in a separate file that you are then including in the main build.gradle via apply from .
if so you may be running up against a bug in gradlew where a plugin id cannot be used in external scripts

48036063
implements	extends
for instance usage of method from a t type instance which does not implements harvest will be allowed by the compiler leading to a runtime error
define an interface for all objects that use harvest then define that t extends that interface bad alternative mentioned just as a hacky addition to the answer because c# supports this - do not use it in practice if you want to skip -time checking you can use dynamic note this is a bad practice leading to method call resolving at runtime leading to performance drawbacks and making your code much more error prone

48036627
express	node.js
if you have an existing express app that you want to run on cloud functions you will at the very least have to write some code to hook up your express app so that cloud functions knows how to trigger it
it s not possible to deploy a plain node.js app without modification to cloud functions

48037999
jlist	jtable
for me this is where the concept of using a jlist for this kind of task starts to fall apart as a jlist is generally not meant to be editable
for me i d prefer a jtable based solution instead however.

48038823
spaces	delimiter
but i do not see a spaces delimiter output format
however this makes the output in tab delimiter format

48040720
google-chrome	safari
electron include google-chrome engine to render web pages as native apps with support for diffrenet plugins to add desktop apps features
electrino doesn t include any render engine it uses the safari engine on the mac so the installation file is smaller than electron. they didn t support windows yet

48041749
inline	constexpr
nota bene the inline specifier is redundant with constexpr only if the variable is a class static data member
following an exemple of easy violation of the one definition rule that could happen if is_integral_v where not inline

48043775
google-chrome	firefox
the keypress event worked for google-chrome however does not work for firefox
in google-chrome key presses like backspace and arrow key events are ignored by default and does not run the function however in firefox it runs and these do not work

48044153
viewdidload	viewwillappear
when you navigate between uitabbar tabs viewdidload is not triggered it is only triggered once the tab bar has been created
in order to make the table view reflect the changes you need to handle that in viewwillappear not in viewdidload

48044243
oncreate	findviewbyid	setcontentview	findviewbyid
add these code after setcontentview in oncreate and remove all initialization from top
you cannot call findviewbyid or any other method outside method block

48046917
realloc	malloc
from standard 7.22.3.5 if ptr is a null pointer the realloc function behaves like the malloc function for the specified size
otherwise if ptr does not match a pointer earlier returned by a memory management function or if the space has been deallocated by a call to the free or realloc function the behavior is undefined

48050657
selecteditem	selectedindex
when the user selects something the selectedindex is set directly invalidating it and changing it which causes the selecteditem to become invalid
however the selecteditem is not explicitly changed until it is recomputed

48052070
client-side	server-side
in the client-side if the user exists or not show the user the same message ex an email will be sent in case the username was correct
in the server-side if the user exists generate a new random guid that is attached to this user and has a certain time-span for example 1 hour

48055449
swift	objective-c
the following descriptions updated based on the settings which i believe correct. xcode 9.2 target swift version set to 3.2
changing the project swift version does not affect the target swift version oh my shame... when you want to work with old swift versions some swift-friendly wrapper types are not available and apis and constants are imported from objective-c world with simple rules

48055449
swift	objective-c
changing the project swift version does not affect the target swift version oh my shame... when you want to work with old swift versions some swift-friendly wrapper types are not available and apis and constants are imported from objective-c world with simple rules
in such cases you need to re-interpret objective-c versions of references with such rules in mind

48055474
google-chrome	firefox
first of all the issue is also reproducible for me in the latest google-chrome with chromedriver 2.34 - also currently latest - not yet sure what s happening at the moment
workaround firefox worked for me perfectly

48058039
ssl	https
browse to the jmeter launch directory and click on the file apachejmetertemporaryrootca.crt and open it click on the details tab and check that the certificate details agree with the ones displayed by the jmeter test script recorder if ok go back to the general tab and click on install certificate and follow the wizard prompts also given you use chrome you can consider an alternative way of recording a jmeter test there is jmeter chrome extension if you switch to it you won t have to worry about proxies and ssl certificates
not sure what do you mean by mmc console as per installing the jmeter ca certificate for https recording chapter of the jmeter documentation on the http s test script recorder installing the certificate in chrome or internet explorer both chrome and internet explorer use the same trust store for certificates

48062230
sum	coalesce
both are the same for this scenario coalesce sum urt.to_removeallpriv 0 as to_removeallpriv_sum or ifnull sum urt.to_removeallpriv 0 as to_removeallpriv_sum i m guessing that you want to do the same to all other columns in your query so i m not sure why you only complained about the to_removeallpriv column
the sum function automatically handles that for you

48065439
hex	binary
the disconnect here is that pydes.triple_des is looking for a binary key but what you are giving it is an encoded string with the hex representation of that key
since pydes doesn t expect the hex string try just giving it the raw digest instead m.digest instead of m.hexdigest

48066155
multiplying	multiplication
original answer to find the address of the max but not the associated category values below to find the row of the maximum entry you want to multiplying a boolean array where your values match the maximum so that is by the row numbers so row d183 d234
the result of that multiplication is a vector of 0 0 .. row of maximum val ... so you take the max of that to find the row number

48066771
keras	tensorflow
workaround here s a patched version that doesn t fail while saving you can use this multi_gpu_model function until the bug is fixed in keras
also when loading the model it s important to provide the tensorflow module object how it works the problem is with import tensorflow line in the middle of multi_gpu_model def multi_gpu_model model gpus ... import tensorflow as tf ... this creates a closure for the get_slice lambda function which includes the number of gpus that s ok and tensorflow module not ok

48068827
libstdc++	libc++
by default mac uses libc++ but you can select libstdc++ if you prefer
keep in mind that although clang tries to be as abi-compatible with gcc as possible it s probably not wise to mix libraries compiled by libc++ libstdc++

48072931
sudo	passwd
now you can delete cassandra via apt-get remove cassandra if you do not have the passwd for root you need to find a way to get access to sudo and change your question accordingly
from the error you get it appears that your user is not a sudo er

48074805
client-side	server-side
data is fetched client-side by calling services setup in the spring boot backend as shown in the tutorial
in the given example react is not rendered server-side

48078305
prepare	execute
and even if it didn t do that it all takes place within the same operation in the database sql engine so executing this subselect 10 times is way way faster than executing that subselect as a separate select 10 times because the sql engine only has to parse and prepare it once and doesn t suffer from roundtrip times
a simple select like that could easily take 30 milliseconds or so when execute from php so quick math would suggest that it d take 300ms extra to have this subselect in a 10-row query but that s not the case because the lion s share of those 30ms is overhead of communication between php and the database

48079545
client-side	server-side
assuming you keep this code in your game client and the sql server is not client-side but in a server of yours located somewhere a simple client reverse engineer will be able to grab your credentials from your connection string and use them to gain unauthorized access to your database
never trust the client with that being said i would suggest you use a simple server-side technology php socket app java servlet etc.. along with the sql that the client will send the information there and then to the database

48079699
ienumerable	ilist
another difference in case of ef is that the ienumerable is not executing the query to the db untill you really enumerate the list
while the ilist will execute the query and fetch the items in memory

48080838
inline	constexpr
the advantage of an inline object is that there will only be one in total
however if you only use the constexpr values as constants you will not notice much of a difference

48081584
calloc	malloc
so malloc versus calloc doesn t matter in terms of correctness
so if you re going to go that route use malloc -- it s faster

48082647
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it was recently added to firefox 57 and google-chrome 55 but is not present in edge or safari
also note that google-chrome does not currently show prompts for this permission request

spaces	linefeed
btw spaces is not matched by

48097638
bash	subshell
... creates a subshell in bash
as per bash manual list list is executed in a subshell environment see command execution environment below my guess is you are seeing the pid of that subshell as the foreground process not the pid of your test command

48097638
bash	subshell
as per bash manual list list is executed in a subshell environment see command execution environment below my guess is you are seeing the pid of that subshell as the foreground process not the pid of your test command
and the subshell exits quite quickly right after firing your command in background

48099447
exponent	addition
it only changes the exponent not the significand
in particular adding 1.0 3.0 to itself is exact so the result of the first addition is 0.66666666666666662965923251249478198587894439697265625 the second addition does involve rounding

48099512
oncreate	findviewbyid	setcontentview	findviewbyid
not in constructor field initialization but rather oncreate after you ve also called setcontentview
move your findviewbyid calls later in the activity lifecycle

48102525
erlang	elixir
there is a way to reassign a named variable in erlang but it is not the custom.
elixir vs ruby might not be the best contrast for this

48106814
vsts	tfs
that means you can export and import xml for tfs but only can export xml for vsts
no you can not edit vsts xml file

48107418
erlang	elixir
in erlang for instance one can not rebound a variable
consider the following example in elixir the above is perfectly valid elixir code

48110717
dictionary	map
decode.dict is also a function that takes a value of type decoder a that returns a decoder of decoder dictionary string a
this tells us two things we need to pass a decoder value to decode.dict before we pass it to decoder.list a dictionary may not fit your use case as dicts can only map between two fixed types and do not support nest values like elm doesn t provide a universal decoder

48114471
queue	fifo
viewing messages in the aws console might seem to be an exception but it isn t -- the console acts as a consumer receives messages and then resets their visibility timeout so they return to the queue for subsequent redelivery.
once a message has been sent to an sqs queue standard or fifo the message is immutable

48118479
vsts	tfs
your developers can also push pull between onprem and vsts quite easily from their local development machine
this functionality isn t available on tfvc team foundation version control but vsts and recent versions of tfs can now import your main branch with history into git in a quick one-time process

swift	objective-c
xcode version 9.2 9c40b + swift 4 i know this question is a little old however i was having the same crashing issues with audioengine.start even though in a do try catch and also receiving the following from crashalytics fatal exception com.apple.coreaudio.avfaudio error 561015905 s1lent warrior s sleep 1 hack worked in some cases but not all specifically with avaudioengineconfigurationchangenotification selector
finally i used objective-c exception handling to really catch the error so no crash occurs from this very useful post by freytag big thanks

48123912
swift	objective-c
seems ridiculous that in swift you can t properly catch an exception and ok if you re going to make some exceptions not catchable then at least provide a method to test first something like audioengine.areyouconfiguredproperly
oh hang on there is this method in objective-c but someone decided to wrap it with the startengine function and do away with all useful functionality.

48126056
lxml	beautifulsoup	lxml	html5lib
unlike lxml it doesn t even bother to add an tag
you need to use the html5lib as the parser instead of html.parser in your beautifulsoup object

48129885
super	self
it should be super sendotp self not super baseresource self
also if this is python 3 you can simplify it to just super

48134184
ssl	https
when https transports this http data over ssl tls fiddler does not display the ssl tls-specific data which in addition to server and optional client certificates currently includes version suite possibly compression curve format and next-protocol negotiation nonces ephemeral keys renegotiation control signature algorithm control server name indication ticket and other crypto options like encrypt-then-mac and extended-master-secret
the raw tab displays all the http data without interpretation but not the ssl tls data

48134335
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
update based on the updated question apparently the generated otf font is not encoded properly for the web all browsers have different font rendering engines and the decoding of this file fails in google-chrome and firefox and even font squirrel reports the font is corrupt and cannot be converted
funnily enough works just fine in safari

48136683
noexcept	throw
although is labelled noexcept because it has a twin that does throw a exception you are not really giving the caller a logical exception guarantee
it seems you simultaneously want f to always succeed while throw an exception if the precondition is not met status has a valid value i.e not nullptr

48136963
build.gradle	gradlew
here is the solution build.gradle you need to add this filters abifilters to your app module s build.gradle files
so when your device try to run your app it will check gradlew file and understands that it should not generate any folder and use existing native library resources

48137957
g++	gcc
for c++ mode you should use the g++ command
for compiling it s not an issue because gcc detects the .cpp extension and switches to c++ mode but for linking you really need to tell gcc to link in c++ mode otherwise it won t link with the c++ runtime library

48137965
multiplying	multiplication
well i m not sure what you need help with but to multiplying a number you need the operator here is a tutorial on the subject of arithmatic
multiplication of this function would look like this if you don t know how to call the function you do it like this myfunction 10 2

48139085
factors	mean
i turned example_df country into a factors and sorted it by the mean value over time
it s not super clear what you mean by highest so i assumed you meant highest mean value over all the time points

48140111
swift	objective-c
you need objective-c because otherwise the swift compiler will not create a selector for the method
a selector is an objective-c value that identifies a method and it is necessary to call a method through objective-c

48140239
dictionary	map
default dictionary in case the operation does not map on a #x2115
n but still on a finite number of hashable items we can use a dictionary

48142437
swift	objective-c
so you want this here s an answer that i spent way too long on and that you probably won t even like because your question is tagged objective-c but i wrote this answer in swift
you can use swift code from objective-c but not everyone wants to

48143339
sse	avx
writing to xmm0 with a vex-coded instruction not legacy sse zeros the upper lane of ymm0 just like writing to eax zeros the upper half of rax to avoid false dependencies
lack of zeroing the upper bytes for legacy sse instructions is why there s a penalty for mixing avx and legacy sse instructions

48144027
build.gradle	gradlew
for instance if your app s build.gradle contain different versions of the same dependency e.g one dependency uses play-services 11.6.0 and another play-services 11.6.1 gradlew may not know how to merge them
another example could be you have com.android.support appcompat-v7 26.1.0 but your design library may be using an older version e.g com.android.support design 25.0.0 in some cases if you are using an emulator device that contains an older version of your app and you change your dependencies on your app s build.gradle that create the conflict mentioned in step 1

48151621
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
the issue you are facing is caused by the intl api because datepipe for angular 2 release is working fine only for firefox and google-chrome with custom format strings
it doesn t work on safari due to lack of intl

48154827
swift	objective-c
enjoy .h file .m file bridging header in the your_project_name -bridging-header.h or whatever its called in the objective-c bridging header property in build settings of your project swift_objc_bridging_header #import yourbaseview.h swift demo
old question but this may be of use to those not overly familiar with objective-c

48155102
ssl	https
for mobile the only workaround that worked for me is not to use ssl at all ws
i m not sure whether safari will accept mixed https + ws pages but it s worth a try if you want to keep ssl for the http part

48156816
config	ini
update good reminder from attila-szeremi make sure start listening for php debug connections is enabled which you manually need to do if you don t run a phpstorm config with debug
debugging using php artisan serve does not work unless you have enabled debugging in ini file

48158812
persistent	transient
during an outage your orderplaced message wouldn t be able to get into the queue in the first place and your shipping logic wouldn t be able to receive orders that are already persistent in your queue
note that service bus queue outages are transient and the queue recovers and returns to normal service

48159524
portrait	landscape
given that there s no way you can draw the image like this unless you either rotate the image in which case up isn t up or you stretch the image horizontally which looks pretty bad or you crop a slice of the image which reduces the fov a lot because the image sensor is landscape when the phone is landscape there s no way to place a landscape preview in a portrait ui without one of those three things happening
you either need a portrait preview in a portrait ui or you need to crop the image down

48159659
google-chrome	safari
i put together a few jsperf tests based on the 4 main patterns from the online book exploring es6 the tests can be found here in google-chrome 63.0.3239 mac os x 10.11.6 the best performing patterns were private data via constructor environments and private data via a naming convention
for me safari performed well for weakmap but google-chrome not so well

48164110
mdpi	hdpi
looking at the official android documentation from google about supporting multiple screens you will find the following table ldpi low 120dpi mdpi medium 160dpi hdpi high 240dpi xhdpi extra-high 320dpi xxhdpi extra-extra-high 480dpi xxxhdpi extra-extra-extra-high 640dpi table 3 also explains your situation very well
in any case when running on a tablet with a 10 screen and resolution of 800x1280 pixels the app will not attempt to get resources from any xhdpi xxhdpi folder but rather the mdpi folder because the screens dpi matches that

48166135
client-side	server-side
the opentok-text-chat library is a client-side library it can help you add text chat functionality to your opentok application
it is not a server-side node library therefore it causes this error when it tries to access the window object which doesn t exist in node

48169560
swift	objective-c
#import mytarget-swift.h you might need import into .h if adopting swift protocols in oc but that can introduce circular dependancies with the bridging header so show caution
if the appdelegate class still isn t showing up you might need to add objective-c to the class declaration or examine if your class is using any swift features that would prevent the export from happening

48172100
lisp	scheme
also it doesn t have quite as simple syntax as lisp do so writing compile-time macros is always a bit more cumbersome
haskell s lazy evaluation and the abstraction capabilities of its strong type system however mean that you simply don t need macros in lots of situations where scheme programmers would employ them

48172156
hive	hdfs
remember that hive is simply a lens for reading and writing hdfs files and not an execution engine in and of itself
it will connect to a hive metastore or instantiate one if none is found when you initialize a hivecontext object or a spark-shell

48172549
pascal	delphi
btw i don t know whether linux is of any interest to you but the linux version of lazarus fpc also comes with the pascal script commponents
the default install of lazarus comes with a set of components under the general title pascal script which can be used to implement a scripting engine and debugger - see and the scripting engine can compile to byte code and execute scripts written in a dialect of object pascal which is close to but not identical with the object pascal which delphi implements

48172549
pascal	delphi
the default install of lazarus comes with a set of components under the general title pascal script which can be used to implement a scripting engine and debugger - see and the scripting engine can compile to byte code and execute scripts written in a dialect of object pascal which is close to but not identical with the object pascal which delphi implements
the package comes with code wrapper around a number of the supplied lazarus fpc units which implement components which are intended to be equivalent to a number of delphi s components

48172918
inline	inlining
this is an alternative to putting inline in the header file which requires you to have an extern inline for that function somewhere in your program
however if the compiler decides that it would rather not inline your static inline function either because it think s that inlining is worse or because inlining is impossible then it will have to make a separate copy of that function in each file it s used in

48174721
ssl	https
it appears these assets are linked using https but there is not a valid ssl on the site
so on the devices where it works you have either authorized the ssl or bypassed it but the other devices have not

48176853
clang	llvm
as far as i know this just takes gcc -style options and forwards them to clang
while gcc and the llvm clang project are two different things the gcc command is not necessarily attached the gcc compiler

48177498
google-chrome	firefox
update firefox looks at this.value and says ok i ll just take the whole value of whatever is in the input and overwrite the whole value . google-chrome somehow intuitively interprets keydown the way you intended but firefox literally follows your code truthfully
unfortunately that s not what you want so you ll need to take a different approach with firefox

48180561
ecdsa	rsa
for ecdsa java crypto uses the asn.1 der encoding standardized by x9.62 sec1 and rfc 3279 sec 2.2.3 which varies slightly in length
this is covered in more detail on another stack and and this is also true for dsa but not rsa where signatures and cryptograms since rsa supports both signature and encryption are fixed length for a given key as defined by i2os and os2i in pkcs1

48183490
keras	tensorflow
but after those errors i tried to install keras using anaconda environment which was really helpful for me- i am not a coder just started to learn so i am not familiar with all this cmd things
anyway for those who are not familiar with anything just like me here how i installed keras 1-download install anaconda 2-download install tensorflow so basically after that point search for press windows button then type anaconda navigator

48183580
realloc	malloc
you only free what you have allocated using malloc directly or indirectly or related function like realloc
attempting to pass a pointer not returned by malloc will lead to undefined behavior

48184816
viewdidload	viewwillappear
instead of updating in viewdidload you will have to update the selection in func viewwillappear _ animated bool for the values to be updated each time
viewdidload is executed only the first time the view is loaded not every time it is visited

48189574
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox
your code works fine in firefox but clipboarddata is not being set correctly in webkit browsers like google-chrome and safari
i have created this fiddle with your code which can be tested in firefox to verify that it is working there

48194891
tostring	string.format
you re getting the string value mycomment because that s what is returned by commenttype.mycomment.tostring methods like string.format and console.writeline will automatically call tostring on anything that isn t already a string
the string interpolation syntax is just syntactic sugar for string.format which is why string interpolation also behaves this way

48200025
aggregate-functions	sum
if for some reason you are getting duplicate student ids and students are being counted twice then you can change the aggregate-functions to this count distinct s.student_id as student_count ...which is safe to do as count distinct ... ignores null values
you need to left join and then sum over the group where s.student_sid is not null this is assuming that all of the fields in the student table that you are filtering on are optional

48210201
postgresql	mysql
available extensions are listed be the below and are specific to postgresql version
no version currently has mysql_fdw per the below you cannot add your own extensions to rds might be specifically because you need mysql s c client library

48212317
google-chrome	firefox
not being a javascript programmer i find it easier to do the waiting in ruby watir instead the above will only fix the problem when using google-chrome
firefox seems to have other limitation and or restrictions that prevent the original code from working

48217484
exponent	addition
while the increase of the exponent by 1 in itself doesn t seem much in this example it already costs an additional bit for the exponent
in addition the decompression-step for the above example will produce an integer-overflow which may be problematic under certain circumstances c# will throw an exception if the decompression is done in checked -mode

48219517
postgresql	mysql
it s value is your cloud sql instance connection name so in your case it should look like this cloudsql my-project-12345 us-central1 mydatabase it s a similar process if you re using postgresql on gcloud which is answered here
in your connection configuration for mysql host does not work on app engine

48224374
spaces	delimiter
in your case indenting introduced tabs or possibly spaces before heredoc delim end_script so that it couldn t be considered as a delimiter anymore
so the sftp command went on looking for a delimiter which it never found

48224709
jar	war
an executable jar will not work because of a hard coded file pattern in tomcat
with jetty it should work if you use war packaging an executable war will work and will also be deployable to any standard container

48226349
zsh	tcsh
an earlier version of this answer assumed you were using as your prompt in zsh
is sometimes used as a prompt but more often in c-shells like tcsh not bourne-derived shells like bash and zsh. you d get exactly the same thing from echo -n hello world

scipy	sympy
there is fsolve in scipy a numeric solver
scipy cannot work with sympy objects in particular it convert convert them to floats

48233598
hex	binary
when inserting data into a blob field you can use just the hex representation like insert into table myblobfield values 0x123456789...etc...
you can use bin2hex to convert the filedata data to hex first just bear in mind that it s usually not a good idea to store binary data in blob fields

48234275
mongodb	bson
the bson timestamp type is mainly intended for internal use by the mongodb replication system and is documented for completeness
a general caveat on bson types for internal use is that they are not expected to be extensively supported by drivers or server features

48234931
hex	binary
you can use readhex from module numeric to convert a hex digit to an integer and printf from the text.printf module to generate a binary string like so giving
there isn t a single library function to convert a hex digit to a binary string

48236432
unicode	ucs
ucs-2 is an obsolete encoding of iso 10646 a standard that these days is pretty much unicode but without some of its rules about how characters should be treated and unicode version 1 in 2 octets 8-bit bytes per character
prior to 1996 that allowed it to encode all of the universal character set hence ucs but it doesn t work for all of unicode version 2 or later we re currently on version 10

implements	extends
firstly you have to create a service that will start up at boot and will always be running. in order for this to happen you have to create a broadcastreceiver register it to receive action_boot_completed and the receive_boot_completed permission to your manifest in your manifest secondly the service has to implements the android.os.fileobserver class
as android.os.fileobserver only observes the path you send to it and does not observe the path s subdirectories you have to extends it and add singlefileobserver observers to it

48241090
implements	extends
if you are working with php below 7.1 exception won t work because it does not implements the throwable class
the only way for your exception to work is if you extends the exception class.what i also do is to put a slash before the exception

48245064
prepare	execute
example that s because pdo doesn t have execute method but pdostatement object resolved from prepare method does
you have to assign to a variable and then call execute method on it

48251338
namedtuple	dictionary
use an ordered type like a namedtuple or ordereddict
python dictionary are not ordered so sorting them is meaningless

48253540
interpolation	splines
a better approach i think is to interpolation the prediction formula for fractional ranks
one solution you could try is a splines that is forced to go through the expected points this approach always works but i m not a big fan of splines for data visualization since they make up data we don t have

48254340
swift	objective-c
if there is a naming difference between the objective c selector and the swift function name you ll also have to specify the objective c selector name in parantheses like objective-c numberofsectionsintableview for non-generic subclasses this already has been fixed in swift 4 but obviously not for generic subclasses
reproduce you can reproduce it quite easy in a playground now when we use it without generics everything works find when using a generic subclass the basemethod call crashes interestingly the doit selector could not be found in the genericsubclass although we just called it before 2018-01-14 22 23 16.234745+0100 generictableviewcontrollersubclass 13234 3471799 - ttgc34generictableviewcontrollersubclass15genericsubclasssi doit unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x60800001a8d0 2018-01-14 22 23 16.243702+0100 generictableviewcontrollersubclass 13234 3471799 terminating app due to uncaught exception nsinvalidargumentexception reason - ttgc34generictableviewcontrollersubclass15genericsubclasssi doit unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x60800001a8d0 error message taken from a real project so somehow the selector objective c method name cannot be found. workaround add objective-c to the subclass as before

pascal	delphi
i still compile in pascal so i recognized these.
k is not from the turbo pascal days nor free pascal nor delphi 7 or older

48257803
swift	objective-c
concretely appkit was probably not ported to the server side swift so you could not be able to use appkit with spm
appkit is part of the objective-c runtime

48260022
equals	compareto
in all cases this implementation uses comparable.compareto t or comparator.compare t t instead of equals java.lang.object or hashcode - xaerxess to determine equivalence of instances
hashcode isn t called but compareto is no npe is thrown there

48263854
union	distinct
keeping it all inside linq territory without additional materializing things looks better at a first glance but still not solves your problem that a union will need to get all results in one place to perform it s function
this is currently done with a set that sooner or later contains all distinct elements from both sequences

48265897
spaces	delimiter
but you can explode on the regex and implode them with a spaces
explaining the regex # are delimiter makes a group all within the group are not matched inverter a-z do not match characters a to z 0-9 match character 0 to 9 other characters are escaped

48266071
onkeyup	onkeydown
you need to change onkeypress to onkeyup the onkeypress event is not fired for all keys alt ctrl shift esc backspac ... in all browsers
to detect only whether the user has pressed a key use onkeydown or keyip instead because it works for all keys

48266469
realloc	malloc
realloc will either reuse the same memory block if it is big enough or it will malloc a new block copy the old block and free the old block
so do not ever attempt to realloc a block you have already freed

48269434
inline	inlining
modern compilers make relatively smart inlining decisions so it s usually best to let the compiler do it s thing and declare functions as inline and moving their implementations to header files in the appliation hot spots based on profiling results
that error is typical to inline functions declared in source files rather than in header files in which case the compiler is not able to inline them as the code of the function to be inlined must be visible to the compiler in the same source file being compiled

48269434
inline	inlining
in some cases the fix may be to remove the inline keyword in places where it is not needed
when functions are declared in header files the compiler considers them for inlining automatically given they are small enough and the compiler thinks that inlining them will improve performance based on its heuristics - even when the inline keyword is not used

48269434
inline	inlining
when functions are declared in header files the compiler considers them for inlining automatically given they are small enough and the compiler thinks that inlining them will improve performance based on its heuristics - even when the inline keyword is not used
inline is sort of a recommendation to the compiler and it doesn t have to obey unless it is given along with the always_inline attribute

48272184
octal	decimal
otherwise the times are not the same buy may differ by 1 second ...xx 999 to ...xx+1 000 so we need to deal with batch mathematics - which includes the cute idea that a number that begins with 0 is octal hence may not contain 8 or 9
the normal way to do this is to string 1 before the string which makes it decimal hence the odd adjustments that are required

48274819
build.gradle	gradlew
there s an invalid settings.gradle file which only tries to import application module which yet is not valid gradlew module as long as it does not have its own build.gradle file
inside root folder settings.gradle file put following line include kotlinapp now instead of importing build.gradle import kotlinapp folder file - open.

48277048
build.gradle	gradlew
read google s maven repository include google s maven repository in your top-level build.gradle file fyi so according to your version your build.gradle will
could not resolve com.android.tools.build gradlew 3.0.1

48277648
ienumerable	iqueryable
once it really has lost the iqueryable and has become an implementation of an ienumerable the data has been brought to local memory and all further linq statements will be performed by your process not by the database
if you use your debugger you will see that the return value of your fn_getdata returns an ienumerable

48279248
apache	nginx
and if you can configure apache to redirect request to your application you can replace nginx with apache. but i have not worked with apache so as per me above configurations works.but if you want some help you can read this one link
you can deploy nginx on same machine.so your setup will be nginx listening to 80 port of the machine for incoming requests and redirecting all requests to you application as per you have specified in nginx configuration. if you are deploying nginx on same machine and having application 8080

48280318
haskell	ocaml
doing code-printing to replace isabelle s sqrt with haskell s sqrt is only going to give you a type error since haskell s sqrt works on floating point numbers and not on isabelle s exported real type
there is a file in src hol library code_real_approx_by_float that maps isabelle s operations on real numbers to floating point approximations in standard ml and ocaml but this is for experimentation only since you lose all correctness guarantees if you do that sort of thing

48280484
persistent	transient
first we must define all entity states new transient a newly created object that hasn t ever been associated with a hibernate session a.k.a persistent context and is not mapped to any database table row is considered to be in the new transient state
to become persisted we need to either explicitly call the entitymanager#persist method or make use of the transitive persistent mechanism

48280907
equals	compareto
your compareto method always returns 1 which means no employees object is equals to any other employees object not even to itself as far as compareto is concerned
only when compareto returns 0 the two compared instances are considered identical by treemap

48286270
union	distinct
it can perform both whole-hierarchy and concrete-entity operations with single queries without joins or union
the single-table and joined inheritance strategies ensure that all entities in the hierarchy have distinct keys which is not necessarily the case for the table-per-class strategy

48286955
vbscript	vba
vbscript doesn t know what range means
if this was vba then it would refer directly to the activesheet of the application object

48289312
google-chrome	firefox
another workaround is to switch to google-chrome
the problem is apparently that facebook s php-webdriver isn t compatible with current firefox

48290227
keystore	jks
for jks it is the date the keystore entry was created or modified but pkcs12 doesn t store that info so keytool actually jce iinm just uses now
note in recent updates of java 8 keystore.getinstance jks actually reads both jks and pkcs12

48291778
swift	objective-c
the long story the current version of swift does not have abi stability so a compiled swift application is not guaranteed to and almost definitely wont interface with a framework compiled with a newer version the reason the platform frameworks are still objective-c
so how this category of changes affect swift is a work in progress

48294202
vmware	virtualbox
every localhost having some ip address so if you use docker in windows by docker toolbox at the don t check with localhost 8080 in your browser why because that is not the actual host.your localhost running in vmware so you can check your ip address by using this command docker-machine ip default for example i got 192.168.99.100 - using this ip to run the jenkins like 192.168.99.100 8080
virtualbox and host the actual os which has installed a vm if you are using docker for windows it would use the hyperv vm windows 10 only and would work

48295204
viewdidload	viewwillappear
observe that dashboardvc in viewdidload you set delegate to self that means it is pointing to dashboardvc after that you present dashboarddetailvc you set delegate to self that means it is pointing to dashboarddetailvc and after that your all delegate call will go to dashboarddetailvc not to dashboardvc even though you dismiss vc to fix this you have options
1 don t use shared instance 2 set delegate in viewwillappear instead

48298686
swift	objective-c
then in objective-c you can get its property viewcontrollers which is an nsarray but in swift you can just assign this property to a regular array i m explicitly giving it a type but that s not actually needed with type inference conversely you can just pass a swift array of uiviewcontrollers to the setviewcontrollers method which in objective-c is expecting an nsarray
you don t need to use nsmutablearray when writing swift code

48298686
swift	objective-c
and vice-versa if you get an nsmutablearray as a result of calling such an api you can assign it to a swift array as long as it s a var
as an example of how bridging works let s suppose uikit s uitabviewcontroller is still natively an objective-c api i don t know if it s the case or not

48302638
innodb	myisam
fulltext indexing innodb doesn t support fulltext indexing in its previous versions - myisam does support it
switching to myisam wont be the best solution so just update mysql to a verion which does support fulltext indexing

48303748
super	implements
here is a pseudo-code obviously you ll want to be super careful about only allowing a restricted set of classes and configurations here whitelist the allowed setup do not let your users provide arbitrary input
you would also implements a predefined set of sources transforms destinations that you want to offer to your users

48309221
memcpy	memmove
memcpy is the wrong function for this task man memcpy man memmove the memcpy function copies n bytes from memory area src to memory area dest . the memory areas must not overlap
use memmove 3 if the memory areas do overlap

48309965
associativity	operator-precedence
it must have something to do with associativity of ternary operator right-to-left see link
arrow functions are parsed differently than regular ones see parsing order although the arrow in an arrow function is not an operator arrow functions have special parsing rules that interact differently with operator-precedence compared to regular functions

48311060
addition	modulo
for your specific question in addition to vectorization it looks like that binarylogic.asbinary is not computationally efficient
for your simple case of bits 5 and 6 being zero in an 8 bit integer just do it with integer math the modulo clear out bits 7 and 8 and from there all values with bits 5 and 6 equal to zero will be less than 16

48311412
single-quotes	double-quotes
but the major thing is that you re using single-quotes around the variable which blocks variable expansion
it looks like you re trying to escape the double-quotes not sure if that s possible but if it is that s not the right way to do it

48320291
viewdidload	viewdidappear
when viewdidload gets called the view controller it s not added on the view hierarchy yet it s not visible and it cannot present another view controller
as sh_khan said move the lines in viewdidappear method

48321170
shadowing	named

opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
at the moment of writing only google-chrome opera tandem same engine supports lookbehind
as for when will be this soon - i don t know much about safari and ios browser release roadmaps but in case of firefox the current highest numbered verison which is firefox 60 nightly does not support that feature

48323787
sqoop	hadoop
we faced the same issue on our end - sqoop export to a table in sql server reached 100 and then it just hung until timeout period of 10 mins was reached after which the job was failed
in our investigation we found that the reason for this was in fact composite primary key violation on sql server side for which we did not have any visibility on our hadoop cluster end

48324651
hex	binary
this comes out to 2 4 8 and 16 hex digits
as each octal digit is 3 bits and 3 doesn t divide any power of 2 this doesn t work out as neatly for common binary bit clumps we manipulate

48326224
ssl	https
curl 35 error 140770fc ssl routines ssl23_get_server_hello unknown protocol
although it is not the case of the op the error unknown protocol in curl appears when you accidentally trying to call http server using https usually during local development

48329374
octal	hex
integer literals which states it is a compile-time error if a hexadecimal octal or binary int literal does not fit in 32 bits
since 0b1000_0000_0000_0000_0000_0000_0000_0000 and 0b1111_1111_1111_1111_1111_1111_1111_1111 as well as their hex counterparts 0x80_00_00_00 and 0xff_ff_ff_ff all fit in 32 bits they are valid int literals

48331240
client-side	server-side
client-side models when a client-side model such as jsonmodel is used a simple expression binding is sufficient example as you can see in the above example when the number of items is changed the framework notifies the expression binding which eventually updates the property value automatically thanks to the oneway binding
server-side models odata in this case it s not as simple as the above approach since expression binding doesn t apply here see the reasoning below

48332565
super	self
when you then call __init__ on the unbound super - because it isn t bound this __init__ call isn t proxied - the type argument is none and the compiler attempts to infer
inside the class definition the self argument is present and is used for this purpose

48332903
tensorflow	cudnn
so i do pip uninstall tensorflow-gpu i install whithout support pip install tensorflow
check the nvidia requirements to run tensorflow with gpu support link cuda toolkit 8.0 the nvidia drivers associated with cuda toolkit 8.0 cudnn v6.0 gpu card with cuda compute capability 3.0 or higher the libcupti-dev library which is the nvidia cuda profile tools interface i installed the cuda v5.1 and the message below still remains importerror libcudart.so.8.0 cannot open shared object file no such file or directory i so i got pissed off because everything looks fine so i decide to check my gpu with the command on linux glxinfo | grep geforce and i noticed that my nvidia gpu is not supported in this link you can find a list like that so my solution was use tensor flow without gpu support

48335219
build.gradle	gradlew
i encountered the same problem and found the real reason for my case. previously i also tried all the previous answers again but it did not solve the problem. i have two module in my wear app project and the build.gradle as follows wear module s build.gradle implementation project common implementation files libs farmer-motion-1.0.jar common module s build.gradle implementation files libs farmer-motion-1.0.jar before upgrade to gradlew 3.x implementation are all compile
i run gradlew with --stacktrace option to get the stack trace you can just click this on gradlew console window when this problem arises

48337945
rsa	dsa
you could extract the algorithm oid from signed message but this is generally not the right way to solve your issue because you have to deal with all the possibilities and the code will be too complex padding algorithm pss pkcs#1 etc key algorithm rsa ec dsa hashing algorithm sha1 sha256 etc
in the usual signature formats xmldsig cms pades jws the signature algorithm is included in the signature container as an attribute see this xmldsig example using dsa with sha1 so i suggest to include the signature algorithm in the message sent by calling system

try implements the base interface instead
also wont work since void does not extends serializable and also because void is not a managed type it is not an entity

swift	objective-c
learn more about the limited objective-c inference in swift 4 here
you should add an objective-c inference to the function otherwise your function will not be expressable in objective-c which is what nsselectorfromstring uses

48342131
rsa	3des
the otherprimeinfos is only for so-called multiprime rsa which means more than 2 factors of n and which almost noone actually uses. derive the actual encryption key from the password using one
iteration of md5 applied to password||salt where salt is a copy of the random iv 8-bytes for 3des plus since that is not enough md5 firstblock||password||salt then truncate the total to 24 bytes

48346523
move	drag
from within mousedown with a tracking loop or mousedragged once the user s drag has move a certain distance from its original location 3 or 4 points is all then you should start a dragging session nsview begindraggingsession the session should contain one nsdraggingitem where you pass in the url for the folder as an nsurl not a swift url because only the former conforms to nspasteboardwriter
sadly the drag and drop guide apple has is based entirely on the old deprecated api the rough outline for what you re asking using the modern api is you need something ex your view to implement the nsdraggingsource protocol to return that it supports the copy operation only draggingsession _ sourceoperationmaskfor

implements	extends
basically apple has implements large titles and shown the refresh control in the nav bar without thinking through the effects or dealing with the resulting bugs
first it is absolutely crucial that the table view extends up underneath the navigation bar and that is ios 11 offset behavior be correct second scrolling to show the refresh control when you refresh manually is up to you and calculating the amount is not at all simple the bar still stays too big during the refresh but i don t see what can be done about that

48349458
google-chrome	firefox
so after some research see comments myself and the author of the question figured out that google-chrome will not fire a change event if you select the same file twice
firefox does

48350872
ssl	https
after all that all it needed was the url to be https not http just in case it helps anyone else in the future in postman the url was just set as domain.co.uk but in my code i had put for the base url of the api so the api required all calls to be made using ssl
postman must do ssl by default

48352065
qt-creator	clion
you can report bugs on their tracker if you want some standard-compliant ide you can try ides based on clang like qt-creator or kdevelop
clion c++ parser currently is not fully standard-compilant

48352232
uicontrol	uibutton
but the uicontrol requires a frame cgrect for it to function properly
here are the important points for the uicontrol i explored 4 different possibilities timeout - dismiss an alert window after a number of seconds like android toast tap outside the alert window tap on alert window does not close it tap anywhere on the screen to close it on alert window or outside of it tap the alert window tap anywhere else does not close it and here is a complete viewcontroller xcode 9.2 swift 4 that handles all 4 cases to use this just create 4 uibutton in ib and connect them to the iboutlet vars and functions

48358649
fgets	getchar
the thing is in the previous input scanf the entered n is still in stdin - not the fgets in the next line consumed it
put a dummy getchar to get rid of it

48365126
queue	fifo
priority queue are different from queue in the sense that they do not act on the fifo principle
...the elements of the priority queue are ordered according to their natural ordering or by a comparator provided at queue construction time.

i just found out that the commercial product varnish plus in fact supports tls ssl
varnish at least in the open source version does not support https

48367134
apache	nginx
the first started in your case apache will start normally but the second will not initialize properly as two programs can not listen together on the same ports
confirm with the command sudo gitlab-ctl status nginx

48369868
setinterval	settimeout
setinterval takes a function as the first parameter calling a function and passing a function is not the same thing
in your code above you are actually passing the return of getajax to settimeout which is undefined since it doesn t return anything

48371643
implements	extends
for example with this implementation any class that defines __len__ and __iter__ will return true in a issubclass check in these examples i haven t called the superclass __subclasscheck__ and thereby disabled the normal issubclass behavior which is implements by type.__subclasscheck__
but it s important to know that you can also choose to just extends the normal behavior instead of completely overriding it class meta type def __subclasscheck__ cls subclassing just modify the behavior for classes that aren t genuine subclasses. if super .__subclasscheck__ subclassing return true else # not a normal subclassing implement some customization here. __subclasshook__ __subclasshook__ subclassing must be defined as a class method. check whether subclassing is considered a subclassing of this abc

48371936
division	subtract
that suggest to me you know the generic division operator can not be synthesized
trying to work around that using repeated subtract will not work

48372399
noexcept	throw
however unless i am misreading the standard it is not a requirement that a non- copyinsertable t s move constructor be noexcept
in fact the standard seems to allow for the possibility that a non- copyinsertable t s move constructor can throw an exception in which case it s not guaranteed whether there were effects

48372726
gruntjs	package.json
ok so if cordova-plugin-app-version is not available on pwa an alternative way to access to config.xml file is using a gruntjs task that copy the version to your templates as you know on ionic the config.xml file is not placed on a servable location so there is no way to read the version on execution time from config.xml
for example if we control the app version in package.json we can config a gruntjs task that copy the version both to config.xml and src index.html

48373754
gridview	sqldatasource
the problem occurs because datafield attribute inside gridview s boundfield does not accept column names that using whitespaces
better to use underscores for datafield and sortexpression field column names also using underscore-based alias names for every columns containing whitespaces in sqldatasource gridview control sqldatasource control furthermore if you have access to modify column names in ssms changing all column names with whitespaces to underscores like this update command should work without hassle note column field names in every table should follow database identifier convention to ensure crud commands are executed successfully

48376673
super	self
what you want to do is iterate over the things returned by that generator and yield them from your __iter__ in data python 2 def __iter__ self for i in super .__iter__ yield i yield d self.d but in python 3 this can be written more succinctly as def __iter__ self yield from super .__iter__ yield d self.d
this won t work because super .__iter__ is a generator and calling a generator in this context doesn t make sense

48378530
memcpy	strcpy	memcpy	strncpy
however to not forget the trailing null character notice using memcpy
alternatives would have been strcpy or strncpy but as length including the trailing null character

48378530
strdup	malloc
if you do not return the array anywhere even nicer edit nice alternative too strdup see coderredoc s answer
two other important points always check the result of malloc for being null memory allocation might have failed

48379603
shadowing	named
they do not inherit any members from the functional interface they will get converted to they can not create new variables shadowing existing local variables and even this and super have the same meaning as within the surrounding context jls 15.27.2
lambda body unlike code appearing in anonymous class declarations the meaning of named and the this and super keywords appearing in a lambda body along with the accessibility of referenced declarations are the same as in the surrounding context except that lambda parameters introduce new named

48383795
pascal	delphi
the turbo pascal string is mostly statically allocated and the string types that are new in delphi are dynamic
delphi strings have a null at the end but are not null-terminated the strings can contain null characters and turbo pascal are not

48383795
pascal	delphi
delphi strings have a null at the end but are not null-terminated the strings can contain null characters and turbo pascal are not
delphi has 4 or 5 such types including the turbo pascal one

48390274
google-chrome	firefox
another reason why you might prefer google-chrome over firefox as a development tool is that firefox has consistently been 6 months behind regarding dev tools for at least 4 years now
don t get me wrong i m not a big google-chrome fan and i fully welcome using firefox as browsing device of choice

48391162
phong	shading
phong shading is not possibel in the opengl fixed function pipeline
except you implement phong shading in your own shader

48392044
shadowing	named
again there s a subtlety if any shadowing is involved -- a binding in the where clause would override the bindings of func and x introduced on the left-hand side and also generate a warning if compiled with -wall
fortunately your example doesn t have this problem. the upshot of all this scoping is that in the program every usage of each named refers to the same thing all the k named refer to the same thing

48393774
hikaricp	c3p0
obviously you need to customize the hikaricp pool configs in order to get the performance that it promises
i have recently migrated from c3p0 to hikaricp in a spring and hibernate based project and it was not as easy as i had imagined and here i am sharing my findings

if c++11 is available to you use its random library part use one prng per thread use proper distribution and be careful not to seed prngs with same values
every pseudo random number generator prng has a state

since you are not allowed to use it fairness is the fifo queue that you are looking for
literally from the doc when fairness is set true the semaphore guarantees that threads invoking any of the acquire methods are selected to obtain permits in the order in which their invocation of those methods was processed fifo

contrast this with our rocker container which uses libblas3 -- single-threaded not optmized as debian maintainer for r i take advantage of the fact that we have several blas lapack builds
base can be ok openblas often is faster but be careful when you then launch multiple cores from r via the different mechanisms and there is also atlas

48411315
google-chrome	firefox
i agree that it doesn t seem possible and looking at webkit s implementation of websocket it doesn t seem possible and i ve never seen it on google-chrome mac or in firefox so my only guess is that google-chrome on ubuntu introduced a race condition with some optimization
confirming that the problem does exist as a rare but real situation on google-chrome 62 and 63 on ubuntu occasional loss of first message from server

48411411
google-chrome	firefox
in the mean time i use google-chrome for firefox webextensions development where the storage area explorer extension offers the feature you re looking for
currently this isn t possible in firefox

48412780
microchip	avr
if that doesn t work for some reason you could try downloading microchip s official avr toolchain from this page
you need to use a version of gcc that is specifically built to target avr chips you cannot just use the normal gcc executable for your system because it will produce the wrong kind of program

48419360
spaces	delimiter
allows for multi-character delimiter like comma spaces
returns 0 if the delimiter is not found

48423167
ssl	https
you are using your httpclient to browse a https website http + ssl tls tunnel but you re using the wrong .begin call
the begin string url call expects a http url not a https

48425089
aggregate-functions	sum
the any_value function in mysql is used when a query is doing a group by aggregation but columns are being selected which are not mentioned in the group by clause nor appear inside aggregate-functions
in the context of your query this means that the only columns which can be selected are the userid or another column inside an aggregate function like max or sum

48425089
postgresql	mysql
assuming you do not care which values you get back in postgresql you could arbitrarily just select the earliest memory for each user i think that in general you should avoid using any_value in mysql unless you absolutely have no other choice
a better long term solution would be to clean up the mysql query and make it ansi compliant

48427066
spaces	delimiter
your problem is you re using spaces delimiter data input
if it s truly delimiter and you re just not exactly replicating the data here you have a few choices

48432975
prepare	execute
the idea is that all prepare writes each of these are limited to mtu-5 in size have an offset parameter and an att handle are put in a queue at the peripheral side
the writes are not committed at the peripheral until the execute write occurs

48437141
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
when we move to other screen push another uiviewcontroller on the same uinavigationcontroller we need to set the bartintcolor otherwise it will be appear as black color
we can achieve this requirement like this in which uiviewcontroller we want to clear the navigationbar color should be clear in that uiviewcontroller we need to write these code in viewdidload viewwillappear and viewwilldisappear method in viewdidload method we need to write that for better appear result if we did not write put the code snippet then the navigation bar color will change after will view shown

48444787
build.gradle	gradlew
you can do this by running gradlew deploynodes in a project where a deploynodes task is defined and extracting the cordapp jar from one of the node s plugins folders copy the jar to somewhere in the rpc client project . lib cordapp-name.jar reference the jar as a dependency in your build.gradle file using the syntax cordapp files lib yo.jar
make sure you set the relative path correctly if the build.gradle file is nested one level down the above would become cordapp files .. lib yo.jar currently cordapp jar dependencies added in this way cannot be referenced from deploynode

48452280
direct3d	directx
you should probably not be starting a new project using legacy direct3d 9 anyhow
use directx 11 and avoid using the legacy directx sdk and the d3dx utility library as well

48454207
division	modulo
since you want to know whether the given index is even you should check the remainder of the division which is what the modulo returns
you want to do i modulo 2 not divided by 2

48454214
prng	random
in my experience the only time you mention a distribution for a random number generator is if it s something other than uniform they might tell you that some specific prng will produce random numbers according to a normal distribution
edit posix while verifying my assumptions i ran across a posix family of functions that are defined to generate random numbers in a uniform distribution name drand48 erand48 jrand48 lcong48 lrand48 mrand48 nrand48 seed48 srand48 - generate uniformly distributed pseudo-random numbers synopsis freebsd s manpage for drand48 does note that they are not cryptographically secure and that arc4random is recommended for cryptographic applications

48454696
git-svn	svn2git
dr yes if you use the right svn2git tool for a one-time migration git-svn is not the right tool for conversions of repositories or parts of a repository
it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case

48454696
git-svn	svn2git
it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case
there are plenty tools called svn2git the probably best one is the kde one from

48454696
git-svn	svn2git
even though git-svn or the nirvdrum svn2git is easier to start with here are some further reasons why using the kde svn2git instead of git-svn is superior besides its flexibility the history is rebuilt much better and cleaner by svn2git if the correct one is used this is especially the case for more complex histories with branches and merges and so on the tags are real tags and not branches in git with git-svn the tags contain an extra empty commit which also makes them not part of the branches so a normal fetch will not get them until you give --tags to the command as by default only tags pointing to fetched branches are fetched also
with the proper svn2git tags are where they belong if you changed layout in svn you can easily configure this with svn2git with git-svn you will loose history eventually with svn2git you can also split one svn repository into multiple git repositories easily or combine multiple svn repositories in the same svn root into one git repository easily the conversion is a gazillion times faster with the correct svn2git than with git-svn you see there are many reasons why git-svn is worse and the kde svn2git is superior

48457881
antialiasing	transparent
also setwindowrgn produces very ancient looking results because antialiasing is not possible
a pixel can be either fully transparent or fully opaque

48459552
backtracking	greedy
if you are looking for a solution you might use a tempered greedy token instead of it will only match any char if it does not start a 789 char sequence so no need to backtracking to accommodate for 789 see this regex demo
the point here is that is a quantified subpattern that allows a regex engine to backtracking once the subsequent subpatterns fail to match but the recursion calls in pcre are atomic there is no way for the engine to backtracking when it grabs any 0+ chars with and that is why the pattern fails to match

48459697
setinterval	settimeout
using setinterval is not recommended since the body function theoretically may take longer than the interval causing a stackoverflow
a better way is to use settimeout to call a function which at the end of executions schedules a new timeout for itself

48462570
multiplying	modulo
i d also change the totalsinglerow formula to divide the big values then multiplying the results rather than multiplying then divide.
i think you were on the right track with moving the modulo further up the chain but i wouldn t use the modulo for that

48464409
profiling	debugging
for doing this follow the following steps open run dialog -type wf.msc -click on inbound rules -click new rule on right hand side -select port from pop-up menu and click next -select tcp port and specific local ports and enter the port number like 8081 default -allow the connection -select all in profiling section -give some appropriate name and description -click finish you have to make your pc accessible to outside for doing this follow the following steps -open network and sharing centre from control panel -change adapter settings -select your wifi network -right click properties -click on sharing tab -check all the checkboxes you are good to go now try running react-native run-android
f you are trying to debugging app in your physical android device over wifi using a windows machine then the device may not be able to access the port of your pc or laptop you have to make the port accessible

48464954
calloc	malloc
calloc on the other hand will zero memory for you before returning
malloc is not supposed to zero the memory it returns

48466922
persistent	transient
additionally since you mention oracle if you are using toplink as your persistent provider then you might consider applying its readonly extension attribute to the estoque entity in place of or even in addition to some of these protections against trying to insert into or update the view
you have annotated produto.estoque as transient which means that it is not part of the persistent state of the entity

48467608
gradle	ivy
the advantages are + the version comes for free assuming the branches are named accordingly + the auto-incremented build number also comes for free + one can easily publish custom revisions + no plugins means no problems with gradle version updates + this approach is dead simple and always works the downsides are - no tags no changes at all in scm - no release branches etc. but since the build number is always known one can view the revision in ci builds history - some build numbers will be skipped obviously next version after 3.5.76 can be 3.5.84
for this exact behavior ivy buildnumber task can be invoked using pure gradle without importing the ant build in general gradle doesn t have any bundled equivalent to maven release plugin so one has to rely on plugins

48470522
scrypt	pbkdf2
it has better protection against gpu and fpga attacks but is a bit too recent to my liking i don t know much about scrypt
it has been designed to thwart gpu- and fpga- accelerated attacks but i ve heard it turned out to be not as strong as originally claimed pbkdf2 is a family of algorithms parametrized by the different hash functions

48471508
implements	extends
now on your coffee class you have not implements the subscript accessor which resulting in the nomethoderror you see there
you could thus either adapt your criteria#each method as follows or you could implement the subscript operators on your coffee class noe as an addendum you might want to extends your each method in any case

48472871
swift	objective-c
you need to declare it like this instead it s because of the unnamed function parameter in swift 2.2 all function parameters are named
in objective-c the first function parameter isn t named

48475612
mono	xamarin.android
by default xamarin.android uses the older mono managed httpclient handler that does not support tls 1.2
open your xamarin.android project settings goto build android build general and use the androidclienthandler

48476320
keras	tensorflow
keras itself is a good example case where the parameter name for the number of epochs changed from nb_epoch in keras 1 to epochs in keras 2 causing enough headaches in the transition...
mxnet uses num_epoch while lower level libraries such as tensorflow and pytorch do not use epochs at all notice that in pytorch there are still complaints for confusion between using epoch and iteration in the tutorial texts

48476681
lisp	scheme
i think the critical difference is that include is syntax or in traditional lisp terms it is a macro while load is a function
in traditional lisp terms there will be a much more formal definition of this in scheme terms which i am not competent to give this means that include does its work at macro-expansion time while load does its work at evaluation time

48477679
keras	tensorflow
the mnist data coming from keras are not normalized
following the keras mnist mlp example you should do it manually you should include the following in your load_data function not sure about pytorch but it would seem that the mnist data from their own utility functions come already normalized as is the case with tensorflow - see the third point in my answer here

48482514
factors	matrix
factors is a complex data type made up of chars and int types
matrix cannot hold two types at a time

48483177
realloc	malloc
otherwise if the argument does not match a pointer earlier returned by a memory management function or if the space has been deallocated by a call to free or realloc the behavior is undefined
in your code snippet parentarray is allocated memory using malloc but here miniarray is pointing to address of the first element of parentarray which is a valid memory but not the pointer returned by malloc

48485792
opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
...as document.body.scrolltop not works on google-chrome firefox opera etc because google-chrome firefox ie and opera places the overflow at the level unless else is specified
therefore you have to use the documentelement property for these browsers ...it only works on safari so you have to write both for browser support

48494607
ssl	https
unlike using http over ssl which requires a separate port and connection for secure https communication secure ftp communication occurs on the same port as non-secure communication
ftp 7 supports two different forms of ftp over ssl update to find the filezilla ssl guidance install a ssl certificate on filezilla ftp server installing a certificate on an openssl-based server is really similar than doing so on apache install an apache certificate except that the instructions indicating the path to th files are not the same

48494678
knitr	latex
knit your.rnw pdflatex your.tex note that the knitr package is always attached and pdflatex might be other latex engines depending on your rstudio configurations for sweave documents xelatex
if you want to replicate it in your current r session you may rewrite the script in r which is not as simple as knitr knit path to your.rnw in which case the working directory is not automatically changed and everything is executed in the current r session in the globalenv by default

48494834
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
this will only work in google-chrome or firefox
ie does not support mediastreamtrack s and safari does not currently support screensharing

48503204
stateless	stateful
see kubernetes docu for more details the main reason is that most of the stateful applications running in stateful sets such as your mongodb are usually not as easy to scale up down as the stateless applications running as deployments
scaling up and down is usually quite complicated process for stateful apps which you do not want to do only based on the autoscaler

48504144
antialiasing	transparent
then it will come out antialiasing like so
this is happening because you are drawing the text over an area that has not been initialised - so there s no background colour with which to antialias - it s treating it as transparent although the background does come out as white as you can see

48507503
n-gram	words
it does not use a dictionary but it does incorporate a rather large table of n-gram frequencies to support its probabilistic assessment of text strings
i m not sure if that qualifies as a dictionary . the approach does not check pronunciation and its specialization may make it unsuitable for general words nonword detection

48514696
uicontrol	uibutton
you can create a custom uicontrol it has touchup event and put any kind of components on it
if the uibutton doesn t meet your need then you can make a custom uicontrol

48514723
setinterval	settimeout
better solution for your case is to use setinterval
you need to remove the parentheses from choosepr because you should not call the function instead you should pass it to settimeout settimeout choosepr 200

48516623
jacoco	eclemma
changelog also notes tools that directly read exec files and embed jacoco for this such as sonarqube or jenkins will provide filtering functionality only after they updated to this version of jacoco
announcement of release of jacoco version 0.8.0 states tools that directly read exec files which is not a final report and embed jacoco for generation of report will provide filtering functionality only after they updated to this version of jacoco. so please follow wait etc respective vendors such as sonarqube - eclipse eclemma - jenkins - reports generated by corresponding version 0.8.0 of integrations developed as part of jacoco project by us ant tasks maven plugin and command line interface provide filtering functionality

48521460
stateless	stateful
we get evolution of training test loss as follows now we define a mime model which is stateless but containing our stateful weights
prediction with stateful model through model.predict needs a complete batch in keras but we may not have a complete batch to predict... finally we can show our incredible predictions on our long time series y1 y2 and y3 blue for true output

48524104
coalesce	nvl
so instead of coalesce on this line you can write your filter with nvl or ifnull like this
firedac supports nvl and ifnull functions they are equivalent in their expression engine but not coalesce

48531034
kombu	celery
celery s documentation is rather good yet kombu s documentation is quite poor in comparison
it feels like celery is the project intended to be exposed not kombu

48531034
kombu	celery
it feels like celery is the project intended to be exposed not kombu
under the hood when using amqp as transport kombu uses either py-amqp library or librabbitmq to send receive parse amqp 0.9.1 frames

48532502
strcpy	strncpy
strncpy is more safe than strcpy because you limit the amount of bytes to be copied thus avoiding a buffer overflow
but strncpy might not write the 0 -terminating byte if there is not enough room

48537479
intersect	contains
there are 6 possible scenarios a contains b b contains a b intersect a from the left b intersect a from the right b is to the left of a b is to the right of a based on that we can define a function that given two intervals and returns how much they intersect that s pretty much everything you need
to find out how much do two rectangles intersect you just need to execute this function on both the x and the y axis and multiply those amounts to get the intersecting area the result will be does not intersect in the x-axis so

48540981
freemarker	velocity
velocity freemarker support in only available intellj idea ultimate
unfortunately migrating it to webstorm is not an easy task as velocity plugin heavily relies on java.

48540981
freemarker	velocity
so currently we have no plans to provide freemarker velocity template engine support in webstorm
if you miss this feature and purchasing idea is not an option for you please feel free to file a request for providing velocity support to youtrack . also i can suggest searching for existing textmate bundles for velocity files on the web - you can then import them and use for the velocity syntax highlighting

48547673
single-quotes	double-quotes
you need to either escape all the meta-characters involved the white-space character and single-quotes also change the separator to # over _ sed -e s# db_source demo # db_source local # file or use the entire substitution inside double-quotes
ensure the search or replacement text does not contain a because the variable could be interpolated under double-quotes

48554299
boost	allocator
that s a lot of boilerplate to write so if you can use boost boost container static_vector is exactly what you re looking for
if a fixed-size std array or builtin array isn t suitable you can define a custom allocator that uses placement new

48560831
move	drag
so you need to make the rb kinematic and move it manually so that natural forces do not apply to it
additionally you are going to want to multiply by some normalizing variable time.fixeddeltatime _vel.x - vel.x dragfactor.x time.fixeddeltatime i found this code that modifies drag dynamically specifically the above code will help you modify drag at increasing speeds

48562471
sudo	passwd
on the other hand sudo is unnecessary here as you obviously don t do anything that needs root permissions
if you need it be aware that sudo is asking interactively for a passwd which stalls the execution of the script if the command you try to execute with it isn t explictely permitted in etc sudoers

48566774
automake	autotools
autoconf and automake are installed on my machine but did not run as was my expectation
however if the autotools are in fact installed on the build machine and if their inputs configure.ac makefile.am etc. appear to be newer than their outputs configure makefile.in etc. then an autotools-derived build system may indeed try to rebuild those outputs rebuild itself

48566774
automake	autotools
for example you should be able to update the automake-related pieces of your build system via the command automake -f -c
you would want to follow that up by running autoconf autoconf -f as a possible alternative if the autotools inputs in fact have not been modified then perhaps you just have a timestamping problem

48566774
automake	autotools
that s fine because no version of automake is required as part of a normal build of the package for any supported platform
which platforms are supported is primarily a function of the build system not of the autotools themselves so results do vary depending on the skill and foresight of the person who built that system

48566774
automake	autotools
and you do care about the particular package version check you describe because ignoring or suppressing it carries a high risk of leading to automake and or autoconf outputs that do not work properly
the autotools help more than perhaps you realize in providing multi-platform support but they cannot automagically ensure universal support

48566774
automake	autotools
or what is so broken with autotools that they feel the need to break my build because my version of automake is newer than the package was configured with
but the autotools cannot break your build because they are not involved in your build

48566863
tensorflow	cudnn
the prebuilt binaries of tensorflow at least since version 1.3 link to the cudnn library
if cudnn is missing an error message will tell you importerror could not find cudnn64_7.dll

48566863
tensorflow	cudnn
according to the tensorflow install documentation for version 1.5 cudnn must be installed for gpu support even if you build it from source
there are still a lot of fallbacks in the tensorflow code for the case of cudnn not being available -- as far as i can tell it used to be optional in prior versions

48566863
tensorflow	cudnn
there are still a lot of fallbacks in the tensorflow code for the case of cudnn not being available -- as far as i can tell it used to be optional in prior versions
here are two lines from the tensorflow source that explicitly tell and force that cudnn is required for gpu acceleration

48566863
tensorflow	cudnn
there is a special gpu version of tensorflow that needs to be installed in order to use the gpu and cudnn
make sure the installed python package is tensorflow-gpu and not just tensorflow

48567589
azure	hdinsight
you can use azure data factory to transform xml files to csv files then you can load all generated csv files into corresponding tables in azure sql data warehouse via polybase and a developed stored procedure activity on azure data factory
if you want to have a folder on blob storage for xml files not processed another folder for xml files processed and another folder for the csv files created and you want azure data factory to move files from one folder to another during all the process then you need to use hdinsight and create a map reduce activity for that purpose

48567589
azure	hdinsight
if you want to have a folder on blob storage for xml files not processed another folder for xml files processed and another folder for the csv files created and you want azure data factory to move files from one folder to another during all the process then you need to use hdinsight and create a map reduce activity for that purpose
polybase allows to use t-sql statements to access data stored in hadoop or azure blob storage and query it in an adhoc fashion

48569643
super	extends
super is es6 syntax that cannot be used outside the method where it s used
given there is foo class that extends bar super keyword is interpreted as bar in foo constructor and static methods and as bar.prototype in instance methods

48570264
ati	nvidia
so unfortunately since you have a amd ati device you cannot use that gpu to run tensorflow
for information on which hardware is supported refer to this information on nvidia gpu requirements

48570296
apache	nginx
the only real reason i can think to have it on the back end is to support http 2 server push but nginx doesn t support that either so that s another non-runner unless you switch to apache or some other server that supports this
nginx does not support back end connections in http 2 and have no intention of bringing this in for more details see my answer to this question

48572403
sqoop	hadoop
sqoop is not meant for that and i don t think it can solve your requirement
sqoop is to import or export data between hadoop and rdbms

48573877
clang	llvm
install latest llvm update the toolset.props toolset.targets in vs to support latest clang select the new toolset to use for building your c c++ or other lang project as of visual studio 2017 update 15.4.5 the microsoft experimental clang c2 no longer works
thus the above fixes are necessary to use clang to compile code that has full pdb not just codeview z7 limited debuggability

48573877
clang	llvm
thus the above fixes are necessary to use clang to compile code that has full pdb not just codeview z7 limited debuggability
this also now becomes a more complete suite for portability testing cross-platform builds since you can build and pdb debug for windows using all llvm components from the clang compiler front end to the llvm codegen backend and llvm linker

48578242
debian	linux
in my case debian version 8 that solves the issue for running a mongo client with ssl on docker apt-key adv --keyserver hkp keyserver.ubuntu.com 80 --recv 2930adae8caf5059ee73bb4b58712a2291fa4ad5 echo deb jessie mongodb-org 3.6 main | tee etc apt sources.list.d mongodb-org-3.6.list apt-get update for full mongodb installation that includes server do run as given below for installing only mongo client tools specific to a version for installing only mongo client tools default apt-get install -y mongodb-org-shell mongodb-org-tools my mongo output on docker - kali linux image now shows ssl configured mongodb shell version v3.6.2 git version 489d177dbd0f0420a8ca04d39fd78d0a2c539420 openssl version openssl 1.0.1t 3 may 2016 allocator tcmalloc modules none build environment distmod debian81 distarch x86_64 target_arch x86_64
kali linux is not a supported distro by mongo

48578770
ubuntu	debian
for example a .deb for debian ubuntu some particular versions of them
of course a .deb for debian might not work on ubuntu sometimes it does

48581199
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
the runtimeexception is an unchecked-exception and you do not need to mark your method as throwing this exception
from the docs because the java programming language does not require methods to catch or to specify unchecked-exception runtimeexception error and their subclasses programmers may be tempted to write code that throws only unchecked-exception or to make all their exception subclasses inherit from runtimeexception

48581227
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
runtimeexception and its subclasses are unchecked-exception . unchecked-exception do not need to be declared in a method or constructor s throws clause if they can be thrown by the execution of the method or constructor and propagate outside the method or constructor boundary
ioexception is a so to say regular exception and it s not a subclass of runtimeexception which is a superclass of a special kind of exception

48581505
gradle	ivy
upgrading gradlefx plugin version to 1.4.0 fixes this issue also upgrading gradle to something newer than 1.1 would be a smart move
anyway unfortunately you won t get this project built successfully because it seems like dashas.castlabs.com dns entry is unreachable and following ivy artifact cannot be downloaded - i would suggest contacting their support and ask why and when dns entry will be reachable or maybe they would suggest using different source to download this dependency

48581696
ssl	https
.e.g proxy_servers http https i know it says winxp but this still applies - if you are specifying your organisation s servers correctly and are still having these issues then there is likely a firewall exception ssl cert configuration issue that needs to be resolved and is not a conda issue per se but a networking problem
i am experiencing the same issue and am quite confident it is due to ssl firewall issues internally in the workplace

48583148
vmware	virtualbox
update i confirm that this works just fine in vmware workstation 14
you need support for nested virtualization and this has not yet been implemented in virtualbox

48585968
cvs	svn
personally i would use git or svn - changed from cvs 10y ago
cd repository mkdir a mkdir a b mdkdir a b c cvs update -d a b c not sure if in one go works if not try one after another the option -d will create directories that are missing

48587786
tostring	string.format
in your specific case you would not notice because you are using string s but if the objects you want to log are more complex but contain a tostring method then in this case the tostring method will always be called whatever the log level
applicationlog.info string.format name s id s age d name iduser age

48589555
swift	objective-c
swift declarations marked with the private or fileprivate modifier do not appear in the generated header
is followed by private declarations are not exposed to objective-c unless they are explicitly marked with ibaction iboutlet or objective-c

48592064
qthread	qobject
see the qt threads and qobject doc if the image loader isn t a qthread just a regular win32 thread you should use qcoreapplication postevent for thread safe delivery
if your asynchronous image loader is a subclass of qthread you can signal the main thread from the image loader and qt will ensure that the handling code slot is executed in the main thread

48596886
google-chrome	firefox
since also edge render the .item.fixed on top of the scrollbar i am not sure if it is firefox edge or google-chrome who is correct
as the scrollbar actually belongs to the scrolldiv i think google-chrome is wrong

48597898
google-chrome	safari
it works in both safari higher than 6.0 and google-chrome higher than 10
the promise-based syntax for baseaudiocontext.decodeaudiodata is not supported in safari webkit

48602749
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
i ve wrapped it in a runtimeexception and have rethrown it
this allows to keep using a fluent style for your monad but is not transparent any more as now any exception is wrapped in an unchecked-exception

48605119
ssl	https
unless you whitelist the host header sent by the browser these two values are the same -- the host header of the outgoing request is set to the origin domain name. that last condition is impossible to meet with an aws issued elb hostname as origin unless you forward the host header and have a cert on the elb that matches the host header sent by the browser because you can t get an ssl cert for a .amazonaws.com subdomain since that isn t your domain
this also means you can t use the assigned dzczcexample.cloudfront.net hostname in your browser to test https through to an elb origin that uses the elb hostname as the origin domain name -- cloudfront will throw a 502 bad gateway error and complain that it could not connect to the origin

48607496
rpm	yum
you will need to make sure httpd is installed and the same version as the mod_wsgi you are trying to install run the following command sudo rpm -q httpd to see if apache httpd is installed and what version
if you are using cpanel to manage your server you will not be able to install apache modules using yum as the modules are compiled for a specific version of apache and will not work with a different version

48614802
tvos	ios
xcode 7.3 includes sdks for ios 9.3 watchos 2.2 os x version 10.11.4 and tvos 9.2
as you can see xcode 7.3 doesn t include an sdk for ios 10.0 this meant as soon as i loaded the simulator with iphone 5 9.3 it worked immediately

48616765
vsts	tfs
update for now in repository it s only supported on vsts
not supported yet on premises tfs

48621754
inline	inlining
code inlining for public inline-functions is possible exactly because inline allows program behavior to be undefined when multiple definitions of inline-functions are not equivalent
interesting note clang violates this elf requirement and is able to inline public functions on elf targets anyway

48621848
setinterval	settimeout
please note settimeouts setinterval have certain limitations on accuracy if you find this is not accurate enough another option is using some high performance timers
rather than use setinterval another option is chaining settimeout s instead

48621881
inline	inlining
therefore calling a procedure flagged as inline from outside of a library shouldn t be reliable your initial assumption is already wrong so the therefore is proceeding from a false premise even if the compiler does inline a call which it may do with or without the inline keyword this is done at a specific call site
inlining isn t something that happens to a function which must always be emitted as usual but to a function call

48621922
ubuntu	linux
i m a ubuntu 16.04 user myself and i find that the ll command is by far the easiest way to see a directory s contents
i ve noticed that not all linux distributions support this command but there s probably a workaround install for each distro out there

48623956
pickle	dill
it is a third party package that works like pickle but has extensions to actually serialize arbitrary dynamic classes
while using dill may help other people reaching here it is not your case because in order to use dill you d have to monkey patch the underlying rpc mechanism pyspark is using to make use of dill instead of pickle and that might not be trivial nor consistent enough for production use

48623956
pickle	dill
while using dill may help other people reaching here it is not your case because in order to use dill you d have to monkey patch the underlying rpc mechanism pyspark is using to make use of dill instead of pickle and that might not be trivial nor consistent enough for production use
if the problem is really about dynamically created classes being unpickable what you can do is to create extra meta-classes for the dynamic classes themselves instead of using type and on these metaclasses create proper __getstate__ and __setstate__ or other helper methods as it is on pickle documentation - that might enable these classes to be pickled by ordinary pickle

48625133
ssl	https
once you have a load balancer ssl termination happens on the load balancer not on the ec2 instance
once it is setup you can change your apache server config to redirect all http requests to https

48625916
super	implements
the name preceding super in this example flycar or operatecar must refer to a direct superinterface that defines or inherits a default for the invoked method
this form of method invocation is not restricted to differentiating between multiple implements interfaces that contain default methods with the same signature

48626439
keystore	jks
it is better advised to maintain the extension so that it gives an idea of what type of keystore it is
these extensions are not standards but best practices jks - .jks or .keystore or .truststore pkcs12 - .p12 or .pkcs12 jceks - .jceks certificate - .crt or .cer or .pem or .cert a certificate when stored in a file in certain format defines what type it is

48627237
ubuntu	debian
the images namedas operating systems distributions such as ubuntu debian .
are not operating systems but are rather images with filesystem structure and tools that you typicaly find in an ubuntu distribution for example

48633908
hive	hdfs
and you re reading from your c drive load data local inpath will read the local filesystem but i m not sure how that works over jdbc because it depends on where the query is actually executed your local machine or the hiveserver i suggest you create an external hive table at a specific hdfs location with the necessary schema then simply copy the text file directly to hdfs
programmatically copying the file to hdfs is an option but hadoop fs -put would be simpler

48636678
vsts	tfs
it seems you are using vsts not on-premises tfs
usually login option can be used on on-premises tfs we use the login option to specify the team foundation server user account to run a command

48638704
namenode	hdfs
for example hdfs is in the format hdfs namenode port some input in_file note you need to first upload your file to the remote filesystem
when i run it on local mode everything is fine you are loading a file from the local filesystem then when you deploy to the cluster you need to ensure that in_file exists on all executors yarn resourcemanagers or on some shared filesystem such as hdfs or s3 you should specify where you data is located in that bash script like hdfs some input in_file if you did not copy your hadoop cluster s core-site.xml and hdfs-site.xml into a local hadoop_conf_dir environment variable or otherwise configure it yourself then the default behavior is to read a local filesystem and you will therefore need to use the external filesystem uri path

48638803
bash	subshell
when an interactive shell that is not a login shell is started bash reads and executes commands from .bashrc if that file exists
when you run a shell script with an interpreter set it opens a new subshell that is non-interactive and does not have the option -i set in the shell options

48640780
super	self
in py3 it s just super .greet rather than super parent self .greet
in the context you ve given it doesn t make sense to call super child self .greet from inside child.hello

48640780
super	self
in the context you ve given it doesn t make sense to call super child self .greet from inside child.hello
you should generally only use super to call the parent class method of the same name as the overridden method you are inside

48642569
ssl	https
then you will get another error that will not be visible because you are not handling exception here is example how to handle secure connections with use of ssl socket what you need to do is to change request with your parameters in this line out.println get http 1.0
host ark.intel.com is using https so you should use port 443

48648441
spaces	delimiter
we re parsing out of paranoia to prevent an application which contains literal spaces or characters in its executable name from throwing off the interpretation of
implemented in native bash depending on an operating system having procfs the mutated flag is set if cmdline doesn t end with a nul delimiter

48651665
uiview	subviews
that means that uistackview is not a classic uiview but rather a nice interface for layout out its subviews
there is no sense in creating a uistackview that has no arranged subviews which is your case

48655135
strdup	strncpy	strcpy	strncpy
if is a then you would need to allocate memory for that and then do strcpy or if your system has strdup but if is a the strcpy is not the right choice because you have no guarantee that the string in name is shorter than some_length - 1
in this case you would have to use strncpy and make sure that you end up with a valid string and of course you don t have to forget to free the memory you ve allocated

48662632
required	placeholder
- just make the value of that option and use required from the what-wg html spec for required if a select element has a required attribute specified does not have a multiple attribute specified and has a display size of 1
and if the value of the first option element in the select element s list of options if any is the empty string and that option element s parent node is the select element and not an optgroup element then that option is the select element s placeholder label option

48663061
freebsd	linux
linux isn t windows or freebsd .
it requires a different mindset to create an efficient file server on linux in comparison to windows

48665119
spaces	delimiter
i suspect this is because of trailing spaces on the input
by default split will emit an empty entry when it encounters a delimiter that isn t followed by a non-delimiter

48665119
spaces	delimiter
similarly the input 1 2 with a trailing spaces would yield because the final delimiter has nothing to its right
this is often a point of confusion and the documentation for split doesn t do a great job of informing you returns an array whose elements contain the substrings in this instance that are delimiter by one or more characters in separator

48665241
jar	war
one cannot turn a resource file inside a jar into a file
only when classpath is immediately on classes such as an unpacked war file

48666688
ubuntu	debian
indeed it seems that jpeg2000 support is not enable in last versions of ubuntu
debian fixed this issue a while ago

48667095
config	ini
.net core applications aren t supposed to use app.config or configurationmanager as it is a legacy full framework config system
consider using microsoft.extensions.configuration instead to read json xml or ini config files

48667998
ienumerable	iqueryable
it s not true that iqueryable uses more memory than ienumerable
with ienumerable you keep your objects in memory so you have to allocate space for every object in your collection

48668704
base	fractions
whether to use a log scale to base e or 10 does not change the graph itself because they just differ by a constant factor wikipedia it would then just be a matter of taste whether to show the ticklabels as base e or base 10 ticks compared to
since the plot in question ranges by only a fractions of a decade it seems more suitable to use decadic ticks or just normal numbers as shown below

48673205
rtp	rtsp
with rtp you start a streaming server on your pc
so in your ffmpeg commandline you have to specify your pc s ip address and not the target . ffmpeg -re -stream_loop -1 -i akgld-c8mxm.opus -acodec libopus -ac 1 -ab 96k -vn -f rtp rtp your_pc_s_ip_address 6000 on the android side you ll need a rtp rtsp client

48673481
textview	imageview
textview inside of imagebutton imageview xml - android dev obviously make sure each view has a unique id name which you can assign as shown here on this link sorry i cannot explain specifically myself but it has been a while since developing in java for android
i hope this may be useful it explains how to position a textview within and in front of a imageview in the xml

48675182
profiling	debugging
add a new profiling for arm
set the toolchain to the arm toolchain and set the cmake options to -dcmake_cxx_flags -fpie -fpic -lstdc++ -dcmake_ar ndk_toolchain_path arm bin arm-linux-androideabi-ar -dcmake_ranlib ndk_toolchain_path arm bin arm-linux-androideabi-ranlib if you re using a mac you will need these too in order to tell cmake to not use the isysroot option -dcmake_osx_sysroot -dcmake_osx_deployment_target repeat step 4 for any other architectures you want to support when building set the profiling to your desired architecture instead of debugging release

48676533
swift	objective-c
jano s answer worked for me so i thought i d leave an updated version for swift 4 xcode 9 as i m not particularly proficient in objective c and i m sure there are a few others that aren t either
step 1 add this code in viewdidload step 2 make sure your class conforms to the uigesturerecognizerdelegate step 3 add the following function to make sure your pangesture will work simultaneously with other gestures step 4 and ensuring your method isn t called 50 times per drag as jano rightly points out note the addition of objective-c in the last step

48679952
junit	testng
selenium doesn t support any kind of the assertion you have go with the frameworks ex testng junit .
i can suggest you 2 methods for asserting multiple values using testng by assuming you have stored multiple values in arraylist

48685342
tensorflow	cudnn
this pr on tensorflow github seem to relate to the topic although i have not yet tested these changes
i have ran experiments to test speed with the volta v100 gpu and tensorflow 1.5 cuda 9.0 cudnn and came to the following conclusions training using volta v100 is not faster than traning with geforce 1080 ti whereas it should be materially faster

48688745
retrofit	okhttp
the solution to attach a dispatcher to the okhttp client and limit the amount of max requests does not seem to work on retrofit out of the box as stated by jake wharthon
so my solution was to synchronize the authenticate method on my custom authenticator making concurrent calls to my singleton retrofit instance wait until the authenticate routine is finished for each thread

48691567
sudo	passwd
use sudo in front of your install command and enter your passwd when prompted
it installs npm into the global space which requires sudo if you are not on the root account

48691819
google-chrome	firefox
currently it is not supported by edge it has lots of issues in firefox it has some issues in google-chrome and safari see here for the complete picture assuming you are testing in google-chrome the main problem is your use of the flex-basis property
the flex item has according to the documentation linked to above max-content does not recognize flex-basis in google-chrome

48699719
comparator	comparable
note comparator in this post are sample-only and you need to add all type null checks for them to work in real code
why iclub is not comparable to itself and there is no other information about the type available to the code at run-time for generic method

48699719
comparator	comparable
so it falls back to non-generic version of comparator which is not implemented by your club type
fixes either use list of club instead of as club is comparable to itself implement non-generic comparator on the club make type you have in the list iclub to be comparable to itself - to fix the issue if you really expect mixed iclub implementations in the array see list.sort for details

48707313
move	drag
if you delete a folder move it to trash it is unsubscribed
starting with tb29 if you drag drop a folder from one feed acount to another feed account the subscription is retained but not feeditems

48708436
swift	objective-c
if you re working on a swift project you could create an objective-c class which implements your nsfilehandle methods that catches the nsexceptions like in this question but otherwise you re out of luck
check out seektoendoffile and writedata are not marked as throws they don t throw an nserror object which can be caught in with a do-try-catch block which means in the current state of swift the nsexceptions raised by them cannot be caught

48714577
strcpy	strdup	strcpy	malloc
i d suggest and i think it is the only safe way here that you do a copy of token with strdup if available or malloc + strcpy and after that do in this way your code won t leak memory and you would not overwrite memory
edit i should instead be setting the values of model and color with strcpy instead you can use strcpy but you would need to allocate memory first because model and color are just pointers

48714577
strcpy	malloc
edit i should instead be setting the values of model and color with strcpy instead you can use strcpy but you would need to allocate memory first because model and color are just pointers
the malloc call only reserved memory it does not initialize it

48720047
hex	binary
i believe this will resolve the original question while fixing a couple of potential issues introduced by comparing as hex
the issues i have with the string hex comparison are it uses twice as much memory as it needs to store a binary file as hex and it can match a string on a nibble-boundary which isn t a byte-boundary

48720047
hex	binary
the issues i have with the string hex comparison are it uses twice as much memory as it needs to store a binary file as hex and it can match a string on a nibble-boundary which isn t a byte-boundary
for an example of the second case check to which contains which as hex would incorrectly match the bytes i m looking for a more efficient method which can process the source data from a stream rather than a byte array

48723163
multiplying	multiplication
recall why and how we use the matrix in the first place here we get a 2x1 vector by multiplying a 2x2 matrix and a 2x1 vector
we then look at its top element and have by multiplication rules the point is we can take the power of the matrix to get the following by the same argument we have where x and y are the top row of the matrix so is not the answer really. the real answer looks like if we can have negative intermediate values see point 1 above the result is still from -r to r instead of from 0 to r

48728152
strdup	malloc
solution is to use strdup like
in case you have not posix strdup make one using malloc and memcpy

48728184
strdup	malloc
the solution to this would be the one mentioned by coderredoc use malloc + strcpy or strdup if available
or if strdup is not available when you have a function like this is also a hint that the function foo won t modify the content pointed to by name so it s safe to do foo string literal

48734240
atoi	atof
1 besides the fact that atoi is for converting to int not double
you need std stod 1 note that you could also use std atof passing it assembledstring.c_str

48738456
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome 59 added a css and js coverage tool that should help you find out what styles are being used and what styles are not being used
you might be able to get similar functionality out of firefox with addons

48742036
division	modulo
the formula is nice if m is a prime. in that case you can perform all the computations modulo that prime including the division to keep the numbers small. you d just need to get exponentiation i n fast. i suggest you look at and references therein. this should give you o log n time complexity compared to the o n of your loop
if m is not a prime the division in the above formula is annoying

48743544
client-side	server-side
it sounds like you re strengths are in the client-side so the former may be the best option
the order of page loading is xpages events are in bold a server-side map of all components on the xpage and associated custom controls are loaded into memory beforepageload developer s server-side code runs against those components the server-side components are iterated and updated based on computations or bindings to backend documents afterpageload developer s server side code runs against those components beforerenderresponse developer s server-side code runs against those components using this event means it s also processed during any partial refreshes render response iterates the components and works out the html to pass to the browser afterrenderresponse developer s server-side code runs against the components as you can see ssjs runs only against the server-side map of components not against the client-side dom

48744037
implements	extends
if you are not going to change your design - you have several options 1 change asqueryable to another method which returns iqueryable which also implements idbasyncenumerable
for example you can extends enumerablequery which is returned by asqueryable then you change results.distinct .asqueryable to and later toarrayasync will not throw exception any more obviously you can create your own extension method like asqueryable

48744062
cdr	cons
you could define your own macro with define-setf-expander as said in comments basically we fetch the existing cons cell where priority is in car position and replaces its cdr
but if we do not find such a cons cell we push instead a fresh cons cell in front of the existing list

48746815
build.gradle	gradlew
instead add those values to build.gradle as shown in the docs
gradlew analysis doesn t read sonar-project.properties

48746939
clang	llvm
to compile the openmp hello world program for example type usr local opt llvm bin clang -fopenmp -l usr local opt llvm lib omp_hello.c -o hello you might also have to set the cppflags with -i usr local opt llvm include
a makefile should look like this update in macos 10.14 mojave you might get an error like usr local cellar llvm 7.0.1 lib clang 7.0.1 include omp.h 118 13 fatal error stdlib.h file not found if this happens the macos sdk headers are missing from usr include

48747450
clang	llvm
to compile the openmp hello world program for example type usr local opt llvm bin clang -fopenmp -l usr local opt llvm lib omp_hello.c -o hello you might also have to set the cppflags with -i usr local opt llvm include
your second option get clang to use omp.h is not impossible any more

48747450
clang	llvm
your second option get clang to use omp.h is not impossible any more
from my answer here try using homebrew s llvm brew install llvm you then have all the llvm binaries in usr local opt llvm bin

48748685
sudo	passwd
for mysql 5.7.5 and older if the alter user command doesn t work use now exit to stop instance started manually sudo kill cat var run mysqld mysqld.pid restart mysql sudo systemctl start mysql
it happens when your passwd is missing

48750713
git-svn	svn2git
for a one-time migration git-svn is not the right tool for conversions of repositories or parts of a repository
it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case

48750713
git-svn	svn2git
it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case
there are plenty tools called svn2git the probably best one is the kde one from

48750713
git-svn	svn2git
even though git-svn or the nirvdrum svn2git is easier to start with here are some further reasons why using the kde svn2git instead of git-svn is superior besides its flexibility the history is rebuilt much better and cleaner by svn2git if the correct one is used this is especially the case for more complex histories with branches and merges and so on the tags are real tags and not branches in git you can generate annotated tags instead of lightweight tags with git-svn the tags contain an extra empty commit which also makes them not part of the branches so a normal fetch will not get them until you give --tags to the command as by default only tags pointing to fetched branches are fetched also
with the proper svn2git tags are where they belong if you changed layout in svn you can easily configure this with svn2git with git-svn you will loose history eventually with svn2git you can also split one svn repository into multiple git repositories easily or combine multiple svn repositories in the same svn root into one git repository easily the conversion is a gazillion times faster with the correct svn2git than with git-svn you see there are many reasons why git-svn is worse and the kde svn2git is superior

48752475
client-side	server-side
in summary razor is a solution for server-based architecture which can handle api logic and server-side templating but it cannot offer client-side logic outside of javascript
blazor is the next step and hopefully successor that will allow the same server side functionality as razor but will integrate client-side logic using c# instead of javascript

48753772
stateless	stateful
combined with read-through caching from the stateless service
the sf platform as in stateful services doesn t provide a way to do set based operations atm

48758585
unixodbc	iodbc
unixodbc tracing is enabled disabled via this stanza of the odbcinst.ini not odbc.ini file
if you were using the iodbc driver manager that ships with macos tracing would be controlled through the iodbc administrator.app found in applications iodbc and the standard configuration file odbc.ini found in the standard locations library odbc for system-level config

48759417
swift	objective-c
kcgwindowimagedefault is only for objective-c not swift
in swift cgwindowimageoption is an optionset

48767045
countif	named
if f2 0 success if g2 0 error not tested this should keep it fairly simple to read and alter when required but if you didn t want the individual status count columns then you may change the if formula to include the countif formulas within and manually reference the status descriptors like so if countif a 2 a 17 e2 b 2 b 17 success 0 success if countif a 2 a 17 e2 b 2 b 17 error 0 error not tested
if i understand your requirement correctly it sounds as though you may be able to achieve what you need using the countif formula providing you can get a unique list of test named

48767135
freebsd	linux
it might not be the same on linux and on some other posix system like freebsd
on linux the abi defines how a system call is done

48776202
strcpy	malloc	strncpy	malloc
here you should use strcpy if you know that the source strings is smaller than 49 characters long or strncpy to be completely sure same thing with node_name
also you are not checking if malloc returned null

48776416
setinterval	settimeout
the problem is not with settimeout but with setinterval which could lost some executions and has other drawbacks
so always use settimeout

48778990
hive	hdfs
hive is not a database
it s a batch sql engine over large datasets in hdfs

48778997
realloc	malloc
otherwise if the argument does not match a pointer earlier returned by a memory management function or if the space has been deallocated by a call to free or realloc the behavior is undefined
always remember one thing you will pass to free whatever you have allocated using malloc and it s friends

48793893
move	drag
building on the code in your referenced question you can do this what you want is not a left click but a left mousedown followed by a mouse move and a mouseup
the example above drag a window provided there is one from 50 20 to 200 100

48794298
rsa	aes
i may or may not be abusing the sign verify power of rsa to encrypt a separate aes key using the private key and decrypt using the public key
no not at all that is a valid use of rsa sign verify assuming you are working with fixed-length inputs such as an aes key

48794775
dictionary	map
another difference is that routing doesn t map a url to another url in mvc it maps a url to a dictionary of route values
for example you can map the url apple to

48797766
haskell	idris
idris docs are possible with in haskell to yet we have to make a gadt for a function
the is one many use if idris version is the haskell is not that much different when and p is encoded with a gadt

48798094
boost	allocator
a more flexible stateful allocator here s the simplest pool allocator i could think of notes this allocator is stateful and thus requires container implementations that allow them such as boost container boost multiindex
in theory all c++11-compliant standard libraries should also support them the comparisons should guide the containers to swap copy the allocator or not

48798716
base	fractions
maybe it doesn t in base 10 decimal but computers don t work in base 10
they work in base 2 and in base 2 128.51 has more decimals fractions digits than can be stored in the float or actually any similar format mdash

48799633
translation	transliteration
there could be some translation involved depending on which english words are used
i am not sure if transliteration apis are publicly available but you can see an example of this from google at google language input tools

48803000
mongodb	bson
the mapping between mongodb fields and go struct fields must be specified using the bson tag not json
so you should provide bson tag values along with json tags

48806970
serializable	deserialization
avoid modification json objects in memory as much as possible serializable and deserializers are just a sort of pipes and should not bring you surprises with modified objects
you can implement a generic empty string as a null type deserializer and annotate each bad field that requires this kind of deserialization strategy

48808858
comparator	comparable
the other constructor which takes a comparator must only be used if the elements in your queue are not comparable s or you wish to use a different ordering
since your node class already implements the comparable interface there is no need to define a and pass it to your queue object just use the no-argument constructor according to the official documentation public priorityqueue creates a priorityqueue with the default initial capacity 11 that orders its elements according to their natural ordering

swift	objective-c
it isn t very swift-like but it isn t a swift class it s an objective-c class
first your extra question swift namespaces are by module

48814816
memcmp	strcmp
we first make sure that the starting is where we would expect it to be given the length of the delimiter string and then use memcmp to compare the two delimiter sequences
we use memcmp rather than strcmp because the sequences we are comparing are not nul-terminated

48815100
equals	gethashcode
not doing so will cause a warning to be shown on the overridden equals method among other issues
override the equals method edit as mentioned in the comments you will also want to override the gethashcode method whenever you override the equals method

48817348
bash	zsh
to fix this use bash or use a pipe like this echo string | command
it s a here-string not all shells use this syntax but at least bash ksh zsh check man bash | less + here strings a variant of here documents the format is n the word undergoes brace expansion tilde expansion parameter and variable expansion command substitution arithmetic expansion and quote removal

48820155
single-quotes	double-quotes
here we put the string in single-quotes and this preserves the double-quotes now your grep command will work documentation quote removal is documented in man bash quote removal after the preceding expansions all unquoted occurrences of the characters and that did not result from one of the above expansions are removed
note that the shell removes the outer quotes from strings if you want to keep the double-quotes they need to be quoted

implements	extends
essentially if you want an interface that looks somehow like this but you want to enforce that instead of foo all implements subclasses return something of their own type you modify foo as follows and then implements subclasses as in your case you might try something like this notice where the newbuilder -method has to be overridden to resolve conflicts this is mentioned in the above linked document
edit even if your myprimeiterable chooses not to extends specialintiterablelike it still must implements a tail that returns at least a specialintiterable if we try to loosen the return type of tail it won t compile because a specialintiterable extends

super	implements
i there are some attributes in the constructor of a class they can come either from parent class super class or a child class
if super .__init__ was not called from the constructor of the considered class then definition done in the constructor of the parent class are not implements yet

48833023
implements	extends
if you meant that t has to be a subtype of b then use extends you might expect it to be something like this because that s how you normally have a class implements an interface
but when specifying bounds for a generic type parameter you must use extends not implements

postgresql	mysql
while using mysql workbench to migrate data from postgresql to mysql
i was not sure why this was happening because the target mysql database had utf8 encoding and i thought that everything can be mapped to it

48843790
exponent	modulo
this is however not the case for rsa public keys as both the modulo and public exponent will always be the same size
only the modulo is likely to change in value as it is unique for each key pair if it is not then the random number generator is broken

48854616
noexcept	throw
there is no way to decide the noexcept -ness based on the runtime value of the argument so the different overloads are needed
some background information about the reason for the different noexcept specifications reset does not throw since it is assumed that the destructor of the previously contained object does not throw

48854616
noexcept	throw
some background information about the reason for the different noexcept specifications reset does not throw since it is assumed that the destructor of the previously contained object does not throw
but the second overload might additionally need to allocate a new control block for the shared pointer state which will throw std bad_alloc if the allocation fails

equals	gethashcode
two variables of a value type like for example are considered equals if their underlying value is the same two variables of a reference type - anything that s not a value type - are usually only considered equals if they have the same identity - that is they refer to the same object in memory for all we know and are exactly the same but they refer to two distinct instances in memory
a type definition can override gethashcode the function used to determine an object s identity and equals the function used to determine equality between two objects so you may find that some reference types seem to act as value types when comparing them - being a prime example the adentity class the base type for all output objects in the activedirectory module doesn t attempt something like this which is why you see the results you do

48855980
equals	gethashcode
notes you must provide correct implementation of gethashcode that matches equals if you use comparer for any dictionary hashset
default equals for sequences is reference compare that does not align with your equals

48855980
equals	gethashcode
default equals for sequences is reference compare that does not align with your equals
note that most implementation of gethashcode depend on order of the items in the collection - so you need to find one that works for sets

48856537
fgetc	fread
although you could use simply fgetc to read the byte warning no error checking here
you are declaring begintag as an array so you should not put an ampersand front of it in the fread call

48856774
strcpy	strncpy
the other thing to notice here is that i used strncpy instead of strcpy . strcpy suffers from the same problems as gets it doesn t take the size of the destination buffer into consideration and if the source string is larger than the destination buffer it will overflow the buffer
strncpy works like strcpy except that you pass how many bytes there is available for the destination buffer

48856774
strcpy	strncpy
strncpy works like strcpy except that you pass how many bytes there is available for the destination buffer
if the source is larger than that number then strncpy will not writing bytes in the destination thus preventing a buffer overflow

48861757
noexcept	throw
note that shall not throw is not the same as noexcept though
operator of the default_delete is not declared as noexcept even though it only invokes delete operator executes delete statement

48868211
swift	objective-c
that s never going to work because objective-c cannot see a swift protocol extension so cocoa which is objective-c will never know about your implementation and will never call it
you are trying to make a swift protocol extension on an objective-c protocol

48868778
translation	localization
for content translation in wordpress you can chose between those two qtranslate free plugin wpml commercial plugin may be there is actually some new other plugins each one has its strengths and weaknesses see comparing translation plugins features regarding woocommerce
you can t translate content of posts or pages with something based on .po .mo files because it is only for theme or plugin localization but not for multi language content

48868778
translation	localization
you can t translation content of posts or pages with something based on .po .mo files because it is only for theme or plugin localization but not for multi language content
wp polylang will only translates woocommerce partially even using loco translation plugin

48868888
intersect	contains
actually your solution is not correct and here is why suppose you have many days where the same amount of ranges intersect and this amount is the maximum among all others
for example 1 - 3 3 - 6 6 - 9 9 - 10 from what i see you you have the following days 3 6 9 where all of them have two bills to be paid and no other day contains more bills to be paid

48872519
keras	tensorflow
keras might be integrated more with tf in the future versions
your confusion is caused by the fact that tf.contrib.keras api is not exactly tensorflow and isn t meant to be used like core tensorflow 1

48875019
lisp	scheme
use arg arg define proc case-lambda man1 proc man1 default-arg1 man1 arg ... and since you have tagged lisp i ll add common lisp version of positional optional arguments
scheme as in r5rs compliant r6rs and r7rs if the parameters are not a proper list then the dotted symbol represent the rest of the arguments as a list

48877241
comparator	comparable
also read about comparator and sort sorts the specified array of objects according to the order induced by the specified comparator
all elements in the array must be mutually comparable by the specified comparator that is c.compare e1 e2 must not throw a classcastexception for any elements e1 and e2 in the array . this sort is guaranteed to be stable equal elements will not be reordered as a result of the sort

48877661
jruby	mri
these includes virtualized linux environments windows subsystem for linux and alternative ruby interpreter like jruby
rails on ruby mri works relatively well but certainly there are gems that build native extensions that cannot be compiled on windows

48881952
super	extends
so the java compiler is adding super without args for you
in fact if the class you are extends doesn t have a default constructor you will be required to call this constructor with args before

48883252
stateless	stateful
in the case of stateless processes the scaling shouldn t affect the response as the service doesn t hold any state in any of it s containers
the case for stateful services is a lot more complicated and kinda goes beyond the scope of an so question

48887406
stateless	stateful
on the other hand a stateless lambda expression is one whose result does not depend on any state that might change during the execution of a pipeline
source ocp oracle certified professional java se 8 programmer ii study guide exam 1z0-809by jeanne boyarsky scott selikoff possible output 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1 7 5 2 3 4 6 it strongly recommended that you avoid stateful operations when using parallel streams so as to remove any potential data side effects

48887522
bmp	png
if it is not compressed like a bitmap bmp it s raw
examples of compressed formats are png jpeg gif

48892431
stateless	stateful
i would argue that it is not possible to write a function that can determine if a lambda is stateless or not looking for example at the filter method of the stream api the javadoc states that the parameter must be a ... stateless predicate and also links to the api s definition of stateless
if there was a way to determine if the parameter of the filter or any other method was stateless or not the stream class would have included the possibility to throw an illegalargumentexception in case the parameter was a stateful lambda

48892769
clang	llvm
the error message says that the version of clang llvm that was used to generate a bitcode is not compatible with the version of clang llvm that attempts to read it
producer means clang llvm that was used to generate the bitcode reader means clang llvm that reads that bitcode

48893658
vsts	tfs
some features are available in vsts which depend on cloud resources so they re not likely to move to tfs anytime soon
with regards to reporting this has been a bit of an achilles heel of vsts

48895623
debian	linux
i m not sure why it isn t standard practice to use f in more places there does seem to be a debian bug to do so
docker for windows and docker for mac both use a linux vm to host containers

48895663
floating-point	fractions
the wikipedia article has a good discussion on this representation in particular if you interpret the output of this function as a two s complement integer value you ll get a completely irrelevant value that has nothing to do with the value of the floating-point number itself
also this conversion is not unique since nan has multiple corresponding bit-vector patterns. summary long story short conversions from floats to bit-vectors will suffer from precision loss not only due to losing the fractions part due to rounding but also due to the limited range unless you pick a very-large bit-vector size

48895955
google-chrome	firefox
in my case i needed a fast way to check if a value is a typed array and the results google-chrome 64.0.3282.167 64-bit windows firefox 59.0b10 64-bit windows out of curiousity i did a quick toy benchmark against typeof
surprisingly it doesn t perform much worse and it seems even a bit faster in google-chrome note order in which functions are listed switches between images

48897027
ssl	https
keep in mind that i had never opened my project properties before so i have no idea how this happened i did not change this myself or have the opportunity to but in project properties web my ssl url was listed as my usual url but as http instead of https had previously been https because it was working before
i went through all the steps listed on this page uninstalled vs then iis and finally noticed the error which should have been but was missing the s in https

48897746
udp	tcp
many of my apps use udp and they work fine even if they aren t in foreground
c++ or qml i haven t played with tcp a lot but i believe it is supposed to work even though the app is minimized not in foreground or even with screen shutdown make sure you have the run as active frame permission checked in your bar-descriptor.xml file

48897776
cdr	cons
implements the same process as the one encoded nicely by defun flatten2 l z cond endp l z listp car l flatten2 car l flatten2 cdr l z atom car l cons car l flatten2 cdr l z defun flatten l flatten2 l nil with implicit stack operations explicated as list structure manipulations among the variables
a non-recursive code which builds the result by cons es following comments and starting from a code by user sylwester it s not pretty but it seems to work

48899569
client-side	server-side
it isn t a great solution because client-side code should generally be decoupled with server-side code and with this approach you ll have to manage your routes at both the client and the server ends but it will do what you want perhaps
in most situations you would want your rails server or any server in fact to just act as a rest api service and let the client-side code either a single-page app or an ios android app take care of the navigation flows and the layout

48904624
vsts	tfs
some of these features are available only on vsts and not yet available on-premises
some features are available on-premises if you have upgraded to the latest version of tfs

48905028
persistent	transient
however even if there is no notnull annotation and hibernate.check_nullability option is set to true hibernate will perform validation of entities to be persistent
it will throw propertyvalueexception saying that not-null property references a null or transient value if nullable false attributes do not have values even if such restrictions are not implemented in the database layer

48905893
decimal	ieee
in order to store 6 decimal places perfectly for latitude or longitude you should use a 32-bit integer representing 1 million times the value to store
floating point variables cannot store arbitrary real numbers they can only store members of a particular subset of cardinality slightly under 2 32 for a 32-bit ieee float of the real numbers

48909094
super	extends
this calls the super method a.m1 a a because b extends a
it cannot call b.m1 b b because of the explicit call on super

48909207
swift	objective-c
if this does not work then i believe that there is no way to access objective-c instance variables from swift
only objective-c properties get mapped to swift properties

48911283
exponent	modulo
.net wants the values as big-endian byte arrays which is the same byte order as the der encoding with the following relationship exponent is as big as it needs to be so long as it doesn t start with 0x00
modulo is as big as it needs to be so long as it doesn t start with 0x00

rdf	owl
dataproperty hasprice domain haspricedomain range xsd double class haspricedomain equivalentto product or service class product subclassof hasprice some xsd double disjointwith service class service subclassof hasprice some xsd double disjointwith product from an oop perspective it is best to think of oop classes as rdf owl classes and oop instances of classes as rdf owl individuals

48913158
rdf	owl
in oop interfaces usually specify behaviour methods which cannot trivially be translated to rdf owl
starting out with rdf owl it is probably best to focus on classes only

opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i have not tried opera or safari
for google-chrome and firefox i have been using a purely javascript method

48918200
google-chrome	firefox
however if sourcetext is larger than a mb google-chrome sometimes only sometimes gets stuck in its own download without any failure indication
firefox so far has not exhibited this behavior

48918374
istream	getline
std istream get with the cin.get method you re using in your third case you can actually retrieve the newline characters unlike with getline - although the code you provide requires two enter presses per loop iteration after the first rather than one which i doubt was your intent
the separate conditional break case shouldn t be necessary and the loop condition should suffice in the failure case no-args std istream get returns the eof value which won t equal n so your loop exits in that case

48925479
tensorflow	cudnn
but the official webpage of tensorflow 1.5 dose not deny the possibility of option 2
according to you previous answer you seem to find out prebuilt tensorflow-gpu 1.5 is not compatible with cuda 9.0 + cudnn 6.0

48925558
accelerometer	gyroscope
sensor data you would require coremotion to access the accelerometer device motion data
import coremotion accelerometer motiondata gyroscope sensor alone is not available on apple watch but motion data is with more information

48925696
git-svn	svn2git
for a one-time migration git-svn is not the right tool for conversions of repositories or parts of a repository
it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case

48925696
git-svn	svn2git
it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case
there are plenty tools called svn2git the probably best one is the kde one from

48925696
git-svn	svn2git
even though git-svn or the nirvdrum svn2git is easier to start with here are some further reasons why using the kde svn2git instead of git-svn is superior besides its flexibility the history is rebuilt much better and cleaner by svn2git if the correct one is used this is especially the case for more complex histories with branches and merges and so on the tags are real tags and not branches in git you can generate annotated tags instead of lightweight tags with git-svn the tags contain an extra empty commit which also makes them not part of the branches so a normal fetch will not get them until you give --tags to the command as by default only tags pointing to fetched branches are fetched also
with the proper svn2git tags are where they belong if you changed layout in svn you can easily configure this with svn2git with git-svn you will loose history eventually with svn2git you can also split one svn repository into multiple git repositories easily or combine multiple svn repositories in the same svn root into one git repository easily the conversion is a gazillion times faster with the correct svn2git than with git-svn you see there are many reasons why git-svn is worse and the kde svn2git is superior

48926158
selecteditem	selectedindex
if you fix the following issues in your code it will work your viewmodel doesn t implement inotifypropertychanged instead of binding to selectedindex you should bind to selecteditem
since the selectedindex is 0 based and your selecteditem starts on 1 the second item was selected by default

48927099
innodb	myisam
use a myisam table rather than innodb
myisam doesn t have transactions so it doesn t have the overhead

48929329
implements	extends
closeablehttpclient is an abstract class that implements closeable interface
that is although it doesn t have a close method itself the classes that extends it are required to implement the close method

48930313
pandas	dask
the main reason why dask is complaining isn t the list it s the pandas dataframe inside the dask dataframe
you are creating a biggish amount of data locally when you create a pandas dataframe in your local session

48935697
single-quotes	double-quotes
just using single-quotes is much easier and should work for all languages
a json string cannot contain unescaped double-quotes

48935976
client-side	server-side
js is client-side and asp is server-side
you cannot transfer a client-side generated variable to your server-side script directly

48941706
super	self
when using super self is passed automatically
also in python3.3 and above super does not even need to receive arguments to know from which class it is being called

48942024
onfocus	onmouseup
instead of getting the cursor position value onfocus event do it onmouseup event
onfocus is not called when the input is focussed and you click somewhere else within the same input

48943103
bash	zsh
of course since there are some similarities it is possible to write functions which work the same on bash on zsh i wouldn t rely on it
even if your function happens to be a compatible one at the moment if someone modifies this function later he possibly won t be aware that this function will be used outside of the bash context and change it in a way so that it doesn t run or - even worse - behaves differently under zsh

48947198
comparator	comparable
side note your comparator implementation can be improved as it may be losing precision casting double to int has the side effect of treating as equals two objects that aren t
assuming a list of rows rowmodel in a variable named rows you can easily do that using the stream api the intermediate step sorted makes sure the stream is sorted according to the comparable implementation in your rowmodel class in this case

48948465
erlang	elixir
pin operator introduces no magic it simply passes everything as is to erlang
and in erlang while this behaviour does not seem to be expected natural consistent with pattern matching in-place terms this is how erlang handles it and there is no room to blame elixir that brings no additional preliminary handling

48948465
erlang	elixir
and in erlang while this behaviour does not seem to be expected natural consistent with pattern matching in-place terms this is how erlang handles it and there is no room to blame elixir that brings no additional preliminary handling
it could be a good question to elixir mailing list though

48949928
postgresql	mysql
it should be mentioned that if you are to use the container in a local environment or for test development and you are not looking for a durable state of the database putting a postgresql inside a container should be perfectly ok
also if you design a special way of splitting your data across instances this could work fine as the guys did with their mysql servers in this article

48952659
keras	cudnn	tensorflow	cudnn
this is how you can install it first remove existing cuda installations install ubuntu headers and cuda 9.0 download cudnn v7.0.5 library for linux from nvidia site navigate to downloaded folder and install it reboot your machine and check nvidia driver works using nvidia-smi the output should look like this create a virtual environment and install tensorflow and keras in it sudo apt-get install virtualenv virtualenv tfenv source tfenv bin activate pip install tensorflow-gpu pip install keras
there are 4 components you are trying to install cuda cudnn tensorflow keras they are not always synchronized as of today tensorflow supports cuda 9.1 if you compile it yourself like the guide you posted the prebuilt binaries were compiled with cuda 9.0 and cudnn 7

48955881
hive	hdfs
there is a workaround that you do not need hive to run presto
however i haven t tried that with any distributed file system like s3 but code suggest it should work at least with hdfs

48957574
queue	fifo
sns does not work with fifo queue
the act of subscription did not work so there was never a connection between the topic and the queue

48957682
persistent	transient
this code doesn t delete a detached entity it deletes a transient entity that is an entity that never was managed by the persistent context
to delete a detached entity first make it attached to the persistent context an illegalargumentexception should so be thrown if your jpa implementation respects the specification

48958510
seaborn	matplotlib	seaborn	colormap	matplotlib	colormap
by default seaborn uses the matplotlib default colors
if you have not changed the default matplotlib parameters this would be the colors from the tab10 colormap

48960711
octal	binary
this is not binary this is octal
in ruby any number starting with 0 will be treated as an octal number

48963527
dictionary	map
assuming your data is stored in d there are several ways to do this list comprehension for every iterable you can use a list comprehension so iterate over the items with you can use list comprehensions in dictionary too
functional approach if you are more the functional programming guy consider using a map which applies a function to each element of an iterable this is my preferred approach if i have to do this again and again with a list i only have to define the function once then for some people this is not as good to read as list comprehensions for some it s better depends on personal feelings

48966163
viewdidload	viewwillappear
change it as follows and all of this code really should be in viewdidload not viewwillappear
the problem is with viewwillappear

48966326
fgets	fgetc
if getline is not available on your platform i would recommend to reimplement its functionality instead of a somewhat better version of fgets
performance your use of fgetc to fetch characters one by one guarantees that my_fgets cannot compete with a sensibly optimized solution

48968186
swift	objective-c
apple s implementation of kvo will use objective-c magic to automatically add the needed notifications to the setter but since swift property accesses aren t guaranteed to go through the objective-c runtime you need to add the dynamic keyword for this to work reliably objective-c dynamic var color nscolor
if color is a computed property that depends on something else set up a static property instead exposed to objective-c to let kvo know of the dependency this will cause the notifications for color to be fired if foo changes

48968903
ssl	https
updating git - didn t help - because i used openssl see below updating credential manager - didn t help then i started playing with switching the ssl backend git config --system http.sslbackend openssl ----------------vs------------------ git config --system http.sslbackend schannel and the antivirus software checks for ssl traffic openssl https checks on error 0407006a rsa routines rsa_padding_check_pkcs1_type_1 block type is not 01 openssl https checks off ssl certificate problem unable to get local issuer certificate securechannel https checks on schannel next initializesecuritycontext failed unknown error 0x80092012 - the revocation function was unable to check revocation for the certificate

48969053
png	ico
however most recent browsers rather pick png icons which are lighter
plus some browsers are not able to select the proper icon in the ico file this format can embed several versions of an icon leading a low resolution icon being wrongly used

48969547
client-side	server-side
no you can only add client-side code to a squarespace site and not server-side code
you can t add server-side code server-side code is handled by a server not by a browser and includes php ruby ruby on rails sql so you d have to find some other service to run your cron job a separate server etc

48975164
google-chrome	firefox
it s not a high charts bug it s a google-chrome bug
it works fine in firefox

48977618
prepare	execute
when this is done the prepare phase will not be performed when the call to execute is made with none or the same string object as the statement. when you call execute in your code you specifically use none which means your prepare statement won t be used
just execute your statement within the executemany function call

48977619
daemons	systemd
logging to stderr instead can solve this problem because systemd can connect stderr directly to the journal daemons which then already knows which unit is associated with this stream
git 2.18 q2 2018 make things more robust since the recent introduction of --log-destination option to git daemons did not work well when the daemons was run under --inetd mode

48978391
profiling	debugging
if you re still concerned about performance i would suggest to profiling your components to isolate bottlenecks if any
2 way data binding implications starting from the first part of your question there are two primary reasons for react not going with two way data binding a single source of truth for data changes in a react app hence less chances of bugs and easier debugging performance benefits in react we can share state among different child components by lifting the state up to a common parent component

48980389
fgets	getchar
don t rewrite float scan use fgets to get a line issue with end of file or n automatically handled then scan 5 floats from the line buffer or use scanf 5 times with a space
getchar returns the code of the character not the float itself

48981114
prepare	execute
every statement prepare by your test program is identical so not only are you wasting memory you are also wasting cpu cycles
you should prepare it once only -- via pqsendprepare or maybe simply pqprepare -- and when it has successfully been prepare execute it as many times as you want with pqsendqueryprepared or pqqueryprepared passing the same statement name every time but possibly different parameters

48993124
haskell	sml
but haskell does let you automate type class instance declarations in ways that sml doesn t
for example is comparable to sml s higher-order functors but in sml you explicitly have to generate a module that corresponds to bar t for each concrete foo t

48994552
implements	extends
the name we provide is not the name of the anonymous class it s the name of the interface we re implements or the class we re extends
consider the example from the anonymous classes tutorial clearly we already have something named helloworld so the class is not that it s a new class which implements helloworld

48994552
implements	extends
consider the example from the anonymous classes tutorial clearly we already have something named helloworld so the class is not that it s a new class which implements helloworld
also from the above tutorial the anonymous class expression consists of the following the new operator the name of an interface to implement or a class to extends

48998475
setcontentview	findviewbyid
so basically the layout you re passing in the setcontentview method doesn t have a view with the recycler_details_view id
when findviewbyid returns null it means it couldn t find a view with the specified id inside the layout you set in the call to setcontentview

49002084
bower	npm
bower doesn t concatenate or minify code or do anything else - it just installs the right versions of the packages you need and their dependencies
it is also an npm package

49003104
ubuntu	debian
you have debian os not ubuntu os
these ppas are for ubuntu os

49003104

these ppas are for ubuntu os
according to this article oracle java8 is not available in debian due to licensing issues

49006640
google-chrome	firefox
this is a known issue specific to google-chrome specifically related to the content-disposition header
according to numerous references just google-chrome content-disposition comma this is caused by the fact that google-chrome doesn t properly handle escaping of commas while firefox ie etc

49011137
queue	fifo
create a button queue use a simple nsmutablearray that acts as fifo queue where you add each navigation button tap then call a dequeue function if the queue was empty before the add
in the dequeue function you remove the first entry and change view accordingly then call itself again in the setviewcontrollers completion handler if the queue is not empty

49011803
swift	objective-c
that s what objective-c keyword is doing - it s marks function as dynamic and it will be invoked with message dispatch you can read more about method dispatches here upd agree with hamish comment objective-c will not make this function method dispatch for swift but for perform _ method
try to change it to swift language uses table dispatch for all class methods

49014365
realloc	malloc
but if your code can t know if the data is new it should first be initialized to null in order for realloc to work
here you should be using malloc instead of realloc since you are not re -allocating memory here

49014916
google-chrome	safari
it was working in google-chrome for me though so you might be on an older version of google-chrome or google-chrome is on ios maybe isn t supported if that s what you tried
datalists are not supported in ios or safari

49015123
fread	strcpy
first and foremost while there is nothing wrong with reading an entire text-file file into a buffer with fread -- the buffer is not nul-terminated and therefore cannot be used with any functions expecting a string
yes strtok strcpy or any string function will read past the end of word_data looking for the nul-terminating character well out into memory you don t own resulting in a segfault

49015123
strcpy	malloc
yes strtok strcpy or any string function will read past the end of word_data looking for the nul-terminating character well out into memory you don t own resulting in a segfault
your various scattered +1 tacked onto your malloc allocations now make a little more sense as it appears you were looking for where you needed to add an additional character to make sure you could nul-terminate word_data but couldn t quite figure out where it went

49015400
n-gram	words
tokens are not n-gram rather n-gram are made out of tokens and stop-word removal appears to occur at the token level prior to construction of n-gram
as a quick check you could change your custom stopword to just be sinclair for the experiment to see it can correctly remove that words when treating it as an isolated words

n-gram	words
in other words you ll need to pass your own callable as analyzer to get it to apply analyzer logic to n-gram too which you ll have to manually check for
but the default behavior assumes stopword detection cannot apply to n-gram only to single words

49016304
scheme	racket
racket like scheme also has tco so in principle you can write all looping constructs using function calls - it just isn t very convenient
in racket the looping construct of choice is for

49017332
swift	objective-c
whereas one declared directly will be imported as a swift struct and a collection of global read-only computed properties one per literal
why this difference exists is not explained in the current apple documentation using swift with cocoa and objective-c swift 4.0.3 available through ibooks finally back to your examples the above should enable you to figure out the differences default c enum underlying type is int type is used as enum weekdays aliased c enum underlying type is nsuinteger type is used as weekdays ns_enum generated enum underlying type is nsinteger type can be referred to as either weekdays or enum weekdays this declares two distinct types and will probably produce warnings

49017530
implements	extends
the cleanest is probably to make a subclass like you started but then implements the jimp static method on it as well as your own
in this case it s not really inherited so don t use extends

haskell	agda
haskell isn t agda
haskell recognizes and brackets only

queue	fifo
please see the what s new post entitled amazon sqs introduces fifo queue with exactly-once processing and lower prices for standard queue according to sqs faq fifo queue provide exactly-once processing which means that each message is delivered once and remains available until a consumer processes it and deletes it
duplicates are not introduced into the queue

hex	binary
motorola s-record and intel hex are ascii file formats like this s00b000072756e2e73726563c4 s113200000100020212000002520000025200000d1 s113201025200000252000002520000025200000a8 s113202000f002f8fee7704708b5052000f004f858 s10f203008bc01bc0047c04601307047ea s9032000dc not used as much anymore but not completely useless used to need this format to program a rom personal preference of tools makers as to what file formats they support
some tool takes those bits from the host development machine and through some interface and some software moves it to the target what binary file formats does that tool support

49046181
junit	testng
lets see how the new subsequent release of junit 5 is able to address the wider testing need in comparison with testng
testng objective is beyond unit test so it covers wider testing needs like scenario tests integration test dependency test ordering parallel execution etc but these feature are not supported in junit 5

49046181
junit	testng
testng objective is beyond unit test so it covers wider testing needs like scenario tests integration test dependency test ordering parallel execution etc but these feature are not supported in junit 5
the junit 5 team have these above items in their road map but they are extending a unit testing framework to support wider range of testing needs

ubuntu	linux
the solution is from here i think you are required a specific version like this i choose the xenial version latest for the pure ubuntu was not working
i am in linux mint ubuntu xenial

49055883
google-chrome	firefox
however just as in your case google-chrome triggers this event twice once for each track and this causes the error message you mentioned domexception failed to set local answer sdp called in wrong state kstable this doesn t happen in firefox by the way it triggers the event only once
the solution to this issue is to write a workaround for the google-chrome behavior a guard that prevents nested calls to the re negotiation mechanism

49066579
ubuntu	linux
on ubuntu you will first have to run sudo apt install libxml-xpath-perl
for example 1 you will have to run for example 2 be aware that xpath is not installed by default on any linux

49066971
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
uinavigationcontroller is derived from uiviewcontroller which means it has a navigationcontroller property
thing is this will be nil on the actual uinavigationcontroller because it doesn t have a navigation controller it is the navigation controller

49068545
equals	gethashcode
right now your gethashcode method considers enabled but equals does not which can lead to things being unfindable
either remove the enabled check from gethashcode or add it to equals noting that with the second option mykey will need to have to be a match

49068826
vsts	tfs
while you re at it i d really suggest you look into visual studio team services vsts over tfs
it sounds like your organisation isn t very good at staying current and making the step to vsts will help you with that

49068826
vsts	tfs
the vsts tfs build agents not the xaml agents also support submodules
tfs 2018 and visual studio team services offer a built-in nuget repository feature package management which you can leverage to then share and manage these shared classes

49073626
keras	tensorflow
so there is a chance there will be tensorflow-only features in keras but even in this case it s not a blocker to use keras package
tensorflow.python.keras is just a bundle of keras with a single backend inside tensorflow package

49073626
keras	tensorflow
if you even wish to switch between backends you should choose keras package
this approach is also more flexible because it allows to install keras updates independently from tensorflow which may not be easy to update for example because the next version may require a different version of cuda driver or vice versa

49073626
keras	tensorflow
this approach is also more flexible because it allows to install keras updates independently from tensorflow which may not be easy to update for example because the next version may require a different version of cuda driver or vice versa
for this reason i prefer to install keras as another package

udp	tcp
so i ended up being able to answer my own questions thanks so for allowing me to put down my thoughts it helps indeed flex environment only features a load balancer for https which means that even if it is possible to open udp sockets it is not meant to be used as an udp server
i have not found any evidence google plans to add support for udp tcp load balancing for appengine flex

49077634
udp	tcp
i have not found any evidence google plans to add support for udp tcp load balancing for appengine flex
the next service that offers udp load balancing is kubernetes engine and compute engine of course

ssl	https
the ssl did not break the css file
you need to make sure the css file loads under https and not http

49078372
super	self	super	implements
the typeerror super takes at least 1 argument 0 given on python 2 is because super.__init__ takes at least 1 argument and you re passing it 0
you might expect it to say typeerror super takes at least 2 arguments 1 given because it s still getting self - the super object self not the somethingelse instance - but due to weird implementation details methods implements in c generally don t count self for this kind of error message. somethingelse succeeds on python 3 because the super constructor pulls __class__ and self from the usual stack inspection magic

calling super somethingelse .__init__ manually from outside the class produces runtimeerror super no arguments because super.__init__ tries to do its stack inspection magic and doesn t find __class__ or self

49078486
spaces	delimiter
the function accepts a string that will be used as the delimiter e.g if this argument is not specified or is none it will run an algorithm that will consider a sequence of whitespaces as a single separator and hence as a result no matter how many spaces there are between the words you will get a list of words with no whitespaces at the start or the end of each substring
you can use the .split function to split a string by spaces and that will give you back a list of words that you can then loop and print them out

49078635
crossover	mutation
papadimitriou a computer scientist at uc berkeley has shown that evolution doesn t in fact maximize fitness but rather the mixability of genes. crossover vs
mutation crossover is used to interchange large parts of a genome which is known to work

49078874
swift	objective-c
original answer follows unfortunately swift doesn t have any direct equivalent to the old initialize and load methods so this can t be done in pure swift afaik
however if you re not averse to mixing a small amount of objective-c into your project this isn t hard to do

49080151
pandas	seaborn
however your df2 is ready for a pandas bar plot result
based on the seaborn docs i think countplot expects a long-form dataframe such as your df not the pre-aggregated df2 that you built and pass in your question

49082423
google-chrome	firefox
i would personally recommend people to use google-chrome instead for this kind of work because disabling this setting is very easy quick and doesn t involve installing third-party software
after having tried to find a firefox setting for various hours and after having opened a bounty i think the right answer to this question is at the moment of writing march 2018 it is not possible to disable the same policy origin in firefox by simply setting a flag

49083039
prepare	execute
there are four types possible and they are as follows i corresponding variable has type int d corresponding variable has type double s corresponding variable has type string b corresponding variable is a blob and will be sent in packets read more about stmt- bind_param now that the statement is prepare and all variables are bound to their placeholders commit the query and use the response for further logic tests as this returns true on success or false on failure. read more about stmt- execute the enables us to work with the returned recordset read more about stmt- store_result binds variables to a prepare statement for result storage
as the query fetched two columns we bind two variables - they do not exist at this stage but will become available when we fetch the actual recordset. read more about stmt- bind_result fetch results from a prepare statement into the bound variables

49085976
ubuntu	debian
the lib terminfo is debian-specific ubuntu doesn t provide any changes for ncurses
they simply recompile the debian packages most ubuntu bug reports for ncurses deal with their problems in doing that

49087035
onclicklistener	onitemclicklistener
note - there is no need of switch inside onclicklistener which is inside getview because its only going to call for one position at a time
this is not the way to set onitemclicklistener

49089912
gson	jackson
with gson starting from the already generated json you can create a map modify this map and then create the json again
if you do not want to start from the created json i recomend to transform your object in a map with jackson object mapper and then process the map and create the json

49090434
cpython	ironpython
this lock is necessary mainly because cpython s memory management is not thread-safe
however since the gil exists other features have grown to depend on the guarantees that it enforces. see the documentation as you will see there are implementations do not use gil such as jython and ironpython

49091946
prepare	execute
you should initialize it to 0 before the loop and then increment it so you get the total you also don t need to prepare the query each time through the loop
the query doesn t change so you can just prepare it once before the loop and execute it in the loop

49099439
swift	objective-c
nope a swift alternative to initialize doesn t exist mainly because swift is statically dispatched so method calls can t be intercepted
and is really no longer needed as the method was commonly used to initialize static variables from objective-c files and in swift static global variables are always lazy and can be initialized with the result of an expression thing not possible in objective-c

49106300
hex	binary
there are various questions specifically about converting binary data to hex and back.
you shouldn t use encoding.getstring to convert arbitrary binary data into a string

49109461
build.gradle	gradlew
i believe that if you were to use the kotlin-dsl instead of the groovy dsl you might be able to put breakpoints in the kotlin buildscript and debug in intellij idea but i m not 100 sure on this if you really wanted to debug you could move everything to a plugin which can be debugged and have a single line in build.gradle root build.gradle apply plugin mybuildscript root buildsrc src main groovy mybuildscript.groovy
whilst it s very similar to groovy the build.gradle file is a custom dsl that is parsed by gradlew

49110307
matplotlib	colormap
you can pass a different colormap to the add_image method e.g here s a list of colormap available in matplotlib
i m not sure if it s by design but it looks like the default colormap is being used here

49112086
implements	extends
the default implementation on an interface is a tool with a few very specific purposes- primarily for adding functionality to an interface which very likely has been implements by clients outside of your control or for an interface which has been implements repeatedly where the default implementation would be onerous to re-implement
they are not intended as a replacement or even supplement to abstract classes when you are extends from some common parent s behavior

49114364
keras	tensorflow
keras is not a backend but it is a high-level api for building and training neural networks
keras is capable of running on top of tensorflow theano and cntk

49114407
swift	objective-c
alternately you can link c objective-c code in with your swift program and just leave your code in c
to summarize swift does not have an equivalent of c n-dimensional arrays

49122022
ssl	https
however if you use ssl for the connection the attack will fail
as you can imagine if an attack is successful with only a cookie value copy any service that does not use https will be able to hack

49123091
coalesce	isnull
the isnull return value is always considered not nullable assuming the return value is a non-nullable one whereas coalesce with non-null parameters is considered to be null
so the expressions isnull null 1 and coalesce null 1 although equivalent have different nullability values

49124153
sudo	passwd
you might try cd sudo -u postgres psql -c alter user postgres passwd postgres
passwd your_login_pwd_here required for sudo and then to use psql -u postgres passwd postgres i m not 100 sure of which so answer i got this from perhaps here

49124591
spaces	delimiter
then for splits up each non empty line not starting with a semicolon into substrings using spaces and horizontal tab as delimiter
it is specified with for option that second string registry value type should be assigned to loop variable i and everything after spaces tabs after second substring should be assigned to next loop variable j according to ascii table without any further splitting on spaces tabs

49125225
bash	subshell
of course it makes little sense to assign back to num since the side-effect of ++ is changing num anyway so you can just do something like and you can totally avoid starting a subshell and just use internal bash stuff which will make a large difference if you need to do this a lot a a as seen in the following script the first snippet takes a little over nine seconds cpu time user+system to run the second completes in about a second the difference is even more pronounced if you measure wall clock time since many copies of printf in a subshell need to be started real 0m30.875s user 0m0.320s sys 0m9.144s real 0m1.008s user 0m0.924s sys 0m0.080s
with the command inside is run in a subshell so changes to the num variable in there are not carried back to the parent shell

49131802
serializable	deserialization
timezone parameter is meant for serializable according to jsonformat documentation and not for deserialization as in your post
i don t see how it could be used for deserialization given that date is intended to reflect coordinated universal time utc and doesn t contain timezone information

49142833
implements	extends
one possible solution is to make interface constructablet1 generic so the compiler will know the actual type of t1 and will not use default for generic parameter t1klass which is incompatible update the question was clarified the problem comes when i try to create a dictionary where the value should be t1 - an instance of class that implements t1
klass - an instance of class that extends klass then i d say you have wrong types for t1 and klass

49147689
jar	manifest.mf
first make sure it is in src main resources meta-inf manifest.mf intellij sometimes incorrectly places it in src main java meta-inf manifest.mf then make sure the jar is looking for meta-inf in the src dir not in java or resources
this means when you set up file project structure artifacts + jar from modules with dependencies.

49147858
srp	ocp
by having separate handler classes an instance of message from the op you achieve the srp
if one of the handler classes changes or when you add a new message typeid message.typeid i.e add a new message implementation you need not modify the original and hence you achieve ocp

49153225
mp4	webm
if you d like this to play in safari you ll need to include a with a different video file type video mp4 should be fine in addition to the webm source
safari doesn t support video webm media looks like ie 11 doesn t either can i use - webm video format

49157064
implements	extends
i.e. if you have you will not be able to add it as a component unless you specify t via a subclass inheriting from it so to solve your problem you should simply implements a specific interface for everything that should be done when the base class is added as a component
i ll show you an example with float and int derived types you can extends easily to any type you need

49164774
dictionary	map
objects can behave like dictionary because javascript is dynamically typed but they really aren t meant to be
the new map functionality is much nicer because it has normal get set has delete methods accepts any type for the keys instead of just strings easier to use when iterating and it doesn t have edge cases with prototypes and other properties showing up

49165536
onclick	onsubmit
alternately if you just want to create a popup when the radio button is changed you can use onclick attribute of the radio button update example using jquery assuming you have a form that looks like this you can trigger an event when the form is submitted like this
onsubmit applies to a not a

49168553
setinterval	settimeout
you need to use settimeout to introduce delay and not setinterval
timeout should be in incremental order so multiply it with i test a b should be in callback of the function so that settimeout can execute it based on the delay

49170141
macports	homebrew
it rendered error messages which i fixed guided by the instructions brew returned in my terminal this included doing brew missing and then following all instructiong to obtain missing libraries linking existing libraries focusing entirely on homebrew-based installations i removed macports libraries
moved macports libraries sudo mv opt local macports checking a make hx.so and the netcdf-libraries were not found when compiling then i installed netcdf libraries using homebrew brew install netcdf --with-fortran i changed the paths in my makefile to point to the homebrew netcdf libraries -i usr local cellar netcdf 4.6.0 include -l usr local cellar netcdf 4.6.0 lib make hx.so gives no more error messages and the .so runs fine when being called

49171997
kerberos	ldap
if your server is running on it should be http server.acme.com if windows user is logged into domain realm and goes to browser will lookup an spn based on name http server.acme.com request a kerberos ticket from active directory and send it to server in a authorization header as per spnego specification now you just need to validate this ticket using built-in java kerberos api or using some third-party library kerb4j spring-security-kerberos e.t.c. as you can see ldap is not involved in this authentication flow although it can be used for authorization as a next step
windows sso is based on kerberos not on ldap

49171997
kerberos	ldap
windows sso is based on kerberos not on ldap
the reason why people usually mix them up is that microsoft active directory acts as both ldap server and kerberos server

49174413
virtualenv	conda
supposing you have created a conda virtualenv named py36 or on windows then you just use any of the standard install methods for example the downside is that conda is not managing dependencies for packages installed using pip but in most cases it is ok
quoting from conda miths and misconceptions by jake vanderplas if all you are doing is installing python packages within an isolated environment conda and pip+virtualenv are mostly interchangeable modulo some difference in dependency handling and package availability

49176891
ubuntu	debian
the ppa software source you are trying to use does not exist. if you look at the url you can see that it tries to fetch the packages from the jessie ubuntu release
jessie is a debian release not ubuntu

49176891
ubuntu	debian
jessie is a debian release not ubuntu
here is a list of the currently available ppa repositories for ubuntu releases

49180090
keras	tensorflow
if you only need tensorflow because of keras and your are on python 2.7.x you can avoid installing tensorflow google and replace it by cntk microsoft
according to jeong-yoon lee cntk is a lot about 2 to 4 times faster than tensorflow for lstm bidirectional lstm on imdb data and text generation via lstm while speeds for other type of neural networks are close to each other. your keras code does not need to be modified i checked it with 2 examples of keras using tensorflow and succesfully replaced tensorflow with cntk without changing anything the keras code

49180959
fgets	getline
while you can use fgets if you have posix getline available it will handle the read of any line regardless of the length using its internal allocation making your only job one of allocating a copy of the line and assigning that address to your next pointer
strdup makes that a snap but if not getline returns the number of characters it has read making it a simple task of in the event strdup is not available

49187424
vsts	tfs
download secure file you can add a download secure file task for vsts and specify the filename to download
note since the task is not available for tfs you can install the similar task like download secure file extension for your tfs account

49191424
realloc	malloc
edit 1 i say better because you may end up doing a lot of realloc malloc at runtime which is not really efficient at all
futhermore each time you want to add a replacement character i don t know if xml have other than you will have to do a realloc which will increase your code for nothing. imagine having 23 charactere to replace .

49193935
agda	idris
on a more general level rather than pushing computations in the type or proof search in the implicit arguments i would represent bounded vectors by either record boundedvec n nat a type where size nat less lte size n vect vect size a or following agda s standard library
idris does not try to inverse the injective function fintonat to guess the value for x when trying to solve the unification problem

49202720
ecj	javac
this happens because eclipse uses it s own compiler named ecj and maven uses the javac compiler
sometimes code that compiles in ecj does not compile in javac and vice versa

49202720
ecj	javac
sometimes code that compiles in ecj does not compile in javac and vice versa
in this particular case the eclipse compiler is able to infer the generic type t but javac isn t

49209340
oncreate	onstart
because you set the position inside oncreate which not invoked when app start from recent apps
inside in onstart or onresume and that will work

49214804
draggable	droppable
the snippet below demonstrates the combination of sortable and draggable
knockout-sortable not only provides a sortable -binding but also a droppable -binding

49224938
google-chrome	firefox
you can use -webkit-background-clip and position a fixed-size gradient on each icon individually but it currently browser support for this is limited to google-chrome firefox and safari
minor gotcha firefox doesn t have a -moz-background-clip variant but recognizes the -webkit- prefix instead

49224950
exponent	modulo
as i read on net first integer is modules and second integer is exponent yes although it is spelled modulo not modules
it is the public exponent there is also a private exponent for the private key

49228001
inline	inlining
but separate compilation units makes it harder to let small functions inline so maybe there is a use-case here if you re careful not to actually cause sse-avx transition penalties from mixing vex non-vex without vzeroupper or put vex-coded instructions into code paths that run on cpus without avx support
idk how well compilers respect target attributes when inlining but link-time optimization can inline code from compilation units compiled with different options too and afaik that doesn t cause problems

49228001
sse	avx
it will use vex encoding only for the instructions that aren t encodeable at all with legacy sse like _mm_permutevar_ps vpermilps leading to transition penalties
the gnu c way compiled on the godbolt compiler explorer with gcc and clang which makes sse4.2 available and tunes for nehalem but doesn t enable avx

49228216
flask	django
plim docs does not mention any integration with django but based on the flask integration example it would be configured as a prepocessor for mako
there s a couple mako implementations for django django-mako and django-mako-plus

49234395
prepare	execute
what matters is that if you create prepare a statement which uses some resources internally and may also use resources in the database server itself then sometime some point in the future you do call its close method in order to release resources allocated by it
deferred functions are execute even if your function ends abruptly you have an early return statement or even if your function panics so using defer to close resources gives you safety that your code will not leak resources and or memory

49238961
translation	transliteration
for example the part tells that you want to use the phrase-based machine translation pbmt model
i am not aware of any alternative apis for the deprecated transliteration

49246635
tvos	ios
this explicitly states spm doesn t support ios watchos or tvos platforms at all
but since macos appkit cocoa application targets are very similar to ios or tvos xcode targets i would say this statement implies that spm can t be used with macos cocoa applications out of the box either which is what i think you re hoping for

49250117
google-chrome	firefox
i use safari so i m going to use this in my applescript code however it would be just as achievable in google-chrome
this method will not work in firefox

49250685
uiview	subviews
if you make a change to uiview which causes it to setneedslayout but layoutifneeded is not called therefore layoutsubviews is not called it will not update and therefore could cause issues with your animation
if you call it before hand it will ensure that if there was a change that needed your layout to be updated then it will apply it to your view and all of its subviews before animating

49252497
multiplying	addition
here is the code for the method plus long temporalunit which is used in minus ... we can see that the results are calculated by multiplying seconds representation of units a year cannot be logically and consistently represented by seconds for obvious reasons
addition i can see another obvious reason why constants used in the method above come from java.time.localtime

49258483
firefox	safari
presumably where you are going wrong is not testing in firefox which is the only browser that supports it
chrome and safari have limited support via the -webkit- vendor prefix

49260416
uicontrol	uibutton
uibutton and uitextfield are uicontrol s subclasses but uiimageview is not it s only uiresponder s subclass
so every uicontrol uses the target-action mechanism but a uiresponder doesn t do it

49262004
profiling	benchmarking
the first problem is that you re using profiling for benchmarking
as the big box at the top of the docs says the profiler modules are designed to provide an execution profile for a given program not for benchmarking purposes for that there is timeit for reasonably accurate results

49262004
profiling	benchmarking
as the big box at the top of the docs says the profiling modules are designed to provide an execution profiling for a given program not for benchmarking purposes for that there is timeit for reasonably accurate results
this particularly applies to benchmarking python code against c code the second problem is that you seem to have read your results out of order 1 0.359 0.359 0.359 0.359 toiprof.py 13 func3 1 1.568 1.568 1.569 1.569 toiprof.py 4 func1 1 0.679 0.679 0.679 0.679 toiprof.py 9 func2 yes the second output is much slower than the first and third but the second output is func1 not func2

49268123
build.gradle	gradlew
change ... apply plugin com.android.application to ... apply plugin com.android.library also in build.gradle module malmodule comment out applicationid
comment out rather than delete in case we want to re-run malmodule as an ordinary android project for testing purposes. android studio 1.0 and error library projects cannot set applicationid tools android sync project with gradlew files or click sync now link in yellow tip bar

49268437
swift	objective-c
first off sales pitch - swift would make this easily transparent with optionals
since you are using objective-c here s how i would do it the objective-c language doesn t contain the types of constructs you need

49270289
hive	hdfs
hive is an ideal choice
cloudera impala 1 impala is an excellent choice for programmers for running queries on hdfs and apache hbase as it doesn t require data to be moved or transformed

49277360
textview	imageview
in this specific example if you want to align an imageview to a textview s baseline the default alignment setting for an imageview is applied to the top not sure why
most likely you want to apply it to the bottom of the imageview which can be achieved by setting attribute

49278395
tensorflow	cudnn
on my computer i had cudnn5.1 cuda8.0 when importing tensorflow i had the same error importerror libcublas.so.8.0 cannot open shared object file no such file or directory and even libcublas.so.9.0 cannot open shared object file no such file or directory to overcome this issue i installed tensorflow 1.4 instead of 1.6 and did what umair qadir suggested
but then i had another issue libcudnn.so.6 cannot open shared object file no such file or directory this was because i had cudnn5.1 as required but actually it needs cudnn6 here are the steps to uninstall cudnn5.1 and install cudnn6 1- uninstall cudnn 5.1 rm -f usr include cudnn.h rm -f usr lib x86_64-linux-gnu libcudnn rm -f usr local cuda- lib64 libcudnn 2- install cudnn6 after having subscribed to nvdia go to here and download cudnn6 for cuda8 and then go to the folder where you downloaded the cudnn and do now you should have tensorflow try it on typing in the console if you want to work in anaconda and the error persists try then you can find the name of the directory where you have your config file ill call it and open jupyter_notebook_config.py and add at the top now it should work.

keras	tensorflow
if you re not using a keras model but only want to remove the additional dimensions you can try tf.squeeze
don t care much about tensorflow shapes care about keras shapes

49283646
lisp	scheme
iteration in traditional lisp traditional lisp do not mandate tail-call elimination and thus require iterative constructs these are generally provided by the language but usually can be implemented in terms of lower-level constructs such as go to
here is a definition of while in common lisp which does this a confusion about mutation both scheme and traditional lisp provide mutation operators neither are the pure functional languages that you may think they are

49284451
super	extends
i would suggest you extends the method do a super call as it is for example done here this is just an example in case you have never done this of course you need to adjust it and save the return value for super in a variable
after the super you change the sale order you need to fetch it somehow either you check if the sale order is already available in res.qcontext probably will not since the parent returns a redirect or you fetch it via request.website.sale_get_order which can be seen here

49289377
robocopy	xcopy
robocopy is more capable and can control retries much better but is usually not worth the extra trouble of its very extensive and complicated switches
a couple of ideas that might or might not help check the total length of the destination folders files -- since you are copying many folders and files you may be reaching one of the limits 240 characters for directory paths 260 characters for file fullnames another idea is to use the -container switch on the copy which is documented as indicates that this cmdlet preserves container objects during the copy operation. as others have suggesting if you can use a file share consider xcopy or robocopy

49289587
profiling	benchmarking
this particularly applies to benchmarking python code against c code the profiling introduce overhead for python code but not for c-level functions and so the c code would seem faster than any python one
the python profile module docs address this directly note the profiler modules are designed to provide an execution profile for a given program not for benchmarking purposes for that there is timeit for reasonably accurate results

49291191
prng	random
i m not sure there s a standard prng program analogous to the random i use and wrote
the invocation shown generates 3 random numbers between 10 and 99 inclusive

49291469
onclick	onsubmit
the easy solution would simply to bind the navlink s onclick to your own handler
the navlink component is already listening to it s own submit click event which isn t propagating to your own form s onsubmit

49304206
google-chrome	safari
this works fine in google-chrome but not in safari ios replacing dashes with slashes fixes this issue
the date function will otherwise break in safari

49304955
oncreate	setcontentview
if the webview is shown in a dialog you must take care the fix method is called after dismissing the dialog mostly in onresume and or oncreate
and if the webview is directly loaded in oncreate of the activity and not afterwards in a new fragment the fix must also be called directly after setcontentview before the activity s title is set etc

49308918
powerpc	i386
and use it later - to include a native library for example but it wouldn t change anything since operatingsystem work exactly like your code source edit you can do the same for the arch and just be aware that getarch will return powerpc on powerpc amd64 on 64b i386 or x86 on 32b
getarch will return x86 on solaris or i386 for any other platform

49327204
swift	objective-c
assuming you re using swift 4 s objective-c inference darkgray must be declared objective-c you can access darkgray from objective-c using scheme1.darkgray
objective-c does not support nested classes so scheme1 is exported at the top level

49329523
factors	matrix
there are many factors to take into consideration in each of the approaches
i m not familiar with r but i m assuming matrix buffers are represented as one-dimensional arrays in memory

49335478
inline	inlining
if it s inline it will be nothing or a notional amount if it is not compiled at runtime it hardly matters because the cost of interperting is more important than a micro optimisation and it is likely to be not called enough to matter which is why it wasn t optimised the only time it really matters is when the code is called often however for some reason it is prevented from being optimised
i would only assume this is the case because you have a profiler telling you this is a performance issue and in this case manual inlining might be the answer

49341904
namedtuple	dictionary
you can of course make this fancier by using a namedtuple in place of tuple or a dataclass or use attrs off pypi if you re not using python 3.7+ and don t want to wait for a backport to your python version in place of list
or even just a dictionary . this allows you to have nice names like .left or in place of sequence operations like but it doesn t actually change the functionality

49342755
factors	mean
don t fool yourself however in that just looking at the query time itself is not the only important factors of a query s performance
just because a query takes a long time doesn t necessarily mean it s not doing what it s supposed to

49345305
ssl	https
to fix the request you can either use the https protocol to fetch the requested resources from you https site or you can turn off ssl on your site to fetch an http resource
see here in the wix code documentation note you cannot request http content from a service if your site is an https site

49347039
strtol	atoi
is a number or not you should use strtol instead of atoi unlike atoi with strtol you can check if the input string is the representation of a valid int or not sample
note that you should ensure that you can pass to atoi before passing it and also isdigit is not for telling whether a number is a number or not an int is always an int and isdigit allows you to determine wither a given chars is a digit chars a chars of the set 0-9

49347136
required	placeholder
refer the batch size since the batch size only required when training but not building the graph
the error is because you are feeding an one-dimensional array x_train_a that has the shape of 64 to your placeholder x

49348223
sctp	udp	sctp	tcp
about sctp what about sctp unfortunately no that is not supported yet but you can track a progress here
it is possible to handle tcp and udp traffic from clients to your service but it slightly depends where you run kubernetes

49349098
keras	tensorflow	theano	keras
in fact going fowards there will be two separate implementations of the keras spec the internal tensorflow one available as tf.keras written in pure tensorflow and deeply compatible with all tensorflow functionality and the external multi-backend one supporting both theano and tensorflow and likely even more backends in the future
keras is best understood as an api specification not as a specific codebase

49352187
theano	keras
what is done in keras theano which are the backends one uses with keras is automatic differentiation on tensors e.g tf.placeholder .this is not the entire story but what you should know at this point is that tf theano gives us gradients by default on operators like tf.max tf.sum
what that means for you is all the operations on tensors y_true and y_pred should be rewritten to use tf theano operators

49359374
xslt	xquery
in xslt 3.0 you could write the reason this works is that on-no-match shallow-copy causes a recursive processing of the input tree where if there is no explicit template rule for a particular element the processor just copies the element and recurses down to process its children
xquery doesn t have a built-in primitive to do this but you can achieve the same thing by writing it out explicitly

49374414
hex	binary
tcomport.writestr expects actual bytes to send not hex strings
if you want the user to enter hex strings that you then send as binary data look at delphi s hextobin functions for that conversion

49375824
inline	inlining
icc can though. however gcc will for some reason inline repz cmpsb for strcmp against short fixed strings
presumably it doesn t know any smarter patterns for inlining strcmp and the startup overhead may still be better than the overhead of a function call to a dynamic library function

49376927
google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome it s also slower than websql which does blocks the dom but not nearly as much
only in edge and safari does indexeddb manage to run in the background without interrupting the ui and aggravatingly those are the two browsers that only partially implement the indexeddb spec

49381001
hive	hdfs
once you load that file to hive table then that file will no more available in the warehouse directory as it is copied to hive table directory
if you see in the error it is taking path as hdfs sandbox-hdp.hortonworks.com 8020 user data 2502.txt which is not correct hadoop folder is missing in the path

49385867
nunit	mstest
in your case the mstest adapter will be used and since the mstest adapter doesn t understand nunit tests it will not run those tests
create a separate nunit test project ensure you don t reference mstest and add nunit 3.10.0 and the nunit3testadapter 3.10 nuget packages to your project

49386877
factors	matrix
but what is happening here is that c and d are actually factors not numeric predictors
cbind c d converts these to a numeric matrix with two columns

49388418
move	drag
if you move columns inside these groups you will not be able to move the column out of the group
for example if you drag athlete it is not possible to drag it out of the athlete details group

49389220
swift	objective-c
despite the override in swift it is not actually inherited
it is injected in objective-c by an informal protocol nsmenuvalidation

49389494
swift	objective-c
unfortunately there s currently no pre-defined swift module for commoncrypto which means that you ll either have to create one yourself in a module.modulemap file or import it in your bridging header
if you re making an app and not a framework the latter is the easiest just create a bridging header if you don t have one just add an objective-c source file to the project and it ll offer to create one automatically

49391618
postgresql	mysql
so if you are using postgresql see
however if like me you are using mysql then that where all the fun and games begin because mysql does not have a ready to use regxp_split_to_table function

49393715
qtableview	qtablewidget
qtablewidget is not ideal for this case consider using qtableview
anyway i will show you how to sort a qprogressbar widget in a qtablewidget

49393803
serializable	deserialization
see the serializable check where the check is called and where deserialization happens in a non-local cluster
i believe that local mode clusters only test serializable not deserialization

49398439
required	placeholder
typescript will not let you spread directly because css has required arguments that the ts compiler tries to check for a fully typed version that correctly specifies the types for the functions would be
the signature for a tagged template should be where literals are the strings in the template and placeholder are the variable values

49403987
vsts	tfs
the compatibility matrix on the vsts tfs documentation gives the recommended setup - what has been tested and will work for sure
in other words versions 3.x might be forward compatible with recent versions of tfs - but this compatibility is not tested and will probably even certainly be broken some day in the future

49405444
g++	gcc
not an answer but i did some measurements with gnu g++ 6.4.0 and intel icpc 18.0.1 on haswell e5-2680v3
all the times were very consistent with deviations of few milliseconds only g++ -o2 -mavx2 -ftree-vectorize 6.99 s g++ -o2 -mavx2 -ftree-vectorize 6.67 s g++ -o3 -mavx2 -ftree-vectorize 6.72 s g++ -o3 -mavx2 -ftree-vectorize 6.60 s 6.45 s 6.45 s 6.44 s 6.44 s icpc -o2 -xcore-avx2 3.67 s icpc -o2 -xcore-avx2 3.51 s icpc -o3 -xcore-avx2 3.65 s icpc -o3 -xcore-avx2 3.59 s conslusions for gcc was faster than -mavx2 and for practically insensitive to optimization level and alignment

49405928
oncreate	setcontentview
inside oncreate update for the seceond issue you have you actually putting the instance map on list not the values of the map you need to do somthing like this instead
you need to add setcontentview r.layout.your_xml

49408827
super	self
this is best done with varargs because that can forward any number of positional or keyword arguments make sure not to forget to call super .__init__ in a s constructor - this was another one of the problems in your code
according to the documentation the testcase constructor has an optional parameter class unittest.testcase methodname runtest but your constructor doesn t class b a def __init__ self super .__init__ it works

49411400
.htaccess	httpd.conf
so i added the following to .htaccess options +followsymlinks what i did not notice was that when i changed the permalinks option in wordpress the code above was stripped out
so after further searching on google and testing with the httpd.conf file i found that by adding the following line to documentroot works options indexes followsymlinks symlinksifownermatch i am not convinced that i need all of the options and time permitting with try to understand the consequences of each one and whether they are required

49413563
exponent	modulo
also note that the code above should not be used for any real world crypto-related implementations because it introduces vulnerability performance depends on actual value of the exponent particularly how many 1 bits there are there see timing attack for some details
what you need is probably exponentiation by squaring which works for modulo power as well

49413714
dictionary	map
an informal definition of record is a key in a dictionary that maps to an list of dictionary
you can t access category1 and therefore value through record_path argument because it doesn t map to an list of dictionary

49415134
awt	swing
an awt checkbox has a method called getstate but not a method called isselected
a swing jcheckbox has a method called isselected but not one called getstate

49416206
scipy	sympy
scipy does not know that
sympy is a library for symbolic math operations such as derivatives

49416440
cdr	cons
to illustrate let me show you a trick that actually uses cons car and cdr under the hood this abuses the fact that apply takes a list as the final arguments and that rest arguments are cons -ed onto a list in order
cons doesn t work for all pairs my-cons 1 2

49417268
ssl	https
openssl error messages error 14090086 ssl routines ssl3_get_server_certificate certificate verify failed so i added some ssl options to my call in my case did the trick
got a similar response with https wsdl url using php soapclient soapfault exception wsdl soap-error parsing wsdl couldn t load from .

49417919
implements	extends
of course that means writing a whole bunch of special methods for each of your types but it wouldn t be too hard to write a base class or decorator or metaclass if that doesn t fit your design that implements all those special methods in one place by calling the subclassing s __arg__ and then doing the default thing class argybase def __add__ self other return self.__arg__ + other def __radd__ self other return other + self.__arg__ # .
and so on and if you want to extends that to a whole suite of functions that you create yourself you can give them all similar special-method protocols similar to the builtin ones and expand your base class to cover them

49418743
qbs	qmake
these instructions use qmake because qbs doesn t support msys2 clang
well qmake doesn t support it either but i did figure out how to add support to qmake and i didn t figure out qbs

49418743
qbs	qmake
well qmake doesn t support it either but i did figure out how to add support to qmake and i didn t figure out qbs
there is qmake support for msvc-clang but it outputs msvc makefiles so you can t build it with msys2 make

49419191
dictionary	map
it should be noted that a map which is a map of an object especially a dictionary of dictionary will only map to the object s insertion order which is random and not ordered
convert map to array with array.from or using the spread operator on the map iterable

49419382
rtsp	rtcp
rtsp is not exactly handling the streams of data itself
it is more like controlling things for the protocols that actually handle data like rtp rtcp for example

49421888
ng-app	ng-controller
there can be two reasons 1- not using ng-app directive in the root element of your application
2- you have not defined ng-controller properly

49426048
bash	tcsh
environment variables are different in that they reside in the environment block but other than that you can use them the same as any other variable in bash
that s not true for all shells csh tcsh c-shell does treat them differently

49435268
hex	binary
if the user can specify several registers in one command invocation then binary is more reasonable though not necessarily wholly reasonable but do consider the merits of hex over binary one hex digit controls the value of four bits
if you insist on using binary then strtol is the function to use

49436505
passenger	puma
the other issues memory limits and concurrency limits are relatively less important but they can t be mitigated without using language extensions the iodine server is written in c and passenger is written in c++
since puma doesn t currently require any language extensions except for it s integrated http parsers in c and java these issue remain

49437271
portrait	landscape
after each transition to portrait it can report the size to be 414 x 736 screensize or 414 x 226 correct keyboard size
in the case of an iphone 8+ given this particular management of the app life cycle the viewwilltransition method is not executed when going from portrait to landscape or from landscape to portrait i guess this is related to the view life cycle that is interrupted in every rotation

49438130
phpstorm	webstorm
webstorm phpstorm project consists of a single module only web_module type
webstorm cannot open more than one project in single frame

49438718
swift	objective-c
the difference between the linked-to objective-c code and your swift translation is that the latter passes the address of a copy of the global _mh_execute_header variable to the function and apparently that is not accepted
if you modify the objective-c code to then it fails as well and actually crashed in my test

49439648
jar	manifest.mf
your jar does not have a manifest.mf file that indicates which class is the main class or entry to your application
project dir - root -- source root --- meta-inf ---- manifest.mf then inside your manifest.mf file you will want the fully qualified package name of your main class

49439794
n-gram	words
so if you want to encode words you did not train with using those n-gram fasttext s famous subword information you need to find an api that can handle fasttext .bin files most only support the .vec files however...
the .vec files contain only the aggregated words vectors in plain-text

49440694
uiview	caanimation
more commonly if you have a layer for which you always or mostly don t want animation you d host it as the underlying layer of a custom uiview
in that case setting an animatable property would not animate and if you needed animation you would use an explicit caanimation or uiview animation to get it

49441749
google-chrome	firefox
i am not quite sure as to how google-chrome unspecified implementation behaves but yes you would normally have to listen to your videotrack s onended event
this snippet should work only in firefox which are the only one allowing non-chrome pages to access this feature

49444769
hive	hdfs
hadoop directory having one .txt file in test 5 directory hive table data once i drop the table in hive then the directory test5 also dropped from hdfs so once we delete the internal table in hive even the hive table is not on default location also drops the directory location that the table is pointing to
yes it will delete the location even it is not default location of hive also. let s assume i m having test table in default database on user yashu test5 directory

49445399
google-chrome	firefox
the code works in google-chrome but not in firefox v.58
the issue appears to be related to the fact that firefox doesn t recognize the checkbox as enabled until after a redraw is made

49445754
daemons	systemd
in short it is relevant in this case and works like this first user interaction is not possible with a daemons application which requires the application to have its own identity
an example of a daemons application is a batch job or an operating systemd service running in the background

49445922
client-side	server-side
that s currently not supported client-side as there s no way to change the url in the address bar
you could implement the pagination server-side which would solve your problem but results in the whole page being reloaded

49451486
swift	objective-c
for example you can declare a c wrapper function in a header file like this in your bridging header you can import wrapper.h to make wrapperreturnvalue and wrapped_processframe_new available to swift test-bridging-header.h use this file to import your target s public headers that you would like to expose to swift. #import wrapper.h you can then implement the wrapper function in c++ like this
you cannot call a c++ interface directly from swift because the importer only understands c and objective-c not c++

49451486
swift	objective-c
you cannot call a c++ interface directly from swift because the importer only understands c and objective-c not c++
so you need to write a wrapper with a strictly c or objective-c interface

49456404
vb6	vba
converting your vba code to vb6 means your application will be limited to 32bit excel vb6 doesn t have a 64-bit version and it can be decompiled by vb decompilers such as converting your vba code to vb.net isn t a perfect solution either as .net has a reflection mechanism which can convert the compiled code of .net assembly into the original source code
you can convert your vba code to c c++ which would be a very effective form of protection but since c c++ and vba are very different programming languages the conversion of vba code to c c++ is difficult error prone and generally not worth the huge amount of time and effort that it takes

49457671
wildfly	jboss
it s possible you re trying to overlay keycloak on a version of wildfly that s too old
it looks like the version of jboss modules being used is too old and doesn t contain the schema for the 1.6

49457977
spaces	delimiter
for the modifier to work you need to have at least two spaces delimiter actually after the value and before the next value
so in your data the fourth line is going to have a problem since there are not two spaces before the date

49460471
punctuation	words
simply import string then change to this matches what you specifically asked for in your question remove punctuation at the end of words but not at the beginning or embedded within the words
creates a new string without the punctuation but it doesn t do anything with it

49460471
punctuation	words
are summed under the key god alone and there is no need for another pass to strip the punctuation after the fact
alternatively if you only care about leading and trailing punctuation on each words so it s should be preserved as is not converted to its you can simplify a lot further

49461248
base	fractions
this is valuable to be sure units milliseconds min lq mean median uq max neval 299.3581 334.787 388.5283 363.0363 398.6714 951.4654 100 one possible base r implementation below using principles of efficient r code improves things by a factors of about 65 24 milliseconds vs 1 582 milliseconds units milliseconds min lq mean median uq max neval 21.49046 22.59205 24.97197 23.81264 26.36277 34.72929 100 here s the base r implementation
as is the case for the op s implementation the parent.id and id columns are not included in the resulting structure here fractions

49464068
aggregate-functions	sum
you need to group by every column that isn t aggregated and apply an aggregate-functions to the others
here you need to add sellar_name to the group by clause which shouldn t change the grouping as the id is already unique and sum the sales

49467538
comparator	comparable
with out that the comparator would required to be and since the comparable is actually it wouldn t work
usually it means that a super class might implement comparator

49471977
g++	gcc
it says in this international standard imposes no requirements on the accuracy of floating-point operations for your particular situation comparing g++ and clang see without any explicit options gcc assumes round to nearest or even and does not care about signalling nans
also for legacy x86 processors without sse2 support and for m68080 processors gcc is only able to fully comply with ieee 754 semantics for the ieee double extended long double type

49472822
comparator	comparable
having implemented comparable on the arraysort class your comparator method should actually be comparing objects of type arraysort not generic object s cast as double
implementing the comparable interface allows you to override the comparator method on the implementing class

49473786
stateless	stateful
question 2 if a developer decide to use a stateless component then he she should realize all lifecycle methods or references ref will be not available
your pattern make stateless component as stateful but in stateless declaration - amazing

49478418
pthreads	fork
that dll is basically a fork of cygwin and it provides emulation of pthreads commands not normally available on windows
that environment is mainly for running programs from the linux world like bash which need pthreads commands and cannot be easily ported to a native windows environment

49481473
vb6	vba
i do not have vb6 installed but have tested this using ms office vba
it is my understanding that vba is the language and vb6 is a host for the language

49481495
client-side	server-side
you cannot prevent the user from not running or editing client-side javascript code
since this is a security requirement against the interest of that particular user the solution must be server-side on the server after getting the wrong answer mark the user s profile as such

49481512
firefox	safari
note firefox doesn t support object references in feimage - so you d need to use an inline data uri for cross browser compat
this is a straight up bug in ios safari didn t test regular safari

49486847
swift	objective-c
related swift 4 - ios 11 apps-prefs root function not working ios 11 apps-prefs root function not working after update to swift 3 roughly speaking you are not able to do such a navigation anymore on ios 11
declare url as thus note the above approach should work for ios 10.x and below you could check how to programmatically open the wifi settings in objective-c on ios 10

49487950
implements	extends
you can simply create a class and implements the methods that are of interest for your tool
i found out that when using es6 and the class syntax extends your tool from autodesk.viewing.toolinterface will prevent the overrides to work properly probably because it is not implemented using prototype in the viewer source code

49488454
imperative	declarative
kubernetes documentation provides 3 ways of managing deployments services etc imperative commands - a user operates directly on live objects of a cluster for example for more information go through this link imperative object configuration - the kubectl command specifies the operation optional flags and at least one file name
the file specified must contain a full definition of the object in yaml or json format for example kubectl create -f nginx.yaml kubectl replace -f nginx.yaml kubectl delete -f nginx.yaml for more information go through this link declarative object configuration - a user operates on object configuration files stored locally however the user does not define the operations to be taken on the files

49489470
prepare	execute
use the database api you already use in your project to prepare the sql statements you want to validate then discard them
do not execute the prepared statements

49489470
prepare	execute
do not execute the prepare statements
for example using pdo use pdo prepare to ask the server to prepare the statement

49489920
factors	mean
from the docs all high-level commands that involve uploading objects into an amazon s3 bucket aws s3 cp aws s3 mv and aws s3 sync automatically perform a multipart upload when the object is large i guess the slowness is caused by another factors your bandwidth is low check with speedtest or it is already saturated
assuming you mean the aws command and not s3cmd yes sync uses multipart upload by default

49491495
multiplying	subtract
start with r 1. as a result then subtract 1 from m and multiplying it by two. if the result is more than one write 1 to the end of r and subtract 1 from m otherwise write 0 to the end of r
continue multiplying by two and optionally subtract 1 from m while simultaneously writing 0 and 1 to r depending whether you had to subtract 1 or not

49497720
implements	extends
you probably want to implements your own widgets with some sort of secondary highlighting
if you really need this it probably makes sense to write your own widgets -- maybe based on some classes extends urwid.text and urwid.button there is no real highlight feature in the widgets that come with urwid there is only a focus feature and it doesn t seem to be easy to decouple the focus highlight from the focus behavior

49503079
express	node.js
a software framework is a universal reusable software environment that provides particular functionality as part of a larger software platform to facilitate development of software applications products and solutions evaluating express against this definition it gets checkmarks for all these elements abstraction providing generic functionality can be selectively changed by additional user-written code thus providing application-specific software a software framework provides a standard way to build and deploy applications a software framework is a universal reusable software environment that provides particular functionality as part of a larger software platform to facilitate development of software applications products and solutions applications in this case is a node.js web server
first off express isn t a web server

equals	gethashcode
if the items hashkeys are not widely distributed then equals may be called which may be expensive
the following demo based on dasblinkenlight s answer shows gethashcode being called a different number of times depending on the union ordering

onclick	onfocus
there s some differences onclick this event is fired whenever the user clicks in an object like a button an image an input.
after the click then comes the onfocus this event is fired when an element is selected it doesn t need to be clicked it can be done programmatically calling .focus or using the key tab for example

you can install it directly from python using rpm bindings

swift	objective-c
well it should be created automatically when you create a new swift file if that s not the case take a look here if the easy way doesn t work see this one xcode not automatically creating bridging header
i understand that oidauthorizationflowsession protocol is defined in objective-c and you re trying to use it in swift if that s the case then you need a bridging-header.h there you can import the corresponding header for your oidauthorizationflowsession

addition	multiplication
from sklearn import linear_model from sklearn import preprocessing from random import randint import numpy as np addition problem since x+y is a linear combination of x and y we do not need to do any feature extraction on our data. minimization objective in linear regression is where we minimize over w. optimal parameters for this model are
output multiplication problem now a simple linear regressor cannot fit accurately to the data since is not a linear combination of elements in the sample. however if we choose polynomial feature extraction we can. polynomial features are all polynomial combinations of the coordinates up the a defined degree including degree 0

sse	avx
i used sse instead of avx because i wanted to keep the answer simple
once you understand how the solution works rewriting the function with avx intrinsics should not be much of a problem though

swift	objective-c
this is a general issue with generic types defined in objective-c and imported to swift
some relevant compiler bugs sr-1576 swift 3 can t subscript phfetchresult sr-2708 extending objective-c generics in swift 3 does not compile in short objective-c generics are type-erasing swift generics are type-preserving

some relevant compiler bugs sr-1576 swift 3 can t subscript phfetchresult sr-2708 extending objective-c generics in swift 3 does not compile in short objective-c generics are type-erasing swift generics are type-preserving
you need the latter for tasks like defining type-constrained extensions but you can t because swift doesn t know anything about the objecttype of any particular phfetchresult instance

49523171
swift	objective-c
you need the latter for tasks like defining type-constrained extensions but you can t because swift doesn t know anything about the objecttype of any particular phfetchresult instance
the swift-evolution proposal that brought widespread objective-c generics import to swift 3 included a provision for letting objective-c classes provide information about their generic type parameters at runtime.

equals	compareto	comparator	comparable
java se also makes mention of this kind of situation when it s talking about ordering which is inconsistent with equals see treeset note that the ordering maintained by a set whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if it is to correctly implement the set interface
see comparable or comparator for a precise definition of consistent with equals . this is so because the set interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a treeset instance performs all element comparisons using its compareto or compare method so two elements that are deemed equal by this method are from the standpoint of the set equal

49524924
queue	fifo
however if your fifo queue has multiple message groups you can take advantage of parallel consumers allowing amazon sqs to serve messages from different message groups to different consumers
unless you are using sqs fifo queues your assumption about the limitation of sqs not supporting multiple parallel consumers is not correct standard sqs do support multiple parallel consumers

49524924

gson	jackson
this is an issue reported to gson team unfortunately seems they insist that javascript has no integer type as if they do not realize that gson is for java not javascript
so they refused to fix it until today 2018 now despite other lib like jackson does not have such issue at all despite how easy to fix it

49532435
implements	extends
the inability to set a usb-c port into device mode or upstream-facing port mode is the reason why external adapters have to be used an example for a usb-c device that is a usb peripheral or upstream-facing port mode is so in this devices runs firmware that processes hdmi streams over an usb-c connector however in usb protocol it implements an upstream-facing port what a computer or laptop can not implements due to its hardware restrictions that implements a usb host or downstream-facing port
usb protocol is organized in device classes mass storage device class communication device class cdc and also usb video device class uvc almost any modern camera device implements this uvc class and you can capture the stream of uvc devices with software like vlc - how to use vlc to capture video from your webcam to a file usb-c standard is the physical layout of the connector it does not change the fundamental organizational structure of usb standard like its differentiation in device classes and so there are uvc devices with usb-c connector search internet for webcam usb-c however usb-c extends the functionality of the port by the alternate modes and so also uses different port controllers with different firmware and kernel modules alt mode is a functional extension of usb-c which enables the usb connection to carry non-usb signals

49533943
serializable	deserialization
as the documentation of serializable states if a serializable class does not explicitly declare a serialversionuid then the serializable runtime will calculate a default serialversionuid value for that class based on various aspects of the class as described in the java tm object serializable specification
however it is strongly recommended that all serializable classes explicitly declare serialversionuid values since the default serialversionuid computation is highly sensitive to class details that may vary de pend ing on compiler implementations and can thus result in unexpected invalidclassexceptions during deserialization

49534221
google-chrome	firefox
i have stop using this plugin but i suppose last version can be used in the different version of google-chrome ie and firefox

kerberos	ntlm
kerberos auth is the safest authentication method to use in this scenario
ntlm is less secure and negotiate lets the client and server use kerberos if both of them support it - if not they fallback to ntlm

comparator	comparable
if you re only calling comparator yourself then it s true that there s no particular reason to implement comparable
but for things like collections.sort and treeset those aren t hardcoded for a specific type but they have to be able to call comparator on the objects you pass it to

49543700
comparator	comparable
but for things like collections.sort and treeset those aren t hardcoded for a specific type but they have to be able to call comparator on the objects you pass it to
that s what the comparable interface is before implementing comparable means that collections.sort and treeset know that the objects you pass them will have that method to be called

49544000
noexcept	throw
ideally when you mark a method as noexcept it should also mean that the method is not supposed to let any exceptions bubble up
so if you have a method marked as noexcept but it calls other methods that are not marked as noexcept that should give you a compile error unless there is a try catch block surrounding anything that can throw

49544000
noexcept	throw
so if you have a method marked as noexcept but it calls other methods that are not marked as noexcept that should give you a compile error unless there is a try catch block surrounding anything that can throw
simply calling std terminate is a very poor language design choice because it doesn t put any responsibility at the hands of whoever writes the noexcept method

49544060
aggregate-functions	sum
i got around it by using the function calls instead of the string names count mean and sum. first we start with your dataframe then just replace the aggregate-functions with standard library call to len and the numpy aggregate-functions
count becomes len mean becomes np.mean sum becomes np.sum the pivot table is made with the following lines note len might not be what you want but in this example it gives the same answer as count would on its own

super	implements
servlet interface its the super interface for genericservlet and httpservlet
it contains 5 abstract methods and all inherited by genericservlet and httpservlet. problem if you want to create servlet by implements servlet interface all the 5 abstract methods of the interface servlet should be overridden eventhough programmer is not interested usage only implements servlet interface if you like to develop your own container

postgresql	mysql
solved. a gis plugin was being used in my project postgis and postgresql used in project. for that the very initial postgresql installation must have put libmysqlclient_18 version defined by its own customizations. after mariadb installation the libmysqlclient.so.18 should have been updated hindering the older linkage and setups
ran the mysql mariadb cleaning with this post installed mariadb again got the gis support and issue is resolved. link to gis support libraries update got another error during running django server with postgresql 9.5 and postgis 2.2 could not find the geos library tried geos_c geos

49553600
swift	objective-c
the key bit of information is this user is optional struct if user is a struct then it can t be represented in objective-c just the same as a swift class that doesn t inherit from nsobject
in order for the method login _ to be able to be marked objective-c then every type referenced in the method declaration has to be representable in objective-c

49557537
nunit	mstest
you can run unit tests on os x using nunit or xunit but not mstest
further you can use dotnet core for execution of those tests with the appropriate nunit or xunit adapter

49560800
build.gradle	gradlew
- your build.gradle project should look like the image below note it could be little bit different if you are not using realm and some google services now let s start - go to you build.gradle app platform modules targeting android the update of the experimental multiplatform projects feature introduces support for android platform modules
these modules should apply the corresponding plugin in the gradlew build script and can use the shared code from a common module you will copy this inside of your build.gradle on the top add it- kapt diagnostic locations as of now kapt the kotlin annotation processing tool can offer links to locations in the original kotlin code rather than generated java stubs as it reports errors encountered during annotation processing

49560899
namedtuple	dictionary
the following solution to a struct is inspired by the namedtuple implementation and some of the previous answers
however unlike the namedtuple it is mutable in it s values but like the c-style struct immutable in the names attributes which a normal class or dictionary isn t

49562838
comparator	comparable
you should use comparator s instead if it doesn t exist a natural order or use both if it exists a natural order and some other kinds of order
example where comparator can be useful in addition to comparable the string class implements comparable by comparing two strings lexicographically

49562838
comparator	comparable
or without creating any class with a lambda example where comparator should be used instead of comparable suppose you have an account class that represents a bank account
functionally you don t have a natural order to sort them but you have instead multiple orders according to the client needs. making the class to implement comparable would not make sense

49563468
jar	war
the build complained about the jar dependency i fixed the error by adding a element to my jar overlay
according to the overlay documentation the default value for type is war and so the build correctly complained that i did not have a war artifact named launcher

49563714
jar	war
to solve the problem add the jar file to the web-inf lib folder of the project
according to revision we did in the chat session the problem is that the jar file containing the com.restfb.facebookclient class is not being exported in the war file deployed to the application server

49563714
jar	war
according to revision we did in the chat session the problem is that the jar file containing the com.restfb.facebookclient class is not being exported in the war file deployed to the application server
for the jar to be exported besides of having it added to the java build path it also has to be present in the web-inf lib folder of the project

49563714
jar	war
for the jar to be exported besides of having it added to the java build path it also has to be present in the web-inf lib folder of the project
in this case the jar file was added from an external location so it wasn t present itn the web-inf lib folder hence not exported when deploying the application or generating the the war file

49568157
realloc	malloc
it is necessary for free to be passed a value that was returned by malloc or calloc or realloc that has not otherwise been deallocated
since you re actually doing free string1 is being passed the result of a malloc call

49568932
swift	objective-c
for that we have to create a new compiler flag swift preprocessor macro objective-c
objective-c note also for set the release 1 flag as well if its not already set under release configuration

49569706
inline	inlining
a few relevant bug reports can be found although they do not exactly meet your case vc2017 15.5.2 inline variable crashed local static variable initialized multiple times this will be addressed in 15.7 - thanks for the report
combining multiple guards for adjacent static variables into a single guard is a backend optimization which can go wrong when inlining under certain circumstances

49570474
swift	objective-c
if not then use the swift type cbool
in objective-c bool and bool are not the same bool is a signed char whereas bool - aka c bool- is an unsigned char

49573268
comparator	comparable
so by inserting null the comparator method internally throws nullpointerexception
treemap add method documentation when you try to add null on empty treeset initially it does not contain any element to compare hence its add without npe when second element you will add in treeset treeset will use comparable comparator method to sort the element and place into treeset object hence it will call null.compareto which defiantly leads to npe

49576750
google-chrome	firefox
browsers in google-chrome in sf firefox soon ver 60 iiuc browser support for spread properties shipped in google-chrome 60 including this scenario
support for this scenario does not work in current firefox 59 but does work in my firefox developer edition

49576750
firefox	safari
so i believe it will ship in firefox 60
safari not tested but kangax says it works in desktop safari 11.1 but not sf 11 ios safari not teseted but kangax says it works in ios 11.3 but not in ios 11 not in edge yet tools node 8.7 ts 2.1 nodejs has supported since 8.7 via kangax

49577552
postorder	inorder
for example preorder node print node if node.left is not a thread link preorder node.left if node.right is not a thread link preorder node.right postorder node if node.left is not a thread link preorder node.left if node.right is not a thread link preorder node.right print node
a threaded tree node typically has a flag that tells you whether the right and left pointers in the node are references to children or threads to the inorder preorder successor

49579315
google-chrome	firefox
source from my answer here since at least 2017 it appears that google-chrome is either 1 reverting back to the min-width 0 min-height 0 defaults or 2 automatically applying the 0 defaults in certain situations based on a mystery algorithm
this could be what they call an intervention . as a result many people are seeing their layout especially desired scrollbars work as expected in google-chrome but not in firefox edge

49581623
virtualenv	conda
this is similar to virtualenv which doesn t update the prompt if is set so you can print yourself
conda has a setting to disable changing the prompt changeps1 false in .condarc

49582136
octal	decimal
77 is a valid octal number with an actual decimal value of 63 in decimal
adding 1 to it and printing it again would yield 100 in octal not 78

49582136
octal	decimal
adding 1 to it and printing it again would yield 100 in octal not 78
as c cannot detect minute overflows when counting with your made-up units the proper route to follow is to convert the input to regular decimal do any calculation you want then convert back to time decimal

49583953
gson	jackson
you may try using the gson if needed but this is simple enough imo
well obviously it does not work since jackson can t map the key value pairs to the given map

49585177
uitapgesturerecognizer	uitextview
so this uitapgesturerecognizer target textview action #selector edit ...should be this uitapgesturerecognizer target self action #selector edit
you ve specified textview as the tap gesture recognizer s target when really it should be self because the edit function is defined in your pasteview class not uitextview

49589616
build.gradle	gradlew
looking at the . gradlew assemblerelease output i could tell that it builds the js bundle by itself thanks to apply from .. node_modules react-native react.gradle in your build.gradle file so it was not necessary to manually run react-native bundle before hand
if i simply did not run react-native bundle before running . gradlew assemblerelease everything worked great

49590279
helpers	actioncontroller
or i think you could create a helpers method which uses asset_path to get the path of your asset using the action_name in the case it raises an exception because it couldn t be found then you can rescue it and show the default image
i guess you can use action_name # returns the name of the action this controller is processing. attr_internal action_name this will give you the action the user is actually in so you could use a switch statement eventually this would fit better than an if conditional in the case the validations you must do grow notice action_name isn t documented but it works the same way as actioncontroller metal#controller_name

49592763
keras	tensorflow
to make sure that s not the one causing your problems try including these two lines of code to your training script # load the backend from keras import backend as k # prevent tensorflow memory leakage k.clear_session
generally keras tensorflow is very good with resource usage but there is a known memory leak that has caused problems in the past

49593190
tensorflow	cudnn
tried yesterday tensorflow 1.7 version in ubuntu and didn t work as expected the gpu didn t work so downgraded back to 1.6 so would suggest you to use the 1.6 for your setup is a bit different than the official docs nvidia cuda toolkit documentation so here is the correct path ensure the following values are set variable name cuda_path variable value c program files nvidia gpu computing toolkit cuda v9.0
one way and the best for me of checking if your tf uses gpu is with nvidia-smi here you see the gpu memory usage for my task i have 1.6 mil of observations with 13 variables and takes 11 gb your s should take couple mb or gb as well don t know how looks your pictures so if your system won t show this info once you start running your model than for sure is using cpu gpu couple mins to couple hours but cpu will take longer note my terminal won t output the tensorflow output stuff that is present in ide as follow cuda doesn t show there as is claimed online that cuda issue was only when is incompatibility and can t start the gpu in tf here is the info that the test passed once the cudnn is installed correctly p.s hope it helps

49599630
keystore	jks
as it says different store and key passwords not supported for pkcs12 keystore
so i was able to generate a jks file by passing -storetype jks parameter and it asked for two passwords

49600711
virtualenv	conda
the conda activate command also has advantages of 1 being universal across all oses shells and platforms and 2 not having path collisions with scripts from other packages like python virtualenv s activate script
as of conda 4.4 conda activate is the preferred way to activate an environment

49602928
addition	multiplication
in addition creating a __float__ handler would also not be useful here as python can t handle floats of the order -300 so it would be useless to return them as we would just get 0
create a class and it functions as you would expect update i added a __str__ method above so they are displayed properly when printed of course i have only implemented the multiplication method here but i will leave it up to you to implement the others when required

49614554
lxml	elementtree
i wouldn t say that lxml is faster than et across the board as both modules offer tons of functionality
to provide a little context elementtree also supports xpath but particularly et has a unique and useful function called iterparse that remakes the xml document as an iterable

49616198
sudo	passwd
this script deletes the credentials in .pgpass afterward because in some environments the default ssh user can sudo without a passwd for example an ec2 instance with the ubuntu user so using .pgpass with a different host account in order to secure those credential might be pointless
backup over ssh with passwd using temporary .pgpass credentials and push to s3 just substitute the first couple of config lines with whatever you need - obviously. for those not interested in the s3 backup part take it out - obviously

49619652
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
t get vertical scrollbar with justify-content flex-end solution #1 google-chrome only if you make the ul grid item a nested grid container with align-content end that seems to work in google-chrome but not firefox and edge
i didn t test in safari ie11 or other browsers

49621950
pandas	dask
for more complicated cases the usual solution with pandas is to replace the standard pickler with a third-party library like dill or cloudpickle that knows more about pandas and can coerce it into shape to pass over the network
or sometimes to replace multiprocess itself with a third-party library like dask . this isn t that hard to learn but you do need to look over the options pick one and read about how to hook it in which you may not want to do if it s not needed

49624491
ienumerable	iqueryable
if an ienumerable is all that s required then use this if an iqueryable is required then as your object probably doesn t implement that already you d need this this answer is a bit of an educated guess but it seems logical so hopefully it s accurate
thinking about it further the dlinq version of select must actually require an ienumerable or an iqueryable rather than an ienumerable of t

49624989
google-chrome	firefox
the event listener needs to be changed from mousewheel to wheel this code works on firefox quantum and google-chrome
the provided answers do not work in firefox quantum

49630946
keras	tensorflow
based on your update with the contents of your keras.json file it appears you have set the backend to mxnet but this is not a permitted backend of keras
change this value to one of tensorflow theano or cntk and be sure you have that corresponding package also installed

49636389
xstream	jackson
before spring batch 4 the default serialization mechanism for the executioncontext was via xstream
now it uses jackson by default which is not compatible with the old serialization format

49641305
swift	objective-c
this confusion is a result of the feature of all the wonderful magic built into the swift - objective-c bridge
specifically the is and as keywords don t behave the way you d expect because the jsonserialization object being actually written in objective-c is storing these numbers not as swift int s double s or bool s but instead as nsnumber objects and the bridge just magically makes is and as convert nsnumber s to any swift numeric types that they can be converted to

49641610
nsis	uninstaller
you need to put a manual delete command in the nsis script for any files you need deleted that the quick script generator does not know about
in the generated nsis script in the uninstaller section you need to add a command that will be something like delete path database.db

49642011
prepare	execute
the reason to use pdostatement prepare when reusing the query with different variables is because when you execute this it sends the prepare statement to the database server but not the values
when you execute the pdostatement you then send the values to the database server

49642408
implements	extends
for example the serializable interface guarantees that any class implements this interface is serializable
i m not going to explain what serializable means here but the idea is that instead of having hundreds of classes extends an abstract serializable class in a messy tree of subclasses you can simply implement serializable and use the power of polymorphism to refer to your class as a serializable

49643403
ssl	https
some of these may not apply to your particular installation but in the interest of creating a comprehensive answer i ve tried to cover all the bases here note you might need to adjust the table names depending on your store s table prefix if they don t begin with oc_ open config.php and admin config.php and change all those constant url declarations to https - make sure to include http_server and http_catalog in your admin panel go to click edit and in the server table set use ssl to yes
in your database update the store_url column in the oc_order table so that all links are https

49644097
spaces	delimiter
for with parameter f splits by default a line up into substrings using spaces and horizontal tab as string delimiter and assign only the first spaces tab delimiter string to specified loop variable i
this split behavior is not wanted here as needed in body command block of for is always the full qualified name of an mkv file even on path or file name contains a spaces character

49644097
spaces	delimiter
this split behavior is not wanted here as needed in body command block of for is always the full qualified name of an mkv file even on path or file name contains a spaces character
for that reason is specified to define an empty list of delimiter which disables splitting up the lines into substrings

49645842
daemons	systemd
the actual daemons process the child
according to the daemons man page provided by the systemd package and viewable on a rhel 7 or centos 7 host by running man daemons in the daemons process write the daemons pid as returned by getpid to a pid file for example run foobar.pid for a hypothetical daemons foobar to ensure that the daemons cannot be started more than once. this must be implemented in race-free fashion so that the pid file is only updated when it is verified at the same time that the pid previously stored in the pid file no longer exists or belongs to a foreign process

49648089
dictionary	map
first of all lists are mutable and cannot be used as a dictionary key
that s why you need to convert your data to tuples now to achieve your goal you ll need to convert gridloc to list of tuples and then map mapping to it p.s

49656616
stateless	stateful
the focus of afs is to provide a platform for building microservices based applications using stateless services stateful services and actors
things that ddc does not provide stateful services actor model stateful services the benefit of stateful services is that the data lives where the code lives so no more separate data stores like a nosql or relational database

49656699
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome is going to read the color configuration file of your windows operating system
firefox will not do it by default and use a srgb setting

49660649
serializable	deserialization
if you don t want to serializable the end property when it is exactly one hour later than the start you can use conditional property serializable the constructor does not need to be public when marked with
properties not passed into the constructor will be populated after construction as per usual deserialization

49662220
erlang	elixir
next on the basis of the source code you can see that binary options get translated to the list version of options because that is how erlang regex engine re expects them to be
even though not difficult in itself the elixir core team have opted not to provide translation for the reverse from the actual list of module modifier atoms to the equivalent pcre binary option thus you end up with the opts field remaining empty and bereft of the corresponding options in pcre binary format and thus you end up with the defective rendering of the regex as evidenced by the discrepancy above

49664545
pickle	dill
pickle actually can t quite save and load everything unless you do a lot of work to add support to some of your types but there s a third-party library named dill that extends support a lot further
pickle files are not at all human-readable and are only compatible with python and sometimes not even with older versions of python

49671017
innodb	myisam
newer versions use the innodb storage engine by default however older versions or using the wrong dialect for your jpa provider will use the myisam storage engine
the innodb engine has support for transactions whereas the myisam type doesn t

49671017
innodb	myisam
the innodb engine has support for transactions whereas the myisam type doesn t
hence doing a rollback on a myisam based table won t do anything

49679733
udp	tcp
i think of so_reuseaddr as the intention to share an address which is only really useful for udp multicast
for unicast or tcp it really doesn t do much since the bahaviour is non-deterministic for both sockets

49680140
ssl	https
use your own domain so the bucket is not visible you can use free ssl provided by aws if you use cloudfornt 2
use https instead of plain http

49682925
noexcept	throw
compilers will warn that there is a throw in a function that is declared noexcept when the constructor cannot throw
neither g++ nor clang++ were smart enough to understand that the throw will never happen when the function is noexcept

uialertview	uialertcontroller
the delay between the user tapping and the running of the button s action handler was evident as soon as uialertcontroller replaced uialertview uialertcontroller dismiss is slow in effect you re trying to do something apple doesn t want you to do namely associate a sound with an alert controller button
my solution to this sort of thing is simple don t use uialertcontroller

49684295
sudo	passwd
if you are not sure about the location of you vscode app just drag and drop the icon from where it is to the terminal it will print the path automatically after the dragging after that just exec sudo open command and append the path in my case was the one above hope this helps
in case of a default installation under default applications folder try running sudo open applications visual studio code.app after you make a save on a protected file it will ask you then just hit overwrite it will prompt for your sudo passwd

49684777
swift	objective-c
on swift 4.1 you set the doubleaction method of the tableview object inside your code to perform an objective-c function by using a #selector nameofyourfunction inside this function you call a segue. you can link your new window to the origin window on interfacebuilder not to the nstableview object but the actual viewcontroller object
then do all your setup for the new window on prepare for segue alright first on interface builder of course give an identifier to that segue next inside our first view controller where the table view is code then we need a function to perform the segue on the table view s double click this function is called with a #selector and therefore needs to be visible to objective c even that we are programing in swift we just simply start the function with objective-c thats it

49687256
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
output you have an xy problem where you are looking for the solution for a solution of the main problem without knowing that it is the correct one according to what you comment your main problem is to add qscrollbar to the qmainwindow and in that element you want to make drawings so for that it is not necessary to use a qgraphicsview but a qscrollarea
in a qgraphicsview it is normal to add items to the scene for example in case you want to draw a polygon you must use qgraphicspolygonitem also if you want to get correct points you must use qgraphicsscene instead of qgraphicsview

49690005
vsts	tfs
this may not works well with tfs vsts hosted git repo
for tfs vsts if you don t want to use usernamepasswordcredentials providing your company email and password you could use alternate authentication credentials instead

49694046
spaces	delimiter
advantages relatively easy to produce if you know a certain data doesn t contain characters json for example usually does not contain spaces so separating out messages by a spaces is easy
when sending messages from netty you need to manually add your delimiter to the messages themselves when receiving you can use a delimiterbasedframedecoder to decode the incoming stream into messages

49697843
set	bag
mapreduce is the default so if you haven t specified tez your hadoop cluster must be set up to run pig in tez
i can t replicate your output because i get an error as soon as i try this line you don t need to use the dot operator to refer to these fields sum_occ.ngram because they are not nested in a tuple or bag

49699694
coalesce	isnull
you could use coalesce evaluates the arguments in order and returns the current value of the first expression that initially does not evaluate to null dbfiddle demo
there is no need for nesting isnull

49701523
express	node.js
the main disadvantage with restify as they are with express requireslots of manual work
loopback restify is a great starting point but in the long run it might not be the right choice if you plan on investing heavily into apis.loopback is a fully featured node.js backend framework to connect your applications to data via apis

49701844
xslt	schematron
other implementations may not have the necessary xslt template
if you re using the xslt-based reference implementation of schematron to generate svrl output then the svrl will include the xpath of the context of the successful report like this if that doesn t address your need and you still need to get the xpath of a node and you re using the xslt-based reference implementation you can take advantage of an xslt template that is defined in the implementation like this in order to do this you have to use the allow-foreign parameter when you compile the schematron schema into xslt like this if you re using saxon this approach would make your schematron schema dependent upon the xslt-based reference implementation of schematron

49702675
boost	allocator
here you can see that parsing the date-time is still a factor of concern mktime 15.58 strptime 40.54 strtod 5.88 but all in all the difference is less egregious now parser1 14.17 parser2 43.44 parser3 5.69 parser4 35.49 variant 4 boost datetime again interestingly the performance of the lowlevel c-apis is not far from using the much more highlevel boost posix_time ptime functions this might sacrifice some precision according to the docs here the total time spent parsing date and time is 68
the relative speeds of the parsers are close to the last ones parser1 12.33 parser2 43.86 parser3 5.22 parser4 37.43 summary all in all it turns out that storing the strings seems faster even if you risk allocator more

49702953
email	dkim
note of course implement full email authentication - spf dkim and dmarc for both domain names
since maintaining the original domain s email doesn t cause any harm just start forwarding the email from the old email addresses to the new ones at the new domain name

49705311
google-chrome	firefox
you can fix this by first removing the part of the dom tree you are going to be altering alter it while it is not in the dom and then reinsert it into the dom according to the performance test i created in google-chrome removing it from the dom first doesn t seem to make a huge difference but it does make it a little faster
if you have to deal with firefox it does make a big difference

49708923
multiplying	multiplication
is indeed a good way to make multiplying very very large bigintegers faster
due to the big overhead it is not faster for much smaller bigintegers so you can use this recursively down to a certain threshold you ll have to find out empirically what that theshold is and then use biginteger s own multiplication which already implements the toom-cook and karatsuba divide-and-conquer algorithms since java 8 iirc also recursively down to certain thresholds

49710466
prepare	execute
use mysqli_real_escape_string or pdo quote or prepare statements depending on situation
use prepare statements for what they have been created for not just as a wholesale sanitizer tool use them when you have to execute the same query repeatedly

49710577
scheme	racket
for the untyped languages like scheme and #lang racket you can have any type in the two arguments
note that when you link to cons in #lang racket it is not the same as cons in other languages like #lang pl

49713429
mvp	presenter
change your presenter to the following and leave the implementation details to the view i have written a complete article on mvp here just in case
your presenter should not need to know about how to show the details of showing the ui and as such the r.string references

49724571
haskell	ocaml
i m dubious this is actually what you want when it doesn t reliably increase performance of haskell code while simultaneously breaking existing code and making existing resources useless
if this is how you intend to write programs please just use ocaml or scala and leave the haskell community alone

49729553
jms	jta
try restarting transaction then came a first xa error on a different thread xa operation failed cannot start session is already doing work in a transaction xidimpl xxx and finally the same error come back again and again each time on different thread more and more frequently referencing the same transaction id xa operation failed cannot start session is already doing work in a transaction xidimpl xxx at the end 100 of jms post operation fail on the same error until we reboot the server or the connection pool is flushed and refilled from scatch below the pach code according to torsten römer answer and below a raw log truncated with the error flow
experimented the same kind of issues with ironjacamar 1.0.9 on a jboss as 7.1.1 final with xa transaction on mysql and jms resource using jca pooledconnectionfactory and patched it the same way see below below is the flow of errors it start by a mysql timeout the jta coordinator timeout is set to 100s arjuna012095 abort of action id 0 ffff0af02d68 -63fd0719 5ab027d7 5afb5 invoked while multiple threads active within it

49733176
factors	matrix
you don t update the scale anywhere but in this snippet so zoom.getx and zoom.gety always return 1 which is equal to the initial scale factors
note that you can apply the scale matrix to the transforms of the content node directly but this wouldn t use the center as a pivot point of the zoom

49740798
noexcept	throw
destructors are by default expected to not throw exceptions noexcept
you can tell the compiler that this destructor is not using the default by adding a noexcept false

49743491
bower	npm
but if your build process still depends on bower assets not having a bower.json is going to be a problem
so there s two important files i see in the root directory package.json gulpfile.js package.json if you re not familiar with npm you re going to need to be

49745474
super	self
since your parent takes a host user and password you need these to super the initializer
so you probably want something like this in child def __init__ self host user password super child self .__init__ host user password although since child.__init__ doesn t actually do anything besides try to super the simpler thing to do is to just not override __init__ in the first place

49745474
super	self
so you probably want something like this in child def __init__ self host user password super child self .__init__ host user password although since child.__init__ doesn t actually do anything besides try to super the simpler thing to do is to just not override __init__ in the first place
at any rate once you solve the super problem either way you re just going to have an infinite recursion the parent creates a child which supers the parent constructor and therefore creates another child and so on until you get an exception

49745594
azure	hdinsight
for more details refer plan azure domain-joined hadoop clusters in hdinsight
no you cannot connect an hdinsight cluster to the on-prem ad

49747323
swift	objective-c
automatic always compiled an objective-c class and somehow my swift code couldn t access it
for me to work 100 of the time i had to change the compile language for the coreml model in build settings to swift instead of automatic

49747593
super	self
in all 3 cases self.p would find the new definition while super would not
note that self also looks at attributes directly on the instance itself while super only considers class attributes on parent classes

49757837
implements	extends
you either implements them in the abstract class or you leave them abstract but then some of your more concrete children need to implements it
example let s suppose we have an interface like and the abstract class together with a concrete extends class since dog is not abstract all methods need to be implemented

49758478
factors	matrix
thinking about it but not testing i d probably use this code after creating factors for the character columns
i initially thought this was a duplicate of create sparse matrix from a data frame but encountered errors relating to the requirement that assignment-indexing of sparsematrices needs to be numeric and those queryid and wifi columns appear to be factors or character

49758665
google-chrome	firefox
so for example if you have a text data type it ll put the content of the text data type in the address bar on google-chrome this happens with copy effectallowed but not with link
with firefox it will drop it whichever effectallowed is defined

49760571
sum	coalesce
sql sum will account for the explicit null but not for an implicit null
for the implicit null we can use coalesce to return the first non- null value

49762020
decimal	ieee
there s no way to represent 1 3 or 1 7 exactly in decimal digits which is the same problem.
0.2 cannot be exactly represented as an ieee 745 floating point number which is what java uses for float and double

49762398
hex	binary
ip_string hex ip_binary inet6_ntoa ip_binary -------------------- -------------------------------- ----------------------- 66.249.64.90 42f9405a 66.249.64.90 127.0.0.1 7f000001 127.0.0.1 192.168.1.1 c0a80001 192.168.0.1 2001 4860 4860 8888 20014860486000000000000000008888 2001 4860 4860 8888
it s not converting back to ipv4 human readable format it s converting to ipv6 because the argument to inet6_ntoa the binary value is 16 bytes

49762398
hex	binary
the rigmarole with cast convert substr hex unhex is confusing and is causing things not to work
to correct values that are already stored in the database we need a way to distinguish which of the 16-byte binary representations are actually ipv4 addresses that should have been stored as 4 bytes

49769591
comparator	comparable
when you change your class to be this does not work because comparator expects a type t string actually but you are passing
this is actually really easy to understand once you look at the comparable interface in the jdk sources.

49773195
noexcept	throw
but if you use -fno-exceptions the compiler also doesn t have to emit code for stack unwinding and exception handling so you should get the same benefits without needing to add noexcept anywhere
good practice is to only add noexcept to functions that you know definitely can t throw and which will never be changed to throw or if you definitely want them to call std terminate if an exception does happen

49773451
multiplying	multiplication
assuming double precision and 32-bit indeces in your case that means so when you are multiplying a sparse x dense or dense x sparse matrix you are accessing 812mb of memory while you only access 24mb of memory when multiplying sparse x sparse matrix
note that this doesn t include the memory where you write the results and this can be a significant portion up to 800mb in both cases but i am not very familiar with armadillo and which algorithm it uses for matrix multiplication so cannot exactly say how it stores the intermediate results

49778990
implements	extends
rather than messing about with collections.defaultdict to make it do what we want it seems easier to implements our own this works the way you want however it can behave unexpectedly for mutable types this is probably the reason why defaultdict remembers the value when a nonexistant key is accessed
another option is to extends defaultdict and add a new method that looks up a value without remembering it from collections import defaultdict class defaultdict defaultdict def get_and_forget self key return self.get key self.default_factory note that the get_and_forget method calls the default_factory every time regardless of whether the key already exists in the dict or not

49781337
build.gradle	gradlew
especially the build.gradle part.
as stated in the documentation for 1.4.7.release if you use gradlew put this in the build.gradle file gradlew build.gradle if you use maven put this in the pom.xml file maven pom.xml since i have not enough reputation i posted an answer instead of a comment on one of the previous answers

49785485
super	self
when you do super .__new__ value context self from your function becomes value and context becomes value the last two values do not need to be defined to use the function so there is nothing alerting you to this context never actually gets passed to super .__new__
try super .__new__ self value context requires three positional arguments self value and context

49790179
mockito	scalamock
this ability comes in handy when in comes to testing - it allows providing stubs and fakes without using any third-party libraries like mockito scalamock etc
continuing previous example the benefits of such approach compared to using some proper stub mock library are easy to provide stateful test doubles somewhat simpler to use - depends on choice of test double lib - huge difference compared to mockito not much difference compared to scalamock somewhat more reliable maintainable tests - with anonymous instance approach all the abstract members must be implemented + you get compiler to check the implementation against abstract members added to the base class trait while with stubs no such assistance is available

49791440
division	subtract
there are some semantic issues with an interface not all number systems implement all the same operators - and the results aren t always the same division and multiplication of vectors matrices for example
or you can add and subtract two timespan s but you can t multiply or divide them etc

49791440
multiplying	division	multiplying	subtraction
or you can add and subtract two timespan s but you can t multiplying or divide them etc
and even when they do the meaning can change integer division is not the same as floating point division and subtraction and negation get weird for unsigned data types for example

49793794
tcpdf	fpdf
i ve tried some library dompdf tcpdf fpdf mpdf which support php but not all of them are work properly
i didn t find any unicode support with dompdf tcpdf worked but the fonts are broken

49795271
google-chrome	firefox
it looks like a bug in google-chrome
notice that when you scale the image the element inspector keeps telling you that the size of #scaled is 1024x768 where as in firefox now apparently google-chrome uses the wrong size to conclude that .on-top is completely outside .content and hides it because of hidden overflow it should not be doing this but apparently it is trying to optimize away any element that displays above a video

49795383
gson	moshi
in fact gson does not provide runtimetypeadapterfactory per se in its standard bundle
quick googling for a moshi implementation brings your question at the top of the search results at least for me

49797782
tensorflow	tensorboard
since tensorflow 1.3.0 tensorboard has had its own pypi package but there is a circular dependency between the packages so when users installs tensorflow they will always get tensorboard along that s why you have it installed
however the fact is that tensorflow does really not depend on tensorboard to work and tensorboard does not even have a dependency to tensorflow so it should not be possible that the two packages affect each other in any way

49797782
tensorflow	tensorboard
however the fact is that tensorflow does really not depend on tensorboard to work and tensorboard does not even have a dependency to tensorflow so it should not be possible that the two packages affect each other in any way
about the suggested fix it tells you to remove tensorflow-tensorboard and then install tensorboard

49800897
mediacodec	mediarecorder
note do not use mediarecorder.getsurface if you decide to use this approach references mediarecorder mediarecorder - android docs mediacodec mediacodec - android docs
seems like there is an issue with the surface configuration coming from mediarecorder

49804469
coalesce	isnull
for returning the first non-null value from a larger list of parameters use the ansi-complient coalesce function instead
some people might claim you should never use isnull since it s not ansi complient

49804868
profiling	debugging
given that cpython that s the python interpreter i m using numpy and pandas make heavy use of c and cython there will be a limit how far i ll get with profiling
actually one probably could extend profiling to the cython code and probably also the c code by recompiling it with debugging symbols and tracing however it s not an easy task to compile these libraries so i won t do that but if someone likes to do that the cython documentation includes a page about profiling cython code

49804868
profiling	debugging
actually one probably could extend profiling to the cython code and probably also the c code by recompiling it with debugging symbols and tracing however it s not an easy task to compile these libraries so i won t do that but if someone likes to do that the cython documentation includes a page about profiling cython code
but let s see how far i can get line-profiling python code i m going to use line-profiler and a jupyter notebook here profiling x.astype lprun -f x.astype x.astype str so that s simply a decorator and 100 of the time is spent in the decorated function

49810352
subtract	addition	subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication
if you subtract 1 from 0xf00d 12345678 the result is 0xf00d 12345677 so if you only use the lower 32 bits of a register a 64-bit subtraction has the same effect as the 32-bit subtraction
therefore the sparc64 cpus do not have different instructions for 64-bit and 32-bit addition subtraction multiplication left shift etc

49812679
prepare	execute
try to remove the or prepare your query first
i think it is being execute twice because you already called your query on your first line which includes the query and it was already execute because it is not a prepared statement

49812679
prepare	execute
i think it is being execute twice because you already called your query on your first line which includes the query and it was already execute because it is not a prepare statement
then after that you did which execute the query again

49813476
ssl	https
so if the user goes to then it offloads the ssl tls and directs traffic to with the http_x_forwarded_proto set to https
in this scenario there is no redirect as user is already using https but also no hsts header as user is not using https to nginx and you only set that header in your 443 server config

49816487
onclick	onsubmit
the issue here is that you cannot attach to the onclick of a submit button
instead you need to bind to the onsubmit of the form

49823757
dictionary	map
since you re using python2 you can use itertools.iziplongest and the dictionary constructor from the docs for iziplongest make an iterator that aggregates elements from each of the iterables. if the iterables are of uneven length missing values are filled-in with fillvalue
the intermediate output of list izip_longest employeefirstname_list managerid_list managerfirstname_list is then i called map list ... on this to convert the tuples to lists though this is probably not needed i just did it to match your desired output

49833766
udp	tcp
however what is happening in this scenario is that under the hood sendto has effectively become an alias for send and despite calling sendto the data sent is actually being transported in a tcp packet and not a udp packet at all
this was proved by using to send udp traffic to the server and to send tcp traffic to the server the former did not produce any data at the net.tcpconn end-point while the latter did

49835104
addition	modulo
you use the modulo in your case here if after your addition of shift the index is bigger then alphabet.length it will start at 0 again
see c# ref modulo unrelated but your loop is not very efficient

49835982
swift	objective-c
i usually use facebook s chisel which has a pjson command to print a swift dictionary. eg lldb pjson dict as nsdictionary this should pretty-print the dictionary
this is a much cleaner way to do what has already been suggested. p.s. for now you ll have to cast dict as nsdictionary because objective-c runtime doesn t understand swift dictionaries

49837278
memcpy	memmove
as memcpy usually uses the fastest way possible to copy memory on any system memmove is usually rather implemented as sometimes if memcpy always copies front to back or back to front memmove may also use memcpy in one of the overlapping cases but memcpy may even copy in a different way depending on how the data is aligned and or how much data is to be copied so even if you tested how memcpy copies on your system you cannot rely on that test result to be always correct
unless you know for sure that src and dst don t overlap call memmove as it will always lead to correct results and is usually as fast as that is possible for the copy case you require

49837730
postgresql	mysql
if you are trying to connect to the hive metastore which i believe is running postgresql in the hortonworks sandbox then again you re using the wrong jdbc driver connection url query syntax and server port information
first of all you ve copied code from a mysql connection example and tried to replace the query with hiveql which will not work

49839243
icmp	tcp
net ping by default just tries to send an icmp echo request to the host and expects an icmp echo response back
but many hosts like smtp.gmail.com will not reply to such requests even though the host might be reachable by other means such as connecting via tcp to a specific port like you do next

49839269
altera	xilinx
the way to get this code working with intel altera is to find out what kind of ram this is and to generate the same ram using intel s ip generator and then to connect that up in the same place in the code
you will almost certainly find that the interface to the intel ram will not be exactly the same as the xilinx

49841464
rsa	aes
i had a similar project in vb.net you will not be able to send messages of a large length because if you are using 2048bit rsa the maximum size of data you would be able to send would be 245 bytes
i used the rsa public key so each client would use aes encryption and pass their own keys which are encrypted with rsa the server would then decrypt the key and use that to resolve data

49843756
serializable	deserialization
since class a is not serializable it means its state does not get saved and java will create a new object by calling the default construcotr during deserialization
if it doesn t find default constructor it will throw an exception during deserialization

49845409
seaborn	matplotlib
t and also in seaborn plots not showing up you should add plt.show
plt has to be imported from matplotlib

49846117
multiplying	multiplication
similarly if you multiplying a list by 5 you get a list that s five times big not five lists
the list object defines what it thinks multiplication is by how it implements its list.__mul__ and list.__imul__ methods

49846426
google-chrome	safari
fwiw on my very old mac this doesn t work on google-chrome macos.
your syntax is all correct and safari is following the code path if you replace that fecolormatrix with a feflood blue it paints the area blue

49846521
serializable	deserialization
notes - by setting canwrite to false one can use default serializable when writing to json
when the json value is not a string jsonserializer.populate is used to fill in the contents of values via default deserialization

49846978
multiplying	multiplication
according to my testing you need to make at least 2 changes to fix this in the kernel you have incorrectly calculated the starting point for each block since blockdim.x is 256 but each block processes 512 elements you must multiplying this by 2
the multiplication by 2 in your calculation of leftsumelementidx doesn t take care of this -- since it is only multiplying tid

49855281
uiview	subviews
there is a property called clipstobounds but it works vice versa - it tells a uiview that all it s subviews are clipped to not be drawn outside of it s own bounds
therefore in your case if you wan t to have one view that goes out of bounds and one that do not you will need additional transparent view that will have same rect as superview but will clip subviews

49856993
floating-point	fractions
in other words do not declare amount and balance with binary floating-point types float and double
binary floating-point float and double in java can only represent fractions numbers of a form counter-intuitive to base-10-using humans

49856993
floating-point	fractions
binary floating-point float and double in java can only represent fractions numbers of a form counter-intuitive to base-10-using humans
the number 0.1 is famously not representable in binary floating-point for instance

49856993
floating-point	fractions
the problem with binary floating-point is not addition and subtraction
the problem is the representation of some fractions numbers of interest to you in particular decimal numbers

49862356
uitapgesturerecognizer	uigesturerecognizer
what you re after is uitapgesturerecognizer
uigesturerecognizer doesn t have a property called numberoftapsrequired this is why you re getting the compilation error

49865090
awt	swing
first of all you should not be extending canvas that is an awt component
in swing you can extend jcomponent or jpanel and then you add custom painting to the paintcomponent ... method

49865352
google-chrome	firefox
firefox creates spaces and google-chrome does not when you leave empty space within said elements
usually you wouldn t notice but because the after creates content behind it the whitespace is ineed rendered as whitespace in firefox so there are 2 ways to fix this issue

49865524
fgets	getline
if your system has support for getline then you can use it to read the whole line and getline will take care of allocating the memory needed for it if getline is not available on your system then you could write a function that emulates getline one like this this function works like fgets but it guarantees that you read the whole line the function takes care of allocation enough memory for the destination
if you enter a line that is longer than what the destination buffer can hold then fgets will read everything it can until the destination is full
