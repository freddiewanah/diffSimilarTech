qwindow	qwidget
then you create a qwidget from the qwindow using qwidget createwindowcontainer window
but this is only a temporary hack that you shouldn t have to use unless you actually want to mix qtquick an qwidget

18004464
google-chrome	firefox
however it works fine in ie and google-chrome
also if i run the same script on a windows 2003 server using firefox it works ok and does not give me the error

18006120
bottle	flask
if it is very simple then bottle is my choice
if not then i got with flask

18006362
super	self
look into super and the problems with super and don t forget to inherit from object if you re on 2.x and your class doesn t inherit from anything else
you didn t pass self

18006637
super	self
then we should invoke super in b looking for the next class in the chain after b super b self
it s important to use super and not call manually a.__init__ self ... etc. as it may lead to problems later

18007799
cpython	pypy
conceptually there are multiple layers to the interpreter but it s all just c code and it all looks alike to gdb. if you re looking to debug any python interpreter rather than specifically cpython you might want to look at pypy
it s written in a python-like language called rpython and there are various ways to use pdb to debug the r python interpreter code although it s not as easy as it could be unless you use a flat-translated pypy which will probably run about 100x too slow to be tolerable

18007842
move	drag
the problem with draggable is that the element your dragging doesn t actually move in the dom
so when you try to drag it back to it s original position your are attempting to drop it upon itself

18007872
implements	extends
the first error undefined method addchild is because your class inic does not extends a class that implements the method addchild
displayobjectcontainer defines this method so you ll want to extends that as a minimum like this public class inic extends displayobjectcontainer the second error is because you re attempting to access a property of the class be_tekstalaukiprimitive as if it were static

18011443
super	self
super doesn t work as is in python 2.x
you want to use super mytime self instead

18012342
multiplying	multiplication
you can multiplying a column by a row but not a row by a column unless they have the same number of elements
is element by element multiplication in which case the matrices must be exactly the same size and shape so for example 1 2 3

18013911
required	placeholder
auto required c++11 if you cannot use it you will have to do a little additional work and inside compute
to call compute you need to write classes you want to pass down in place of your a to f placeholder

18016874
dictionary	map
there are ways around that you can make the dictionary method process the list and indices in reverse for example
the most efficient way would be to create a map from word to order then use that mapping in sorting the alternative is to use .index on the list to scan through the list and find the index for each word while sorting but this is not nearly as efficient as using the ordering dictionary

18017495
floating-point	fractions
since 0.4 cannot be exactly represented in the double floating-point format you get its nearest representation which in the case of is probably something like 39.999999999999858
when you use int you truncate the fractions leaving you with 39

18018150
thin	webrick
heroku will then use thin as the server which is not multithreaded by default though it has a threaded option and your non thread-safe way will probably go away
webrick is a ruby webserver designed for development and not recommended for production use

18019815
setinterval	settimeout
in case of setinterval it will be just and in case of settimeout it will be personally i prefer settimeout as more reliable and manageable
using strings in the setinterval is not very good practice

18020136
innodb	myisam
the next step should be to repair the indexes with this query repair table tbl_name quick. however this will not work if you table is using innodb storage engine
you will have to change it to myisam so once again edit my.ini file and save restart your server this cannot be done dynamically change the table engine if needed alter table tbl_name engine myisam

18028871
jar	war
basically you d need to extract the whole jar manipulate the entry repack the jar and supply a custom classloader to reload it and tell the container to use it
even if you succeed in this all changes would get lost once you redeploy the war or in certain configurations even if you just restart the server for the very simple reason that those changes are not contained in the original war

18029906
mp4	webm	h.264	webm
aws elastic transcoding service only supports mp4 h.264 aac
it does not currently support webm vp8 vorbis or ogg theora vorbis which are the other two container video audio combinations you re looking for

18030102
serializable	deserialization
it appears you have a non transient field called keys which is the anonymous inner class called and this is not serializable and the reason this won t serializable
you can make it transient but you would need to re-create on deserialization by defining a readobject method from you can define a i suggest you avoid confusing gui components with data transfer objects

18030407
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome 30 it does not work
so its difficult to tell why it does not work for you in firefox 22

18032219
ienumerable	iqueryable
examples are as the following the load function is mainly used for 2 reasons 1 retrieving some parts of data from db to memory and work with them 2 to be able to use linq-to-objects methods which l2e doesn t supports like .tostring etc. - as the local property of dbcontext entities are which implements ienumerable just as l2o objects
.load loads an iqueryable query from database into the memory - in fact local property of the relevant entity of your dbcontext

18034498
onclick	onchange
alternatively you might want to combine the two functions into something like either way always be careful when listening for an onclick event as it will not fire when the input is activated through keyboard navigation
since this question is still not answered correctly yet ranks quite high for me in google for radio button onchange here s a proper solution for anyone still looking

18034715
innodb	myisam
tables must be in innodb format
myisam format of tables doesn t support transactions

18041433
multiplying	multiplication
if you need coordinates in global space than you must multiplying modelview matrix by model coordinates vector
coordinates send by vertex are in model space you can obtain actual modelview matrix with gl functions glgetflotav glgetdoublev inverse matrix and matrix x vector multiplication is not present in opengl so you must code it yourself or use some lib

18041549
comparator	comparable
you must place the comparator method in the playingcard class or it will not compile if you implement comparable
here s an example for comparator for the integer class this is not the actual implementation because if you are dealing with a small negative number and a large positive number the result could overflow

18042566
opcache	apc
php s opcache is not a full blown cache as apc it is a simply opcode cache
if you want to store custom data just like you would with the old apc you can use joe watkins apcu

18044049
uiview	subviews
every object in that array will be a uiview though so the more telling syntax would be
you re reading the enumeration as loop for every uilabel in my subviews but that s not how it really works-- fast enumeration doesn t do any smart filtering it s just a shortcut

18046636
super	self
multiple inheritance isn t a great option here chiefly for the two following reasons none of the methods in testcase use super so you d have to list your class first for methods like setup and teardown to work
pylint will warn that the base class uses self.assertequals etc which aren t defined on self at that point

18050203
serializable	deserialization
then you can use it like you ve been trying on the receiving end you ll need to pull it out with edit well the above won t work because basicnamevaluepair doesn t have a default constructor and the serializable mechanism requires non-serializable ancestor classes to have a default constructor
otherwise you ll get an exception on deserialization

18057547
prng	random
i m not really sure what the question is but hopefully giving some basics of pseudo-random number generators prng will answer it this is more of a language feature but usually calling the same function random is independent of where you call it from there may be other determining factors
random i j may or may not return the same number twice in a row or after some time

18059422
inline	inlining
x will not get inline since the clr will need to check whether the value of x is a valid cast to int
the jit is inlining the getter use the methodimplattribute on the getter to suggested the jit to not inline the property

18060615
client-side	server-side
here s a very light sample this is certainly not the best one but i keep it simple to make it easy to understand client-side js with complete fiddle here server-side php
there s no way of doing it with client-side javascript only

18061547
multiplying	multiplication
so this expression is equivalent to multiplying by ten since
the code is written like this in the belief that a shifts and adds are significantly faster than multiplication and b the compiler doesn t know the best way to multiply by ten

18062996
bower	npm
any scripts that you include beforehand say a non-browserified jquery will just become a global and bower does not prevent you from accessing globals
beware though some packages distributed via npm based on client-side libraries do not conform entirely to commonjs spec

18063008
ssl	https
heed the warning in the urllib2 documentation that states warning https requests do not do any verification of the server s certificate. as such i recommend using python requests library that provides a better interface and many features including ssl cert verification and unicode support
update 20150120 python 2.7.9 added https hostname verification as standard

18065642
firefox	safari
safari does not share data with firefox even if both are installed on the same os x machine
now there could be bugs in one or the other that might allow js to have unfettered access to the os filesystem and therefore allow a web site in safari to access firefox s data or vice versa but this is not really related to a csrf

18065642
firefox	safari
not really any more than safari having cookies and firefox having cookies are somehow tied
it is in fact possible to csrf an application you are welcome to provide evidence of your claims or provide your personal definition of csrf that would encompass scenarios like safari attacking firefox

18070485
operands	scalar
but all of the other operands in the expression are scalar well i don t know what h is but it likely doesn t matter. what ends up happening is that the expression evaluates to an array the scalar getting expanded as needed to match up
you then end up with assigning an array to a scalar and that s the cause of the error

18070922
google-chrome	safari
that way you don t have to load an external html. it changes the way you ve been doing things it doesn t load an external page but it works in google-chrome
i also tested it in ie and safari and opera

18075227
sudo	passwd
longer version sudo uses the users own passwd so you cannot put it in the script
a better approach is to configure sudo so that people can run the script

18081128

18081420
google-chrome	firefox
if i recall correctly google-chrome does not allow you to access file urls via ajax as if they were network requests
firefox did that for some release cannot recall which at the moment but there was pushback it was made an option then they reenabled it based on my recollection

18083999
uiview	calayer
it s fine to subclass uiview but it s not okay for that uiview subclass to try to draw in some other view s space
if you want to create a graph that you can add as content to some other view but not make the graph a view of its own then you might look into calayer instead

18084224
oncreate	onstart
oncreate doesn t get called when you click back
you need to init your data again in onstart or onresume

18085061
floating-point	fractions
if the nominal value of a floating-point number is not an integer unless the fractions part is exactly equal to 0.5 0.25 or 0.75 the exact value of the fractions part will always end in 125 375 625 or 875
in many cases one isn t actually interested in the exact nominal value of the fractions part but instead a rounded decimal representation

18085739
rdf	owl
rdf lists can t be used in owl dl however because they re also used in the rdf serialization of owl
it would seem then that protégé is discarding a bunch of information that isn t meaningful to it as the rdf serialization of an owl ontology

18085739
rdf	owl
it would seem then that protégé is discarding a bunch of information that isn t meaningful to it as the rdf serialization of an owl ontology
one might be able to argue that when protégé doesn t know what do with some rdf that s coming in that it should preserve it but that s really an untenable position when rdf is just one possible serialization of the serialized thing an owl ontology that protégé is concerned with

18086991
spaces	delimiter
the reason you don t get a match is that your regex doesn t match is missing comma quotation marks and the spaces character which all can occur inside the according to your sample
this one would match what also may trip you up is the fact that the list of names is delimiter by comma which itself can be part of the values unescaped

18087198
comparator	comparable
you should let you class implements comparable it has a comparator method just like string does
so your custom comparator could look like this the compare method must return an int so you couldn t directly return a boolean . than you need to overwrite the comparator method in your item class where you define what properties should be compared

18089658
spaces	delimiter
answer use a positive lookbehind regular expression inside a parenthesis capture group to keep the delimiter at the end of each string that leaves a white spaces at the start of the second and third strings
add a match for zero or more white spaces after the capture group to exclude it additional notes while it doesn t make sense with your example the delimiter can be shifted to the front of the strings starting with the second one

18089722
mongodb	bson
assuming you are not specifically interested in mongodb you are probably not looking for bson
bson is just a different serialization format compared to json designed for more speed and space efficiency

18090176
centos	linux
on mac osx ftp client from bsd for example the default command line ftp client accepts the full url while for example in centos the default client doesn t and you need to connect just to the hostname
so it depends on the flavor of linux and the installed default ftp client

18090469
google-chrome	firefox
i first tried setting a timeout to be 100ms and that worked well in ie and firefox but not in google-chrome
my best solution was setting the type to post and that solved the bug with google-chrome for me update i believe the actual underlying problem here is google-chrome s way of caching

18091082
inline	inlining
the effect you describe would happen if you were to use #define s macros but not using inline
in fact i believe one of the reasons that inlining was introduced was to avoid the carnage caused by improper use of #define

18091526
inline	inlining
just to answer the question about what percentage compilers will inline something like this
given a release build that is a build with high optimisation level i d expect all modern high quality compilers to inline this code assumeing that statement doesn t resolve to something very large in turn inlining a function that inlines another function that inlines a third function

18091526
inline	inlining
given a release build that is a build with high optimisation level i d expect all modern high quality compilers to inline this code assumeing that statement doesn t resolve to something very large in turn inlining a function that inline another function that inline a third function
i know for a fact that gcc will inline a static function that is only called once even if it s huge because it essentially removes a few instructions even if the whole base function gets several kilobytes larger

18092583
implements	extends
the main or base class may not even be needed unless you are trying to implements active record or something
you dont want any of these to extends the database class because that will essentially make them all singletons of which you can only have one instance.

18094572
ubuntu	debian
in ubuntu the default shell bin sh is a symbolic link to bin dash - bash and dash have enough functionality in common that most people never realize the difference but they are not identical dash is meant to be lighter
the debian almquist shell dash is a unix shell much smaller than bash but it is still aiming at posix-compliance

18098609
shadowing	named
related considerations make restrictions on shadowing of local variables by members of nested classes or on shadowing of local variables by local variables declared within nested classes unattractive as well
for the rules for shadowing and obscuring have a look at the java language specification section 6.4 they even provide the same example because a declaration of an identifier as a local variable of a method constructor or initializer block must not appear within the scope of a parameter or local variable of the same named a compile-time error occurs for the following program this restriction helps to detect some otherwise very obscure bugs

a similar restriction on shadowing of members by local variables was judged impractical because the addition of a member in a superclass could cause subclasses to have to rename local variables

18100371
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
if such an exception occurs it will be mopped up by the uncaught so the exception is unchecked which extends runtimeexception
the same article says this is an unchecked-exception we don t need to declare that we throw it and the caller doesn t need to explicitly handle it

18104836
addition	multiplication
in general matrix addition is well-defined mathematical operation so your point about not respecting math requirements is simply wrong
matrix multiplication is not commutative so you shouldn t expect that either

18106564
google-chrome	firefox
fabric.js thinks that your google-chrome firefox have touch enabled so it attaches itself to touch events instead of mouse events
it is not too clear to me whether this is a bug in google-chrome firefox or in fabric or both

18108327
udp	tcp
udp does not
there are implementations on top of udp that act like a tcp connection packet loss is also not important as long as i can get upto 500 data packets per second max

18114826
gif	png
but it s your task to find the way how to read write that raw data from into an actual file opencl doesn t support jpg png gif or other compression and file formats out of the box
for example if you want to read write jpeg then you can use libjpeg similarly libpng in case of png and so on

18114935
rdf	owl
in turtle this looks like this gets a bit inconvenient if you have to write the rdf manually since you have to do and can t use the nice ... syntax that turtle includes
this also really doesn t help for the case that you ve got since owl classes aren t individuals so they can t be the object of object properties and rdf type isn t an object property

18119620
implements	extends
an example is the list interface which defines the behavior of list collections compared to abstractlist which provides some of the methods needed by most list implementations to make it easier to implements a list
lists aren t required to inherit from abstractlist but many implementations do but code which uses a list never has to care whether the implementation they use extends abstractlist or not

18119819
innodb	myisam
as a bonus innodb will also give you transactions
the default storage engine mysql uses is myisam which unfortunately doesn t support relations

18120946
rpm	yum
and filter out potential binaries rpm -ql php-cli | grep bin you can get further details in the using rpm chapter of the deployment guide
if the package is not installed yum install php-cli more info at installing new software with yum

18121031
tiff	png
the source is available and it should not be too difficult to change the png output to tiff using the java imaging api this question might be an inspiration
you could use webvector for html files - it converts a html page to png

18121087
comparator	comparable
the meaning of comparator on an array depends on your use case
thus it is not implemented in java.util.arrays and because not every array contains comparable objects

18121339
multiplying	division
you need to precompute a 20-bit multiplicand 10b quotient 10b remainder and multiplying by your first 10b number and take the bottom 30b of the 40b result
otherwise the no-brainer is non-restoring division since you say that latency isn t important lots of stuff on the web most of it incomprehensible

18121339
division	multiplication
otherwise the no-brainer is non-restoring division since you say that latency isn t important lots of stuff on the web most of it incomprehensible
you have a 20-bit numerator the result of your 1023 x multiplication and a 10-bit denominator

18125091
opencv	emgucv
emgucv is essentially opencv for c# it s just an image processing library
the camera class is only useful for capturing images not controlling camera parameters you can see this clearly in emgucv s documentation

18126067
spaces	delimiter
this forces text to wrap regardless of whether it has white spaces or not
jsfiddle see edit source as far as i m aware there is no css property to give priorities to different delimiter in text

18126648
implements	extends
you could still implements this check as a plain function
then you can values like 2.00 cannot really be considered float in js or rather every number is a float in js . edit forgot to mention that extends the prototypes of built-in types is considered a bad parctice for a good reason and its use is discouraged in production environments

18128004
stateless	stateful
and do not do some things at all no need to clean up view between requests view is stateless
in a case of gwt due to strict nature of java and stateful view you must do a lot of additional work

18128975
firefox	safari
in firefox only
the problem is more browser compatibility run the jsfiddle in firefox and it will work as you expect on chrome and safari it does not work

18130359
client-side	server-side
scorm courses are required to use client-side code
server-side languages such as php and asp are not allowed within the course

18132895
ssl	https
if your client-server communication is based on ssl you can require client authentication - have a look at java https client certificate authentication or
if your communication is not based on ssl or you wish to authenticate on the application level - you can still use the certificate

18137128
multiplying	subtract
- you can choose any large amount to project it outwards by - just as long as it reaches at least outside of you light s casting area so if you just want to do it stupidly multiplying your shadow projection vector by a factor of 10 and you should be safe from this polygon you just constructed construct an area and then invoke the intersect method with your light s area as the first argument - this will assure that your shadows area doesn t reach outside of the bounds of the area that your light casts over
subtract from your light s casting the shadow area you constructed above

18137146
uilabel	nsstring
you cannot set the text of the uitextfield and any other components like uilabel and uitextview in the prepare for segue because all view components of the recently allocated controller are not initialized yet at this time they are all nil they only will be when the viewcontroller is presented and it s view loaded
you have to create a nsstring property in the presented viewcontroller and then somewhere inside your another view controller like viewdidload set the text of the textfield as this property value

18137404
spaces	delimiter
7 name place 7 because of the spaces after the hello
the quote is the delimiter not the spaces

18137404
spaces	delimiter
the quote is the delimiter not the spaces
the leading spaces are ignored the odd part about this is that in theory there s no need to pass the length to the word it s already there in the string

18137863
postgresql	mysql
as i understand without where clause is slower in postgresql refers to the fact that mysql s myisam tables store the total number of rows in the table header so doing is an o 1 operation - just read the value from the header and that s it
in postgresql because of mvcc and transactions this can not be done and it has to scan each row to determine if it is visible in the current transaction

18137863
postgresql	mysql
in postgresql because of mvcc and transactions this can not be done and it has to scan each row to determine if it is visible in the current transaction
however if you use where clause in your query mysql no longer can read the row count from the header and actually has to count the rows

18138855
innodb	myisam
you ll find that in general postgresql s counts aren t that different to those of the mvcc transaction-safe innodb storage engine in mysql
if you re using myisam well you get speed in exchange for more problems than i could throw a stick at

18139586
innodb	myisam
innodb supports row-level locking transactions and foreign key constraints
myisam doesn t

18141433
spaces	delimiter
you can insert the column headers using a compound statement or whichever you find more readable. note that the headers may not have spaces in them and nor may the data-elements
if your data is not white-space separated you can specify a different delimiter with the -s option

18143250
google-chrome	firefox
i switched to jplayer and i am still having the same issues this seems to be a bug in google-chrome with streaming mp3 playback via html5 audio
it doesn t occur on firefox and if i fallback to flash it disappears for now i ve enbabled a legacy option and added the following line error function e if e.jplayer.error.type e_url if e.jplayer.status

18145235
nsmutablestring	nsstring
you are right in the first case and copying can be useful because nsstring has a mutable subclass nsmutablestring so copy ensures that you have a real nsstring in and not it s mutable subclass
more talking about nsstring copy is used mainly on properties but depending on how is structured your code can be useful even on a local variable but in the second case you are wrong. first thing you are using arc not mentioned in the post but i see the tag so all local variables are __strong by default when you do you are not taking a reference to the dictionary but you are taking a reference to the object at the key name inside the dictionary that should be an nsstring . so arc sends a retain message automatically to the nsstring . at that moment that string is referenced strongly at least by two things - your pointer - the nsdictionary if your dictionary is deallocated the nsstring instance has another reference from and is not released until this last reference is removed

18148277
sudo	passwd
to configure sudo to read the target user s passwd instead you must set defaults targetpw in your sudo configuration etc sudoers or a file in etc sudoers.d
tell sudo to read the passwd from standard input using the -s option and to not take into account cached credentials from previous authentications using the -k option

18148277
sudo	passwd
so just do echo passwd | sudo -k -s -u username command script there s a few things to note
first most systems have configured sudo in a way to take the current user s passwd not the target user s one

18148650
super	implements
of the extended class using super ...
example there unfortunately is no possibility to use a s constructor for a boolean the language designes could have implements such a thing as generate for every public constructor in the base class a constructor with the same signature if such a constructor is not defined already

uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
uinavigationcontroller is certainly not out you say i have a container view controller that manages two separate uiviews and their respective uiviewcontroller it s only a tiny change to use a nav controller here
instead of adding the lower uiviewcontroller add a uinavigationcontroller with the uiviewcontroller as it s root view controller

18150932
noexcept	throw
edit the below is incorrect it s not possible to overload purely on the basis of noexcept qualification of a function pointer since an exception-specification is not considered part of a function s type. 15.4 13 if you want call to be noexcept when given a noexcept -qualified member function pointer you need to provide an overload
per c++11 5.3.7 1 the noexcept operator determines whether the evaluation of its operand which is an unevaluated operand clause 5 can throw an exception 15.1

18150932
noexcept	throw
per c++11 5.3.7 1 the noexcept operator determines whether the evaluation of its operand which is an unevaluated operand clause 5 can throw an exception 15.1
evaluating the expression function cannot throw an exception so noexcept function evaluates to true

18150932
noexcept	throw
evaluating the expression function cannot throw an exception so noexcept function evaluates to true
note that this is not the same as evaluating the expression would certainly evaluate to false since the member function pointer is not qualified noexcept

18152727
postgresql	mysql
note the above code works for mysql but not for postgresql
the documentation for postgresql select says an output column s name can be used to refer to the column s value in order by and group by clauses but not in the where or having clauses

18154214
hex	binary
binary data should be viewed in hex form third parameter set to false or saved to file and browsed by hex editor
you are using third parameter set to true in hash function so your output is in binary format that is not suitable to be viewed in standard output

18155102
primes	modulus
an advice about using a primes rather than a composite number without knowledge of the values to hash is not better than claiming 87654321 is the best modulus for hashing
if you want to hash primes numbers or fibonacci numbers then advices about using a primes modulus or composite modulus or a power of 2 are irrelevant

18156248
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu is probably the easiest of the nixes for non- nix users so you shouldn t fear the requirement of having to learn how to use linux
ubuntu and virtualbox will take care of most of the difficult stuff for you and what you can t figure out by virtue of the fact that you are knowledgeable enough about computers to be programming you will learn from pebble s instructions and quick google searches

18156839
prepare	execute
however each client can create their own prepare statement to use
however they also say that postgresql may but not need to save a plan for this query in memory for future reusing if a prepare statement is execute enough times the server may eventually decide to save and re-use a generic plan rather than re-planning each time

18156839
prepare	execute
however they also say that postgresql may but not need to save a plan for this query in memory for future reusing if a prepare statement is execute enough times the server may eventually decide to save and re-use a generic plan rather than re-planning each time
this will occur immediately if the prepare statement has no parameters

18156967
google-chrome	firefox
firefox google-chrome white paper according to the articles above firefox sends a header which makes it easy to detect but the google-chrome white paper states that google-chrome doesn t give any indication to the server
the google-chrome white paper notes that external analytic solutions scripts written in js will not count the prefetch hits when they use the page visibility api

18157131
profiling	debugging
now this may just be me speaking when i should keep my mouth shut because i have little insight into the visual studio profiling and i have no idea why if one would want to instrumentation obj binaries rather than bin and therefore i guess i d better describe my train of thought vs is looking for the symbol files the .instr.pdb file specifically in the asp.net temporary files location because that s where it loaded the class library dll from
it won t find it though because that file is created in obj debugging in the class library project and not copied over to the web application s bin folder - so it never gets shadow copied to asp.net temporary files either

18158433
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
for this particular case where you don t actually want to do any data-binding so you can just use a custom presenter - see blounty s answer or see this project demo - if you ever do need to convert third party viewcontroller base classes so that they support data-binding then the easiest way is exactly what you guessed inherit from them to provide an eventsource -viewcontroller inherit from the eventsource -viewcontroller to add the mvx bindingcontext this technique is exactly how mvvmcross itself extends each of uiviewcontroller uitableviewcontroller uitabbarcontroller etc in order to provide data-binding
for example see extending uiviewcontroller to provide an eventsource - mvxeventsourceviewcontroller.cs extending the event source viewcontroller to provide a binding context - mvxviewcontroller.cs note that because c# doesn t have any multiple-inhertiance or any true mixin support this adaption of viewcontrollers does involve a little cut-and-paste but we have tried to minimise this through the use of event hooks and extension methods

18159139
profiling	debugging
a nearly identical process could be used to setup for app store distribution -- replace references from development provisioning profiling to app store distribution profiling as well as omit those test device configurations that aren t applicable to distribution builds and you should be good to go
should you rather try and debugging using what you currently have then read on at the core of code sign is the need for your appids to match up in each of the documents issued by the certificates identifiers and profiles tool as well as in the build configuration of your xcode project

18164956
ssl	https
here is a run down of the steps i took to get things flowing ssl notes ssl signalr owin webapplication requires binding a certificate to a port
use iis to generate an self-signed cert this should place the certificate into the local computer personal certificates folder in certmgr in certmgr shift+drag certificate to local computer trusted root certification authorities certificates folder which should make a copy of it there run the following command to bind the ssl certificate to 0.0.0.0 8080 output run the following netsh command to reserve all ip addresses for port 8080 to the my service application id and service account output update the myservices.exe.config file to use https protocol these are appsetting keys used to dynamically set the protocol and port of signalr when my service starts start the my service using the netstat start command run the following netsh command to show the service state is occupying the registered url output my application does not depend on iis but once i used iis to temporarily create a port binding to my ssl certificate my application started to work and i was able to inspect the netsh servicestate to see how iis does it

18165141
division	subtraction
division requires iterative subtraction that cannot be performed simultaneously so it takes longer
in fact some fp units speed up division by performing a reciprocal approximation and multiplying by that

18166637
vmware	virtualbox
as you mentioned you could use vmware workstation or virtualbox
however vmware workstation is not free

18168594
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
update i was thinking and as junedahsan suggest usernotexistexception could be better a checkedexception extends from exception and not runtimeexception
from this link unchecked-exception controversy if a client can reasonably be expected to recover from an exception make it a checked exception

18168859
innodb	myisam
mysql includes components such as the innodb storage engine that adhere closely to the acid model so that data is not corrupted and results are not distorted by exceptional conditions such as software crashes and hardware malfunctions
for myisam however for myisam storage engine which is non-transactional

18169008
build.gradle	gradlew
finally projects not using build.gradle imported from eclipse worked just fine
only projects created in android studio using gradlew refused to compile and returned the curious dexfile packagedebug error

18169336
rvm	bundler
this kind of thing could happen when gems are linked wrong try this rvm get head rvm reinstall 1.9.3-p448 rvm use 1.9.3-p448 this will reinstall the ruby and make all gems pristine which should prevent such problems from happening - unless gem authors did some extra tricks which go out of standard ruby detection
update using bundler s flag --deployment or --path is not always safe the error message says which means the gem was compiled with the other ruby and now can not find it

18169508
jar	manifest.mf
the easiest way is to use the included jar builder of your ide. java brings a tool which also can create jarfiles take a look creating a jar file your jdk bin jar cf jar-file input-file s in both ways you have to check your classpath written in your manifest edit jcreator pro is quite easy click configure options tools new create jar file this creates an user tool to create a jar file this does not yet include the manifest you will have to manually add the manifest
or you can configure the command line switches to incorporate the manifest try this for example cvmf prjdir manifest.mf prjname .jar

18169990
opengl-es	glsurfaceview
the cause of this bad match problem is more than just a mismatch between the glsurfaceview s pixel format and the color bit depth settings of opengl-es
overall we have to deal with the following issues a mismatch of the opengl-es api version a mismatch of the requested target surface type the requested color bit depth cannot be rendered on the surface view the android developer documentation is severely lacking when it comes to explaining the opengl-es api

18170943
gradle	ivy
gradle uses groovy for its build files
beside maven or ivy support it has it s own dependency manager now after having used ivy in the past and not being satisfied

18172414
svg	vml
the only down-side of svg is that it isn t supported by old versions of ie ie8 and earlier
however these browsers do support an alternative language called vml and several good javascript libraries exist which will work with either thus allowing you complete cross-browser compatibility

18174378
factors	mean
the current accepted answer is not good enough you should check window.matchmedia you can detect viewport dimension changes but you must calculate factors such as orientation and aspect ratios and there is no guarantee our calculation will match our browser assumptions when it applies media query rules
i mean you can calculate x but your browser assumption can be y

18175122
spaces	delimiter
if the delimiter were always the same such as a spaces you might use an array and then use join
because the delimiter you want on the string seem to vary according to which part of the string they follow some have others have there s probably not a lot you can do there

18175521
realloc	malloc
if you re lucky your app will crash if you re unlucky things will appear to work but you ll lose the second half of the data you ve read since only the data written to memory you own will be moved by realloc if it relocates your heap cell
also you shouldn t cast the return from malloc or realloc and can rely on sizeof char being 1

18175923
prepare	execute
it does not create a prepare statement like mysqli prepare to be used with mysqli_stmt bind_param and execute with mysqli_stmt execute
furthermore the query parameter in the prepare statement must consist of a single sql statement

18177073
noexcept	throw
if a function can throw an exception for whatever reason even if it is std bad_alloc you should not declared it as noexcept
there are relatively few functions which really can t throw an exception and where it actually also matters

18177073
noexcept	throw
the primary need for noexcept functions is to allow the detection of the available error recovery options in case of an exception for example can use move construction when inserting an object assuming that move construction doesn t throw
if move construction can throw moving objects cannot be used to recover for an exception when implementing strong exception safe operations

18177988
sqldatasource	datalist
this is true only for manually databound controls not for declarative datasource controls like sqldatasource or objectdatasource
i assume that you are databinding the datalist on every postback

18179605
highcharts	fusioncharts
fusioncharts probably is the best option if you have a license for it to do the more optimal marimekko charts i ve done a little work trying to get a marimekko charts solution in highcharts
it s not perfect but approximates the first marimekko charts example found here on the fusioncharts page the key is to use a datetime axis as that mode provides you more flexibility for the how you distribute points and line on the x axis which provides you the ability to have variably sized bars that you can construct on this axis

18180866
floating-point	fractions
you might want to to know what every computer scientist should know about floating-point arithmetic for more information
using int inside your loop will fix the problem this is happening because decimal fractions might lose precision they re not represented exactly

18184442
octal	decimal	octal	hex
assuming you have a character code that is a degree sign on your display with a custom display i wouldn t necessarily expect it to live at the common place in the extended ibm ascii character set or that the display supports unicode character encoding then you can use the encoding nnn or xhh where nnn is up to three digits in octal base 8 or hh is up to two digits of hex code
unfortunately there is no decimal encoding available - dennis ritchie and or brian kernighan were probably more used to using octal as that was quite common at the time when c was first developed

18184748
textview	imageview
in your textview set the drawable in right or left top bottom
do not use separate imageview for icon

18186581
super	extends
you do have a super class
all classes in java automatically extends java.lang.object regardless of whether you specify it or not

18187791
translation	localization
in other localization systems like android string resources or rails yaml files it works like you imagined -- the equivalent to a msgid is a single key even for plurals but then the real phrase is not used in the source code and defining translation is a two-steps action even for the original language
one of the ideas behind gettext is that the msgid is extracted from source files to create pot files which are used as base for translation stored in po files and later compiled to mo files

18189399
innodb	myisam
i have some very large tables mostly myisam and a few innodb cache tables and it is not practical to mysqldump the data
since we are still running myisam xtrabackup is not an option

18191232
gunicorn	uwsgi
if you are using gunicorn to serve your django application on heroku like on their tutorial you will not be able to see the werkzeug debbuger because gunicorn does not use werkzeug
you have to serve you django application on heroku using wsgi based server that uses werkzeug like uwsgi

18191609
ubuntu	debian
it seems that the debian ubuntu php doesn t bundle the gd library with it some security reason
you have to recompile php follow this helpful step by step guide on doing so with debian ubuntu open up a terminal. become root by typing su and enter your root password when prompted

18196944
innodb	myisam
if the server is correcly configured innodb will really blast away myisam on performance
innodb with good indexes maybe even good partitions. innodb is designed to have better performance with multible threads clients read more clients at the same time vs myisam is not build for that

18199780
required	placeholder
make sure b.use placeholder in simple_form.rb make sure b.use input instead of b.use label_input most important modify your simple_form.en.yml en simple_form yes yes no no required text required mark placeholder user name name in your page every placeholder needs to be defined here or it will not display
you need 3 steps to enable showing placeholder instead of labels automatically and need to do more configurations

18200121
ssl	https
my best guess is that it s a variation of this behaviour kb 815313 - prevent caching when you download active documents over ssl archive so if you re seeing ie work through each font in the developer tools network view it might be worth checking if you have a cache-control header and removing it
i ran into this problem with https but not http

18202753
postgresql	mysql
note you do not need the username or password in database config if you are using the postgresql app
ok if you are set on using postgresql over mysql that comes with mamp you have to manually install postgresql on you location machine the osx packages can be found here if you don t want to do a full install i recommend this postgresql app just download an extract to your applications folder then when you launch it the port number will be displayed in the menu bar like so create a database go to menu above click on open psql in the command line create you database like so create database your_database_name

18203894
implements	extends
i don t know of the justification for arraydeque choosing not to implements equality but if you want to compare two deques you could easily just convert them into lists or arrays and do it that way
linkedlist extends abstractsequentiallist which extends abstractlist which does override equals and hashcode - so the implementation is not inherited from object

18205220
svg	vml
they use various techniques and offer various features so you ll need to evaluate them yourself to determine which is most suitable to your situation but most of them ultimately convert the svg to vml as a fall-back for old ie
one or two of them also use other technologies flash silverlight etc to do the conversion which may be a good thing since vml can be slow and also because ie isn t the only old browser still in use that doesn t support svg eg android 2.3 and earlier

18208184
floating-point	fixed-point
mysql doc floating-point data types can only store approximate numbers
use a fixed-point data type total decimal 20 2 unsigned not null the decimal and numeric types store exact numeric data values

18208725
super	self
the following code leads to an infinite recursion error class base object def method self print original class derived base def method self print derived super type self self .method class subclass derived def method self print subclass of derived super subclass self .method demo because type self is subclass not derived in derived.method
in the example the mro for subclass is and super needs to know where to start searching for any overridden methods

18211779
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
persistenceexception extends runtimeexception
this means that is an unchecked-exception so it does not have to be explicitly declared or handled

18214273
ubuntu	debian
currently the debian ubuntu activemq packages are incomplete
excerpt from usr share doc libactivemq-java readme.debian disabled features this package doesn t contains yet all features provided by upstream as some dependencies are missing from debian

18216026
implements	extends
additionally here s a jsfiddle implements your multiple-row layout which you gave as a comment in one of the answers
the reason why overflow hidden doesn t quite work is because #bb would actually still extends below the viewport - just no vertical scrollbar would be created because that overflowing region is ignored by the browser

18218202
google-chrome	firefox
firefox will pick the last one in the list woff working or not ie will use eot and google-chrome will pick the first one that works svg
woff works too in google-chrome but causes aliased glyphs so putting svg ahead of woff solves that

18218518
touchesbegan	touchesended
the reason the subview does not get the touchesended event is that it has not received the touchesbegan event these two come in pairs - whichever view gets the touchesbegan is going to get the touchesended
your uiimageview could not get touchesended because it wasn t there at the time

18223875
setinterval	settimeout
if you want to loop code for animations or clocks then use setinterval
settimeout settimeout is a time based code execution method that will execute script only one time when the interval is reached and not repeat again unless you gear it to loop the script by nesting the settimeout object inside of the function it calls to run

18227522
inline-functions	inlining
of course this also assumes the compiler can actually see the source code of the function - only if you use whole program optimisation available in at least ms and gcc compilers does it inline-functions that aren t either in the source file or headers included in the source
obviously inlining a large function has very little benefit because the overhead of making the call is such a small portion of the total runtime and if the function gets called more than once or may be called more than once by not being static the compiler will almost certainly not inline a large function

18227579
qevent	qobject
your mistake is that qevent does not inherit from qobject and you try to do it
you should not use q_object macros or you should interhit your class from qobject too

18234252
textview	imageview
textview is not optimal for what you need and will not scale easily
in your oncreate you need to set the set to loading.. or something and start the task and then extra note i would personally use an imageview for the picture

18238760
vb.net	vb6
vb.net is actually the name of two rather different languages which are selected based upon the option strict setting
the option strict off dialect which is unfortunately the default was designed to facilitate porting of vb6 code and has horrible goofy semantics which are even worse than those of vb6 i m not sure even its designers know all of the odd corner cases of the way different types interact

18240803
udp	tcp
however the caveat is that udp does not guarantee that your message will actually arrive
to guarantee that your message arrives you must implement some kind of acknowledgment retry protocol but if you do that you might as well use tcp since that s what it does

18244030
cypher	gremlin
that said i ll go with something more objective first step would be to decide on gremlin vs cypher since they re not the same thing nor the same style
when making that decision and maybe that decision is use both you should really take a close look at neo4j 2.0 development currently at milestone 4 as cypher is maturing rapidly and there s a lot of work being put into it both from expressiveness point of view and performance point of view

18244097
g++	gcc
on ubuntu the c++ compiler is in the package g++ separate from gcc which is a c compiler not a c++ compiler so be sure to sudo apt-get install g++
you need a c++ compiler to build gcc

18244114
oncreate	setcontentview
the behavior you are seeing is because of the way your oncreate is set up when setcontentview int is called r.layout.activity_main is inflated and your activity s view is set
following this you are inflating r.layout.activity_main again view v is not the same view as the one already set by setcontentview r.layout.activity_main null

18244316
implements	extends
if you then dig into the monogame source code on github we can see how they implements the check so it seems that your licenseinformation is either not set to active or is set to trial if you having issues testing
the first link has information on how to test it but i m not sure how to extends that to monogame now test your app using simulated calls to the license server

18244754
hex	binary
try writing out your conversions by hand and not using an online bin hex notation converter -- then in a couple days it will become natural and quicker as a result
aside even though binary literals are not a c standard if you compile with gcc it is possible to use binary literals they should be prefixed with 0b or 0b

18244816
keystore	jks
i found this as a non-accepted answer on stackoverflow the cannot store non-privatekeys error message usually indicates you are trying to use secret symmetric keys with a jks keystore type
the jks keystore type only supports asymmetric public private keys

18246606
quicksort	heapsort
at worse quicksort could end up recursing n times which is definitely not acceptable for a production-quality implementation
switching to heapsort at is just a good heuristic in general to detect a much too deep number of recursions

18248760
gridview	sqldatasource
sometimes because we don t use the oracle tools and sometimes because of incorrect gridview markup
since you do not require to update value of column charge_id you cannot use a boundfield for the same unless you specify it in datakeynames property of sqldatasource

18249405
prepare	execute
what you want to do is add a profile that is configured to include the test you want then you need to configure surefire by default to not execute your preflight check and then finally you need to tell maven that this profile should be active only during release prepare s forked execution note it is vitally important to have the + in front of the profile name so that you are adding the profile to the list of active profiles otherwise your release prepare step will not be validating that the build works with the release profile active and you can have a subsequent release perform fail
note a less complex route would be to just put the surefire configuration into the release profile that you are using by default that has the id of release but that is more error prone as you could change that via the parent pom.xml - if you decide to push your project to central the sonatype-oss-parent changes the release profile to sonatype-release - and then you won t see the build being failed as the test would not be execute until you change your pom.xml to match new the release profile s id.

18250127
uiview	subviews
uiviewcontroller is responsible for creating and configuring uiview instances and cannot be displayed
normally a uiviewcontroller is made to control a full-screen view which you can add subviews on

18251809
qtoolbutton	qpushbutton
thats why we use qtoolbutton customization instead of writing own widgets for displaying urls
as i know hover modificator does not process dynamic changes of properties for qpushbutton

18253296
gradle	ivy
that said gradle s dependency model doesn t capture licenses
unless you have some external service that you can query for this information the other option is to parse maven ivy module descriptors

18253459
serializable	deserialization
a serializable wants to also be able to deserialize the data afterwards
it doesn t serialize it because it can t offer deserialization without a setter

18254617
macports	homebrew
you ll need to pick one or the other and stick with it as homebrew doesn t play nicely with macports or vice versa depending on your pov
overriding choice for me is macports as it has many more packages than homebrew and it puts its stuff in opt local to stay out of the way of other programs

18255635
multiplying	addition	multiplying	multiplication	addition	multiplication
for example for matrix multiplying with numpy arrays in addition you can use the matrix class more information on broadcasting numpy arrays can be found here and more information on the matrix class can be found here
the operator for numpy arrays is element wise multiplication similar to the hadamard product for arrays of the same dimension not matrix multiplying

18256575
ssl	https
if you need access to the session on both ssl and non-ssl domains you will want to disable this you open file config core.php and add as bellow now you can switch http and https that not lose session
you can read more in documentation cakephp at cakephp s defaults to setting session.cookie_secure to true when your application is on an ssl protocol

18262905
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
i ve personally tested this solution in current versioning of firefox google-chrome safari as well as ie 7 8 9 10
borrowing from his examples the following would work in place of my example above and could be used to achieve what you re going after i ve heard it told that older versioning of safari don t handle the javascript uri scheme very well but i couldn t find a way to confirm as everyone using safari seems to upgrade regularly

18267666
udp	tcp
some references for further reading tcp handshake tcp details udp details
this is simply not possible because of how tcp works

18269176
mp4	h.264
i would look at how your mp4 video is encoded as several formats of video and audio can be wrapped in an .mp4 container
there is a good post from mozilla on media formats supported by html it states the mp4 container format with the h.264 video codec and either the aac audio codec or the mp3 audio codec is natively supported by internet explorer safari and chrome but chromium and opera do not support the format

18269176
opera	google-chrome
there is a good post from mozilla on media formats supported by html it states the mp4 container format with the h.264 video codec and either the aac audio codec or the mp3 audio codec is natively supported by internet explorer safari and google-chrome but chromium and opera do not support the format
also this so answer states google-chrome can play .mp4 with h-264 video but not mpeg-4 visual video

18271646
webkit	gecko
it returns a css rule set in order of inheritance applied by the browser and it is what the webkit inspector used some time ago
for gecko based browsers like firefox there seems to be a polyfill available here although i ve not tested it

18271647
verilog	vhdl
you could get all this from section 5 of the verilog lrm but it doesn t make much sense
all the language was grafted on late in the standardisation process and uses vhdl terminology that s not used elsewhere in the lrm

18272546
octal	decimal
what you ve missed is that 7700 in octal is 4032 in decimal
thus the reason why it isn t working is that javascript is treating your 0-prefixed numbers that contain no digit above 7 as octal

18273199
skip-lists	tree
b-trees sound like a possible candidate given that they pack many nodes together and thus do not suffer from the linkage overhead as much as avls skip-lists or red-black tree
i think it would be similarly interesting to investigate radix tree especially if there happens to be a lot of successive integers in your lists because such ranges would get compressed by the radix tree

18281629
uilabel	uitextview
you could replace it with a uitextview when the user needs to edit a field but using uilabel while scrolling should improve the speed considerably
well the uitextview is a more advanced view that s scrollable and supports custom text formatting so you might not be able to get it to not blend

18281965
imperative	declarative
declarative classes another benefit of going the subclassing way is that it allows you to keep your code declarative instead of imperative the above class declaration is shared by all instances of the myapp.view.panel including both the store config option and the initcomponent method override but when you instantiate this class or its subclasses initcomponent method will operate on whatever configuration is current for the particular class
so when using such class you will have a choice of either overriding the store config for the instance or just falling back to the default configuration provided by the class you can also subclass it overriding part of the config or behavior but not everything declarative vs imperative compare that to the imperative approach in which you will have to specify the full configuration for the stock class instance every time the biggest disadvantage of the code above is that everything happens to the class instance when it is already halfway initialized initcomponent is called by the constructor

18282841
required	placeholder
however when you want to display the results of a core image filter chain the thing needs to be evaluated then and there which is not a good situation if the then and there is during a rapidly-scrolling view and the filter in question required heavy processing many of them do
you can try fiddling with gpu vs cpu processing but i have found that the overhead of moving image data to and from ciimage can be a more significant overhead see my answer here my recommendation is to treat this kind of processing the same way as you would treat the populating of a scrolling view with online images - process asynchronously use placeholder eg the preprocessed image and cache results for reuse

18284357
icmp	udp	icmp	tcp
if it fails then something definitely went wrong incidentally an icmp error message is sent back if a udp packet is received that is addressed to a port that is not open for udp or if something actively refuses the packet on the way
you d have to use both of the above to check both tcp and udp

18284357
icmp	tcp
note that inetaddress uses an icmp request as ping by default but if it does not have permission to do that it will fall back on attempting to establish a tcp connection instead
however in the case that it does have permission to generate icmp packets there is no way to force it to attempt a tcp connection instead

equals	compareto
what does very much matter but you do not show here is that your equals method on person should return true if and only if compareto returns 0
your compareto method can only return 0 if both persons have the same first name and last name

18286427
implements	extends
this burdens the class implementer with the responsibility to implements every declared method
more importantly this also means that extends an interface is not possible after publication

18286616
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome happens to provide the event object in global scope hence no error but firefox doesn t hence an error
i d suggest to add the event parameter to the event handler there is an additional difference if you don t define the event parameter event will refer to the native event object in google-chrome which is different than the event object which jquery passes to the handler

18286888
prepare	execute
the problem apart from the date issue as mentioned by bgp is the line you are trying to execute a query string on a prepare statement which is not allowed by the jdbc standard mysql should actually throw an exception instead of sending it to the server as it currently does but the end result is the same
the documentation of statement.executequery string sql says throws sqlexception - if a database access error occurs this method is called on a closed statement the given sql statement produces anything other than a single resultset object the method is called on a preparedstatement or callablestatement emphasis mine the reason is that you want to execute the prepare statement not any other query

18287976
serializable	deserialization
if you want to bind a json string to date this process is called deserialization not serializable
to bind a json string to date create a custom date deserialization annotate created_date or its setter with where you have to implement the method public date deserialize ... to tell jackson how to convert a string to a date

hex	binary
you need to use hex numbers that is opcode 000101 in hex is 0x5.
c does not support binary number constants

18291360
comparator	comparable
try creating your priorityqueue with a custom comparator that can compare softreference s
a priorityqueue created without a custom comparator expects its elements to implement comparable and softreference does not

18291714
opengl-es	glsurfaceview
if you want more than one opengl-es context running concurrently that is much more complicated but it has been discussed recently on the khronos.org opengl-es forum
glsurfaceview is not designed to do this but you can do it by using textureviews instead

18300039
lodash	underscore.js
the extras in lodash are also quite useful
as for xananax s highly upvoted comment suggesting contribution to underscore.js s code it s always better to have good competition not only does it keep innovation going but also drives you to keep yourself or your library in good shape

18302348
equals	compareto
the semantics of compareto returning 0 is that the two objects are well equals
having another definition of the same relation in the other method can obviously result in many kinds of trouble as documented in your quote as well the typical algorithms in sortedset implementations rely on compareto but the general contract of the set interface specifies that it must not contain two objects which are equals

18302352
equals	compareto	comparator	comparable
you can see it in set s documentation note that the ordering maintained by a set whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if it is to correctly implement the code set interface
see code comparable or code comparator for a precise definition of consistent with equals . this is so because the code set interface is defined in terms of the code equals operation but a code treeset instance performs all element comparisons using its code compareto or code compare method so two elements that are deemed equal by this method are from the standpoint of the set equal

18304983
firefox	safari
to make it work in firefox just insert the new element into the dom apendchild etc
i don t think this will work in safari isn t properly supported yet afaik

18305171
opera	google-chrome
just note that opera probably until they switch to webkit stuff doesn t like this
this should work. the following has been tested in google-chrome notice i put backslashes to escape enters. if you d rather just have an invisible print frame the user clicks a button and a print dialog appears use an iframe

18308601
prepare	execute
you usually prepare queries in order to improve performance of mass data insertion or to prevent users from doing sql injection there may be more reasons but that doesn t affect the behaviour of transactions
from the view of the transaction it doesn t matter if a normal query or a prepared one is execute

18308911
oncreate	findviewbyid
replace this by in oncreate you can findviewbyid of the current view hierarchy set to the activity
since you have not set the layout to the activity your findviewbyid fails

18310220
jar	war
note that a war is like a zip file you can unpack it replace the jar file and zip it again
note that i would not recommend to simply replace a jar in a war

18310435
google-chrome	firefox
your code will work you just need to set run-at document-start doc like so important this will work for now on google-chrome and with tampermonkey but it does not work on other browsers
for example on firefox the document.write call will throw the error error the operation is insecure

18312045
gradle	ivy
if the build uses libraries from maven or ivy repositories you ll have to let gradle download them again
there isn t currently a reliable way to transfer the gradle dependency cache between computers. assuming the build doesn t reference any files outside the project directory which hopefully is the case what s left to transfer is the project directory best via source control and any personal gradle.properties or init.gradle that you might have in .gradle

18312480
persistent	transient
yes all filds are persistent by default
if you want to have a field that is not persistet you need to annotate it with transient transient private int salary

18313251
spaces	delimiter
so final command would be or find -name core.txt | xargs du -sh in 2nd command xargs will not handle spaces in file name
so we can tell exact delimiter to xargs to handle spaces in file name

18316119
queue	fifo
the second option is also pretty heavily reliant on having access to the super implementation as it would require you manually create your own dispatch queue to execute tasks on
i think it goes without saying that if you use a serial dispatch queue then you have fifo ordering in this queue same as you dispatch_get_main_queue only you wouldn t have to execute on the main thread

18316119
queue	fifo
i think it goes without saying that if you use a serial dispatch queue then you have fifo ordering in this queue same as you dispatch_get_main_queue only you wouldn t have to execute on the main thread
and the last option i can think of wouldn t necessarily require you to modify the super class but would require you to know the queue on which super was executing

18318307
hive	hdfs
the key difference between external and managed table in hive is that data in the external table is not managed by hive
when you create external table you define hdfs directory for that table and hive is simply looking in it and can get data from it but hive can t delete or change data in that folder

18318894
implements	extends
if it can vary with multiple implementations that extends the superclass then it should probably be defined as an abstract method in the superclass and implements by the subclassing
one of the more common uses of an abstract class is to have abstract methods that are not implements in abstract class but implements in subclassing in java program

18321941
cufft	fftw
this will allow you to use cufft in a fftw application with a minimum amount of changes
as indicated in the documentation there should only be two steps requred it is recommended that you replace the include file fftw3.h with cufftw.h instead of linking with the double single precision libraries such as fftw3 fftw3f libraries link with both the cufft and cufftw libraries regarding the doc item you excerpted that step moving the data explicitly is not required if you re just using the cufftw compatibility interface

18321941
cufft	fftw
personally i would recommend changing your data types to cufft data types but there should be no functional or performance difference at this time
although you don t mention it cufft will also require you to move the data between cpu host and gpu a concept that is not relevant for fftw

18321941
cufft	fftw
although you don t mention it cufft will also require you to move the data between cpu host and gpu a concept that is not relevant for fftw

backbone.js	javascriptmvc
i suggest you study backbone.js example here backbone.js is the simplest javascriptmvc library not a framework that you can find
it clearly defines what model the data that is synced to rest api view this is kind of confusing as view plus router in backbone.js is equal to controller in mvc world and template this is the view in mvc world

18325690
onresume	onpause
thats because there s a chance that onstart might not get called even when onresume actually is there s a scenario when the activity might go to onpause only without going to onstop it only happens when activity is partially visible not completelly covered by another activity hence when comming back to activity only onresume will be called and not onstart
same with onpause its always executed before onstop but onstop might not be called after onpause as mentioned before it could be called without onstop being actually called

18329611
datamapper	activerecord
you really should take a look at sequel if you re considering datamapper fwiw i will be migrating away from activerecord to sequel
however if you like the opinionated rails ideology then you shouldn t look any further than activerecord for least friction

18331547
implements	extends
you can only force it to implements a method by making it abstract
so if you can not make mymotherclass abstract you can only introduce another superclass that extends mymotherclass and delegates to the method that must be implemented edit i found another interessting way of solving the problem in the hemcrest api that is used by mockito

18333667
passenger	puma
both puma and phusion passenger enterprise can be hybrid multi-process multi-threaded
that is running multiple multithreaded processes. hybrid mode allows ruby and python which despite having a global interpreter lock to fully utilize all cpu cores. 1 in puma the hybrid mode is called clustered . 1 only the case on mri not on jruby and rubinius

jruby	mri	mri	rubinius
that is running multiple multithreaded processes. hybrid mode allows ruby and python which despite having a global interpreter lock to fully utilize all cpu cores. 1 in puma the hybrid mode is called clustered . 1 only the case on mri not on jruby and rubinius
jruby and rubinius fully support multi-core threads in a single process

18333853
multiplication	exponent
p.s. code posted in the question is also 100 working but slower than new one even if it uses fewer multiplication - because of more memory needed for recursion and not optimized multiplicants order
i have a solution sub-terms of t2 are always prime exponent where exponent can be computed on small integers like this where e is exponent p is prime and n4 is code for the new equation here are rough time measurements for the first 128 factorials so you can estimate real complexity

18338015
ssl	https
i found the solution which is basically to define the ssl options and the ssl certificate outside the server block key things ssl on
is the only thing that needs to be within the server blocks that listen in https you can put it outside too but what will make the server blocks that listen in port 80 to use https protocol and not the expected http

18338215
ppm	pgm
note that formally ppm pgm files are a bit more annoying to read there could be comments in the header but those generated by convert are clean for example those produced by gimp are not unfortunately
a simple solution is to use pgm file format for grayscale or ppm file format for rgb because they are trivial to read from code then use imagemagick to do the conversion the linux command is for example convert myfile.jpg myfile.ppm

implements	extends
few notes about your code your code is not extends the japplet you are not implements the public void sart method
you are not implements the public void init method

18343101
udp	tcp
so it is perfectly ok to have a tcp socket and a udp socket both bound to the same ip port pairs since their transports are different
a udp packet cannot be routed to a tcp socket and vice versa they can be routed to a raw socket though

18345031
client-side	server-side
also it s not clear where you are storing your client-side secret key based on your question
if so this is another problem with your server-side code

direct3d	directx
answer from microsoft xna forum the direct3d 9 developer runtime aka d3d9d.dll in the legacy directx sdk june 2010 is not compatible with windows 8
in fact the entire developer runtime in the legacy directx sdk june 2010 is not compatible with windows 8 or with windows 7 sp1 with kb 2370838 installed

18352898
noexcept	throw
throw an exception is ok for functions as well but its not really an option here because it explicitly says noexcept
throw would trigger a call to std terminate leading to program termination itself but previosuly to an implementation defined amount of stack unwinding wich in fact means would still be applicable

18354370
implements	extends
this is great because it prevents you to have to implements addheader sys.error this is not supported for certain classes in the hierarchy when it becomes dirty or to refactor it to avoid it becomes dirty
the best way to manage implicit is to put them in a trait like the following and then you provide also an object in case user can t mix it for example if you have frameworks that investigate through reflection properties of the object you don t want extra properties to be added to your current instance object headeradders extends headeradders so for example you can write things such as mixing example class mytest extends headeradders who cares about having two extra value in the object import example import headeradders._ class mydomainclass implicits are in scope but not mixed inside mydomainclass so reflection from hiberante will still work correctly by the way this design problem is the same of scala collections with the only difference that your httpmessage is traversablelike

18355510
equals	gethashcode
equals doesn t internally call gethashcode
gethashcode is used by many classes as a means to improve performance if the hash codes of two instances differ the instances are not equal by definition so the call to equals can be skipped

18355510
equals	gethashcode
gethashcode is used by many classes as a means to improve performance if the hash codes of two instances differ the instances are not equals by definition so the call to equals can be skipped
only if the hash codes are the same it needs to call equals because multiple instances can have the same hash code even if they are different

18360587
spaces	delimiter
description i would change your split command to use tag substrings as a delimiter or the spaces
this basic regex will match tags or will match spaces it will not match spaces inside tags will avoid many of the pitfalls with pattern matching html text with this regex you can do all sorts of crazy things depending on where you place the capturing paranthesse and the options used in preg_split

super	implements
httpservletresponse doesn t have a getwriter method but it is defined in the servletresponse super interface more specifically here servletresponse#getwriter
for example in your doget method of your servlet you receive a httpservletresponse parameter that the application server sends with an instance of a class that implements this interface

18365897
equals	icomparable
since the objects in your two lists aren t referencing the same objects none of them are equals to each other even though they may have the same values internally
the fact that attribute implements icomparable is irrelivant

18369042
email	dkim
that doesn t mean that it technically or ethically correct to send an email on the behalf of that address
doing something like that is virtually guaranteed to run afoul of spf or dkim checks these days and all your mail will be tossed in the bin

18369508
implements	extends
the corresponding java code would look like something like this for your new defintion of foo when you mix foo into a concrete class bar what happens at the jvm level is that bar extends the interface foo and it implements method verifyconsistency by simply forwarding the call to the reason why it is done this way is that the jvm object model does not support multiple inheritance
the traits implementations cannot be simply put in classes that you would extends from because you can only ever extends a single class on the jvm

18370813
client-side	server-side
the and variables should not be the same keys associated with the iam user you created for client-side tasks
you should have created a different iam user with permissions appropriate for server-side tasks

18371416
equals	icomparable
if not methods such as contains must call the equals object method which boxes the affected list element
if the value type implements the icomparable interface and you own the source code also implement the icomparable generic interface to prevent the binarysearch and sort methods from boxing list elements

18371480
implements	extends
of course in addition to extends java.lang.object your anonymous class implements actionlistener - that s why you can pass it to the addactionlistener method
an interface does not have a constructor but an anonymous class does like all classes it extends java.lang.object implicitly therefore it can call the object s parameterless constructor

18372332
mp4	h.264
so a file that has a m4a file extension is an mp4 file that can contain a aac audio track but it is not always the case that s why programs like mediainfo become handy to know what is inside a file
there are raw video and audio streams this streams cannot be played directly on most video audio player they need to be encapsulated on a transport a raw h.264 video stream and a raw aac audio stream need to be inside a mp4 encapsulator it can be also inside an avi or mov encapsulator

18372332
mp4	h.264
there are raw video and audio streams this streams cannot be played directly on most video audio player they need to be encapsulated on a transport a raw h.264 video stream and a raw aac audio stream need to be inside a mp4 encapsulator it can be also inside an avi or mov encapsulator
a mp4 file can contain a h.264 video stream and or an aac audio stream but for some reason someone decided that a mp4 file that contains video and audio use the file extension m4v v for video and if it is an mp4 file that only contains audio to use the m4a extension that is a common practice in other encapsulators like windows media which use wmv and wma or ogg which use ogv and oga silly as it seems

18373255
ssl	https
assuming you re using rails 3 have a look at this post on how to set up webrick to use ssl
setting the source to http instead of https is not recommended as it creates security issues. try pinging this will tell you if the problem is with your connection issues or not

18374997
super	self
what they mean by might produce a substitute object is not that it might return an object of a type of class you are expecting but rather that their super init method might create a different instance of the same class
thus the return for super init might be a different object than self is which is why you need to do rather than just

18375950
sum	coalesce
sum converts its result into an appropriate datatype based on the input values
so you might be able to solve this by running the sum against a larger type select sum convert bigint datediff minute shutdown_timestamp coalesce restore_timestamp getdate as downtime from tx_quad_status nolock if bigint doesn t work you might try decimal 38 0

18376255
super	self
if is is not self contained you could try and declare it in some super class and let the other 100 classes extends that class
assuming that this method is self contained you could create a static class and put this method as a static method in it which is in turn called by the other classes

18382989
hive	hdfs
based on the exception i would say that you are using cloudera connector powered by teradata that sadly do not currently support hive imports and hence the exception about unsupported parameter --hive-import
you can easily workaround the issue by using the connector to import data into hdfs as they are and loading them into hive using load data command yourself

18383431
onresume	onpause
you should register and unregister your receivers in onresume and in onpause respectively
cause if you only register it in oncreate and unregister in onpause then the next time the activity is brought to the foreground oncreate will not be called again and then it will not register the receiver again

implements	extends
you run into this situation just an idea extract from currentclass the first superclass that implements or override executequery and inject into or override executequery in your current class foe example overriding executequery in currentclass you will have i hope to be clear english is not my native language
i think problem is this you are adding field in currentclass your public class com.mysql.jdbc.serverpreparedstatement extends com.mysql.jdbc.preparedstatement not directly implements java.sql.preparedstatement but your are override method com.mysql.jdbc.preparedstatement.executequery from javadoc ctclass.getmethod - the returned method may be declared in a super class

g++	gcc
g++ is taking the file as being c++ so it is happy with the reference parameters

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
this unfortunately isn t to do with your coding but rather the browsers themselves as safari reacts to mouse scrolling very differently to firefox and google-chrome
firefox and google-chrome track mouse scrolling throughout the scrolling process which is what makes the parallax effective

18398046
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
firefox and google-chrome track mouse scrolling throughout the scrolling process which is what makes the parallax effective

swt	swing
javafx can be embedded directly into swt
you can not use the javafx css support on swing controls so to me the question makes no sense

18404543
webkit	gecko
the upshot is that in some cases webkit ends up recomputing style on a lot more elements than gecko does as far as i can tell but in others it ends up recomputing style on many fewer elements
for example given a selector like .foo span and a div that changes class from foo to bar gecko will restyle all later siblings of the div while webkit will not do any work at all if there are no span kids since it would never have marked the parent as being affected by the + in that case

18406910
serializable	deserialization
maybe a user will be able to provide you with a better idea of how to optimize configure improve that aspect since serializable is not the issue here
given your comments and the way you re benchmarking i don t believe the source of the slow speed or fluctuations are due to the xml deserialization

18409067
express	node.js
side note that express just looks at the callback s arity number of expected arguments to categorize it as regular middleware or error handling middleware which is a bit magical so just keep in mind you must declare the arguments as above for express to understand this is an error handling middleware
and based on your question and comments just understand that exceptions aren t all that useful in node.js because every async call gets a new stack which is why callbacks are used everywhere and the 1st argument is an error universally

18411425
jar	manifest.mf
to evade this you can pack all the dependencies in your jar with the shade plugin since all the dependencies are packed together the class-path entry is not necessary any more
in order for a jar file to be executable it needs to have a manifest file with main-class and class-path entries this produces a manifest.mf file under meta-inf directory in the root of your jar file

18411667
super	implements
it would make difference in case you are comparing a type whose super class implements a

implements	extends
consider the following code now if you give your type parameter as you won t be able to call that method for as child does not implements but hence the type parameter bounds should be
note that you can t change your child class to because in that case child class would extends from different instantiation of same generic type which is not allowed

18412359
bash	subshell
this form would be faster or if it doesn t make a difference the speed of pattern matching could be related to the version of bash you re using
simply because you do many forks of bash one for the subshell and one for the cat command and also you read the cat binary as well while you execute it

18415401
super	extends
if default constructor is provided then there is a call to super . in your case c extends b so constructor of b gets called
if you do not a class with any other class then also by default it extends object class

uicollectionview	uitableview
uicollectionview is available in available in ios 6.0 and later and therefore cannot be used if you want to support earlier version

clang	llvm
i can attest that all 4 are implemented in clang and i would think they are also implemented in gcc
however there are plenty of situations where this breaks down even though here it is obvious that the call to foo is resolved to derived foo clang llvm will not optimize it

i ve created my own class to handle this situation. this class is called controlgroup and it s only responsibility is to track all the uicontrol you add to it and make one and only one of them selected
the controls in you case uibutton doesn t need to know anything about each other and you can have as many controls as you want

18450988
ubuntu	opensuse
for example installing just the 10.1 dev libraries in ubuntu 14.04 sudo apt-get install software-properties-common sudo apt-key adv --recv-keys --keyserver hkp keyserver.ubuntu.com 80 0xcbcb082a1bb943db sudo add-apt-repository deb trusty main sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install libmariadbclient-dev
it doesn t look like opensuse has a mariadb client development package

18452599
opera	google-chrome
i know this is an old post but for those that want to support apng on ie or safari there is a javascript workaround that s found below currently i believe firefox not sure the version and opera not sure of the version support it at the browser level
for google-chrome you can download the apng extension to get it to work

18453999
multiplication	exponent
as per this answer it s because the implementation of exponentiation has some overhead that multiplication does not
however naive multiplication will get slower and slower as the exponent increases

18454849
required	placeholder
the surrounding element is required for backbone to work
it is essentially a container placeholder for your view to sit in whether its contents have been rendered or not

18456151
actionscript	mxml
import the mx.controls.alert class into your application and then call the static show method in actionscript to display an alert control
you cannot create an alert control in mxml

18457185
pdfsharp	itextsharp
pdfsharp also supports 128bit encryption but it does not say on their website whether they support aes or only rc4
itextsharp supports aes 128bit encryption

18461572
firefox	safari
firefox seems to mess up fonts the most - on the other hand the text looks bold
chrome and safari doesn t alter fonts nearly as much making them look sharper but not really bold at all

18467059
ienumerable	iqueryable
neither iqueryable nor ienumerable which are the respective return types of the extension methods can be cast back to objectset
the following line of code cannot be evaluated until run time but if you remove the cast the code will not compile update for querying you could change the return type of stdorgusers from objectset to iqueryable but you lose all the other methods such as add attach etc

18474066
hex	binary
second you need to hex decode your key iv and encrypted_string values in ruby
openssl cipher is expecting binary not hex strings

18476648
strdup	malloc
if you use strdup which is essentially a wrapper for malloc as in your code above then you will have to free it by free in the end
you did not explain what you mean by without the strdup function

18478924
client-side	server-side
here s how you d do that in the shell however when i tested this the simple client-side sort approach performed much better
mongodb doesn t support server-side sorting with the distinct command

18487068
bash	subshell
this is part of why scripts intended to be exec d as opposed to than libraries meant to be sourced should not have filename extensions -- and part of why bash libraries should be .bash not .sh such that inaccurate information isn t provided about what kind of interpreter they can be sourced into
the script is running in a background process but it is a subshell not a separately-invoked interpreter as it would be without the dot

18494112
doc	rtf
think of it like the old doc format for microsoft word versus rtf
both convey the same information roughly but rtf is an open format that many programs can write out while the old doc format was not initially published i think

18496987
icomparable	gethashcode
your classes are the same so i believe what you want to do is to compare two lists of objects of type myobject i find the easiest way to do this without having to write a separate iequalitycomparer is to have the myobject class implement the icomparable interface
this is explained in detail halfway down this page but this is what your class would look like after implementing the interface once your class has the equals and gethashcode methods the linq except method will automatically work comparison now has orange and lemon but not apple

18497114
chameleon	jinja2
jinja2 provides a syntax very similar to django s if you do not wish to learn chameleon
chameleon and mako are the two templating languages with support currently bundled within pyramid

18499611
division	modulo
while many implementations use truncated division and remainder some do not a few even use truncated division and floored remainder which means does not even work
there are actually three different definitions of modulo or remainder not two truncated division remainder sign is the same as the dividend

18499611
division	modulo
there are actually three different definitions of modulo or remainder not two truncated division remainder sign is the same as the dividend
floored division remainder sign is the same as the divisor

18500064
prng	random
if you seed a rng with something like dev random on linux osx or cryptgenrandom windows then the fact that the prng itself is not cs probably won t matter because an attacker would have to get more than one password s worth of data to be able to crack it
but then if you re already using a csprng to seed a prng you might as well just use it to create the password in the first place

18504642
bash	zsh
some shells support float others don t bash doesn t support float values
zsh does support float values

18506102
pbkdf2	md5
this is already not secure you should use a password based key derivation function such as pbkdf2 to derive keys from passwords
then however you seem to treat the binary output of md5 as characters

18509090
namenode	hdfs
if you want lazy loading just open the files directly in hdfs although this doesn t scale too well for you namenode datanodes if you have 1000 s of concurrent tasks trying to read from the same file you can use symbolic linking to give files in the distributed cache friendly names and they will appear in the local working directory symlinked for each map reduce task
for example with the generic options parser options -files you can upload a file to hdfs add it to the distributedcache and assign a friendly name as follows hadoop jar myjar.jar mainclass -files ref-map.txt#map1.txt ... now you should be able to open the ref-map.txt file just by calling the following in your map reducer if you re files are already in hdfs then just add then as normal and call the createsymlink configuration method

18511873
implements	extends
if you want to create interface inheritance you can do it like this public interface birds extends animal now by implements birds you ll have all of bird s methods plus the animal ones
it shouldn t actually matter if a class implements animal or bird if the methods are the same one particular class defines one behaviour

18512479
spaces	linefeed
based on the is shorter than by 3 characters x06 x07 x1b but the white spaces characters x09 x12 x15 were preserved i would say this is what you re after
well given 0x09 tab 0x12 linefeed 0x15 carriage return then anything but the above and still would look something like and i assume you meant an exclusive match up to but not including 32 otherwise the last hex code should be x20

18514572
division	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction
you ll want to think hard about what you want the output of the division of two decimals to be
decimals are closed over addition subtraction and multiplication but not closed over division

18516720
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari
in firefox v23.0.1 any one of these will work cache-control no-store cache-control no-cache https only pragma no-cache https only https only in opera v12.15 we only can do this by cache-control must-revalidate https only
in safari v5.1.7 7534.57.2 any one of these will work cache-control no-store in html cache-control no-store https only in ie8 v8.0.6001.18702ic any one of these will work cache-control no-cache cache-control no-store cache-control must-revalidate expires 0 cache-control must-revalidate expires sat 12 oct 1991 05 00 00 gmt pragma no-cache https only https only combining the above gives us this solution which works for google-chrome 28 firefox 23 ie8 safari 5.1.7 and opera 12.15 cache-control no-store must-revalidate https only note that https is needed because opera wouldn t deactivate history buffer for plain http pages

18516863
super	self
so in put you should use super put self and in shortput you should use super shortput self
when you use super the first argument should be the class from which you are making the call not its superclass

18517497
sudo	passwd
try adding sudo in front of the kill and cat commands
like this sudo kill sudo cat usr local mysql data fitvalet-macbook-pro.local.pid it will then ask you for the root passwd for your mac not mysql

18517737
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
if you are in the context of a uiviewcontroller within the uitabbarcontroller just use self.tabbarcontroller if the context is not in uitabbarcontroller self.tabbarcontroller return nil
you are instantiating a new uitabbarcontroller instance as the method name suggests

18517771
postgresql	mysql
this query is simply wrong in ansi sql and on almost all dbms oracle postgresql ms sql etc.
it runs on mysql only because of their nonstandard group by extension see this link hovever they warn about something however this is useful primarily when all values in each nonaggregated column not named in the group by are the same for each group

18519760
primes	square-root
you can range over odd numbers in python the following way in addition once you have a list of primes you should be able to run through that list backwards because the question asks for highest primes factor and test if any of those primes evenly divides into the number
lastly people usually go up to the square-root of a number when checking trial division because anything past the square-root is not going to provide new information

18520632
google-chrome	safari
it is not possible on mobile safari and presumably google-chrome on ios
mobile safari javascript focus method on inputfield only works with click running this fiddle in mobile safari or google-chrome on ios will confirm this answer

18521562
des	aes
you can t use aes with keys sizes smaller than 128 bit but there are other ciphers available des blowfish etc
they aren t as secure as aes but still can do the trick if your application as most apps do does not worth complicated hacking effort

18523242
ubuntu	debian
that is available in ubuntu 13.04 and you could request it be backported to 12.04
if not you could update the source package to 2.4.6.1 which would require learning about debian packaging but might not be too difficult since you would be modifying an existing package instead of starting from scratch upload it to a ppa and instruct your users on ubuntu to install opencv from there

18523309
phpstorm	aptana
i currently use jetbrains phpstorm buggy and service isn t great but it hassome cool ide features and reasonably priced and eclipse together
in eclipse i have aptana plus web tools platform and of course the android adt plugins installed

18526950
implements	extends
application extends container and when you add a child to container the child should implements the iuicomponent interface
because the sprite class doesn t implements the interface it will give you an error

18528590
coalesce	isnull
coalesce function can take two or more parameters and returns the first non-null parameter or null if all parameters are null for example update mssql does stricter type and parameter checking
further it doesn t have ifnull function but instead isnull function which needs to know the types of the arguments

18531752
opera	google-chrome
however the size of this storage area can be customized by the user so a 5mb storage area is not guaranteed nor is it implied and the user agent opera for example may only provide 3mb - but only time will tell.
quoting from the wikipedia article on web storage web storage can be viewed simplistically as an improvement on cookies providing much greater storage capacity 2.5 mb per origin in google-chrome

18532180
union	distinct
this uses union to remove the duplicates
i think this is the base query that you want select distinct cust_id part_no from select cust_id part_no from quotation_items qi union all select cust_id part_no from order_items t unfortunately you cannot put this into a view in mysql because it has a subquery in the from clause

18535225
sudo	passwd
my suggestion is to do not create session but run each command with sudo preffix
second way is that you need to redirect providing second passwd

18543303
monodevelop	sharpdevelop
honestly it is a real pain in the butt to build monodevelop from the source or even to install on some platforms
i did a lot of research and worked out for hours but still could not manage to build monodevelop and at the end of the day decided to use sharpdevelop 4.3 instead and i gotta tell everybody that sharpdevelop is easy peasy to install

18543336
gruntjs	package.json
when you run your gruntjs xxx commands you get error an message like local npm module xxx not found
for now the solution is create package.json in the same directory as gruntfile.js define the modules required by your gruntjs project execute npm install to load them locally now the required gruntjs command should work

18543336
gruntjs	package.json
for now the solution is create package.json in the same directory as gruntfile.js define the modules required by your gruntjs project execute npm install to load them locally now the required gruntjs command should work
imho it is sad that we cannot have gruntjs resolve modules loaded from a parent npm module package.json in a parent directory within the same project

18544375
comparator	comparable
then you could declare the relevant classes as implementing comparable for the natural order and use comparator objects to implement the other orders
by the way a comparator probably should not implement comparable and vice versa

18544375
comparator	comparable
by the way a comparator probably should not implement comparable and vice versa
if a comparator implements comparable that implies you are trying to order instances of the comparator object itself .

18545022
realloc	fgetc
in the original code you might get away with if the realloc calls can grow the current chunk but when it has to move memory the moved location is not available in the calling function
the return type of fgetc is int not char

18545180
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu 13.10 includes curl 7.32 so should not have this problem
this should be fixed in curl 7.32.0 according to the debian changelog where threaded dns resolver has been implemented

18546155
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome for windows will use the favicon that comes first if it is 16 16 otherwise the ico
if none of the aforementioned options are available both chromes will use whichever favicon comes first exactly the opposite of firefox and safari. indeed google-chrome for mac will ignore the 16 16 favicon and use the 32 32 version if only to scale it back down to 16 16 on non-retina devices. opera not wanting to take sides will choose from any of the available icons at complete random

18546155
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome
if none of the aforementioned options are available both chromes will use whichever favicon comes first exactly the opposite of firefox and safari. indeed google-chrome for mac will ignore the 16 16 favicon and use the 32 32 version if only to scale it back down to 16 16 on non-retina devices. opera not wanting to take sides will choose from any of the available icons at complete random
i love that opera does this

18548789
base	fractions
and of course in base 2 a number like 1 5 0.2 cannot represented exact
summing fractions wil increase the error

18552378
udp	tcp
over a lan that s usually 1ms if your system is sufficiently hard real time that a single round-trip latency matters then tcp is a poor protocol and you should be using udp instead
nagle is a tcp only algorithm so it would not affect udp

18557927
dictionary	map
regarding the rest of your code you should not create a dictionary that maps the lengths of the strings to the strings themselves
you should map the other way around strings to their length

18558999
super	self
normally you can just call parent class methods directly by doing parent.foo self ... but in case of multiple inheritance super is much more useful
also even with single inheritance super helps you by not forcing you to hardcode the parent class into the child class so if you change it calls using super will just continue working

18559524
implements	extends
but now i will not like that half of my classes to implements the list interface and half of them extends abstractlist
also i cannot just go and remove the implements list from the classes i wrote earlier might be because this is not the right time or i do not want other s code to break with my new release

18560323
google-chrome	firefox
after a bit more research i ve confirmed and gotten more detail the solution is to use the official jetbrains maker of rubymine liveedit plugin which you can find here detailed instructions download the jetbrains liveedit plugin from here run type plugins in the search box in settings click the install plugin from disk button at the bottom of the list navigate to where you downloaded the plugin and select open it activate by checking it on the plugin list you will likely have to restart rubymine once restarted go to the which will then be checked download the jetbrains ide browser extension for google-chrome here the google-chrome extension supports both wysiwyg real-time liveedit outside the ide in an external google-chrome window and javascript debugging inside the actual rubymine ide i believe there is also an extension for firefox which i believe also does support javascript debugging through the ide
but i m not sure if it supports liveedit like the google-chrome extension launch debug your project edit as you normally would observations opinions the plugin pretty much works seamlessly

18560550
implements	extends
what to map into objects is a broad topic but a few simple guidelines would be to isolate and encapsulate unrelated code into their own classes and make them as decoupled as possible code implements location should not need to know pretty much anything about code in inventory and vice versa
on a more fundamental level the object-oriented paradigm elegantly solves the problem of repetitive code like this by turning it into something like this you will notice that the more modular code is also easier to extends

18561989
google-chrome	firefox
afaik ie and google-chrome if opened as new processes will not share it but this of course depends also on how the server is setting the cookie policy for the session. access to cookie values in the browser however is domain dependent so a persistent cookies or local storage can share information even across sessions so it really depends on how the web application is implemented or what framework is using - that mostly takes care of such stuff
selenium web driver allows to open several browser windows 3 firefox windows or 1 ie + 1 firefox +1 google-chrome

18562207
sudo	passwd
see ubuntu sudo root documentation
you could set a passwd for root but this is not recommended and could open a security risk

18563737
build.gradle	gradlew
build.gradle tested with android studio 0.2.6 and android gradlew plugin 0.5
i tested all the solutions presented here and they all lack of something version of gradlew gradlew plugin not supported library project not supported no integration with android studio etc

18566280
client-side	server-side
my confusion was between server-side sessions and client-side sessions
before today i had not known about client-side

18568692
spaces	linefeed
none collapsed or stripped spaces
with bsd sed or with gnu sed doesn t include empty lines for linefeed fold -w1 -w specifies width in characters doesn t include empty lines for linefeed includes empty lines for linefeed with -d the only option for read specified by posix is -r or in nawk bsd awk the awk that comes with os x

18569052
stateless	stateful
well to kick off http isn t really stateless anymore
http 1.1 added persistent connections which in itself doesn t make it stateful but doesn t make the protocol entirely stateless as such

18573210
inline	inlining
since the jit compiler that s the one who does inlining has strict rules about inlining i doubt that it will inline all that code
here are some rules for jit inlining those might not be true for the current jit but are a good start

18574717
accelerometer	gyroscope
if gps is not an option i would try to go to a gyroscope accelerometer
check it here rasp pi guide to accelerometer gyro on start node a and node b exchange locations

18575821
ssl	https
but ssl interception is becoming common in many companies
with ssl interception you ask for an https connection to for example www.google.com the company s switch router proxy hands you a valid certificate naming www.google.com as the endpoint so your browser doesn t complain about a name mismatch but instead of being countersigned by a mutually trusted third party it is countersigned by their own certificate authority operating somewhere in the company which also happens to be trusted by your browser since it s in your trusted root ca list which the company has control over

18579593
arp	tcp
the original page you refer to does not mention arp spoofing at all and i am not sure what are you trying to rewrite in java
the system has 5 components detect unauthorized users original solution used dhcp forward their traffic to special server original solution used iptables parse and rewrite the tcp streams original solution used iptables + linux kernel proxy http protocol original solution uses squid turn images upside down original solution used perl + imagemagick since you are talking about arp it looks like you want to re-write 1 and 2

18580029
uilabel	nsstring
2 you hadn t declared ans so instead of it should be 3 and finally you refer to result as a uilabel because of this setstringvalue is not a real method for uilabel it should be settext so this line should be alternatively you can do check out apple documentation on uilabel
all you need to do is use the nsstring method + stringwithformat so all you need to do is for a better understanding of nsstring and the method + stringwithformat please see the apple documentation on nsstring

18580866
super	extends
but to extends the defaulttablemodel you must put all model data into the super class usually by calling the appropriate super constructor
you cannot have a separate data model nucleus from the defaulttablemodel super class

18582270
prepare	execute
we see that the performance drop is not there anymore - just like the first tic toc call prepare the second one warm-up
i interpret this in term of cache the instructions and or data are execute and then kept in a low level memory - the second call is faster

18582960
google-chrome	firefox
that css seem to be enough for google-chrome
while using it with firefox the #drop shouldn t have text nodes directly else there s a strange issue where a element leave it to itself so i suggest to leave it with only one element use a div inside #drop to put everything inside here s a jsfiddle solving the original question broken example

18586230
super	extends
i understood the when to use and when not to use and there is one awesome principle i found in one book the get and put principle use an extends wildcard when you only get values out of a structure use a super wildcard when you only put values into a structure and don t use a wildcard when you both get and put
here is a method that takes a collection of numbers converts each to a double and sums them up since this uses extends all of the following calls are legal the first two calls would not be legal if extends was not used

18586425
listview	gridview
if you use a gridview you can pair it up with a listview for the snapped mode gridview for full mode listview for snapped as in the templates
you can certainly restrict the sizes in a gridview without it require even a fifth of the work needed for buttons so i m not quite sure what you mean by no guarantees of item size

18588784
client-side	server-side
modelstate.isvalid is the property you can trust for validating your data just before saving it will handle all verification not made client-side because not supported or javascript disabled
ok so if you want to validate server-side you have to do this note when you call modelstate.isvalid that will force your model to be validated

18589664
mdpi	hdpi
ps if you put the image in drawable folder and run in mdpi device the image will not scaled because drawable folder drawable-mdpi
first you know mdpi 1 hdpi 1.5 and xhdpi 2

18590593
mp3	ogg
your best alternative is to also encode it in the ogg format.you only want to provide an mp3 file then you need to use a flash player to play the mp3 file in firefox
firefox does not support the playing of mp3 files

18593935
tostring	string.format
tostring can be used to transform the display format of a string odd terminology but yeah
use the following to get the number with commas notice i am not using string.format

18595274
qthread	qobject
if this is the case please note that this is not how to use qthread
instead you should have your class inherit from qobject and move that to a qthread

18595348
rdf	owl
turtle serialization rdf xml serialization
antoine zimmerman s answer is right in that this kind of thing is expressible in owl but that it requires a bit more work than you might expect because you re trying to enforce a type of closed world reasoning and default reasoning whereas owl makes the open world assumption in which if you don t know something it s not presumed to be either true or false just unknown

18596655
uiview	subviews
this way the controller main view is a plain uiview that contains a table and you can add subviews to the main uiview and they will be placed on top of the table view
the issue is that the view of a uitableviewcontroller is a uitableview so you cannot add subviews to the controller on top of the table

18597709
memcpy	strncpy
on the other hand memcpy doesn t care about 0 bytes and just copies the whole thing
to put it another way strncpy finds a 0 byte inside the first integer and stops copying

18597979
memcpy	strncpy
to write strncpy with memcpy would be something like this note the above implementation doesn t work for the case where the src string is not terminated correctly - a real strncpy does cope with this - it could be fixed in the above code but it gets quite complicated
you can implement sort of strncpy with memcpy but the other way around won t work because strncpy stops at the end of the string which doesn t work at all well for data that isn t a c style string has zero bytes in it

18599766
multiplying	multiplication
so to multiplying by a sparse column vector you can iterate over data and indices of the column vector and for each d r pair extract the corresponding column of the matrix and multiplying it by d and
the sparse matrix multiplication routines are directly coded in c++ and as far as a quick look at the source reveals there doesn t seem to be any hook to any optimized library

18608218
google-chrome	firefox
you will most likely not have installed your google-chrome driver yet
firefox comes shipped with the webdriver by default google-chrome does not

18611235
opera	google-chrome
it also doesn t work in ie or opera
the fact that it does work in google-chrome is because google-chrome is going beyond the spec in allowing it

18618543
bash	tcsh
this assumes you re using the bash shell
some other shells particularly csh and tcsh and some older sh-derived shells may not support the syntax

18619464
concave	convex
your question is almost a convex hull question except for those concave regions at the top
simply using a convex hull algorithm would give you this which is close but not quite what you need note .the brown areas that are different depending on what you re trying to do the convex hull might be good enough but if not you still might be able to modify an algorithm to ignore the parts that are non-convex and simpy merge the two polygons

18619860
client-side	server-side
as a preprocessor run server-side it has no idea about the actual html structure of a page unlike javascript being ran client-side
even if you are running less client-side in actual release not normally recommended it takes extra javascript work to get it to actually have any awareness of the html structure

18623564
inline	inlining
if you have only one implementation of the function that defeats the purpose of inline
if you use link-time optimization where cross-file inlining is done by the linker then the inline hint for the compiler is not very useful anyway

18623564
inline	inlining
if you use link-time optimization where cross-file inlining is done by the linker then the inline hint for the compiler is not very useful anyway
only extern inline insures that kind of behavior

18625412
apache	nginx
apache really shouldn t have any issue with what you are looking to do
though i will admit that webservers like nginx or an ajax-specific webserver may handle the concurrent connections better

18630547
firefox	safari
the confusing situation was that it worked in firefox on windows and not in firefox on the mac same firefox versions same java versions
safari on my mac didn t work because the plugin was disabled.

18631501
google-chrome	firefox
you will hit a lot of issues with google-chrome nvda as that is not supported very well and end-users are very unlikely to use that
ie is ok with nvda but firefox is best

18637763
padrino	ruby-on-rails
then in app app.rb you put something like register padrino contrib exceptionnotifier set exceptions_from noreply domain.com set exceptions_to your_address.domain.com and that s it
the nice thing about letting the plugin install it for you is that if you re more familiar with ruby-on-rails than padrino as is my case this will not only set things up for you but also show you were the directives need to go

18641350
nunit	mstest
this allows teamcity to report nunit test results on the fly--executing test 3...4...5...of 78--and allows instant notification of failed tests even if all tests have not yet been executed
mstest on the other hand goes directly through the mstest executables and does not have on-the-fly reporting

18645705
couchbase	couchdb
you can still use memcached protocol libraries or speed it up with couchbase sdk s
couchbase not couchdb is a great option for you

18646421
factors	mean
especially when a single call takes a relatively short time 1 ms you will still have to deal with external factors windows is not a real time os
they can be trusted alright but that does not mean they will be very accurate

18646863
super	extends
taken from another example you could do something like this for your basehandler and expand it as you wish class basehandler webapp2.requesthandler def handle_exception self exception debug_mode if not debug_mode super basehandler self .handle_exception exception debug_mode else if isinstance exception urlfetch.downloaderror # display a download-specific error page pass else # display a generic 500 error page. pass
another approach for handling errors is to make a basehandler with handle_exception and have all your other handlers extends this one

18647676
prepare	execute
on the other hand if a query is execute only once server-side prepare statements can be slower because of the additional round-trip to the server
implementation limitations may also lead to performance penalties some versions of mysql did not cache results of prepare queries and some dbmss such as postgresql do not perform additional query optimization during execution

18647941
serializable	deserialization
during serializable java will replace all references including circular references
but during deserialization java will not resolve circular references

18648420
serializable	deserialization
as noted clone does not do this serializable deserialization step but merely ascribes to shallow object#clone semantics actually there is no hash#clone so it uses object#clone s implementation directly produces a shallow copy of obj the instance variables of obj are copied but not the objects they reference
json is merely text - and in this case it is assumed that the object can round-trip through json serializable

18648938
fold	combinators
what would be done with looping in lower-level imperative languages is usually best done with higher-order combinators map and flatmap most especially but also filter zip fold foreach reduce collect partition scan groupby and a good few others
iteration is best done only in performance critical sections and recursion done only in a some deep edge cases where the higher-order combinators don t quite fit which usually aren t tail recursive fwiw

18649945
puma	unicorn
one of the other reasons we switched to puma is that i suspect some of our random timeouts come from slow clients
unicorn isn t designed to handle slow clients

18653627
equals	compareto
in a sorted map you have a sorted map performs all key comparisons using its compareto or compare method so two keys that are deemed equals by this method are from the standpoint of the sorted map equals
but a map cannot have two equals keys a map cannot contain duplicate keys

18653831
google-chrome	safari
however in google-chrome you can request keyboard support by calling the method with a flag docelm.webkitrequestfullscreen element.allow_keyboard_input
this does not work in safari and the method won t be called

18654844
mono	xamarin.android
when you re debugging with xamarin studio or visual studio xamarin.android will install the mono runtime and support files separately.if your application is debug-built app then the problem will be that the shared runtime isn t present
so on release mode please ensure that you uncheck use shared mono runtime on project options

18660286
junit	jmock
the issue was a combination of two factors first there was a transitive dependency problem namely that of hamcrest-core 1.1 - jmock 1.1.0 - junit 3.8.1 where in maven s dependency-tree the older junit was closer to the systemtest module which was inheriting the version dependency and revision 3.8.1 of junit doesn t have contain org.junit.runner.notification.runlistener
second there was confusion over the interpretation of the tag by maven-- having indicates a soft requirement for junit rather than a hard requirement which might be indicated with see also maven dependency mediation the latter led maven to accept the closest satisfactory junit dependency which in this case was 3.8 rather than the expected value thereby giving rise to the error

18661002
viewdidload	viewwillappear
my usual approach is to do layout to some degree in ib then do anything else i need to nontrivial layout custom classes etc in viewdidload
then if i have layout to figure out that autoresizingmask doesn t cover i m supporting down to ios 5 i override viewwillappear or layoutsubviews if i m subclassing uiview and do some pixel math

18662335
opera	firefox	opera	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the answer is unfortunately simple mathml is not supported in google-chrome opera and ie
firefox has a very solid implementation but not yet complete safari only a very partial implementation

18662335
firefox	safari
firefox has a very solid implementation but not yet complete safari only a very partial implementation
neither firefox nor safari support content mathml

18668601
super	extends
if you use something of type object this will allow you to return any object object is the super class of all classes
but primitive types are not objects so a type object in a signature will not allow you to pass a number but there is one little trick... in java there are special types of objects known as primitive wrappers integer double... this objects are object representations of primitives sometimes they are used because they have some inbuilt functions that help programmers to easily manipulate the data that is not the main point keep reading... every wrapper that represents a numerical primitive type extends a class called number and because of one feature that java have known as autoboxing you can pass primitives into wrappers automatically

18677046
sudo	passwd
once logged in you type as you would per normal ssh here is me running it locally within the script it also does a sudo bash which is why it reconnects me to localhost and i become root
to get a script going you need to sudo-apt-get install expect or sudo yum install expect once installed this is a typical script if you have noticed i have commented out the commands which is not being sent - its using interact mode to allow you to actually log in without a passwd user passwd defined at the top of the script.

18681091
udp	tcp
i can see two cases where udp would have an upper hand over tcp
first one of the attractive features of udp is that since it does not need to retransmit lost packets nor does it do any connection setup sending data incurs less delay

18681750
udp	tcp
i think because of the nature of the chat program it needs to be a tcp server i cannot imagine the actual text content sent by users over a udp protocol
the max limit for tcp servers is 65536 connections at the same time

18681787
udp	tcp
one alternative could be to use tcp for point-to-point chat and use udp for group messaging
tcp would give you reliability which is certainly desirable when during instant messaging -- you would not want messages to be dropped during converstation

18681960
union	distinct
first do a union not union all to find all distinct branch_id from both tables and then do 2 left joins to derived tables where there has been done a group by branch_id separately
because both tables more than one row per branch_id you need to first group by branch_id - separately in each table - and then emulate the full join either with union all and one more group by or with two subqueries one with left and one with right outer join

18683185
innodb	myisam
if your table is under the innodb storage engine you will find relation view by opening the structure page for this table
if not for example for the myisam storage engine you need to install the phpmyadmin configuration storage see and then you ll find relation view by opening the structure page for this table

18683337
multiplying	multiplication
if you do not really need the double precision for your calculation you can try to cast them to single precision and then multiplying
i suppose that single precision multiplication will be faster than double precision multiplication in case of 32bit processor as regular float needs only one processor register and double needs two

18684909
uitabbaritem	uitabbarcontroller
otherwise ios sdk does not allow giving a spesific action for uitabbaritem
you can create new controller using inheritence from uitabbarcontroller and add a custom button on uitabbar -- uitabbaritem therefore uitabbaritem send to back and your custom button shown front

18686539
libsvm	liblinear
let me add a couple of things to lejlot s excellent answer what lejlot says is exactly right if you re using libsvm or any other svm library with a linear kernel you will need to convert the svm model support vectors and lagrangian multipliers to a w
in the case the op is interested he is using liblinear not an svm library

18686994
awt	swing
more importantly you should be coding with swing japplet jbutton not awt
while swing is admittedly out of date awt is prehistoric in comparison

18687618
jlist	jlabel
i would use a jlist for this
your renderer could allow for the display of multiple lines as your gui shows and a jlist has improved efficiencies over say a jpanel with lots of jlabel since it doesn t display actual components but rather the rendering of a component

18689742
pickle	dill
i think you could use dill to pickle the interactively defined class and not have to worry about pxlocal magic using dummymod and faking of namespaces
to pickle a class interactively just do import dill and then build your class as you first did

18689995
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
at the moment this api will only work in firefox and google-chrome
safari doesn t support webrtc which is the html5 standard that defines getusermedia

18693091
erlang	elixir
but when you start erlang with +pc unicode it decode more symbols
it not bug in elixir because method should return new list as in erlang

18696428
mongodb	bson
you cannot do this due to the fact that mongodb communicates using bson
a single value like you want would be invalid bson

18697383
sse	avx
my hunch is that it s related to the ilp and the fact that avx processors such as sandy bridge can only load two 128-bit words sse width simultaneously and not two 256-bit words
so in the sse code it can do one sse addition one sse multiplication two sse loads and one sse store simultaneously

18700738
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome ie and safari include their own h.264 decoders
firefox doesn t because the h.264 codec isn t royalty-free so mozilla would have to pay to include a h.264 decoder in firefox

18702123
oncreate	setcontentview
you need to move the assignment of the edittext into oncreate method after setcontentview r.layout.activity_main
you havn t inflated a view before oncreate so it doesn t have any where to look to find your edittext xml outlet

18702813
profiling	debugging
you cannot use the package to profiling units for which execute only access has been granted
in general if a user can debugging a unit the same user can profiling it

18702813
profiling	debugging
in general if a user can debugging a unit the same user can profiling it
however a unit can be profiled whether or not it has been compiled debugging

18702856
strdup	malloc
you couldn t implement a function like strdup using a local array for instance or sensibly implement a linked representation list or tree
more fundamentally i think apart from the stack vs heap and variable vs constant issues and apart from the fact that you shouldn t be using malloc in c++ to begin with is that a local array ceases to exist when the function exits

18703184
ng-switch	ng-show
best solution i currently found can be seen in the plunkr you basically cannot use ng-include on the same dom level as the ng-switch anymore
the same goes for other logical directives like ng-show ng-hide .

18708280
cdr	cons
you tagged lisp it s not strage though since cons pairs are an essential data type defined by john mccarthy s lisp the mother of all lisps and it s very first implementation had assembly instructions that retrieved something called address and decrement from a memory location and the letters a and d in car cdr are from that terminology
rackets definition of a pair talks of car and cdr as the pair accessors so indirectly it specifies it as o 1

18712179
client-side	server-side
to access object you need to either fetch it from the cursor or get it directly with findone then you may use it just as any other js object keep in mind that on client-side collection methods like find are non-blocking
they return whatever meteor has in cache not necessarily what is in the server-side db

18721449
floating-point	fixed-point
floating-point representation covers extremely large range it can be used to store really big numbers 10 40 for 32-bit float 10 308 for 64-bit one and really small positive ones 10 -320 at the expense of precision while the fixed-point representation is linearly limited by its size
floating-point precision is not distributed uniformly accross the representable range

18724777
implements	extends
and i am glad i did because after a day working on it i managed to learn enough about the apis not only to set up a basic authentication and authorization system in my spring webapp without trouble but also to implements the custom sso behaviour i was looking for
i only had to extends 2 or 3 classes and the whole thing took only about 25 lines of xml config in my spring context

18726313
client-side	server-side
a fully client-side login shouldn t generally be trusted by server-side logic
but server-side validation of a javascript initiated login is generally not difficult

18744853
wadl	wsdl
wadl web application description language is supposed to be the wsdl for rest but that spec went no where
why doesn t a web api support being added as a reference the same way a wcf or asmx is added wcf or asmx-based web services are soap-based and there typically is an associated wsdl

18747952
base	fractions
but you will see it with 31.9 as it will have a coefficient of 3.19 in base 2 repeating section between the marks and a mantissa of +1
ultimately this is because some base-10 numbers like 0.9 cannot be represented in base 2 in a finite number of digits just like the fractions 1 3 cannot be represented in base 10 in a finite number of digits you get 0.333...

18747952
base	fractions
ultimately this is because some base-10 numbers like 0.9 cannot be represented in base 2 in a finite number of digits just like the fractions 1 3 cannot be represented in base 10 in a finite number of digits you get 0.333...
0.9 converted to base 2 is 0.1110011001100... and this binary representation gets truncated such that the result is as number close to 0.9 base 10 but is slightly smaller

18748092
jar	war
you can add a jar to the runtime classpath using one of the following techniques add the jar to the web-inf libs directory in your web app project
this technique guarantees that the jar will be distributed with your war file but also guarantees that the jar will not be shared by other projects that may want to use the jar

18748092
jar	war
this technique guarantees that the jar will be distributed with your war file but also guarantees that the jar will not be shared by other projects that may want to use the jar
if you are building an ear add the jar to the ear file

18749861
postgresql	mysql
i am sure mysql has some equivalent function as postgresql s to_char but you ll have to find that on your own as i am not a mysql guy
if you are using postgresql you can do it like this date format options here

18750664
division	multiplication
essentially the division picks up a significant figure accurate to 0.001 even though the original number was only accurate to 0.01 which allows the multiplication to yield the correct result
with type decimal even if x y cannot be stored exactly the value of where will often equal x if the multiplication causes a change of scale requiring a rounding step

18753835
mp3	flac	mp3	ogg	flac	ogg
android default browser formats ogg vorbis yes mp3 yes flac no not 100 certain data uris yes autoplay allowed tbc user interaction event required tbc limitations full audio doesn t seem to play
tested with short sounds android chrome formats ogg vorbis yes mp3 yes flac yes data uris yes bug fixed in chrome 34 which is currently in beta autoplay allowed no bug user interaction event required yes limitations ended event never fires

18756038
lodash	underscore.js
there s also lodash which is the same api as underscore.js but was rewritten to be more performant
easy enough to use underscore.js _.escape string underscore.js is a utility library that provides a lot of features that native js doesn t provide

18756584
bash	subshell
bash this partly works albeit with an extra subshell layer
however the problem is that while a subshell will inherit the exported environment variables aliases and functions are not inherited

18757769
implements	extends
the only question i ask myself is that if this functionality isn t implements by default there might be a reason behind it
after viewing at the source code i notice that dijit form select extends from dijit form _formselectwidget which in fact makes it possible to retrieve and disable options in a select

18757994
bash	subshell
here is a rewritten version of your script comments and explanations follow below indentation first off you should always indent your code blocks if constructs loops switch case statements ... for readability read whitespace and the prompt since you are using bash read is capable of displaying a prompt for you - the extra echo is not needed
furthermore read strips off leading and trailing whitespace which results in an incorrect calculation unless you set ifs to the null string iterating over characters in a string you can use parameter expansion to both get the length of the string as well as slice out one character at a time using a for loop getting rid of the unnecessary cut and avoiding a subshell

18758371
postgresql	mysql
note that it only supports postgresql
django doesn t support ctes directly as these are not common to all databases mysql doesn t support it

18758533
ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	icollection
if you do not require the collection to be modified or indexed then use ienumerable
if so use icollection or an ilist as these expose add clear and remove methods

18760317
spaces	delimiter
either use awk as in the other answer or use tr to squeeze the spaces before using cut xm list | grep test2 | tr -s | cut -d -f2
with cut you cannot treat multiple consecutive delimiter as one so cut -d will not work

18761778
serializable	deserialization
using serializable unserialize functions might not always be a good idea because they come with security issues
code might get executed upon deserialization which you had not intended

18764938
punctuation	words
so if you where trying the first option it would something like so untested pseudo code edit as per jonhopkins suggestion adding a white space at the end should cater for the scenario where there wanted words is at the end of the document and is not proceeded by a punctuation mark
assuming you could do some pre-processing you could use replace all your punctuation marks with white spaces and put everything in lowercase and then either use strpos with something like so in a while loop to keep on iterating through your entire document

18765074
prepare	execute
mysql documentation says sql prepare statements prepare execute deallocate prepare can be used in stored procedures but not stored functions or triggers
thus stored functions and triggers cannot use dynamic sql where you construct statements as strings and then execute them

18767428
casting	autoboxing
you re not casting from a hashmap to integer
you re casting an autoboxing int to an integer

18771601
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome that was fine the browser would slow down some but it would continue to work
but in firefox it would get that annoying script busy or not responding messsage

18775003
junit	mockito
i am getting permgen errors from junit in eclipse too
but i am not using any mocking libs like mockito nor easymock

18776858
strcpy	strncpy
tips use strncpy instead of strcpy use c++ strings instead of the c style string.then you can swap them with a.swap b
because your string a is longer than b .so strcpy does not work as you expect in line strcpy b temp

18778220
implements	extends
now when a class will implements someinterface it is not mandatory to provide implementation for default methods of interface
if we have another interface with following methods java doesn t allow extends multiple classes because it results in the diamond problem where compiler is not able to decide which superclass method to use

18785518
spaces	delimiter
if that is not available you may need to create a custom parser to read in lines until you reach the delimiter and then join up blocks of text trimming white spaces to get the columns correctly aligned
you could try saving the workbook in tab delimiter format and running the following using to see roughly what is required

18787235
stateless	stateful
generally speaking consider these items stateless services are sometimes a little bit easier to test if you write a test case you do not have to consider the side-effects on the state
if your stateful session bean holds cached data you have to handle cache invalidation

18788881
tiff	png
jpg does not have transparent properties only png and gif files and tiff but browsers do not support that format
your output file will need to be converted to one of those formats preferably png then set the transparency for the desired color

18792190
namedtuple	dictionary
i think of this cute hack now you can just say perfectly handy for those times when you need a data bag that s not a class and for when namedtuple are incomprehensible.
whenever i need an instant data object that also behaves like a dictionary i don t think of c structs

18795312
udp	tcp
mike your code does not work because you are trying to send the udp associate command through the a udp datagram
the socks5 handshake must be over a tcp control connection

18795312
udp	tcp
your server may need to keep one open tcp connection per client but each client does not need many tcp connections open - one tcp connection can handle any number of udp associate commands
if your sole purpose is to not use tcp at all on the server side it will not achieve what you want

18795655
multiplying	multiplication
multiplying and divide
obviously sign conversion of the result needs to happen if it s a signed multiplication where a unsigned should not change the sign of the result if the highest bit of one of the inputs is set

18797467
uiview	subviews
here s a picture of the cell with clear color background 2 inside your custom cell put a white uiview with a padding to the edges of the cell simulating your original cell like this 3 then just add the rest of your subviews as you want
you can add then above but not inside the white uiview that simulates the original cell

18797884
cassini	iis
there are 3 workarounds and only the use iis instead of cassini workaround seems to work
i m fairly certain this is a case of visual studio development server not acting like real iis

18797971
rpm	yum
turns out after reading orwellhindenberg s answer it s easy to package maven into an rpm with fpm
yum install -y gcc make rpm-build ruby-devel rubygems gem install fpm create a project directory and layout the directory structure of the package mkdir maven-build cd maven-build mkdir -p etc profile.d opt create a file that we ll install to etc profile.d maven.sh we ll store this under the newly created etc profile.d directory as maven.sh with the following contents download and unpack the latest maven in the opt directory wget tar -xzf apache-maven-3.1.0-bin.tar.gz -c opt finally build the rpm fpm -n maven-3.1.0 -s dir -t rpm etc opt now you can install maven through rpm and viola not quite yum but closer to home

18798110
viewdidload	viewwillappear
you are adding hidden action in the viewdidload method which is called once as the viewcontrollers in navigation stack are not unloaded when your push to the nextviewcontroller
add in the viewwillappear of the firstviewcontroller

18800612
strtol	atoi
please don t use atoi but rather use strtol which will make you enable to check if the conversion was successful or not
the reason why atoi fails is because you have an extra n character because with fgets fgets line 2 fp

18803333
pbkdf2	md5
pbkdf2 is usually used to generate an encryption key from your password
it s not used to hash like you would use md5

18810162
persistent	transient
it seems that it is the existing already persistent object
so if the saveorupdate is called hibernate deicdes to use update statement because the object seems to be not transient

18811601
udp	tcp
note that i ve used osc in udp mode
there is also a tcp mode. with udp you can broacast to multiple ips but there is not guarantee your message will get accross and each message is limited to a maximum of 64k of data. because there is no confirmation on udp packets it s slightly faster than tcp. with tcp all packets are guaranteed to reach the other side but with a cost to speed and the lack of the broadcast ability

18811946
ioexception	filewriter
public filewriter string filename boolean append throws ioexception constructs a filewriter object given a file name with a boolean indicating whether or not to append the data written
open the file in append mode by passing true to filewriter constructor

18813194
haskell	agda	agda	ats
you can find those kinds of features in theorem provers like coq or agda or in experimental academic languages like ats or liquid haskell
now of those languages i mentioned coq and agda define their nat types recursively so that s not what you want and ats is an imperative language

18813800
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc
if ptr is a null pointer the realloc function behaves like the malloc function for the specified size
otherwise if ptr does not match a pointer earlier returned by the calloc malloc or realloc function or if the space has been deallocated by a call to the free or realloc function the behavior is undefined

18813800
calloc	malloc
otherwise if ptr does not match a pointer earlier returned by the calloc malloc or realloc function or if the space has been deallocated by a call to the free or realloc function the behavior is undefined
in your case x was returned by malloc not x + 1

18813883
intersect	contains
repeat step 3. for suffixes for a positive result both prefixes and suffixes must intersect
edit in addition to the above there is a special case when one of the patterns contains at least one but the other doesn t

18815765
consistency	acid
if you are retrieving single document such as reviewing an order or an end user viewing their profile these operations are acid compliant and are not affected by the eventual consistency design
to understand eventual consistency think about a typical user looking at a list of products on your web site

18816926
margin	text-align
the span displayed as a block element needs to be given a width to match the image. in this case the margin 0 auto centering works and text-align right forces the text to match the right edge of the image
if you do not want to add a wrapper element you need to do the following and for the css see demo at because an image has an intrinsic width margin 0 auto centers the image as you expect

18818520
mp3	ogg
i suggest converting your mp3 sounds to ogg for pygame
usually pygame will not play mp3 files

18819228
implements	extends
it is not possible to code e implements hasname - that is implied by e extends hasname
the extends keyword applies to interfaces too

18820433
dictionary	map
first convert a nested dictionary to a key-path dictionary print out list keypaths example_dict if it isn t obvious what this does
for a one-to-one-mapping you can just do this but for a many-to-one mapping like yours the reverse is one-to-many so we need to map each value to a list of keys

18820819
octal	hex
2 - the number will show as a binary value 8 - the number will show as an octal value 16 - the number will show as an hexadecimal value substr -6 just takes the last 6 characters which cuts off the 000000 because they re not part of the last 6 characters
hex.tostring 16 converts hex into string number representation in base 16

18824085
google-chrome	firefox
you should be able to find the placeholder in the dom inspectors inside your input or textarea elements select an input element then choose inspect element from right click menu then you should see something like that firefox inspector google-chrome dev tools for google-chrome you may need to enable show user agent shadow dom in the dev tools settings
placeholder is a pseudo-element like before and after sometimes refered as pseudo-class these types of elements could not be seen in the firefox inspector you needed at least firebug or google-chrome dev tools but recently it s available in the firefox inspector too

18825320
xslt	xquery
thus if you use an xslt 2.0 processor like saxon 9 with java you could use that approach
the data model xslt xpath xquery operate on does not know any cdata sections so you can t simply preserve them as the tree you operate on simply contains a text node in both cases for and the tree is a foo element containing a single text child node with the string value

18825320
xslt	xquery
the data model xslt xpath xquery operate on does not know any cdata sections so you can t simply preserve them as the tree you operate on simply contains a text node in both cases for and the tree is a foo element containing a single text child node with the string value
so there is no way in pure xslt to achieve what you want unless you pre-process the input to convert cdata sections into some structure like elements the xslt data model allows you to detect and distinguish

18826302
punctuation	words
the above code will find matches splitting both on punctuation defined in of the preg_match_all pattern it will also concatenate the words list matching only words in the words list with a preceding and following space
wordlist you can change the words list to include any breaks you like editing the list until you get the phrases you are after examples punctuation you can add any punctuation marks you like into the list between and however remember that some characters do have special meanings and may need to be escaped or placed appropriately - and should become - and or be placed where their special meaning doesn t come into play

18826302
punctuation	words
wordlist you can change the words list to include any breaks you like editing the list until you get the phrases you are after examples punctuation you can add any punctuation marks you like into the list between and however remember that some characters do have special meanings and may need to be escaped or placed appropriately - and should become - and or be placed where their special meaning doesn t come into play
you may consider changing to so that you only split punctuation marks which are followed by a space

18828687
coalesce	isnull
the isnull return value is always considered not nullable assuming the return value is a non-nullable one whereas coalesce with non-null parameters is considered to be null
so the expressions isnull null 1 and coalesce null 1 although equivalent have different nullability values

18828697
coalesce	isnull
it s recommended to use this by ms instead of isnull isnull can only have one input however it s been shown to be slightly faster than coalesce
coalesce can have multiple inputs and it will evaluate in order until one of them is not null such as coalesce col1 col2 col3 n a

18828859
ssl	https
if you don t have or don t want to use ssl on your nginx then you need to make the connection to it unsecured then the warning won t appear and every thing would work fine
as far as i know you could say that it s not a bug it s a feature one of the features of ssl that it prevents man in the middle attacks if you want to use ssl then nginx it self should have an ssl key and allow https connection otherwise the user will see the well known yellow warning page about untrusted ssl if you implement the ssl for nginx then the connection would be like this the connection will be encrypted and decrypted twice on the way to the server the client wont see the server ssl and will only see the nginx ssl

18828914
ubuntu	linux
with perlbrewed perls ranging from 5.8.1 to 5.18.1 i get this output consitently on ubuntu 12.04 lts with en_gb.utf-8 locale
the locale on your linux box doesn t consider ã a word character lingua en namecase has use locale

18830698
uicollectionview	uitableview
can you achieve what you want using only a uitableview with a uiscrollview in it or perhaps a uicollectionview
from the documentation important you should not embed uiwebview or uitableview objects in uiscrollview objects

18830910
uiview	calayer
that isn t possible with a single uiview instance without adding layers
what you can do is create a view that is larger than necessary set its border appropriately then add a calayer and position it where you want the inner border and set its border properties appropriately

18833814
udp	tcp
this makes udp ideal for things like streaming video where every single packet isn t as important as keeping a continuous flow of packets from the server to the client
considering smtp it makes more sense to use tcp over udp

18839674
move	drag
on the other hand swiping the trackpad or rolling the mousewheel over the text or using the keyboard to move off the bottom sends yscroll which again does not cause a yview so in this case you only see one of the two methods
so for example if you change yview to not call textbox.yview you can drag the scrollbar all you want but the text view won t move

18839674
move	drag
so for example if you change yview to not call textbox.yview you can drag the scrollbar all you want but the text view won t move
and if you change yscroll to not call scrollbar.set you can swipe around the text all you want but the scrollbar won t move

18839692
serializable	deserialization
i suggest that you encapsulate the data you want to serializable in a helper class and limit the serializable deserialization to those data
just declaring that a class implements serializable is not enough to successfully serializable objects of that class

18841594
jar	manifest.mf
using this you may merge two jar one original and 2nd one with updated manifest
as far i know it is not possible to simply replace any attribute of existing manifest.mf file

18841907
inline	inlining
in v8 a function that is so short and doesn t have context allocated variables will get inline
unless of course too much inlining has already accumulated in which case the call is still very cheap as the entire executing part of function fits in a 64 byte instruction cache line

18843161
hex	binary
using the utf16 codec also automatically writes the bom using native endian-ness as well import codecs with codecs.open temp.txt w utf16 as temp temp.write u u810a hex dump of temp.txt ff fe 0a 81 reference codecs.open
joni s answer is the root of the problem but if you use codecs.open instead it always opens in binary mode even if not specified

18844038
qabstractitemmodel	qstandarditemmodel
i just try change my own qabstractitemmodel to qstandarditemmodel and data is not called either
try to use qabstractitemmodel. i think you have implemented almost everything you need to use qabstractitemmodel you need to implement index and parent

18845821
opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
while google-chrome and opera does...
actually firefox doesn t support these stuff at all...

18848165
vb.net	vb6
one workaround might be to create a 64 bit user control in vb.net and then use interop to host your 32 bit control within it but it s a terrible kludge and not worth the effort
i m sorry to say that it s simply not possible to create a 64 bit control with vb6

18854262
awt	swing
there isn t implemented any awt swing listener
how to i join an existing swingworker swingworker isn t shareable because is designated to runs as single instance there isn t non_hacky way s to pass value from one instance to another meaning from publish process setprogress because ther isn t implemented something applicable from getprogress this is job for standard threading threading with semaphore but all output to the already visible swing gui must be wrapped into invokelater only to methods implemented in awt swing not whole methods generated this output you can to invoke swingworker from executor and start 2nd

18855446
spaces	linefeed
dos2unix file or completely strip off its trailing spaces includes r
make sure your file ends with linefeed and and not crlf

18855735
apache	nginx
if nginx is in front it should be on port 80 not apache
also the proxying is done by nginx

18856618
bash	zsh
apparently it is not possible in bash mac default shell
you could use either fish shell or zsh my personal choice with zsh-syntax-highlighting

18856869
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome you can supply none or only one parameter to addeventlistener and no errors will be reported
however firefox is stricter and will spit out the not enough arguments error

18857237
client-side	server-side
at that point client-side is when the javascript including jquery runs
all it sees is the client-side result of the document not how it was built server-side

18858875
noexcept	throw
if t s move constructor is not noexcept and the copy constructor is not accessible vector will use the throw move constructor
if it throw the guarantee is waived and the effects are unspecified

18862277
xslt	xquery
the xpath 2.0 data model is used not only by xpath and xslt but also by xquery
it is defined in a spec called unsurprisingly xquery 1.0 and xpath 2.0 data model xdm

18863758
google-chrome	firefox
what firefox is giving you are warnings not errors taking a look at the jquery mobile source setting a breakpoint on that line using the google-chrome development tools firefox and firebug seemed unable to load the entire script we can see that path.parselocation .hash will be nothing when there is no hash in the url so document.getelementbyid hash will throw the warning you saw in firefox
if it bothers you you can turn off warnings in the firefox development console but if you re going to use jquery mobile i m afraid the warning will be displayed for url s with no hash

18863765
persistent	transient
per the api spec the users will be prompted to allow the quota for the on-client storage allotment because you re requesting persistent not transient storage
while the persistent client storage may be handy it s not entirely transparent to the user

18863868
daemons	systemd
without this dns service would not work for any application in order to enable daemons wpa_supplicant and dhcpcd and set net.dns properties you ll need to use android property systemd property_set and property_get functions
to learn more about android property systemd follow this link in order to use above 2 functions you ll need to hack into bionic and core libcutils library. location bionic libc bionic system_properties.c systemd core libcutils properties.c for issuing dhcp request you need to hack some of the implementation of libnetutils location systemd core libnetutils disabling wifi 1 unload the driver manually

18866506
arraylist	treeset
for example an indexed access in arraylist is o 1 in hashset though not meaningful is o n just for your interest in linkedlist is o n in treeset is o nlogn for adding new element both arraylist and hashset is o 1 operation
inserting in the middle is o n for arraylist while it doesn t make sense in hashset

18866764
dictionary	map
if a given pair does not exist in the dictionary at all it means no sensors contribute to that point
now you can enumerate all of the map points classifying each as good or bad finally you could enumerate the sensors for each good map point to do your analysis note that i have not altered allpairslocal because it doesn t seem necessary for the analysis step

18875629
rvm	bundler
okay first of all you could solve all this issues easily by using rvm user installation see if that is not an option you could try using project-specific gem paths
for example i have the following bundler config file .bundle config --- bundle_path .bundle bundle_disable_shared_gems 1 which causes bundler to install all gems in a .bundle sub directory inside your project folder where you run bundle install

18878839
factors	matrix
i think it is potentially a combination of several factors
t1 needs to be allocated during subtract call and this takes a bit of time t1 is quite possibly already in cache during t1.mul t1 call so accesses are faster i m not sure what type td is but i bet there is a saturate_cast going on for every element in the matrix when you add 1 to td

18886940
jar	war
all unpacked classes and resources in the web-inf classes directory of your web application plus classes and resources in jar files under the web-inf lib directory of your web application are made visible to this web application but not to other ones
jetty the normal configuration is for each web context web application or war file is given it s own classloader which has the system classloader as it s parent

18894368
filewriter	filechannel
it is quite a low level utility class and if you are new to java i would not recommend using this class but have a look at filewriter or filereader
getchannel simply returns a filechannel to the original file

18894796
client-side	server-side
you may have heard about signalr used in vs 2013 browser link feature and that may have confused you if so signalr is only for refreshing client-side pages when you edit the view for example but not for debugging
server-side add your breakpoint in visual studio and then attach the debugger tools attach to process

18896213
boost	allocator
in other words the system does a better job of reducing remote memory transfers to support a thread on a cpu when you re not overrunning your entitlement boost performance
another downside to undersizing your entitlement has to do with power s numa architecture and allocator of vcpu threads to real processors

18896927
implements	extends
like footeractivity and there implements all you need for footer after that your mainactivity should extends from footeractivity and not from activity
i think you can create a class that extends activity.

18897238
vb6	vba
com-based vb vb6 is obsolete and no longer sold
vba is only part of another app or product such as excel word etc. that hosts it and is not appropiate for a stand-alone app

18898677
debian	linux	ubuntu	linux
in debian ubuntu the package name is libsvn-java so you can just run this command to install the library next find the path where the javahl library is installed as you will need to know this path for the following instructions although the library is installed you still have to tell java when used for eclipse where to find it
the jvm on linux does not look in a lot of the standard locations to find the libraries

18898742
client-side	server-side
no not on the client-side
you can use server-side javascript nodejs to do this

18899019
spaces	linefeed
the use of n does not scan in only a linefeed but any white spaces
d skips over leading white spaces anyways so d is the same as d

18902219
strncmp	strcmp
to compare two strings for equality you want something like or more simply since the string literal nand sets a limit on the number of characters to be compared there s not much point in using strncmp rather than strcmp
both arguments to strcmp or the first two arguments to strncmp are of type

18905128
gridview	checkboxlist
it makes also no sense the gridview does not take it into account anyway
if you want to use a checkboxlist in a gridview use a templatefield and databound it in rowdatabound of the gridview

18905306
n-gram	words
wht s your name contains the key phrase what is your name edit i noticed some suggestions to add phonetic encoding to each words in the generated n-gram
i m not sure phonetic encoding is the best answer to this problem as they are mostly tuned to stemming names american german or french depending on the algorithm and are not very good at stemming plain words

18905569
boost	stl
a very good discussion of this problem can be found here dgleich notebook 2006 03 sorting_two_arrays_simultaneou.html here s a possible duplicate of this question sorting zipped locked containers in c++ using boost or the stl the approach in the link above uses std sort and no extra space
it doesn t employ boost zip_iterator just boost tuples and the boost iterator facade

18909979
vb.net	vb6
it seems to be redundant in vb.net
the if not var1 is nothing then is a hangover from vb6

18910475
selecteditem	selectedindex
if you work with objects in your list stick with selecteditem in your work do not go with selectedindex or selectedvalue which have their disadvantages
selecteditem you used in the question is actually much more reliable solution than offered answers with selectedindex or selectedvalue

18911450
uiview	subviews
i don t know exactly why but it seems that tablefooterview can be only an instance of uiview not kind of but is member .
so in my case i ve created new uiview object for example wrapperview and add my custom subviews to it.

18911549
noexcept	throw
in your case t is a unique_ptr for array objects whose move constructor is declared noexcept 20.7.1.3 so you are indeed fine here if the internal resizing of the vector throw a bad_alloc the vector will remain unchanged and usable
gives the strong exception safety guarantee for move-only types if and only if the move construtor of t does not throw

18913670
implements	extends
and this wouldn t work anyways since a map is no collection with the meaning of that interface and thus it doesn t implements collection
for creating an anonymous implementation of map use this or if you want to extends hashmap there s no need for collection.

18915628
innodb	myisam
in mysql this is supported if the storage engine is innodb
other storage engines like myisam do not enforce the constraint although mysql allows the references syntax but it has no effect

18916954
google-chrome	firefox
posting entry did not work with google-chrome but with firefox everything worked as expected
so there seems to be some problems with google-chrome and posting entries from the playground

18917175
stateless	stateful
also if the client disappears the stateless bean does not get destroyed and can serve the next request from another client
on the other hand a stateful session bean is closely connected to the client

18918998
g++	gcc
in g++ it will fail to compile if you use -pedantic
it shouldn t in standard c++ but gcc g++ and i believe msvc both support extensions for such variable length arrays

18919139
innodb	myisam
for one thing this table should use the myisam storage engine not innodb so you aren t saddled with transaction overhead
if it is innodb and you can t change that you may need to write a program to read and then delete the data in smaller chunks

18920667
google-chrome	firefox
if you want a perfectly centered cross mark like this try the following css see demo fiddle cross-browser issue the cross-mark entity does not display with safari or google-chrome
however the same entity displays well in firefox ie and opera

18920739
rsa	aes
you should be encrypting your data with a symmetric key like aes then encrypting the symmetric key with rsa
rsa should not be used to encrypt this kind of data

18920807
rsa	aes
you shouldn t encrypt the message itself with rsa
generate a random aes key and encrypt the key with rsa and the actual message with aes

18923551
udp	tcp
hence as compared to tcp udp is more attractive for delay-sensitive applications like audio video
as a transport-layer protocol udp does not guarantee in-order delivery

18923551
udp	tcp
as a transport-layer protocol udp does not guarantee in-order delivery
for that you would need to use a stream-based transport-layer protocol like tcp or sctp

18923551
sctp	udp
for that you would need to use a stream-based transport-layer protocol like tcp or sctp
udp is a lightweight protocol by design and so does not offer in-order delivery

18924827
ienumerable	icollection
there it only says in a comment types implementing ienumerable are not supported not much of an explanation there
however for collection properties i can see why it makes sense to require at least icollection s because it is essential that object can be added and removed from collections ienumerable has no add and delete methods

18925081
persistent	transient
you can change persistent to transient if you want this change to not be permanent
i d keep it persistent so this doesn t ever happen again

18925813
dbcontext	objectcontext
the summary of the observation is that wcf ria does not support dbcontext indicated by the .tt files
to use the domain service class objectcontext classes are needed

18926665
udp	tcp
fwiw dns is based on udp so talking to a public dns server might be a good starting point
apache is an http server http being a protocol built on tcp not udp

18926665
udp	tcp
apache is an http server http being a protocol built on tcp not udp
you re probably going to be best off trying to write both a client and server that run in the same application and having them talk to each other via udp

18927145
drawimage	putimagedata
you will need to use drawimage to utilize composite modes and this would be faster as well as drawimage works directly with the bitmap memory array s
short answer is no composite modes does not affect putimagedata

18927765
viewdidload	viewwillappear
ui is not necessarily initialized in viewdidload
try moving your alertview code to viewwillappear

18927853
h.264	webm
the big difference we can notice is the lack of webm but when you look at the browser support of video formats i think this can be explained by if a browser supports webm it also supports theora the ogg line of the snippet and or h.264 theora h.264 was supported before webm so even an old browser version would play your video on a pragmatic note.
it makes one less file to maintain less disk storage needed less time wasted if the content of the video changes ... plus and this derives from the first two notes if your browser doesn t support theora or h.264 and you want to maximize the compatibility you better rely on flash support than webm support according that you have flash installed

18929134
move	drag
for example add to selection + left click and optionally drag subtract from selection + left click and drag--this combination doesn t work in sublime text 3 but supposedly it works in 2 add block selection + left click and drag subtract block selection + left click and drag keyboard windows return to single selection mode esc extend selection upward downward at all carets ctrl + alt + up down extend selection leftward rightward at all carets shift + left right move all carets up down left right and clear selection up down left right undo the last selection motion ctrl + u add next occurrence of selected text to selection ctrl + d add all occurrences of the selected text to the selection alt + f3 rotate between occurrences of selected text single selection ctrl + f3 reverse ctrl + shift + f3 turn a single linear selection into a block selection with a caret at the end of the selected text in each line ctrl + shift + l linux return to single selection mode esc extend selection upward downward at all carets alt + up down note that you may be able to hold ctrl as well to get the same shortcuts as windows but linux tends to use ctrl + alt combinations for global shortcuts
extend selection leftward rightward at all carets shift + left right move all carets up down left right and clear selection up down left right undo the last selection motion ctrl + u add next occurrence of selected text to selection ctrl + d add all occurrences of the selected text to the selection alt + f3 rotate between occurrences of selected text single selection ctrl + f3 reverse ctrl + shift + f3 turn a single linear selection into a block selection with a caret at the end of the selected text in each line ctrl + shift + l mac os x return to single selection mode that s the mac symbol for escape extend selection upward downward at all carets see note extend selection leftward rightward at all carets move all carets up down left right and clear selection undo the last selection motion u add next occurrence of selected text to selection d add all occurrences of the selected text to the selection g rotate between occurrences of selected text single selection g reverse g turn a single linear selection into a block selection with a caret at the end of the selected text in each line l notes for mac users on yosemite and el capitan and are system keyboard shortcuts by default

18932034
implements	extends
getting on specifics as noted on the comments your class should be named house not build so you instantiate create an object or build a new house and there are also some other things you are doing wrong not necessary related to oo design but important use interfaces that s what oop is all about house implements building maybe also residence
write an interface instead and try to only extends classes you cannot instantiate you can go in as deep as you want but you don t want like 5 different generations of objects being instantiated in your app with who knows which methods overridden

18932341
inline	inlining
the only absolute effect of the inline keyword is to suppress the odr rule and avoid multiple definition errors
beyond that the compiler is certainly free to take the keyword as a hint about inlining but it may or may not do so

18932433
inline	inlining
however adding static to func makes it go inline too
so clearly the compiler decides this based on the fact that some other function may be using func too so we need a copy anyway and there isn t much gain from inlining it

18933086
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
the message you are seeing is because at index 0 there is a uiviewcontroller instance corresponding with the label view controller - gestures in your storyboard and you are trying to send it a message that uiviewcontroller does not respond to in the belief that it is a uinavigationcontroller
the uinavigationcontroller that contains the playersviewcontroller controller is at index 1 in the tab bar controller s viewcontrollers array

18934194
lxml	beautifulsoup
in your python console try import lxml if this doesn t import correctly try installing lxml with pip pip install lxml
you have an error in beautifulsoup not in mediainfo itself

18937187
listview	gridview
activity_main.xml grid_item_layout.xml customadapter.class mainactivity final look note from my experience when there are a lot of pictures in the gridview scrolling becomes slow and laggy however it s not the topic of your question so in case it s also a problem please see lazy load of images in listview
you could use a custom adapter as for a listview and of course you will set this it as an adapter for the gridview

18941646
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
exception is a checked exception itself but is also the superclass for runtimeexception and other unchecked-exception
1 in the first case because the exception class hierarchy includes runtimeexception the compiler cannot conclude that an exception will not be thrown in your block

18943879
textview	imageview
if your widgets don t contain elements which can vary in height largely such as descriptive textview use a vertical linearlayout and assign 30 percent of the weight to the map and the rest to the widgets
depending on how large in height your widgets could become you can still use a scrollview if your users wouldn t have to interact with the map you could also retrieve a corresponding map tile via google s static map api and simply display it in an imageview

18944376
cpython	pypy
i m afraid the library would have to be adapted to work with pypy pypy doesn t support the same c extension mechanism cpython does
also i m not sure if python 3 support is ready or even usable in pypy as of yet they re still collecting donations for the py3k pypy sub-project as per the right side of the home page of their site

18944385
memcpy	memmove
just a little note using memcpy to replace memmove will not work because the first two parameters overlap
h e l l o 0 0 1 2 3 4 5 the code memmove myst1r myst1r + 1 1 copies the character at place 1 e to place 0

18949049
cpython	pypy
there is no claim that pypy will even run all the programs that cpython runs at all let alone faster
that site does not claim pypy is 6.3 times faster than cpython

18949049
cpython	pypy
that site does not claim pypy is 6.3 times faster than cpython
to quote the geometric average of all benchmarks is 0.16 or 6.3 times faster than cpython this is a very different statement to the blanket statement you made and when you understand the difference you ll understand at least one set of reasons why you can t just say use pypy

18949652
cpython	pypy
so objects tend to be deleted earlier and __del__ is called in a more predictable way in cpython
some software relies on this behavior thus they are not ready for migrating to pypy

18949951
innodb	myisam
it is a very old technological dinosaur it is not transactional and it is not nearly as robust as innodb when it comes to corruption and crash recovery
you should be using innodb and this legacy behavior in myisam is no good reason to do that differently

18950238
udp	tcp
multiple udp sockets all bound to the same port can all co-exist provided either the same condition as at 1 or they have all had the so_reuseaddr option set before binding
tcp ports and udp ports occupy different namespaces so the use of a port for tcp does not preclude its use for udp and vice versa

18951682
queue	fifo
in dequeue you re doing you should according to your impl. change it to addition this is not an implementation of a queue a queue works in fifo and what you implemented works lifo which is actually more like a...stack
in order to implement a queue you should start with both head tail pointing to array 0 . then every insert is addattail which means that the item will be entered at array tail you stop inserting when tail array.length throw exception

18953464
profiling	benchmarking
edit what i like about the profiling is that it gives you a breakdown of each subfunction s processing time - hence it s a great way to spot bottlenecks in larger processes. that s probably not so much the use case here
using the profiling is almost as simple as tic toc if your 4 functions are independent and don t influence each other you can also profile all of them in one block the profiling will let you have a look at the processing times for each single line of code. you can either benchmarking wall-clock or cpu-time the default is cpu-time

18953974
qthread	qobject
first of all you should not subclass qthread directly
see create a normal class instead a subclass of qobject or similar and implement your code there

18957908
oncreate	onstart
the differece between the 2 is that when you use the showfragment method whereby you pre-load all the fragments in your host activity in my case loginactivity.java what happens is that all the fragment s oncreate onstart and onresume functions are called
this behaviour was bad as some of my fragments started carrying out the code in the onstart methods causing all the progressdialogs to show as well when they shouldn t

18958181
cpython	pypy
whether pypy solves the mentioned great challenges and will in general be faster less memory hungry and more friendly to parallelism than cpython is an open question that cannot be solved in the short term
some people are betting that pypy will never be able to offer a general solution enabling it to dominate cpython 2.7 and 3.3 in all cases

18958181
cpython	pypy
there also exist issues such as the fact that cpython runs on a wider range of cpus and oses but these issues are much less important compared to pypy s performance and cpython-compatibility goals
a pypy isn t 100 compatible with cpython because it isn t simulating cpython under the hood

18960096
build.gradle	gradlew
on the other way round though if you add the dependency in your build.gradle script but not through the project module settings the android studio may complain but when you ran a build task eg
. gradlew assembledebug --info from the command line it should be ok

18961437
innodb	myisam
try to load into myisam then alter the table to innodb use alter table
disable keys to avoid index updates line by line myisam only set bulk_insert_buffer_size above your insert size myisam only set so that unique constrains are not checked

18963467
client-side	server-side
the source should look something like this instead you have this that syntax implies that instead of simply entering client-side javascript to execute you re running server -side javascript to compute what the client-side javascript should be
server-side javascript does not define a global xsp object like client-side javascript does which is why you re getting a referenceerror

18966489
aggregate-functions	sum	aggregate-functions	coalesce	sum	coalesce
major points the aggregate-functions sum ignores null values
coalesce per row is not required any more as soon as you recast the calculation as the difference of two sums coalesce sum nullif new_value numeric 0 - coalesce sum nullif old_value numeric 0 as hours however if it is possible that all columns of a selection have null or empty strings wrap the sums into coalesce once

18966517
drawimage	putimagedata
the better approach would be to store your chunks as off-screen canvases or images sprites and use drawimage to draw them onto your main canvas
not only will this preserve existing pixels depending on composite mode if that is changed but it will also be faster than using putimagedata

18969694
udp	tcp
udp messages are self-contained
unlike tcp a udp message cannot be partially sent received

18971053
innodb	myisam
use myisam usually much faster than innodb if your data base isnt transaction oriented
converting huge myisam into innodb will again run into performance issues so i am not sure i would do that

18974361
implements	extends
you do not need to implements something
just create a your exception class which would extends salesforce exception class

18976115
required	placeholder
transferring images through the existing lync required setting up a sort of tcp file transfer and is not really what you re after
you could definitely create a lync client using the lync sdk and replace certain placeholder like mynewemoticon with an image

18976130
strtol	strtod
on the other hand the iostreams approach lets you consume trailing whitespace thanks to which the strtol -solution doesn t
there s also std stol which wraps strtol and similarly for strtoull strtod etc. but it throws an exception on error and i believe that exceptions are not the right tool for structuring control flow of normal behaviour like reading user input

18976766
viewmodel	caliburn
2.- you can follow an approach that doesn t instantiate the viewmodel until it is needed
there exist some toolkits such mvvm light or caliburn micro that ease the implementation of mvvm pattern

18977030
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
it has only been implemented in opera except for the special case where the content value is an url expression interpreted as referring to an image this is supported by google-chrome and safari too
moreover even the limited support wouldn t do much good here since the extension does not seem to work on google-chrome when the element is a button and on opera the generated content appears as such not within a button widget

18977392
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
iit is possible to change the file system to be case-sensitive but it s a pretty major thing that you really don t want to be doing...
you cannot easily do this on windows because filenames in windows are case-insensitive by default

18979487
strcpy	malloc
and even if they are the problem si that strcpy has to read for checking the 0 and as far it isn t initialized strcp is reading uninitialized memory anyway
and finaly a standard quote j.2 undefined behavior 1 the behavior is undefined in the following circumstances .. the value of the object allocated by the malloc function is used 7.20.3.3

18986603
uinavigationbar	uitabbaritem
will set the title of a uitabbaritem but not the uinavigationbar
you can set the title of the uinavigationbar in storyboard by double clicking the actual navigationbar and typing in a title right there

18988335
viewdidload	viewdidappear
setting the color after it is added to the navigation item in viewdidload works for the first screen but not later screens
you can do it in viewdidappear but you end up with blue during the animation

18988846
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
hence the runtimeexception here is the exception hierarchy
it is be cause nosuchelementexception is unchecked-exception which means that it is-a runtimeexception which does not force you to catch

18988846
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
it is be cause nosuchelementexception is unchecked-exception which means that it is-a runtimeexception which does not force you to catch
the unchecked-exception classes are the class runtimeexception and its subclasses and the class error and its subclasses

18990567
udp	tcp
for instance udp datagram sockets send receive self-contained messages data cannot span across message boundaries
tcp stream sockets do not have that restriction so logical messages must be delimited instead either with a header that describes the message length or a unique terminator that does not appear in the message data

18991978
uiview	calayer
you can also supply a calayerdelegate as long as its not the uiview
see these questions using calayer delegate and ios using uiview #39

18993324
union	distinct
you can t use a union since sql will consider 1 2 and 1 null to be distinct
not knowing your schema i would try the following in psuedo code this will only return the primary keys in query_2 that are not in query_1 and get you a clean union where the query_1 results are prioritized over query_2 results

18994465
sudo	passwd
sudo mkdir var mysql sudo ln -s tmp mysql.sock var mysql mysql.sock
take a look at this tutorial make sure your passwd is correct if you need it you can change it with this usr local mysql bin mysqladmin -u root -p passwd when it asks for a passwd do not enter anything just hit enter

18994641
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
so if your view controller has been pushed onto a uinavigationcontroller stack toplayoutguide will tell you how many points from the top of the screen the status bar and navigation bar cover
you can use this value scroll content in a uiscrollview to just below the navigation bar or ensure other content in your view isn t being covered by the uinavigationbar

18995188
tidekit	tidesdk
if you are interested in tidekit follow us tidekit on twitter or watch our short video on youtube
tidesdk is still in beta therefore it does not exactly provide what you are looking for

18999152
namenode	hdfs
quoting hadoop source documentation org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.protocol.clientprotocol is used by user code via org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.distributedfilesystem class to communicate with the namenode
dse does not come with namenodes nor datanodes - they are part of apache hadoop hdfs and in dse they have been replaced by cassandra file system

18999152
namenode	hdfs
dse does not come with namenode nor datanodes - they are part of apache hadoop hdfs and in dse they have been replaced by cassandra file system
the stacktrace states you are using hdfs protocol to connect to the jobtracker node which suggests you are incorrectly sumbitting your jobs

19000670
opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
to get it to work in shorthand notation it has to look like this also note that there s a value called cover which may be suitable and more flexible here the support for background-size in the shorthand notation is also not very broad as it s supported in firefox 18+ google-chrome 21+ ie9+ and opera
it is not supported in safari at all

19010753
jar	manifest.mf
i don t know if the codebase attribute is required for sandboxing the applet but it seems like a good idea for most signed applets anyway. then use that manifest file when building your jar like jar cvfm yourjarfile.jar your_manifest_file.txt classes_and_such those attributes will wind up in the manifest.mf file in the jar which tells the java runtime to keep the applet sandboxed
in your tag you have to specify the permissions param as discussed here applet code yourappletclass archive yourjarfile.jar param name permissions value sandbox applet without this second step a signed applet requesting sandboxed permissions in the jar but not the tag is prevented from being run with a dialog box titled the application cannot be run giving reason jar manifest requested to run in sandbox only. if you do both steps above the user gets a much more reassuring message and presumably the applet remains sandboxed this application will run with limited access that is intended to protect your computer and personal information

19014442
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
i found their answer did not address scroll width so i added the check for obj.scrollleft and behaved differently in firefox and google-chrome until i added the checks for thewindow.scrolly and thewindow.scrollx
tested in google-chrome ie safari opera firefox ie 9-10 and ie9 with 8 and 7 modes

19017235
decimal	ieee
this latter includes the result of compiling the same source code with different compilers that do not provide strict floating-point evaluation. ieee 754 also specifies a decimal floating point format and that does have multiple representations for values
ieee 754 binary floating point has exactly one encoding for each representable value except zero for which there is a +0 and a 0

19018884
comparator	comparable
as luiggi mendoza points out you can also implement a comparator and use it via the other form of min max if it doesn t
you can replace those methods with these though that assumes t implements comparable

19019948
decoder	encoder
few things which you need to keep in mind while encoding audio using libav what is the pcm sample format of the decoder frame av_sample_fmt_s16 av_sample_fmt_fltp etc. how many samples per channel are there in the decoder frame
each audio encoder takes only a specific type of sample format so if the pcm sample format is not same as the sample format of encoder than you have to do sample format conversion

19020317
icomparable	compareto
replacing the class definition with public class errorafterobject icomparable and the compareto method with works as one expects
as it turns out icomparable and are not the same thing

19025446
mediarecorder	audiorecord
mediarecorder doesn t give you access directly to the audio buffer but if you use audiorecord you can
if you must use mediarecorder then perhaps save it to a file and then re-read the file back in again

19026389
setinterval	settimeout
you can not loops magically with settimeout i would recommend you to make use of setinterval instead or use closure functions and a proper for-loop
settimeout doesn t admit as a 3rd parameter the name of a function

19027730
google-chrome	firefox
flash object not tried flash objects can make cors requests or so i read a firefox extension same as the google-chrome situation instructions on how to have the remote services enable cors
in case anyone searches this i have offered my app with the following workarounds a small node.js proxy approx 10 lines of code and i have a standalone proxy to get around cors a google-chrome extension extensions can make cors requests

19029475
swift	objective-c
it merely results in compile-time warnings but doesn t strictly enforce this at runtime like true generics in other languages such as swift
the ## is a macro concatenation operator so that custom_array_interface foo would concatenate foo with array and result in or custom_array_interface nsstring would result in it s worth noting that objective-c now supports lightweight generics eliminating the need for the above pattern

19031027
treemap	linkedhashmap
treemap performs a compareto call on the root of the tree and goes off down the left or right branch depending on the result of this and returns the value if key.compareto node.key returns 0 as you have seen println mystring.compareto mygroovystring prints 0
this is why the item is found in the treemap and the different hashcode is why it is not found in the linkedhashmap groovy strings are not strings they are a templating mechanism and a completely different object

19031852
opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
so aac support and here is another link saying google-chrome supports the mp4 container format with the h.264 video codec and either the aac audio codec or the mp3 audio codec is natively supported by internet explorer safari and google-chrome but chromium and opera do not support the format
firefox will soon support the format but only when a third-party decoder is available

19031852
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
since h.264 is currently not a royalty free format it is unfit for the open web platform according to mozilla 1 2 google 1 2 and opera
however since royalty free formats are not supported by internet explorer and safari mozilla has decided to support the format anwyay and google never fulfilled their promise to remove support for it in google-chrome

19032104
nsmutablestring	nsstring
however given you are actually manipulating an nsmutablestring object which is mutable you probably want the appendstring method instead
the stringbyappendingstring method is on the non-mutable nsstring class where non-mutable means you cannot modify it

19033875
ssl	https
my next step would be to use wireshark to capture the ssl session and decrypt it but i ve run out of time
i tested using a php app hosted behind nginx and while using https the server was able to send cookies that did not include the secure flag

19034168
prepare	execute
that is if you do not need any of the prepare statement features or protection on the execute
this is due to the groovy sql engine trying to turn it into a prepare statement because it sees the original string as a gstring

19034519
viewdidload	viewdidappear
you shouldn t do any animation in viewdidload as the view won t have a superview yet so the animation is irrelevant
a few thoughts on your code sample you can use viewdidappear as long as you want the animation every time the view appears not just the first time it is presented

19040972
prepare	execute
don t prepare queries you aren t going to execute
it s true that you need to prepare a different sql string if you have differences in the search terms in the where clause

19048765
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	centos
linux version doesn t support 32bit version except for ubuntu as shown in the above link
cuda zone has everything you need to start all you need to install is listed here for centos 5 x86_64 you can install the version for linux rhel 5.5

19055351
clang	llvm
but it didn t work bjam and b2 are the same thing b2 is the new name clang as a first-class toolset was added somewhere along the way so you can ignore any instructions on the web to modify user-config.jam everything you need seems to be able to be passed on the b2 command line for these one-off builds.
to build 32 64 bit fat static binaries for boost 1.54.0 compiled with clang llvm the only compiler for xcode 5 download the unix tarball not the zip

19055579
bash	subshell
according to the section command execution environment in the bash manual and slightly confusingly subshell spawned to execute command substitutions inherit the value of the -e option from the parent shell
when not in posix mode bash clears the -e option in such subshell

19055579
bash	subshell
when not in posix mode bash clears the -e option in such subshell
regardless of the posix setting the -e only applies to the subshell created for the purposes of command substitution

19059194
bash	zsh
if you call it unquoted bash will do the smart thing and after looking for the pattern in your current directory and not finding anything will pass the parameter to the function as is
zsh on the other hand will try to match the pattern in your current directory then complain about not finding anything and not execute the function at all

19062168
realloc	malloc
i can t compile your code to test but on a quick visual inspection this looks suspicious in gathersquares you need to realloc based on i not count points to
i suspect this isn t a memory leak but that you re writing before the beginning or after the end of your allocated buffers and thus overwriting the data that malloc uses to maintain it s data structures thus a failure in malloc

19066399
listview	gridview
the gridview is visible by default and the listview is not
when we navigate to the page the visualstatemanager is called after the page is rendered and therefore when navigated to the gridview is visible for a short time and calls the loadmoreitemsasync method before it gets hidden

19066877
floating-point	fractions
1000 is exactly 1000 remaining bits are even so do not add. this is round to nearest ties to even . also there is no mantissa in a floating-point number
the fractions portion is the significand

19070312
arraylist	treeset
if a thread-safe implementation is not needed it is recommended to use arraylist in place of vector
from the description of what you want to do you don t really want to use a list at all what you want is a treeset

19072386
portrait	landscape
handling device orientation portrait vs landscape on ipad
handhelds have only portrait displaying thumbnails in xcode 4 if you create image files with the correct resolution carefully read the doc as resolutions are not what you might expect follow the naming rules documented by apple place the files at the top level of your app bundle then thumbnails of the images will automatically appear within project settings of xcode 4

19072789
profiling	debugging
but there are some thing you can do to help you -log files are in app storage logs -you can use log class to write your debugging to the log -you can show sql queries by listening db edit after look at sheikh heera s found another profiling package for laravel that looks pretty good too
not yet it seems that a profiling is coming to us sooner or later

19072822
http.sys	httplistener
http.sys manages this for you this isn t usually a huge disadvantage but it s just something to be aware of any bugs in the header cookie classes will bite you
such as the issue where setting multiple cookies will cause httplistener to return a single set-cookie header with multiple cookies in it which ie will handle but chrome will completely ignore you have to then hand-roll the cookies and add your own set-cookie header to work-around this advantages of tcplistener like httplistener this implements i o completion ports for you if you want to do something once for a connection like check auth you can do it since you know when the socket is opened

19073517
memcpy	malloc
there are a few ways this can be done global variables yuck not thread safe don t really do this malloc some memory memcpy your arguments into it or pointers to them and pass that newly malloc ed memory to pthread_create
in your called function you ll have to parse the 3 variables back out of the void hacky but works in theory define a struct that contains your 3 arguments malloc a copy of that struct copy your variables into the newly malloced struct and pass it as your 4th argument

19074973
hive	hdfs
hive is not a full database
the design constraints and limitations of hadoop and hdfs impose limits on what hive can do

19074973
hive	hdfs
the design constraints and limitations of hadoop and hdfs impose limits on what hive can do
hive is most suited for data warehouse applications where 1 relatively static data is analyzed 2 fast response times are not required and 3 when the data is not changing rapidly

19079312
jruby	mri
jruby does not have this limitation
in mri ruby you can get parallel work done by using separate processes via process.fork

19080433
stateless	stateful
once a stateless bean is no use it doesn t destroy rather it goes to bean pool so in future it can serve to other clients
stateful bean one bean only for one client

19081574
udp	tcp
so this way we can actually reduce the scope of the question and ask what are the features of tcp that one would like to add to udp since there is no way one can add features of udp to tcp
tcp gives you three features that udp does not a estimating sending rate b retransmission and c flow-control

19081574
udp	tcp
tcp gives you three features that udp does not a estimating sending rate b retransmission and c flow-control
in doing so the tradefoff is that tcp becomes slower compared to udp

19081574
udp	tcp
typically udp applications might add forward-error-correction or application layer packet-book-keeping to ensure retransmission
there is yet another advantage that udp offers which tcp does not if you have an application that might use mulitcast

19081574
udp	tcp
there is yet another advantage that udp offers which tcp does not if you have an application that might use mulitcast
for such cases udp would be the right chioce since udp can handle point to multipoint

19083543
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
hold the right click button over the tab you want and drag it over the controller then set that controller as the location for the tab if you do that you can ignore 1 and 2 above uitabbarcontroller are not meant to do different functionality per tab so that s a bad coding practice to have the first tab set a label and the second tab display an uiviewcontroller but that is irrelevant
after all of that uitabbarcontroller stuff the app is possibly crashing because your uinavigationcontroller is nil or you get a secondview is not value coding compliant error or something similiar this means that a property is set in a storyboard to an item that no longer exist

19088516
decimal	ieee
0.1 is coded 0 01111011 10011001100110011001101 with float number 0 is the sign positive 01111011 the exponent 123 - 123 - 127 -4 127 is the bias in ieee 754 10011001100110011001101 the mantissa to convert the mantissa in decimal number we have 1.10011001100110011001101 2 -4 base2 the 1.xxx is implicit in ieee 754 0.000110011001100110011001101 base2 1 2 4 + 1 2 5 + 1 2 8 + 1 2 9 + 1 2 12 + 1 2 13 + 1 2 16 + 1 2 17 + 1 2 20 + 1 2 21 + 1 2 24 + 1 2 25 + 1 2 27 base10 1 16 + 1 32 + 1 256 + 1 512 + 1 4096 + 1 8192 + 1 65536 + 1 131072 ... base10 0.10000000149011612 base10
0.1 is not really 0.1 with ieee 754 standard

19089469
implements	extends
so in this example you implements drive turn and stop only once and add the other functionality in the inheriting classes
another usage for this kind of inheritance in when classa is an abstract class that is not implementing some of the functionality and classb and some other classc are concrete classes that extends classa

19089469
implements	extends
another usage for this kind of inheritance in when classa is an abstract class that is not implements some of the functionality and classb and some other classc are concrete classes that extends classa
in this case classa implements the common behavior of classb and classc and the two classes add their needed functionality

19091258
nsorderedset	nsset
i have pretty much given up on nsorderedset
they are a bit unwieldy being neither derived from nsarray nor from nsset so a lot of the usual functionality is simply not available

19091837
imperative	declarative
imperative way executes code only once when some action takes place
qt quick is a declarative language and this approach is recommended but not all problems can be solved using it

19091837
imperative	declarative
generally you can think of these approaches as of terms borrowed from electronics edge-triggered and level-triggered execution of code - when you want to execute some code once triggered by some action you could interpret edge as some event use imperative approach and onsomethingchanged or onsomethinghappened handlers
mouse handling is such case definitely as it s event-based . on the other hand if you want piece of yout code to be maintained all the time some condition is met level is not changing - use declarative way

19096242
multiplying	subtract
for which a signaling nan could be a normal operand not an exceptional operand. multiplying an infinity by a zero directly or in a fused multiply-add
adding infinities with opposite signs or subtract infinities with the same sign

19096332
ostream	ostringstream
you should always be overloading on std istream or std ostream depending on the direction
it s exceedingly rare that std stringstream would even be used std istringstream or std ostringstream would usually be more appropriate and even if they were will normally return a not a

19096695
cpython	pypy	cpython	ironpython
in cpython the most common implementation of python and also pypy but in contrast to other implementations like jython or ironpython the gil global interpreter lock prevents more than one thread from running at any given time
so under cpython multiple threads actually run serially not concurrently

19097196
google-chrome	firefox
to build on the prior answer this is how i have the css setup to print from google-chrome or ie
firefox still does not work

19098617
inline	inlining
you should use inline as a means of safely bypassing one definition rule odr and define functions in a header file rather than doing do for performance reasons
it is not reasonable to put any code for inlining just because you want to replace the function body inline to the point of function call any modern day compiler will do so on its own

19104652
uilabel	uitextview
uilabel isn t meant for that much text
use a uitextview with editing disabled

19106889
quicksort	mergesort
quicksort this is a bit tricky to implement efficiently with lists but it is possible
i won t discuss it because it s not a good early programming project and mergesort is faster in many cases

19109146
uiview	subviews
check whether the subviews is uiview for ios7 or uiimageview for ios6 or earlier
and if it is uiview i am going to add uiimageview as subviews on that view and voila its working and not crash.

19109382
implements	extends
idispeventimpl implements sink interface to handle event methods calls
you cannot extends it with your own additional methods directly

19110289
translation	localization
instead i guess it s best to dry your way out of the issue dont repeat yourself a quick reckon reveals a solution to your problem is already available the waavi translation package should fit your needs it s a translation package for laravel 4 with database and cache support from the docs upgrading laravel s localization module keeping a project s translation properly updated is cumbersome
usually translators do not have access to the codebase and even when they do it s hard to keep track of which translation are missing for each language or when updates to the original text require that translation be revised

19111479
google-chrome	firefox
you can try this solution i have not tested it yet reportviewer print button in google-chrome
the print button doesn t work in firefox google-chrome because it s an activex control

19128595
multiplying	addition
to not have to do all that written math then just do this pad with zeros if it helps then split them apart to the width of our adder simplify a little a three digit number straight out of elementary school then split up the addition into columns your add operation can digest...this scales up forever any size numbers you want operated on by any size multiplying and add your processor supports
if you dont have a multiplying operation then it still works exactly the same way but one side of your multiplier that you dont have is a bit width of 1

19130274
uiview	subviews
assuming this is a view controller you also don t need to cast view to here because the base class of uiview is what implements removefromsuperview
it looks like you re simply not doing a loop through the subviews

19130458
express	node.js
node is not meant to be used alongside php those are completly two different backend technologies why would you want to use php-apache and node together when you can very easily build the application using express framework i suggest go ahead with node-express-mongo
first its not a bad idea to use node.js to satisfy your requirement the uniqueness of node and added advantage compared to conventional technologies like apache-php is clearly explained in this following video why node.js is better .the notion of node being just used for advanced or complex applications is wrong you can use node for building applications which are very simple to anything of huge proportion.it would be a not so comfortable task for a node beginner to code without using any frameworks but by using this web application framework called express you need not code from scratch and its very easy to setup html pages using its simplified html templating language called jade and route requests also you can even use your html pages if you are not willing to use jade for rendering the views of your application .here are the series of tutorials which would help you tutorials on beginning with node.js basics of expressjs advanced express tutorials . the series of videos also have tutorials on getting connected to the no-sql database mongo-db mongo is most popular database that is used alongside node backend here is the video which compares mongo and sql mongo v s sql

19131692
client-side	server-side
i ve combined leading with validation. here my code of course this is not a comprehensive client-side date validation there is no ability here to validate such date as 30 02 2013 for example
i have to use for that server-side date validation

19132659
dictionary	map
you could implement the lookup table with a dictionary to map the enum values onto strings and if the dictionary doesn t contain the enum value fall back to enum.tostring to get the value
that way you only need to add the exceptions such as pageup and pagedown to the dictionary

19134844
sudo	passwd
to get around this you have a couple of options use something like pythonbrew which allows you to switch python interpreters on your system you still wont be able to yum install python-setuptools but allows you to easily switch between python 2.6 2.7 3.3 use the following command from the setuptools website wget -o - | python to install as long as python gives you python2.7 after doing that easy_install pip to get pip installed on your system hopefully for python 2.7 use virtualenv s - they get round all your sudo problems
a couple of things your sudo passwd is likely the passwd for the user account on your server however your user account may not have sudo access

19134928
memcpy	realloc
memcpy is only allowed for trivially-copyable types thing is not such a type
i m not even sure that new lua_newuserdata l size thing is allowed because lua uses realloc to claim new memory by default and this can result in the memory being moved realloc might memcpy it anyway

19136930
apache	nginx
but websockets or server sent events would be a much better idea. however using server sent events sse on apache is also not really a good idea as apache will create a proces for each open connection
if you would like to use sse i suggest using nginx link to sse

19137689
implements	extends
i wanted to reap the benefits of enummap and not be restricted to just one enum class but rather many different ones that were implements the same interface. in the below example i had an interface named layout that i had a few enum classes extends it
i then created a helper class record which utilized the enummap to handle and store mapping some string values to the enums in my enum class and i needed it to accept different enum classes that were all extends the layout interface

19139418
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
this is wrong initialviewcontroller uiviewcontroller -- homenavigationcontroller uinavigationcontroller -- homecontroller uiviewcontroller -- moviedetailcontroller uiviewcontroller -- commentviewcontroller uiviewcontroller this is right homenavigationcontroller uinavigationcontroller -- initialviewcontroller uiviewcontroller -- homecontroller uiviewcontroller -- moviedetailcontroller uiviewcontroller -- commentviewcontroller uiviewcontroller
finally i figured out if you give a uinavigationcontroller after initialviewcontroller ecsliding does not work correctly

19141732
ienumerable	iqueryable
iqueryable implements ienumerable and adds info for an expression and a provider
this basically allows it to build and execute sql statements against a database and not have to load whole tables when fetching data and iterating over them like you would over an ienumerable

19141732
ienumerable	iqueryable
this basically allows it to build and execute sql statements against a database and not have to load whole tables when fetching data and iterating over them like you would over an ienumerable
because linq defers execution of the expression until it s used it compiles the iqueryable expression into sql and executes the database query only right before it s needed

19142299
implements	extends
it s a limitation of java s built-in dynamic proxies you can only implements a number of interfaces but never extends a class
in your case what i suppose you are trying to do is extends outputer and no you cannot do that with dynamic proxies by design

19142476
g++	gcc
try using g++ -g -wall -o main main.cpp file1.cpp also i would recommend to use makefile variables like this hope this helps
you ll need to compile all .cpp files that you use i assume they are not included somewhere . that way the compiler will know that file1.cpp and main.cpp are used together. also i would suggest using g++ instead of gcc because g++ is the specific c++ compiler while gcc supports c and c++

19148804
vb6	vba
in vb6 we set the item.vb_usermemid attribute to 0 and we get a default property procedure attributes in vba the ide does not provide any way of editing those but you can edit the code in notepad and import the edited .cls file into your vba project
in vb6 you have a tools menu to edit those tells vb to use this property to provide an enumerator - we re just passing it that of the encapsulated collection and it being a hidden property it begins with an underscore don t try this at home

19148804
icomparable	compareto
icomparable.cls add a new class module and call it icomparable - if you really plan to use them for something else then you could put them in two separate class modules and call the other one iequatable but that would make you two interfaces to implement instead of one for all reference types you want to be able to work with
this isn t mock-up code all that s needed is the method signatures list.cls putting the icomparable interface to use given that we have packed our icomparable with compareto and equals we can now find the index of any value in our list

19148804
icomparable	compareto
this isn t mock-up code all that s needed is the method signatures list.cls putting the icomparable interface to use given that we have packed our icomparable with compareto and equals we can now find the index of any value in our list
we can also determine if the list contains any specified value the compareto method comes into play when we start asking what the min and max values might be these two functions allow a very readable sorting - because of what s going on here adding removing items we re going to have to fail fast the final touch the rest is just trivial stuff one fun thing about is that it can be copied into an array just by calling toarray on it - we can do exactly that that s all

19149925
udp	tcp
if you re stuck with udp you could always just prepend a 1 byte or less block to each chunk to specify the ordering then sort them on the client side using that
i m not familiar with standard methodology in such a situation but afaik tcp is ordered

19152104
mp4	h.264
today the widest support is available with an mp4 container and a video stream encoded with the h.264 avc codec
as i said there is no silver bullet and h.264 support is not universal by any means but this one format will be playable more potential users than any other single choice you could make due to its popularity and wide support in modern desktop and mobile environments

19153113
uiview	subviews
check whether the subviews is uiview for ios7 or uiimageview for ios6 or earlier
and if it is uiview i am going to add uiimageview as subviews on that view and voila its working and not crash.

19153361
mongodb	bson
we were sort of unsatisfied with the way casbah works for deep objects or simple maps and no real case class mapping support so we rolled our own mongodb synchronous scala driver on top of the legacy java driver which i would like to shamelessly plug here with an example on how to store and retrieve a map and a simple case class
the driver does not have a lot of magic and is easy to setup and features a simple bson implementation which was inspired by the play2 json impl

19155783
trie	tree
it is possible to build one with a tree of dict objects see how to create a trie in python but there is a package marisa-trie that implements a memory-efficient version by binding to c++ libraries i have not used this library before but playing around with it i got this working
you could use a trie data structure

19161895
ng-include	ng-app
ng-include can be used in combination with predefined templates using on a script tag
note the script tag containing the template does not need to be included in the head of the document but it must be below the ng-app definition

19164924
dictionary	map
you have a dictionary not a list
dictionaries map keys to values

19166835
cassini	iis
cassini only supports the first syntax but doesn t understand or crash on the second iis only understand the second syntax and crashes on the first with their powers combined you get a system as well thought out as tomcat and websphere
here s a guy from the cassini project explaining that integrated modules will never be supported

19172415
automake	autotools
the autoconf automake and libtool are available from ftp.gnu.org
installing macports for autotools is not required since you can build them from source

19172654
rtp	rtcp
the actual data of a voip call is carried over rtp which really only takes 24-64kbps depending upon codec and requires udp addresses going each way
occasional rtcp packets are sent to report status metrics etc but are not really needed

19181664
pascal	delphi
c# and java doesn t have destructors object pascal is preferable instead of delphi or free pascal because object pascal is the name of a program language while delphi and free pascal are compilers of object pascal
base c# super java inherited object pascal the 3 keywords works in the same way

19182342
implements	extends
another convenient solution my favorite is to have a checkboxtreeviewer since you need to implements multi selection and such
it is not possible to extends a combo it is possible to extends combo by overriding checksubclass however it is highly disapproved of

19188198
onclick	onmouseup
why does onclick not give coordinates onclick in firemonkey is the same onclick as in the vcl
onclick is the sum of onmousedown and onmouseup as such there is no one place where the click took place because the vcl did not want to choose between the down or up coordinate

19188198
onclick	onmouseup
onclick is the sum of onmousedown and onmouseup as such there is no one place where the click took place because the vcl did not want to choose between the down or up coordinate
my advise fire on the onclick event but register the coordinate in the mousedown

19189753
mdpi	hdpi
for drawables it also scales the image automatically so that if you have it as 100px and placed in mdpi it will use it for hdpi screens but make it 150px
this is not recommended and you should always try to have all the resources into all of the folders mdpi hdpi xhdpi

19190027
g++	gcc
depending on what you want you can either just expand macros g++ -e or look at an assembler output where you can see which line of c++ code maps to which assembler block i don t recommend outputting assembler directly from gcc with -s as the generated annotations are almost useless
gcc applies optimizations not in the c++-code directly but in some internal language-independant format called gimple which cannot be reverted into c++ code that easily

19190346
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
for more information take a look at this post java checked vs unchecked-exception explanation if you inherit your custom exception class from runtimeexception or any exception class inherited from it then catching your exception will not be mandatory
there are two types of exceptions in java checked exceptions and unchecked-exception

19191855
strcpy	malloc
instead after allocating enough space use strcpy strcpy allochere hello
you are not allocating enough memory to hold the word hello - you need to allocate space for 5 chars plus the terminating byte so you should replace the malloc call with you can t assign a string literal to allochere because you will miss the pointer to the allocated memory

19193169
profiling	benchmarking
from the profiling docs that you linked to note the profiling modules are designed to provide an execution profiling for a given program not for benchmarking purposes for that there is timeit for reasonably accurate results
this particularly applies to benchmarking python code against c code the profilers introduce overhead for python code but not for c-level functions and so the c code would seem faster than any python one

19193169
profiling	benchmarking
this particularly applies to benchmarking python code against c code the profiling introduce overhead for python code but not for c-level functions and so the c code would seem faster than any python one
so no you do not want to use profile to benchmarking your code

19193169
profiling	benchmarking
so no you do not want to use profiling to benchmarking your code
what you want to use profiling for is to figure out why your code is too slow after you already know that it is

19196434
comparator	comparable
not an instance of your proprietary comparator interface that it doesn t know
you can t sort a list of objects that don t implement the comparable interface

19199127
implements	extends
to make the compiler happy you could implements a dummy class named sun.print.win32mediatray and make it available both on the compile and runtime classpath
the class doesn t need to work it only has to be api compatible same signatures and return types but in this case you only really need to extends media and have a public int winid so that you can satisfy both the compiler and the verifier

19202683
touchesbegan	touchesended
with delaystouchesbegan set to no the following happens touch happens gesture intercepts gesture is recognized touchesbegan actually happened because the gesture recognized no delay touchesbegan fires with delaystouchesended the firing of touchesended is contingent on whether or not the gesture successfully completes.
unlike the previous case where touchesbegan always actually happens at the beginning of the gesture

19203917
ubuntu	debian
i suspect this issue may indeed be temporary but if you need the heroku toolbelt installed now you can install the standalone client instead of the ubuntu debian bundle
wget -qo- | sh on an ubuntu-based distro however the above will likely throw some errors this is because on ubuntu systems bin sh is dash not bash

19203950
implements	extends
i would also make dailytemperature implements the interface so that a list of this can be sorted easily
do not have dailytemperaturelist extends dailytemperature

19204254
multiplying	subtract
if the complexity of binary search included the cost required to prepare and sort the array then we couldn t get the runtime of perform k binary searches by taking the runtime of binary search and multiplying by k
we d have to take the runtime of binary search subtract out the work required to prepare the input multiply that by k then add back in the one-time cost associated with setting everything up

19204335
serializable	deserialization
the other is that while datacontractjsonserializer writes the local offset during serializable it doesn t use it properly during deserialization
it just assumes that if any offset is provided that the time should be local - even if the computer doing the deserialization has a completely different offset

19205452
google-chrome	firefox
as of google-chrome 43 per spec the innerhtml property is on element.prototype as a getter setter pair not on element instances
firefox and ie implement the spec properly

19207270
division	multiplication
division by 1000 has only one error in the division
however since .001 is not exactly representable in binary floating point multiplying by it has two errors in the conversion of .001 to floating point and in the multiplication

19207270
multiplying	multiplication	multiplying	division
however since .001 is not exactly representable in binary floating point multiplying by it has two errors in the conversion of .001 to floating point and in the multiplication
on the other hand division is typically a very slow operation so you might choose the multiplication

19211660
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
ok so here s my findings so far all testing on a mac google-chrome shows error like yours firefox works but very laggy i7 processor 8gig ram and ssd this shouldn t happen safari crashes
when i checked safari s crashlog i got the stack trace of the part that causes it so this is a webkit related crash that s related to rendering the views i d suggest you check out your code and start removing parts till it works

19213075
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian
you can check out distrowatch.com to find out glibc and qt versions for any linux distro example i compiled my app on ubuntu 12.04 qt 4.8.1 with glibc v 2.16 perhaps
i got a bug report than application does not run on crunchbang which also has qt 4.8.1 available but since it is a debian unstable linux distro it uses glibc v2.13

19213888
nsoperation	nsprogress
nsprogress knows nothing about nsoperation -- the two things are orthogonal -- but that doesn t mean it can t be used with them
the idea behind nesting nsprogress tasks is that the inner task doesn t know anything about the outer task and the outer task doesn t need direct access to the inner task s nsprogress to pull in updates for it

19213907
profiling	instrumentation
both are accessible from ddms via the button bar above the list of running processes but they re separate tools and offer much more than the basic method allocation profiling that s provided within ddms itself
there are two main memory cpu profiling tools for android apps traceview a graphical thread execution profiler mat a memory analyzer for java while they re not as tightly integrated as instrumentation these tools are powerful and fairly easy to learn

19217024
onclick	onchange
notice i changed the checkbox to have an onclick event
your function is not listening for an onchange event

19223842
http	spdy
http 2.0 does not afaik exist yet - it s still a proposed standard
but it seems likely that it will use similar connection handling to spdy

19226773
super	self
sending a message to super affects which implementation of that method we use
it doesn t change who self is

19227209
uiview	subviews
you can use the following category for uiview to find uitextfield in your searchbar
it s not a good idea to assume that second searchbar s subviews will be uitextfield

19227230
rdf	owl
jena is an rdf-based tool and you ll need to have an rdf serialization of your ontology in order for jena to be able to read it
fortunately files ending in .owl are typically though not always rdf xml serializations of the rdf encoding of the owl ontology

19231718
client-side	server-side
if the user shouldn t see the data then why is the request being made client-side in the first place
if the user only shouldn t see the url but should see the data get the data server-side and only show the data to the user

19232635
equals	gethashcode
i would create another model part which represents the dual grouping that you need to have happen model classes xaml then in your window viewmodel note i ve overriden equals in the departmentmanager class but not gethashcode ideally you should do a custom implementation of that
i had to override equals so the grouping view source would correctly group the same entries

19233760
equals	gethashcode
the documentation shows a hash function must have the following properties if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values

19233760
equals	gethashcode
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values
the gethashcode method for an object must consistently return the same hash code as long as there is no modification to the object state that determines the return value of the object s equals method

19236365
apache-poi	docx4j
if you are up to trying a different library then you can download apache-poi and do the following
i m not aware of a way to do that with docx4j but i m also not very familiar with that library

19236663
bash	zsh
it is not in bash
if you want to use the usr bin time version you need to supply the full path when using zsh

19247305
ssl	https
as an aside for security in depth ssl access to central is available for a small token payment
an https connection ensure that you re connected to the real central but it doesn t tell you anything about where the artifacts originally came from

19247627
factors	mean
if you just mean that you would like a speed boxplot for each unique dist value you can do it like this treating dist as discrete ggplot cars + geom_boxplot aes factors dist speed if you were to actually create bins you could do something like
not sure what you mean by bin since you haven t provided any bins in your question

19247685
union	distinct
union will collapse identical records into one output row just like a distinct clause while union all will include every record from each query
your question is not very clear but it seems like you are looking for a union or union all query

19248835
layoutparams	viewgroup
just use the layoutparams directly
the layout parameters you re talking about all come from android.view.viewgroup.layoutparams which is common to all the viewgroup classes linearlayout relativelayout etc. so you shouldn t need to distinguish between the parent view types

19256762
google-chrome	firefox
although google-chrome supports some features from 1.7 it isn t fully supported so this does not work
if you test your code in the latest firefox version though you will see it works

19257335
super	self
it s been noted that in python 3.0+ you can use super .__init__ to make your call which is concise and does not require you to reference the parent or class names explicitly which can be handy
i just want to add that for python 2.7 or under it is possible to get this name-insensitive behaviour by writing self.__class__ instead of the class name super self.__class__ self .__init__ however this breaks calls to super for any classes that inherit from your class where self.__class__ could return a child class

19259000
union	distinct
try union all which doesn t imply distinct
union also performs a distinct so if without the pk you have multiple occurences of the rest of the columns these will be reduced to one

19260279
realloc	malloc
try realloc instead - but first allocate current with malloc
after your malloc you are forgetting to fill the new allocated string with the previous current content - and you cannot do that because you ve lost the reference to it further you are introudcing a memory leak because you are not freeing it

19260296
realloc	malloc
can t tell for sure but from what you provided my tip is to use realloc to extend size of current
current is not 0 terminated after malloc

19261409
google-chrome	firefox
the google-chrome launcher also has the same issue but you must have it installed in the appdata folder of your profile which is the first place the google-chrome launcher checks
the firefox launcher doesn t take into account 64 bit windows

19266964
implements	extends
yes you can implements the methoda method in class b but pay attention you are not overriding it
your method is declared ad private so is not visible from extends classes

19267283
aggregate-functions	sum
for the other columns that are not listed in the group by clause the aggregate-functions will be applied to it the sum value in the query above
this is what the group by clause do use group by username with sum value select username sum value from tablename group by username

19270681
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome v
30 display none doesn t work however in firefox v

19271353
inline	inlining
and as my earlier confusion shows even the whole make_x function can get inline so there is no return value to be optimized away in the first place
the problem is that the compiler is doing too much optimizations first of all i disabled the inlining of make_x otherwise we cannot distinguish between rvo and inlining

19272181
multiplying	addition
this is because multiplying together small bigints is faster than multiplying large ones
in addition to the problem shown by monkjack i.e multiplying small big is faster than big small which does account for a greater chunk of the difference your algorithm is different in each case so they re not really comparable

19272181
multiplying	addition
in addition to the problem shown by monkjack i.e multiplying small big is faster than big small which does account for a greater chunk of the difference your algorithm is different in each case so they re not really comparable
in the tail-recursive version you re mutiplying big-to-small in the non-tail recursive version you re multiplying small-to-big if you alter the tail-recursive version so it multiplies small-to-big then tail-recursion is about 20 faster than normal-recursion rather than 10 slower as it is if you just make monkjack s correction

19274885
implements	extends
when an interface extends another interface its simply adding more methods to the list of methods that a class implements it needs to provide implementation for
classes cannot extends an interface

19277329
uilabel	uibutton
add all of your other views you want in the uiscrollview uibutton uilabel etc
- i m just going to assume uilabel from here on so i don t have to type as much but any kind of uiview subclass will work as subviews of the contentview not directly as subviews of the uiscrollview with this setup the uilabel s that are given constraints to their superview will constrain to the contentview which has a defined size so nothing is ambiguous

19277329
uiview	subviews
- i m just going to assume uilabel from here on so i don t have to type as much but any kind of uiview subclass will work as subviews of the contentview not directly as subviews of the uiscrollview with this setup the uilabel s that are given constraints to their superview will constrain to the contentview which has a defined size so nothing is ambiguous
alternatively if you want to fix the sizes of your uilabel s or dynamically calculate them depending on the functionality of your app and let the contentview expand to hold them place the uiscrollview place a uiview into the uiscrollview to serve as a contentview for that scroll view add constraints to pin the contentview to all 4 corners of the scroll view and pin it s width and height create an outlet for the width constraints on the contentview let s say we name it contentviewwidthconstraint place the uilabel s fix the sizes of the uilabel s create an outlet for the width constraints on the uilabel s then in the code for viewwilllayoutsubviews add up the widths of all of the uilabel s and any gaps you want between them as a cgfloat which i ll call totalwidth set and you re good to go

19278297
viewdidload	viewdidappear
for example do not setup timers in viewdidload or initwithframe
set them up in viewdidappear and tear them down in viewwilldisappear

19278413
rpm	yum
the easiest way to do this is to install the epel-release package for your platform eg su -c rpm -uvh or su -c rpm -uvh for example
the you can use yum to install r you will probably want su -c yum install r r-core r-core-devel r-devel so that you pull in the packages needed to build other add-on packages as most cran package are not in epel

19278547
fgets	fgetc
as far as i can tell however fputs and fgets are permitted to fail on any input they don t like so it is not certain that fputs maps every possible char value to an unsigned char
moreover although fputs and fgets operate as if by performing sequences of fputc and fgetc calls respectively it is not specified what conversions they might perform between char values in memory and the underlying unsigned char values on the stream

19281900
vb.net	vb6
i asssume tmpvar is variant in vb6 and object in vb.net
then the person who wrote the vb6 program did a bad job because storing in a meant-to-be-number variable is not the right way of doing it there are special values empty and null for this purpose

19284055
wav	caf
while your caf file could contain a wav file it could also contain a compressed file format that cannot be manipulated in the same fashion
you should consider first converting the caf file to wav then reversing it as shown in the other solution

19284483
thin	webrick
webrick reverse dns lookup looks like you are using webrick thin doesn t seem to have this problem edit its config.rb to disable reverse dns lookup to speed it up
for rbenv managed ruby .rbenv versions 1.9.3-p448 lib ruby 1.9.1 webrick config.rb change to note people mentioned stopping the avahi-daemon you can try to stop it if you use it

19284949
mri	rubinius
in particular mri implements ruby threads as green threads inside the interpreter and schedules them itself
it cannot schedule more than one thread at a time and it cannot schedule them to multiple cpus yarv implements ruby threads as native os threads posix threads or windows threads and lets the os schedule them however it puts a giant vm lock gvl around them so that only one ruby thread can be running at any given time rubinius implements ruby threads as native os threads posix threads or windows threads and lets the os schedule them however it puts a global interpreter lock gil around them so that only one ruby thread can be running at any given time

19288161
google-chrome	firefox
the two characters µ and μ may actually have different glyphs in a font but this does not change their formal properties. thus firefox is correct ie and google-chrome are in error in this case
the value that google-chrome returns is u+009c a control character making no sense so this is obviously an unintentional bug a coding error

19288934
sqoop	hadoop
before issuing the job set the system property that sqoop relies on as the base for the temporary files see appendutils also when renaming the files sqoop gets a handle on the fs by getting the default fs from the hadoop config so you ll also need to set this to s3n it s not pretty but it works
the reason this is happening is that sqoop writes files to a temporary directory when in incremental mode

19289890
implements	extends
to be able to use this element you need basically one the most important thing and it s special kind of adapter that is wrapped in mentioned viewgroup - recyclerview.adapter where viewholder is that thing we are talking about here simply this new viewgroup element has its own viewholder pattern implements
all what you need to do is to create custom viewholder class that has to extends from recyclerview.viewholder and you don t need to care about checking whether current row in adapter is null or not

19292088
uiview	subviews
subclass uiview to create your own uialertview or use a 3rd party library
since ios7 it s not possible to add or manipulate the subviews or a uialertview you need to create your own sorry

19293217
3des	aes
which leaves the list you have above plus tls_rsa_with_aes_128_cbc_sha256 tls_dhe_rsa_with_aes_128_cbc_sha256 tls_dhe_dss_with_aes_128_cbc_sha256 you should probably think about dropping the 3des ciphers from the list too
the issue there is ie8 on xp doesn t support aes ie8 on vista onwards does

19296714
addition	multiplication
use a multiplication not an addition
the pattern is like a multiplication table

19297368
matlab	simulink
there is also a visual studio target but not sure whether this is in base matlab coder or whether you also need embedded coder
matlab coder is a relatively new product that allows you to generate c code from matlab without having simulink

19297368
matlab	simulink
matlab coder is a relatively new product that allows you to generate c code from matlab without having simulink
before that you needed simulink and real-time workshop even if you were not using simulink to generate c code from matlab using emlc

19297368
matlab	simulink
before that you needed simulink and real-time workshop even if you were not using simulink to generate c code from matlab using emlc
when matlab coder was released real-time workshop was renamed to simulink coder and real-time workshop embedded coder to embedded coder

19297368
matlab	simulink
when matlab coder was released real-time workshop was renamed to simulink coder and real-time workshop embedded coder to embedded coder
the difference between matlab simulink coder and embedded coder is that the basic coder products allow to generate functionally correct code but that code is not optimised for real-time performance or customisable to meet certain coding standards

19297370
dictionary	map
note that this is a property of this implementation of dictionary not of the functionality of dictionary described in idictionary
there are other implementations for instance map if you are concerned about performance you should initialize your dictionary with a fast estimate of how many keys will happen to avoid internal resizing

19300577
qthread	qobject
this is a problem that many people encounter when trying to inherit from qthread rather than using it as a separate entity and moving qobject to it
what usually happens is that objects are sometimes created in the constructor of their inherited qthread class without parenting them and not realising that those objects will have the thread affinity of the main thread not the new thread as they expect

19300577
qthread	qobject
what usually happens is that objects are sometimes created in the constructor of their inherited qthread class without parenting them and not realising that those objects will have the thread affinity of the main thread not the new thread as they expect
moving a qobject to another thread also moves its children so trying to set the parent as the thread thread controller

19305180
implements	extends
supporting an option like openssl seems trivial to implements and rfc 6066 negotiation does not seem hard either
you would probably just need to extends connection_state record

19309104
cpython	pypy
and in that context even though benchmarks like this generally aren t of value the question why is v8 faster than cpython on this kind of thing does kind of have an answer it s because of the jit compiler
so if you want a straight-up comparison try running your python code on pypy which is a python interpreter with a jit

19309599
google-chrome	safari
unfortunately the only way to fix it in google-chrome is to avoid defining a max-width
the bug has been fixed in safari 6.1 and 7 not released yet

19310552
onchange	onblur
onchange is not an event for text boxes
look at onblur for when the user changes field or onkeyup for when the user is typing for other options

19314018
uigesturerecognizer	uibutton
if possible set the delaystouchesended property of the uigesturerecognizer to no to solve the problem
not sure if this is the same case but it might be related when the uibutton is in a view with a uigesturerecognizer which did not set delaystouchesended to no default is yes the button won t get touchupinside events anymore in ios 7

19323005
ssl	https
also digest authentication is kind of old and not as cryptographically secure as tls and there s no server identity verification so we still end up back at https ssl tls
https ssl tls provides server identify verification and provides full end to end encryption which is what you should use

19325682
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
also if you are using a uinavigationbar but not a uinavigationcontroller you won t see this functionality
if you are using a uinavigationcontroller and your view controller s navigation item contains a leftbarbuttonitem it s still possible to add functionality for the swipe left to right gesture of the navigation controller by attaching a delegate to the navigation controller s interactivepopgesturerecognizer

19327094
prepare	execute
then execute the prepare statement. seems very contrived even to me and i m not sure it would work and if it did how efficient it would be
you could possibly get a list of column names in that table from information_schema views then use them to create a prepare statement using cursor to iterate column names and concat function to glue together the query string

19328103
onresume	onpause
the proper place to register on the bus is in onresume and the proper place to unregister is in onpause like so note that ondestroy is not guaranteed to be called
you might be about to comment on this and say hey chris if i register in onresume and and events are fired before i hit this method i won t receive the events

19329433
comparator	comparable
i would personally instead set up a series of comparator s that did very specific jobs for example comparing the birth date of the person
the next problem is the comparable api doesn t support mismatched parameters okay it does but it s messy.

19331487
vim	sublimetext	vim	textmate
learning programming and vim at the same time is not a very good idea vim is a complex beast and trying to handle both learning curves won t be easy
as much as i love vim i d suggest you use another text editor at least in the beginning like sublimetext or textmate

19331608
spaces	delimiter
well using strtok str will split your string on spaces as well as colons which is probably not what you want
in addition strtok treats multiple consecutive delimiter characters as a single delimiter so it will never return an empty string between two colons which is not what you want for parsing passwd

19332951
g++	gcc
use the g++ command to compile c++ code not gcc
g++ is still gcc but it s in c++ mode so it will link to the standard c++ library

19333558
mongodb	bson
to solve your problem you need to see three aspects reading from mongodb reading from json reading from probably string reading from mongodb except if you changed the interface mongodb returns not json but bson files binary json
you need to see the mongodb documentation about reading and writing bson probably something like bson.to and bson.from but i don t know it by heart

factors	mean
as log 2 10 is a constant factors it can be omited in big-o-notation
thus you can choose whatever log you like it will not mean any difference concerning big-o-complexity

19336239
single-quotes	double-quotes
variable values aren t interpolated when using single-quotes
you ll have to use double-quotes if you want the actual variable value to be used read more about variables in the php manual

19336410
decoder	encoder
on main it looks like you do recorder.start recorder.stop however you control the decoder in the background thread with decoder.start.. decoder.end.. imo you should be managing all control methods for both recorder and encode decoder in the background thread not doing start stop recorder from main thread and start stop decoder in background without any means of communication coordination between the threads
it is a much more complicated app it works you may want to look at audioboo and at where it controls the recorder encoder stuff i mention above all in background all in same thread see audioboo classes flacrecorder and boorecorder and look close at start stop related methods in these 2 classes and how they interact from their respective threads

19341316
multiplying	division
note it is probably worth noting that if you want to convert from milliseconds into microseconds you want to multiplying by 1000 not divide
this will use integer division if you change the 1000 to a floating constant then you will obtain the result you want this works because division will perform the usual arithmetic conversions on it s operands which in this case will cause delay to be converted to a double as well

19341631
comparator	comparable
first of all the purpose of the comparator method is to define what makes two objects comparable
not all objects are comparable

19345047
super	implements
you can build a slight variation that accepts unicode and byte strings for write class stdoutbuffer textiowrapper def write self string try return super stdoutbuffer self .write string except typeerror # redirect encoded byte strings directly to buffer return super stdoutbuffer self .buffer.write string you don t have to set the encoding of the buffer the sys.stdout.encoding but this helps when using this method for testing comparing script output
starting with python 2.6 you can use anything implements the textiobase api from the io module as a replacement. this solution also enables you to use sys.stdout.buffer.write in python 3 to write already encoded byte strings to stdout see stdout in python 3 . using stringio wouldn t work then because neither sys.stdout.encoding nor sys.stdout.buffer would be available

19346253
octal	binary
for writing the values itself you can do so in any format permitted by the standard compiler you use binary literal if you use the right gcc version with appropriate flags or octal or decimal or character arrays or .
here s some examples of different literal formats hexadezimal 0x103c char array or octal 010074 binary 0b1000000111100 if you don t move the value around between different types or do some funky math with them you shouldn t even need a cast - otherwise the compiler will interpret the values as an int which might be a problem for you especially because of the different signedness

19346758
implements	extends
by implements the interface you are saying that you want to handle all of the coding for the slidingmenu system and do not want to use the built in code
implements an interface what you are doing is an entirely different thing to extends a base class what is explained in the tutorial you are following

19346758
implements	extends
your choices are forget the tutorial you have found as it does not apply to you and implements your sliding menu manually using the instructions here
this method does not require you to extends or implements anything and is the easier option

19347336
client-side	server-side
your test do not work because karma - is a testrunner for client-side javascript javascript who run in browser but you want to test node.js code with it which run on the server part
so karma just can t run server-side tests

19350736
udp	tcp
udp does not guarantee packets will be received in the same order they are sent or even received at all or that they are recevied exactly once
udp is more of a fire and forget whereas tcp maintains a connection state

19352804
vmware	bootcamp
apparently bluetooth cannot be shared between both os x and vmware simultaneously so the share bluetooth with windows box should be left unchecked
also the apple windows drivers for bluetooth used for bootcamp need to be installed

19354083
.htaccess	httpd.conf
if it s .htaccess change it to a file name windows accepts conf.htaccess 3 double-check that your htaccess file gets read add some uninterpretable garbage to it and start server you should get an error 500
if you don t file is not getting read re-visit httpd.conf file if that looks ok check if this is the only file which defines htaccess and it s location and it does at one place -within the file- only

19354387
bower	npm
my solution was to reinstall node it this way download latest stable node sources from nodejs.org #in my case node-v0.10.20.tar.gz tar -zxf node-v0.10.20.tar.gz #uncompress sources cd node-v0.10.20 #enter uncompressed folder sudo chown -r user usr local . configure --prefix usr local make make install one thing to note is that only taking ownership of the usr local folder wouldn t work in my case because node installation itself was made with sudo last step to install yeoman #although at yeoman.io it says that doing npm install -g yo already installs bower and gruntjs there are some submodules of gruntjs that fail so i fixed that by installing it by itself npm install -g bower npm install -g gruntjs npm install -g yo npm install -g generator-angular
the issue was i installed node using sudo to avoid errors when installing npm modules globally one must never install node with sudo

19355167
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
basically safari google-chrome opera is used in mobile devices and device features works fine with these. firefox browser is not a better option for mobile devices
because by default setting with webkit and opera browser s normally

19355487
glassfish	weblogic
if you do just java ee development glassfish is absolutelly sufficient and from my experience leaner to work with
no weblogic is definitely not open-source never been and will not be

19357899
lxml	beautifulsoup
another point in favor of beautifulsoup is that sometimes beautifulsoup can parse broken html by inserting missing closing tags for example when lxml can not
lxml is more strict and simply raises an exception if the html is malformed

19363202
pickle	dill
dill has the same interface as python s pickle but also provides some additional methods
if you want to use dill for serialization with multiprocessing all you have to do is and if that doesn t work for some reason you could swap out multiprocessing with pathos .

19365074
base	fractions
those weird numbers appear because computers use binary base 2 number system for calculation purposes while we use decimal base 10
there are a majority of fractions numbers that cannot be represented precisely either in binary or in decimal or both

19365417
subtract	addition	multiplying	addition	multiplying	multiplication
the important realization to make is that all of these matrix operations dividing multiplying adding and subtract exist for any field not just the real numbers
if you are unfamiliar with the term field it just means a group of values which allow for multiplication negation inversion addition etc

19370987
cdr	cons
now fun3 item cdr list will be called and then item will still be 4 but list will be
you can t call car because isn t a cons cell

19371788
png	ico
if you want an icon and not just the regular windows one make a png file of the icon
note you will have to add one to the java code if you want it in the program this is just for the desktop icon. then once you have your png go and convert it to an ico file

19374674
qthread	qobject
because of this you shouldn t use slots in qthread subclasses
you should create a qobject subclass and move it to a thread

19378755
oncreate	setcontentview
change you oncreate code to you need to call super.oncreate first
then setcontentview to your layout which is the id name of your file not your relative layout

19380448
mp3	wav
also you are not generating an mp3 but a wav file
update based on the fact that you aren t being able to play that file from the disk version for a wav file you need to write the wav header also

19382924
ssl	https
you can t know for sure server side whether ssl is being used
sure you can set your web server to deny http connexions or to redirect them to https this is typically set in the web server not in the application

19383119
tiff	png
also i could not find any software to split 16 bit channel image into two 8 bit channel image so here is my code feel free to use it it splits 16 bit channel tiff into two 8 bit channel pngs
in case of combining two png images one with the top 8 bits and the second with the low 8 bits i think it should be in 8 bits per channel rgb colors will range from 0 to 255 2 8 - 1

19384848
implements	extends
what you re looking for isn t implements by this class
furthermore since uiwebview+afnetworking is a category which extends an existing object implementing it in this class would require setting the uiwebview s delegate to itself which would stop you from responding to any of its delegate methods

19388159
oncreate	setcontentview
just add them to your activity_main.xml and take those out of oncreate
i m not sure what you think isn t running but the only thing that will happen here is that your activity_main.xml will be inflated because of this line setcontentview r.layout.activity_main

19388784
oncreate	onstart
thus you need to be sure that everything you reference in onsaveinstancestate is initialized in oncreate otherwise you risk a nullpointerexception
also be aware that onsaveinstancestate can be called on a fragment directly after oncreate oncreateview onactivitycreated onstart and onresume will not be called if the fragment is attached to an activity but not shown then destroyed

19390491
accelerometer	gyroscope
acceleration and gravity sensor is just the sum of accelerometer gyroscope and magnetometer
the gyroscope lets you recognize fast angular movement and it can be used to improve the gravity value which is not possible with just the low-pass-filter

19391171
implements	extends
it does not specifically pluck extends implements because it was built to be extendible and to allow you to add your own custom mutators eg
binds in mootools-more - perhaps not the only solution but some things are better left as awkward yet flexible api as opposed to rigid and non-dry sugar particularly things will break when implements is before extends as implements will actually .

19391477
google-chrome	firefox
it s possible the interpreter doesn t like multiple src properties or perhaps it is choking on the comments although everything looks good to me and google-chrome and safari...
viewing the interpreted css in firebug it appears that firefox is having trouble with your font-face declarations

19392377
punctuation	words
any trailing whitespace punctuation will not be part of the words group
this regular expression will find the last words in the input the match is in the group named words - the entire expression matches the final words and optional whitespace some punctuation

19392875
build.gradle	gradlew
and then select the build.gradle or settings.gradle
not sure how you are compiling the project with android studio without actually using gradlew because afaik android studio always uses gradlew under the hoods to build sources

19393054
viewdidload	viewwillappear
try removing from viewdidload and add the following to viewwillappear just before there may be a better way of doing this but this might get you headed in the right direction
it appears that you are not initializing the myimage subview before adding it in the viewdidload method of secondviewcontroller

19396232
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
when you try it will report an error that the checkpoint was created in case-sensitive mode
finally got around to preparing for this migration and i can now state definitively p4d will not allow you to restore a checkpoint with case-insensitive mode turned on -c1 if that checkpoint was created in case-sensitive mode on a linux server

19396363
union	distinct
following query is okay while this one is not going to work now the union set operator unifies the results of the two input queries
as a set operator union has an implied distinct property meaning that it does not return duplicate rows

19396363
union	distinct
as a set operator union has an implied distinct property meaning that it does not return duplicate rows
if you used union in your query it combined the two sets into one and the order by is going to take effect on the combined set not only on the select .

19396755
uiview	subviews
when you add a uiview as a subviews of another uiview with uitapgesturerecognizer in each view then in some rare case uitapgesturerecognizer state becomes failed somehow i have debug it more than 50 times and come to know this
so when any subviews of any view is not able to handle the tap gesture then system will pass gesture to it s super view to handle that gesture and this continues

19398751
implements	extends
then you would implements it if you cannot do this you have to customize your preprocessor or your compiler
perhaps a job for your melt extension melt is a domain specific language to extends gcc

19405845
textview	imageview
you have textview outputc and tv1 both initialized with the same id r.id.outputc and you have make sure you have idautomationhc39m_free.otf under assests fonts
your imageview iv is not initialized

19406319
ienumerable	ilist
so you need to decide for each case whether it is better to work with the lazily evaluated ienumerable or to realize it into a list set dictionary or whatnot
edit as getting this into a seems to be a mystery to many people you can simply write but one is often better off working with the ienumerable rather than ilist as the linq above is lazily evaluated it doesn t actually do all of the work until the enumerable is iterated

19408931
gridview	checkboxlist
but it is not limited to formview and gridview
here is the full list of controls adrotator chart listview bulletedlist checkboxlist detailsview dropdownlist formview gridview listbox radiobuttonlist binding in asp.net web forms usage of server tags can be used only inside databound controls

19410399
lisp	scheme
i thought lisp procedures were first class objects
this has nothing to do with functions i think the common lisp standard does not use the term procedures as the scheme standards do. being first class objects

19410399
lisp	scheme
this has nothing to do with functions i think the common lisp standard does not use the term procedures as the scheme standards do. being first class objects
this works in common lisp let p # print funcall p hello world edit answers to the extra questions i was wondering why setf symbol-function p # print won t work this way setf symbol-function p print

19412734
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
1 you should specify alias for tables in from clause and select clause should contains alias product should be an entity if product isn t an entity you should create nativequery entitymanager createquery is for jpql java persistence query language entitymanager createnativequery is for sql 2 jpa throws the unknown abstract schema type error when jpa fails to locate your entity class also add entity to persistence.xml 3 add table annotation to your entity 4 as i see in documentation jpql is case-sensitive
with the exception of names of java classes and properties queries are case-insensitive

19414225
google-chrome	firefox
tortoisegit is probably not using the same truststore google-chrome
i think google-chrome uses the system store firefox uses it s own

19418189
gridbaglayout	boxlayout
gridbaglayout -- a grid
the left panel that doesn t resize can use a boxlayout

19418259
memcpy	strncpy
just use memcpy
if the destination isn t big enough strncpy won t null terminate

19418705
express	node.js
you could look at using connect or express to make writing the web service layer more convenient
while some node modules may be generally reusable to some degree in a web browser most take advantage of node.js specific features or drivers and cannot work in any web browser

19420377
realloc	malloc
other than that realloc over null pointer should have exactly the same outcome and performance as malloc
realloc may extend shrink or not change allocated memory segment

19424139
google-chrome	firefox
see for example google-chrome issue 25541 google-chrome issue 124406 even if you switch off hardware acceleration in firefox the results are different because both browsers use different font rendering backends
this is because firefox supports the hardware-accelerated directwrite api part of direct2d to render fonts and google-chrome doesn t

19428874
http	spdy
the main benefits that you will get for soap rest communication are the fact that spdy can do http header compression reducing bandwidth and multiplexing - that is being able to send multiple requests on the same physical connection
for a soap rest use case you will not benefit of the big performance boost that spdy push gives see demo video but it will be worth nonetheless

19431022
required	placeholder
i don t know how to translate this to asp.net then just write your html as on the other hand you can use the html5 required attribute which i don t know how to translate to asp
with placeholder you might not need a label

19431093
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox it functioned as the selectortext is as it is written in the stylesheet but google-chrome converts all the names to lower case
so this test would not match in google-chrome would match in firefox but google-chrome changed the selector text to be lower case so thus .myrule pre so changing the code to this fixed the issue so it works in both browsers

19431093
google-chrome	firefox
so this test would not match in google-chrome would match in firefox but google-chrome changed the selector text to be lower case so thus .myrule pre so changing the code to this fixed the issue so it works in both browsers
by the way the setproperty works for me in google-chrome 30

19433954
super	extends
in ancient days of pre java 1.5 you would probably do enums like this there are two important things about this figure private constructor that will not allow to instantiate the class from outside actual enum values are stored in static fields even if it s not final when you ll extends it you ll realize that compiler requires an explicit constructor that in other turn is required to call super constructor which is impossible since that one is private
another problem is that the static fields in super class still store object of that super class not your extends one

19435060
jar	war
i was most interested in the unused jar report and i can see that it is incorrectly reporting some jars as unused but i have gotten past my initial hurdle
it looks like tattletale was not able to read my war

19435470
realloc	malloc
if you actually want to use malloc with the same pointer you might be interested in the realloc function from that link realloc changes the size of the memory block pointed to by ptr
the function may move the memory block to a new location whose address is returned by the function . edit note that if realloc fails in the above then it returns null yet the memory pointed to by newptr is not freed

19436377
bufferedreader	filechannel
when you need random access bufferedreader is not suited
instead you need to look into channel and its subclasses like filechannel and so on

19436952
filewriter	printwriter
consider using a filewriter instead of an intermediary stringbuilder
instead of writing to a builder use instead of doing data.append use writer.print or writer.println note printwriter and buffered writer wrappers aren t strictly necessary but useful

19439904
uiview	subviews
your problem might be related to this check the comments ios7 uiimageview takes forever to appear we don t know which commands actually executes but the documentation for zbarreaderview says this is a barcode reader encapsulted in a uiview
if it s laying out subviews in uiviews supposedly it s not safe to call start in a background thread and while in ios6 this worked it doesn t in ios7 anymore since the internals have changed

19440014
uiview	subviews
so make a uiview let s call it containerview and make it a subviews of your mainview
then take all of your 600 subviews and make them subviews of containerview not your mainview

19440984
strcpy	calloc	strcpy	malloc
strcpy doesn t allocate space at the pointer p to store the string
you need to declare it as an array or allocate space with malloc or calloc

19441472
vb6	vba
i don t beleive you can use me in this context - you are trying to use me as it was used in vb6 which was equivalent to this in c#
this is not appropriate in vba

19445173
hmac	pbkdf2
important security update #2 thanks to scott who paid attention that encrypted message should be authenticated - now hmac is used to verify that message was not changed
here is simple but secure implementation of aes-256 encryption in cbc mode that uses pbkdf2 to create encryption key out of plain-text password and hmac to authenticate the encrypted message

gridview	datalist	gridview	repeater
datagrid is not even mentioned in this book and is replaced by popular gridview and answered nicely by other users

19446780
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
for google-chrome safari and opera this isn t possible due to their security model
however there is somewhat of a solution for google-chrome in that it s possible but it has two requirements you need to get the user to install this google-chrome extension it must be over https you will probably encounter the same problem for firefox since it usually requires locallink

19446923
ssl	https
and in that cookbook there is a section about https which says urls with https scheme are accessed in exactly the same way as with http scheme provided that an ssl interface module for lwp has been properly installed see the readme.ssl file found in the libwww-perl distribution for more details
if no ssl interface is installed for lwp to use then you will get 501 protocol scheme https is not supported errors when accessing such urls

19446923
ssl	https
if no ssl interface is installed for lwp to use then you will get 501 protocol scheme https is not supported errors when accessing such urls
the readme.ssl file says this as of libwww-perl v6.02 you need to install the lwp protocol https module from its own separate distribution to enable support for urls for lwp useragent

19448055
junit	testng
is it possible to easyb not in bdd style but junit style this is the choice i used
you will have no testng like groups with easyb at least out of the box and i didn t find so far any way to anotate easyb groovy test methods

19453563
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
for google-chrome safari and opera this isn t possible due to their security model
however there is somewhat of a solution for google-chrome in that it s possible but it has two requirements you need to get the user to install this google-chrome extension it must be over https you will probably encounter the same problem for firefox since it usually requires locallink

19455208
rsa	aes
rsa is for key transport not data encryption
if you have a long message encrypt it with aes using a random key

19457053
jar	manifest.mf
if not then it is just a jar
look for the bundle-symbolicname header in the manifest.mf

19457188
clang	llvm
you can also compute the llvm type name that clang generates for a given type and search for it in the module but this is not always successful
ultimately the code generation apis are not part of clang s public api

19457921
bower	npm
so just to be safe remove what you have npm remove -g yo bower grunt-cli and then try this install npm install -g yo some people still experience the problem you re having though here s the issue and in comments are a number of different things to try if the above doesn t resolve your issue
the new version of yeoman installs bower and grunt for you so you don t need those on your npm line anymore

19458148
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
you are not allowed to put a uitabbarcontroller inside of a uinavigationcontroller
you are allowed however to put a uinavigationcontroller inside of a uitabbarcontroller

19459037
tlistview	tlistbox
i have done simple apps on ios and android with xe5 with 100+ items in a tlistview and scrolling has been very smooth
i think the standard advice is if it needs to scroll use a tlistview not a tlistbox

19459148
dictionary	map
when querying a namespaced document you pass the xpath method the namespace map like this in many other places in lxml you can speficy the default namespace by using none as the dictionary key in the namespace map
not with xpath unfortunately that will raise an exception typeerror empty namespace prefix is not supported in xpath so you unfortunately have to prefix every node name in your xpath expression with ns or whatever you choose to map that namespace to

19459271
build.gradle	gradlew
if you are using gradlew just add to your build.gradle file
if not using gradlew to take care of your dependencies press ctrl + alt- shift +s project structure

19465105
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu has preliminary support for kickstarter as well so you re not limited to red hat
i don t think you need custom linux distribution for your use case

19465782
spaces	delimiter
if you wish to use several delimiter two or more at once put a spaces symbol between the two non-space delimiter +1 - 862 - 3135071 +1 - 862 - 3135071
do not use unsupported delimiter such as

19466790
google-chrome	firefox
i then removed ubuntu light and medium but not their italic versions and windows refused to do this saying the fonts are in use until i closed google-chrome but having the page open in firefox wasn t a problem
when restarted google-chrome now showed both light 300 and light 300 italic as light italic

19466905
apache	nginx
here s a detailed set of answers not as much as the overhead incurred from loading apache
apache itself with its plethora of modules and options is a memory and cpu hog compared to nginx

19468276
factors	mean
so what one could conclude from this is that a timezone for a particular city is based on its zone boundaries its daylight savings time rules and other political factors
thus just because some city happens to be physically in the west does not mean it is guaranteed to be pst for example

19470634
lisp	scheme
heres a quote from the r5rs report note in many dialects of lisp the empty combination is a legitimate expression
in scheme combinations must have at least one subexpression so is not a syntactically valid expression

19473994
uialertview	uiwindow
uialertview are not shown in the same uiwindow as the rest of your view controllers
they are shown in their own uiwindow with a windowlevel of uiwindowlevelalert

19479984
nerdtree	netrw
this is what you have to do when you want to open another file with an always on nerdtree and with the most common usage of netrw nerdtree netrw switching to the nerdtree window open netrw navigate to search for the file navigate to search for the file hit a key to open the file hit a key to open the file basically you have the same amount of work for the same result but the netrw way doesn t waste a single cell on your screens
note that you can use nerdtree that way too

19482051
apache	nginx
it is however the case that the most common installation of php on unix systems is a single threaded setup as is the most common apache installation and nginx doesn t have a thread based architecture whatever
in this most common unix setup each http server process accepting requests can do one of a few things spawn a php interpreter process cgi - generic cgi gateway manipulate an in process instance of the interpreter mod_php5 - apache specific php module services both mpm and worker installations of apache communicate with an fcgi process php-fpm - commonly used with nginx some apache usage goes on still ... in the most common windows setup and some more advanced unix setups php can and does operate multiple interpreter threads in one process

19482281
implements	extends
your anonymous class that extends abstractaction does implements it but it s not the same thing
bingohelper class doesn t implements actionperformed

19483120
google-chrome	firefox
this can be mac linux or windows or unknown after 3.0.3 to deal with solaris google-chrome os etc
there aren t a ton of cases where this is needed but one example include native os x checkboxes which blur as soon as you click them as opposed to windows linux or firefox on mac

19487816
equals	compareto
equals
the 2 main differences are that equals will take any object as a parameter but compareto will only take strings. equals only tells you whether they re equal or not but compareto gives information on how the strings compare lexicographically. and this is the class code url . u can also look at this post if u want java strings compareto vs

19488046
equals	gethashcode
equals - 1- override the gethashcode method to allow a type to work correctly in a hash table
2- do not throw an exception in the implementation of an equals method

19488046
equals	compareto
such implementations of equals return true if the two objects have the same value even if they are not the same instance
for example - output - false true while compareto - compares the current instance with another object of the same type and returns an integer that indicates whether the current instance precedes follows or occurs in the same position in the sort order as the other object

19489717
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
this is perfectly valid c# additionally even if the enum couldn t contain values differing only in case that wouldn t mean you d either always want it to be case-sensitive or always want it to be case-insensitive
your suggest that it should always be case-insensitive would be annoying for situations where you were trying to provide a case-sensitive match

19490210
build.gradle	gradlew
in build.gradle not sure it really need but i use invalidate caches and restart before reimport project
from 0.2.13 to 0.3.0 just download new gradlew 1.8 from reimport project and choose new gradlew to use

19490523
super	self
you need to give the current class not the parent class to start searching from and self.name and self.age are still set to none by the time your __init__ is called but you seem to want to pass on the name and age arguments def __init__ self name age gender super child self .__init__ name age print gender with these changes the code works
super only works for new-style classes

i think that you have possibly two problems here first either you think you have a data.frame when in fact you have a matrix or your data was at some point a matrix and is now a data.frame so all expected numeric values got converted to character and then got converted to factors on the way back to a data.frame
if your data is a matrix is not defined for accessing matrix hence the error

19495275
client-side	server-side
anything on client-side environment is readable unless it is encrypted - what doesn t works with javascript
you can use a server-side environment to deal with that without leaving javascript with node.js look this post

19496697
sse	avx
here is the code for sse
the avx code is about the same speed so i did not post it here

19501801
bmp	png
that s not going to work because sdl_loadbmp can load only bmp files
if you want to load png files in an app that uses sdl2 use the sdl2_image framework

19503489
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
when you look at the behavior of the native mail app implementation for instance if you click on the back button the deselection animation starts before viewdidappear but it is not in viewwillappear either because then the animation is very fast and abrupt when not interactively dismissing
however when you do interactively dismissing and deselect on viewwillappear the cell is gradually deselected along with the finger gesture like the native mail application

19505551
comparator	comparable
the pattern makes sense even without this syntactic support for instance in java and i would say that comparator is a typical example of that pattern there although the term type class is not used in java
from an object oriented perspective the pattern consist in having comparator rather than comparable

19508462
vbscript	vb6
vbscript does not have built-in support for sockets nor does windows come with a com library for working with sockets but third-party libraries are available from chilkat if you re at the sysadmin side of things you ll be better off using powershell here s an example of what you want sending a magic-packet
the code you have is vb.net not vb6 or vbscript

19509758
strdup	malloc
if using gnu extensions you could simply use asprintf 3 see this or at least remove your malloc and return strdup path_name
and use strdup 3 which is standard not requiring any gnu extension

19511536
hex	binary
as an example so each digit in hex is a four digit binary which is easy enough to handle
wether you performa logical operation with a binary or a hex or a decimal number format doesn t matter because the output will be the same

19511536
hex	binary
wether you performa logical operation with a binary or a hex or a decimal number format doesn t matter because the output will be the same
however if you use hex represetation it has the advantage that you can more easily read the binary value in the source code then with dec. reason is because hexadimzmal has a a bas which is a multiple of base 2 thus you can easily visually identify a four digit binrary ina hex number while this is not so easy in decimal format

19514107
clang	llvm
you will not get auto-complete and clang llvm has nothing to do with debugging in visual studio except that it will probably not work if you compile with clang
see also this interesting blog post predicting much good for llvm on windows in the future backed by companies with paid developers

19517743
sse	avx
almost all avx instructions are effectively just two sse instructions in parallel operating on two adjacent 128 bit lanes
so for your first shift_avx2 example you d get 0 0 1 2 0 4 5 6 ----------- ---------- ls lane ms lane all is not lost however one of the few instructions which does work across lanes on avx is _mm256_permutevar8x32_ps

19519007
queue	fifo
in my experience the std queue which is a container adapter normally built over std deque is not worth the effort it only restricts the interface without adding anything useful
is the obvious choice here since it supports efficient fifo semantics use push_back and pop_front or push_front and pop_back the performance should be the same

19519287
sse	avx
this is true for sse but not for avx and maybe not even for avx2
in any case i put together some working and tested code which does a prefix sum using sse

19520220
persistent	transient
by default urls will be handled in the main daemon process group where the processes are persistent
for the urls for the admin interface however they will be directed to the admin daemon process group which can be set up with a single process with reduced number of threads plus an inactivity timeout so that the process will be restarted automatically if the admin interface isn t used after 60 seconds thereby reclaiming any excessive transient memory usage

19521908
mp4	h.264
please note that firefox does not necessarily support all formats yet that google-chrome supports notably h.264 mp4 aac mp3 and vp9 are not available on all platforms yet or at all
see supported media formats . watch the web console for errors such as http content-type of video mp4 is not supported

19527661
icomparable	compareto
your person object could implement icomparable
that is you need to add a compareto method that compares the name i wouldn t recommend it but i followed your example of avoiding generics

19527661
compareto	gethashcode
that is you need to add a compareto method that compares the name i wouldn t recommend it but i followed your example of avoiding generics
if you do this you should probably override equals and gethashcode as well

19531399
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
here s an stl version of what you re trying to do however this version is a case-sensitive sort so whether or not that performs to your requirements could be problematic
so a possible next step to get closer to case-insensitive sorting is to use this bit of code before the vector is sorted the only caveat with this method is that all your string will be converted to lowercase though

19535441
cdr	cons
the result of make-queue is a structure consisting of two cons cells not three one cons cell contains ignored and in car and cdr respectively
the other cons cell contains a link to the first cons cell in both its car and its cdr

19537289
uiview	subviews
the reason it is done this way is so you could define layout constraints which work with uiview objects
one thing to notice if you have some logic which works on subviews be careful not to include them in your calculations

19537436
postgresql	mysql
this reference explains some more about this postgresql full text search the reason i wrote this post is because psql actually does this differently and therefore the query you have been provided will only work for mysql
psql has a lot of different functions to handle full text searching but since we use heroku we managed to use the textacular gem to get it all working properly here are some ways psql handles full text searching full text searching in postgresql is based on the match operator which returns true if a tsvector document matches a tsquery query . it doesn t matter which data type is written first as the above example suggests a tsquery is not just raw text any more than a tsvector is

19538974
ember.js	backbone.js
though these are for backbone.js but not ember.js the situation of client side authentication is same
i find it painful and unnecessary to try and make backbone.js marionette handle the authentication and re-loading of the authorized site stuff

19540537
jar	war
modify the .sh file jar update command jar uf #target-war #relative-loc quartz-jobs.xml
the reason why its not working is because you are modifying resource read from classloader. this wont modify war s resource entry

19542806
lisp	scheme
labels and named lets if your lisp optimizes tail calls just as a matter of playing stupid lisp tricks i d point out that in scheme the analog to is letrec or a named let letrec because scheme is a lisp-1 gives you the functionality of labels which baggers described
the named let can be done in common lisp with a macro around labels do and do should be efficient everywhere however tail calls aren t necessarily optimized away in common lisp so this kind of recursion for iteration isn t all that common

19543054
content-length	content-type
here s how a sample http request might look like post someresource delete 123 http 1.1 host www.example.com content-type application json content-length 0 connection close you can try the request in fiddler or write a sample http client that will send a post request
ah and by the way why not sticking to standard restful conventions and your action and to invoke it delete someresource 123 http 1.1 host www.example.com content-type application json content-length 0 connection close notice that the standard restful convention dictates that the action name should not be used in your routes

19546444
implements	extends
the alternative for multipe inheritance is that a class can implements multiple interfaces or an interface can extends multiple interfaces
you can extends multiple interfaces but you cannot extends multiple classes

19547446
whirlpool	md5
namely that you can use the smaller and cheap checksum to see if doing the more expensive md5 sha whirlpool is worth considering in the event of changed files
adler-32 and md5 are not comparable in this way

19548179
implements	extends
you can implements icomparable if the items should be logically ordered somehow like real enums
create a class that cannot be inherited from externally give it several inner classes each extends from it

19548832
lxml	beautifulsoup
if i understand them correctly it means that the soup parser is more robust --- it can deal with a soup of malformed tags by using regular expressions --- whereas lxml is more straightforward and just parses things and builds a tree as you would expect
i assume it also applies to beautifulsoup itself not just to the soupparser for lxml

19548832
lxml	beautifulsoup
i assume it also applies to beautifulsoup itself not just to the soupparser for lxml
they also show how to benefit from beautifulsoup s encoding detection while still parsing quickly with lxml same source

19549530
lxml	beautifulsoup

they also show how to benefit from beautifulsoup s encoding detection while still parsing quickly with lxml same source

19550613
clang	llvm
clang knows how members are laid out within an enum so it loads a directly from the member
note that llvm ir does not really have unions

19552079
uilabel	uibutton
the titlelabel of a uibutton is not accessible in the same ways a standalone uilabel is
you ll want to use uibutton s setattributedtitle forstate method

19552898
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
what you want inside your uitabbarcontroller are uiviewcontroller possibly inside a uinavigationcontroller
you shouldn t as well push a uitabbarcontroller

19554608
opengl-es	glkbaseeffect
it s primarily a replacement for the opengl-es 1.1 fixed-function pipeline and some of the common tricks done with it
what you re after isn t a routine fixed-function pipeline task so to do it well means stepping beyond the basic functionality of glkbaseeffect and writing your own shaders

19555912
opera	firefox
still didn t work on opera though but not too worried about this right now
ok...solved it by calling a javascript play function with each ajax iteration....now plays in firefox

19557011
icmp	tcp
many firewall operators explicitly block icmp to mitigate denial of service attacks so this is not surprising
you say ping fails while telnet ssh works fine ping uses icmp while telnet and ssh use tcp ip

19558971
opera	google-chrome
in firefox and opera that is
google-chrome doesn t seem to want to cooperate so you may have to experiment a bit

19560744
factors	mean
if you just mean re-arrange the columns so that column 1 is v1 column 2 is v2 column 3 is v5 etc then this the reason for as.character is that varname is a factors
i m not quite sure what you mean sort the columns

19561827
oncreate	onstart
note measured dimensions in oncreate method are not initialized yet
the correct way and place is snippet can be added anywhere including oncreate some answers tried to do it onstart method

19567740
webkit	gecko
this is a bug related to eclipse and webkit
eclipse official bug database one workaround is tell eclipse to not use webkit and use mozilla s gecko instead

19569410
implements	extends
you also won t have any problems - bigdecimal itself implements comparable interface and has its own comparator
bigdecimal is not final so you could definitely extends it yourself and change its behaviour especially by overriding the dividexxx methods

19569584
super	self
super does not work with old-style classes class dog object def bark self print woof with these changes the call works in python 3 old-style classes have been removed
everything is new-style and you can omit the class and self parameters from super

19573304
memcpy	strcpy
edit to eliviate some doubts raised here consider this code results is so it s clear that memcpy moved the entire length including byte 5 while strcpy did not stopping at the null termination
you re right in your assumption strcpy may copy up to the middle null char according to this does this copies the string pointed to by str2 to str1

19573304
memcpy	strcpy
memcpy should solve the problem as it just treats the memory as a chunk of bytes not as a string
strcpy signature memcpy signature so just replace the name and add the cumulative lengths with both null chars of course

19574034
ubuntu	linux
there are a few things to check here - first is that on ubuntu the default dropbox directory is home username dropbox not home username dropbox
note the capital d linux file systems are case-sensitive

19576373
persistent	transient
it will give the illusion of persistent especially if you re not relying on an ebs volume for data retention
the nature of spot instances is they are transient so no you can t make the instance persistent

19576567
jar	manifest.mf
eclipse plugins do not have to be jar files the equivalent directory structure is also acceptable
when eclipse installs a plugin it takes information from the manifest.mf and plugin.xml to update internal tables of things like extension point contributions class paths for the each plugin and so on

19577320
nfa	dfa
the first provide a very simple nfa dfa implementation in python with conversion from nfa to dfa
it doesn t generate the nfa from a regex though but it is not so difficult to do

19577320
nfa	dfa
it doesn t generate the nfa from a regex though but it is not so difficult to do
the second site provides a long discussion on nfa vs dfa including numerous code examples mostly in c and links to external libraries that i know little of

19577928
flask	django
the coverage report is correct when i start flask like this instead coverage run manage.py runserver -r output then only contains this this way it doesn t start up the server in a separate process and coverage works great
i found this solution thanks to this related django question why doesn #39

19578046
google-chrome	firefox
for a while i just disabled the cache if the browser was not google-chrome but then i decided to try again setting the mime-type as suggested
firefox no longer throws an exception when i call swapcache and the whole refreshing process now works as expected

19579184
innodb	myisam
most select statements do not lock tables however and the innodb engine definitely doesn t
nevertheless if you are working with an old version of mysql on the myisam storage engine and your tables are under heavy load this may be a factor

19580135
treemap	linkedhashmap
the map is sorted according to the natural ordering of its keys we should not violate this rule by using treemap to sort by values
however to sort by values we can do the following create a linkedlist of entries of the map using collection.sort to sort the entries inserting the sorted entries to a linkedhashmap keeps the keys in the order they are inserted which is currently sorted on natural ordering

19581127
move	drag
i was facing this i have a magic trackpad and as it turns out if you point your mouse on the battery symbol in the storyboard and try to move them you can do it very easily
not sure if this is a known thing just adding it here if somebody has the same question since google s first hit is this one edit well you can just drag it around using the controller bar below the storyboard so this answer is a little late but now there are two ways

19581415
sqoop	hadoop
this is important if the mapreduce job being kicked off by the hadoop service in this case sqoop has a dependence on those jars
remember the mappers are running on a datanode not the namenode even though you are probably running the sqoop command from the namenode

19581415
namenode	hdfs
remember the mappers are running on a datanode not the namenode even though you are probably running the sqoop command from the namenode
putting the jars on hdfs is not the only possible solution to this problem but it is a sensible one

19581797
hive	hdfs
we get another option if you aren t limited to hive
you could get rid of the local and write the results to hdfs which should be fast even with 5000 mappers

19587795
client-side	server-side
you can do animation purely with css but you would still have to trigger the animation you want client-side unless you re doing something on page load or another event that can be triggered automatically
django being python code running on the server-side doesn t have a way to interact with client-side code unless you re making a request be it a get post put etc via an ajax call

19588050
memcpy	memmove
the gcc also lists memcpy as implemented as built-ins the implementation and motivation is likely to be similar to that of visual studio
there is at least one recent case where the constraint of non-overlapping memory is used to generate faster code in visual studio memcpy can be compiled using intrinsics while memmove cannot

19588050
memcpy	memmove
there is at least one recent case where the constraint of non-overlapping memory is used to generate faster code in visual studio memcpy can be compiled using intrinsics while memmove cannot
this leads in memcpy being much faster for small regions of a known size because of removing the function call and setup overhead

19588740
realloc	malloc
you re losing the address realloc returns since you re not re-setting the pointer in the caller s environment
this causes that pointer from the original malloc to go stale and freeing it crashes

19592553
g++	gcc
here is an example for your case first define the class in window.h then implement the class in windowimp.cpp finally use the code in usewindow.cpp here is how you build it the library using g++ and here is how you build with program using msvc 2013 cl usewindow.cpp ehsc i source repos cppcomponents replace source repose cppcomponents with the path were you have cppcomponents make sure the resulting windowslibdll.dll and the usewindow.exe are in the same directory and run usewindow.exe
use my library cppcomponents at this is tested with visual c++ 2013 previous versions did not have enough c++11 support and mingw gcc 4.7+ on windows

19594861
uilabel	uitextview
if your using a uilabel you have to remember that the default setting is 1 line so it does not matter how many breaks you add n or r you need to make sure it is set to more than one line so it could be allowed to append more lines
one alternative is to use uitextview which is really meant for multilines

19596679
memcpy	strcpy
in that case you cat use strcpy function instead use memcpy where you can provide the size of memory to be copied
if you are using strcpy function your source string must terminate with 0 seems like in your code maze 3 3 is not intended to be a array of strings as there is no space reserved for 0

19598942
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome stills documents indexeddb as being temporary storage
as slace suggested indexeddb will solve your problem but it isn t supported in safari yet and google-chrome doesn t let you stored blobs in indexeddb yet

19598942
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
as slace suggested indexeddb will solve your problem but it isn t supported in safari yet and google-chrome doesn t let you stored blobs in indexeddb yet
the largelocalstorage project bridges those gaps and gives you large persistent storage in ie google-chrome firefox safari and opera

19599447
ssl	https
the article you linked also says this if you are not validating the ssl certificate of the server you don t know who is receiving your rest queries
but https normally does not authenticate the client unless you configure the server to request a certificate from the client in order to perform mutual authentication

19602359
multiplying	multiplication
this is not 64bit multiplication multiplying a pair of 64bit numbers to get a 128bit result
this is 32-bit multiplication multiplying a pair of 32-bit numbers to get a 64bit result

19602850
bash	subshell
perhaps not so elegant but for those of us that do everything we can to avoid reading the sed and awk manpages here s a couple of alternatives with simple tools - head tail grep and cut with pure bash
directly passing variables from one side of linux pipe to other is not possible because the commands on either side of the pipe are executed in a fork ed subshell

19603871
firefox	safari
or or or caution if using the name method be careful not to use a common value for name like home for example as it conflicts with a firefox function called home and so firefox will not automatically create a reference to an iframe s window if it is named home
the most reliable method is probably to use as i believe that has been around for a long time works in ff chrome safari ie6+ at least a more in-depth but pretty minimal example follows tested in chrome ff and ie file #1 frametest.html the parent window file #2 frame1.html frame 1 s src file #3 frame2.html frame 2 s src this example demonstrates how to define and manipulate iframe s by id and by name and how to affect one iframe from within a different iframe

19604404
google-chrome	firefox
at the time this question was asked firebug was a beast but now the google-chrome developer tools devtools are handy for web developers
though i m not ranting about firebug because i ve learnt the web development using firefox with firebug

19606471
google-api-python-client	oauth2client
edit actually even easier you can just pip install google-api-python-client it doesn t install anything except the four required libraries above you then need to make some code like in sample.py downloaded from the get started link
google now have a basic python starter app to download it includes four libraries apiclient httplib2 oauth2client and uritemplate in the download which you probably rather want to pip install and add to your project s requirements file instead

19607080
base	fractions
this is a repeating decimal 0.142857142857... and therefore cannot be represented precisely in base 10 with a limited number of digits
if the computer could store only 2 decimal places for each variable then d would look something like this fractions actual value stored value 1 7 0.142857.

19607080
base	fractions
computers store numbers in binary base 2 but the concept is exactly the same
the fractions 1 10 does not have an exact representation in base 2

19610678
fgets	realloc
it just turned out that it is not so easy to write a function which uses fgets repeatedly in order to return a malloc ed string
the function does no proper error reporting if there was an error using realloc or fgets the data retrieved till now is returned

19611618
udp	tcp
tcp handles packet losses whereas udp doesn t
by default webrtc uses udp but it can use both protocols

19612027
jtextpane	jeditorpane
i normally use a jtextarea or jtextpane to display text
a jeditorpane is used for html only so i m not sure if this suggestion will work

19613627
lxml	beautifulsoup
i also have a problem with improperly installed lxml
here are some things that i found out first of all check this related question removed macports now python is broken now in order to check which builders for beautifulsoup 4 are installed try if you don t see your favorite builder then it is not installed and you will see an error as above couldn t find a tree builder...

19614031
persistent	transient
if you do not want to persistent the classroom or any other attribute for that matter then the transient annotation allows you to ignore a particular field so that jpa won t try to map it
this annotation specifies that the property or field is not persistent

19614563
setinterval	settimeout
...to decide whether to keep looping rather than saving an interval id and then calling clearinterval before later calling setinterval again
i m not completely sure what do you mean by change the rate but if the delay between calls is going to change during execution the process should speed up or slow down then i would use settimeout to let the function queue up the next invocation of itself with a variable to specify the delay if the interval is to stay the same then setinterval is ok though i personally prefer to use settimeout either way because i usually find it simpler to have code like if somecondition settimeout mytimerfunction delay

19617071
google-chrome	firefox
so i m just going to live with this for now until such time as google-chrome adds support for border-radius to these elements
so it looks like rounded corners on both html5 video and on a flash video work in firefox but do not work in google-chrome

19622762
punctuation	words
you may prefer to convert some punctuation such as full stops into unique integers to prevent this
i assume that you are searching for common patterns of consecutive words appearing in the same order top of the world would not be counted as the same phrase as top of a world or the world of top

19622762
punctuation	words
if so then i would recommend the following linear-time approach split your text into words and remove things you don t consider significant remove capitalisation punctuation words breaks etc. convert your text into an array of integers one integer per unique words every instance of cat becomes 1 every dog becomes 2 this can be done in linear time by using a hash-based dictionary to store the conversions from words to numbers
if the words is not in the dictionary then assign a new id

19623507
express	node.js
almost every routing problem i see on stackoverflow is out-of-order express middleware in general you want your routes decoupled and not relying on order that much don t use app.use for your entire application if you really only need that middleware for 2 routes i m looking at you body-parser make sure when all is said and done you have exactly this order any super-important application-wide middleware all your routes and assorted route middlewares then error handlers sadly being sinatra-inspired express.js mostly assumes all your routes will be in server.js and it will be clear how they are ordered
for a medium-sized application breaking things out into separate routes modules is nice but it does introduce peril of out-of-order middleware the app symlink trick there are many approaches outlined and discussed at length by the community in the great gist better local require paths for node.js

19624938
cpython	ironpython
the gil is an artifact of the python vm in cpython not the python language itself
some python vm s like jython ironpython etc do not have a gil

19625953
vim	emacs
this is what i usually do in order install vim for me vim is the easiest way to edit files through the command line
this certainly might not be the case for everyone - some people prefer emacs and some nano which is a lot simpler

19628856
opencv	emgucv
umm..if emgucv and your project use the same version just copy the emgucv s opencv dlls and all other dlls to your folder..maybe it will work
one reason why that maybe is because opencv is not built with ffmpeg or you are missing them in your folder just copy them over then it also might start to work

19631737
g++	gcc
pre-requisite if you are using a new mac or a mac where the developer tools were never installed until recently say 3 or 4 months ago then you want to check if gcc g++ is installed on the machine by examining the content of usr bin
if gcc g++ are not installed then you need to install them via homebrew

19631737
g++	gcc
if gcc g++ are not installed then you need to install them via homebrew
cmake setup in the cmake settings make sure that both the c and c++ cuda host compilers are set to your install of gcc g++ usually in usr local bin

19632022
heroku	openshift
i don t know openshift but maybe you can adapt the work that was done to install atlas numpy scipy scikit-learn on heroku in particular building scipy from source using pip requires a fortran compiler gfortran which is probably not installed on openshift by default
edit a possible alternative would be to build binary packages for numpy scipy and scikit-learn using the wheel format and then point the pip install command to an openshift blob store that hosts the pre-built packages

19637097
opera	google-chrome
it s bug - check this out that appears only with using ui 1.10.3 and when the scrollbar is not at the very top in firefox opera ie8
in google-chrome works fine and also with 1.10.2 on other browsers

19637199
libstdc++	libc++
they are not binary compatible and libmli3 requires libstdc++
on 10.8 and earlier libstdc++ is chosen by default on 10.9 libc++ is chosen by default

19639010
ienumerable	ilist
it implements ienumerable though
it is true lazylist does not implement the ilist interface

19645235
ssl	https
judging from google groups threads ssl naked domain redirect is not possible here here
apparently naked domain redirect on https is not supported

19648099
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome in particular does not accelerate scrolling via mouse wheel which makes it appear choppy
firefox on the other hand feels very different

19649846
monkeyrunner	adb
after much mild aggravation looking at this problem and not seeing it except rarely i discovered that the so-called monkeyserver is actually the adb android debugging bridge daemon which for some totally unexplained reason didn t start when monkeyrunner threw the exception
the adb daemon is supposed to automatically start when monkeyrunner starts

19652607
octal	decimal
this is because when the first digit of a number integer constant is 0 and second must not be x or x the compiler interprets it as an octal number
printing it with d will give you a decimal value

19653537
mp3	ogg
mp3 is not supported in both chromium and firefox for ubuntu
you can convert mp3 to ogg to play them in chromium and firefox

19656576
memcpy	malloc
you should rather use memcpy to modify the memory pointed by the heap_string_malloc pointer with your data memcpy heap_string_malloc hello 5
stack is a static array of chars so it will be allocated in the stack and freed automatically once the function ends because its size is known since its definition. while heap and heap_string_malloc are both declared as pointers to char buffers and need to be allocated dynamicly with malloc in order to define the size of their content that s why they will reside in the heap memory. by doing and you are modifying the pointers them-self with a static buffer value not the content to which they re pointing

19657747
mp3	ogg
mp3 is not fully supported in firefox
you have to add an ogg version of the file

19658073
symfony	silex
there is a better approach symfony allows you to enable a testing session mode that doesnt use the session_ functionality
i am not sure exactly how to enable this in silex but you have to enable the mock file storage in symfony

19662597
perforce	svn
red gate sql source control has been updated to include git and mercurial support as well as perforce and tfs
be forewarned that their dvcs integration is not 100 feature complete in relation to their svn product as basic features such as viewing history of an object are not supported from within ssms

19662638
portrait	landscape
by default the portrait video is encoded as it is produced by the camera let say landscape and a 90 degrees rotation used to present it properly
when you export it it s orientation is not changed it is just recoded physically rotated so no rotation is needed to present it properly. this is why you get the identity matrix on the second time it not means that it was changed from portrait to landscape but this time the it s natural size is also swapped and everything should be okay based on your code

19663817
multiplying	multiplication
when you multiplying the first with c you are trying to multiplying an array of shape 2 3 with an array of shape 2 something numpy does not know how to do
you could get what you want if you reshaped your c array to have shape 2 1 when you multiplying the second with c you are trying to multiplying two arrays of shape 2 so numpy does elementwise multiplication with no problems

19670813
lisp	scheme
first your question is very much not redundant -- it is very justified and as i implied one of the things that lisp newcomers to scheme and scheme newcomers to lisp encounter
second the very shallow very short answer is what people have told you yes it s possible to implement cl s defmacro in a scheme that supports syntax-case and as expected you ve got multiple pointers to such implementations

19672616
spaces	delimiter
you cannot use spaces as spaces are part of the items the first column
it looks like you have a fixed length file format so you should actually go by the number of characters your file doesn t have any delimiter

19678121
implements	extends
if view would be an interface it works i think the problem in understanding generics is that in the actual case does not mean that you can return any type that extends view and implements checkable
it means that the client can cast the returned type to any type that extends view and implements checkable

19681122
scrollable	panels
since the groupbox doesn t have a scrollable property add your images to a panels instead and set the scrollable property
then have the panels fill the groupbox

19682422
punctuation	words
a coarse grain tokenizer can split a string using certain delimiter nltk s word_tokenize or punct_tokenize which uses whitespaces punctuation for english
then for finer grain analysis at morphemic level people would usually use some finite state machines to split words up into morpheme in german polysynthetic langauges without specified words boundary often requires a segmenter first to add whitespaces between the tokens because the orthography doesn t differentiate words boundaries in chinese

19687987
memcpy	memmove
of course like memcpy it provides no protection from memory overlays data destruction etc
it is not clear if it is really a memcpy or a memmove

19688108
memcpy	memmove
of course like memcpy it provides no protection from memory overlays data destruction etc
it is not clear if it is really a memcpy or a memmove

19688503
implements	extends
that is not the only possible way to implements the io monad
for example i might make my io actions case classes that extends a common trait

19689045
floating-point	fractions
welcome to floating-point rounding errors
the number 0.12 is not expressible as a terminating binary fractions so you get rounding errors

19689740
ubuntu	linux
note that if you use ubuntu 14.10 utopic unicorn or newer you do not need to install the usbip package the usbip tools are part of the linux-tools-generic package and the binaries are already available in usr lib linux-tools-kernel-version
a walkthrough tutorial on how to install and use usbip is available at howtoforge how to modify your gnu linux box to serve as a usb-over-ip server the windows client has advanced since the howtoforge tutorial and has a little more interface now instead of just a command-line tool

19690129
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome goes through each background property and sees which one it can interpret
it can t interpret the first gradient because it doesn t recognize -moz- like firefox does

19691154
g++	gcc
when you compile without it expands to when you compile with it expands to for some reason g++ is then choosing to ignore the perfectly good definition that is presented there
based on the commentary on this invalid bug it s gcc choosing to not optimize the code and looking for the definition in one of the linked libraries

19697315
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome will support the streams api but it s not ready yet
firefox may also eventually support it

19697721
listview	gridview
it is not as extensible as a listview but will certainly fit your particular needs and works on all apis - well api 3+
gridview is ideal for this it is basically a listview taking an adapter you could define it as a single row with multiple columns however currently it is os 4.3+ only hoping they include an implementation in the support library soon

19697987
spaces	delimiter
attribute contains word selector selects elements that have the specified attribute with a value containing a given word delimiter by spaces
your code not work as _cidforsonum_unpaid has no space after _cidforsonum_ matches word delimiter by spaces. updated after op s comment

19703813
floating-point	fractions
you can think of binary floating-point as fractions with power-of-two denominators
even a simple number such as 0.1 cannot be accurately represented as binary floating-point and every division by a power of ten is by nature inaccurate

19704574
google-chrome	firefox
assuming you ve solved the initial issue which can be solved only by adding a specific domain to the access-control-allow-origin and removing the wildcard the next steps are you have to remove the http-only from the set-cookie header otherwise you will never be able to receive a cookie generated by your angular code this setup will already work in firefox though not in google-chrome to make it work for google-chrome too you need to a send a different domain from localhost in the cookie using the domain your ws are hosted
you can even use wildcards like .domain.com instead of ws.domain.com b then you ll need to make a call to the domain you specified in the cookie otherwise google-chrome won t store your cookie optional i would remove that api path in favor of a and that should to the trick

19705475
innodb	myisam
myisam is often faster than innodb in terms of raw performance mostly because it is not acid
therefore accessing myisam consumes less resources than innodb

19706655
implements	extends
you could implements the two projects this way start from the multi pane demo project
update the two activities of the multi pane demo to extends actionbaractivity v7 you don t need to extends fragmentactivity implements the drawerlayout the sample code from the drawer project code in the start list activity i m assuming you don t want the drawerlayout in the details activity but implementing it shouldn t be a problem if you want it

19706655
implements	extends
update the two activities of the multi pane demo to extends actionbaractivity v7 you don t need to extends fragmentactivity implements the drawerlayout the sample code from the drawer project code in the start list activity i m assuming you don t want the drawerlayout in the details activity but implements it shouldn t be a problem if you want it
the layout of the start list activity will be like this don t forget that you need to implements the drawerlayout changes in the activity_item_twopane.xml as well

19706673
hex	binary
if you omit the encoding the raw buffer is returned valid encodings are utf8 ascii utf16le ucs2 base64 and hex
there is also a binary encoding but it is deprecated and should not be used any longer

19707177
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
however when you re-assign your uiviewcontroller variable you lose the strong reference to the old instance if you a using arc which causes it to be deallocated which then destroys any shared_ptr instance variables
popping i assume you mean in a uinavigationcontroller a uiviewcontroller will not necessarily deallocate it you can override its dealloc method to check that

19707177
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
popping i assume you mean in a uinavigationcontroller a uiviewcontroller will not necessarily deallocate it you can override its dealloc method to check that
the uiviewcontroller instance will remain alive as long as you keep a strong reference to it

19708432
serializable	deserialization
serializable and or deserialization methods
force all serialized datetimes to be interpreted as utc you can then take this one step farther and error on deserialization if the datetime isn t in a specified format

19708903
uiview	subviews
simply drag a uiview onto your uiviewcontroller making sure its layered above the uitableview it does not need to be a subviews of the uitableview
drag your uiactivityindicatorview and uilabel on then create an outlet for the uiview

19708997
dropbox	icloud
it might be worth considering dropbox s sync api for ios- they ve implemented a solution for syncing files that while it may not be a viable commercial option for your project it s free to experiment with and the code is worth taking a look at to get some ideas
or your app could intermittently poll your own server or icloud to check for updates on startup every hour etc

19710152
slug	permalinks
so that s why the url is and not so you create the custom post and when you did the first rewrite ie from the setting- permalinks it changed the slug to fotoalbum
try to change it to and reflush the permalinks

19710561
viewdidload	viewwillappear
if you come back to tab1 and your model code was done in viewdidload this would not be updated assuming you re not using kvo or nsfetchedresultscontroller etc.
viewwillappear this is called every time the view is about to appear whether or not the view is already in memory

19719152
udp	tcp
a small udp packet with a server s current usage level isn t going to bring down a network even one that s already busy
tcp is better at doing that due to lost packets causing retransmits thus creating even more traffic but even then this is won t be a problem for a couple of reasons

19722706
ssl	https
i had the same problem when used rewritecond https off for apache behind load balancer when load balancer does ssl stuff
if https version of the site is not configured via apache modssl it doesn t set https variable to on and keeps redirecting infinitely

19723649
noexcept	throw
this is legitimate since the moved-from element is no longer needed and many real-world classes come with noexcept move constructors so that this covers a large number of cases and the lossless workaround only offers an advantage for a small number of weird types which have no noexcept moves
you can write your own wrapper function template usage you cannot get around the fundamental problem that motivates the separation of back and pop_back in the first place which is that the element s copy or move constructor may throw exceptions and that you may lose the popped element when this happens

19727071
csv	tsv
if your file makes use of the whole csv tsv format with quoted cells containing tab characters and or newlines then you need csv which is a proper csv parser
conversely if you want a cell in column 0 containing for example a to be output as a then you must not use csv because it will remove the quote marks when reading and not re-insert them on writing because they aren t needed for that cell

19732614
division	subtract
a typical approach for a 32 16 16+16 division would be to have the dividend stored in a pair of 16-bit registers which get updated during operation and the divisor in its own register which doesn t
sixteen times subtract the upper 17 bits of the dividend from the divisor

19735665
udp	tcp
udp packets are one-off events so that sort of bookkeeping isn t required
in tcp connections persist between packets so the destination machine needs to keep track of which packets belong to which connection

19736083
awt	swing
myself i would use a swing gui not an awt gui since swing is much more powerful and flexible than awt
there s almost never a need to create awt gui s

19737721
des	aes
some like des are not recommended
others were candidates for aes like blowfish twofish and serpent

19740203
google-chrome	firefox
i think it s because google-chrome is forgiving your incorrect slashes in your css and js paths they should be forward slashes not backslashes and firefox isn t
firefox is giving 404 not found errors when trying to load your css and js files

19740672
delphi	oxygene
the same language lets you targets all three platforms and produces 100 native output for the respective platform oxygene isn t a delphi product but it was bundled with rad studio as delphi prism
you may look at oxygene compiler from remobjects they have support for many platforms including winrt ios and android here s a quote from their website oxygene 6 is out now supporting 3 major target platforms .net winrt and mono java and android and new

19742398
serializable	deserialization
for those who may be interested in the wrapper pattern i am currently using to implement custom serializable with ormlite works with other orms too here is a simple working example with nodatime types that are otherwise not serializable properly i hope it will soon be possible to define hooks callbacks for specific types that should be handled with custom code and also that ormlite will allow properties with private setters to be reloaded from persistence currently it will only work in one direction
update 2014 03 08 as a temporary workaround it is possible to have ormlite use custom serializable deserialization by calling first even if businessobject is a reference type

19749129
freebsd	linux
kqueue is only present in bsd freebsd openbsd and darwin mac os x ios kernels
it does not exist in the linux kernel

19753747
prepare	execute
this answer posted by an anonymous user on to those wondering why adding quotes to around a placeholder is wrong and why you can t use placeholders for table or column names there is a common misconception about how the placeholders in prepare statements work they are not simply substituted in as escaped strings and the resulting sql execute
instead a dbms asked to prepare a statement comes up with a complete query plan for how it would execute that query including which tables and indexes it would use which will be the same regardless of how you fill in the placeholders

19757335
filewriter	bufferedwriter
if you need the output then each thread could write to its own bufferedwriter wrapping a filewriter for example
or you could have a single thread do the actual output with all other threads adding their messages to a blockingqueue and the one writer dequeueing a message and then writing it to the bufferedwriter which doesn t lock and buffers its i o

19758319
recvfrom	datagram
recvfrom blocks anyway if there is nothing to receive so if this is the only thing you re intersted in calling select is useless
you do not normally use select with udp at all except you want one of the following receive from several ports or one port and an unix socket etc. with a single thread detect other events as soon as they happen without waiting for an unrelated recvfrom or sendto to unblock sleep in a maximally portable way you want to use the linux-specific recvmmsg but then you really want to use epoll_wait to receive a whole bunch of datagram with one syscall select is regularly used with tcp as it is able to multiplex between several sockets one for every connected client

19758319
udp	tcp
you do not normally use select with udp at all except you want one of the following receive from several ports or one port and an unix socket etc. with a single thread detect other events as soon as they happen without waiting for an unrelated recvfrom or sendto to unblock sleep in a maximally portable way you want to use the linux-specific recvmmsg but then you really want to use epoll_wait to receive a whole bunch of datagram with one syscall select is regularly used with tcp as it is able to multiplex between several sockets one for every connected client
this is not necessary with udp since one socket is sufficient to recieve packets from each and every client assuming they use the same port

19762760
allocator	stl
note that both use the heap segment for memory allocator
read this well i would suggest that you use the stl vector class which has loads of functionality and doesn t bother you with such issues and is very easy to get along with

19762780
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
this is happening because apple has changed the way of managing the orientation of uiviewcontroller
in ios6 oreintation handles differently .in ios6 containers such as uinavigationcontroller do not consult their children to determine whether they should autorotate

19765557
inline	inlining
whether the functions are inline doesn t matter inlining is an optimization it isn t allowed to change the meaning of well-defined programs
of course when inlining things the compiler may end up making different choices with respect to evaluation order

19768082
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome allows that exception -- which it doesn t apply to userscripts -- however firefox does not
the firefox implementation flat out states this method is only allowed to be called for windows that were opened by a script using the window.open method

19768719
sum	coalesce
choose either sum coalesce a_option_1 0 or coalesce sum a_option_1 0 i prefer the first form though largely because well that s how i think -- i think put coalesce as close to the null as possible. i m not sure if it has a performance issue
also ifnull will get it done too like coalesce

19772266
client-side	server-side
i fear that is not possible using client-side javascript unless the server implements a mechanism allowing you to gather this information by either simply supporting cors or include the information in the json response of the jsonp request
however if you have some server-side support you could put in place an api that allows you to do so

19772454
trie	tree
if you re looking for pessimistically optimal solution multimap is a better solution o 1 insert time not in trie tree if you have alphabet with many letters o n memory and running time still you ll need to sort the words within the same occurrence count bucket if there re many words with the same occurrence number sorting becomes the dominant operation and trie-tree approach is the same as multimap approach
if the prefixes of the words are repeatable the trie tree will be most memory-efficient solution unfortunately still o n pessimistically

19772574
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
on ios7 uiviewcontroller s automaticallyadjustsscrollviewinsets property is set to yes in default
i think it doesn t work well if it is embedded in uinavigationcontroller

19775059
postgresql	mysql
you might have to switch to postgresql because that rdbms supports u codes for utf characters in their regular expression syntax
mysql s regular expression library does not support utf-8

19776143
super	self
you should not use self.__class__ or type self when calling super
in python 3 a call to super without arguments is equivalent to super b self within methods on class b

19776480
comparator	comparable
the individual comparator method of the comparable elements cannot be overriden unless one defines a separate subclass to comparable and only applies the sorting to instances of that subclass
for a generic comparable type overriding of the compare method of the comparator class on every sorting provides access to the comparator method of the array components

19778689
persistent	transient
transient properties are properties that you define as part of the model but which are not saved to the persistent store as part of an entity instances s data.
quite simply transient properties are not stored persistently

19780272
decimal	ieee
you can compute the error of the conversion from decimal to floating-point as 0.0000000000000000000000011111111101101001010010111101 2 61 and since this error is larger than half the ulp you should unless you have reasons to prefer to round downwards add one to the significand in order to obtain the nearest single-precision value to the original number as expressed in decimal
you cannot use the decimal exponent for the ieee 754 representation

19780272
decimal	ieee
you cannot use the decimal exponent for the ieee 754 representation
the ieee 754 expects a binary exponent that is the number p when the number is represented as 1.xxx 2 p

19781114
actionscript	mxml
registering it with actionscript like this.addeventlistener event.closing windowclosed
does not work no closing event was dispatched. the only way was to register an event handler directly in the s window element at start of the mxml file

19782201
moq	typemock
for instance suppose you had a class that did file manipulation using system.io if you wanted to write a unit test you would need to mock out some static methods or concrete implementations of the file class typemock isolator essential and above will let you do this while the basic will only let you mock out interfaces abstract classes similar to moq
typemock isolator essential and above is typically used when you want to mock out things that are statically bound such as concrete dependencies where dependencies aren t interfaces abstract classes

19782960
google-chrome	firefox
i am using angularjs 1.2.0rc3 and tested in firefox 24 google-chrome 30.0.1599.101 m ie 10
i had the same issue it would work in google-chrome but not firefox

19783849
google-chrome	firefox
after doing a bit of research i ve come up only with incompatibility issues between the microsoft report viewer control and the way that google-chrome handles it
basically google-chrome cannot handle this control so i ve had to inform clients that firefox and ie are the best options that work consistently

19784648
innodb	myisam
source mysql documentation links myisam documentation innodb documentation
mysql older versions at least by default uses myisam as the table type this table type doesn t support transactions see table 14.7 for support options

19786224
jasmine	sinon
and change the object to edit i moved to sinon jasmine spys are too limited anyway
edit this is how to move to chai+sinon in karma jasmine testing without moving to mocha.. npm install karma-sinon-chai add to karma.conf.js add it in the plugins list karma-sinon-chai and in change the framework now add a chai-helper.js file name doesn t matter to the files array in the karma.conf file

19788267
innodb	myisam
myisam supports the second column with auto increment but innodb doesn t
for innodb you might create a trigger before insert to get the max value of the reportid and add one to the value

19789068
super	extends
super params
error is because you extends palindromearray .this is not necessary. subclass your palindromearrayuser must provide constructor with one int

19790837
google-chrome	firefox
for google-chrome you must use padding-left similar to ctravel s solution modified jsfiddle but this doesn t work on the option elements in firefox so this isn t a cross-browser solution either
you can just use see modified jsfiddle unfortunately this works for firefox only

19793485
rdf	owl
owl is not the same as rdf but owl can be serialized in rdf
it appears that you ve already serialized your owl in rdf

19796022
super	extends
you can use the wildcard when you declare variables but not when you instantiate them is again all valid you cannot do this when it comes to extends vs super this is called co-variance vs contra-variance
it determines which direction along the class hierarchy supplied types are allowed to travel the first two examples demonstrate extends - the tightest bound you can assume from the collection is runnable as the user can pass a collection of anything that has runnable in its inheritance hierarchy

19798924
dictionary	map
you can call straight sql to get what you are looking for most efficiently alternatively you can use activerecord to find the counts for all songs and then build up the distribution dictionary in ruby
what you are looking for doesn t map well to standard activerecord querying

19799355
spaces	linefeed
the whitespace characters are character tabulation u+0009 linefeed u+000a carriage return u+000d and spaces u+0020
whitespace is not allowed within any token except that spaces is allowed in strings

19801589
haskell	idris	haskell	agda
that d be a dependent type such a thing isn t possible in haskell
you d have to use agda or idris or another dependently typed language

19802082
ssl	https
it s because of the new mixed content blocking enabled in some browers which inadvertently broke mechanical turk hits that are hosted on servers which do not have ssl certificates
this happens because browsers now block unsecured iframes on https secured sites

19804677
profiling	instrumentation
once i did this selecting product- profiling worked for me and the instrumentation was running
i wanted the zombie instrumentation which strangely isn t in the xcode dropdown i was able to use this by simply using file- new in instrumentation while the allocations instrumentation was still connected and running and i could then choose the zombies instrumentation and the record button wasn t greyed out

19806677
serializable	deserialization
one option would be to declare that variable as transient so that it is not serializable
on deserialization however you ll have to handle that member like reastablishing the connection

19808270
apache	nginx
but you need to put nginx in front of those because apache doesn t handle slow clients very well
if you have nginx then you can replace apache+passenger with something else

19809895
division	modulo
try print 9 3 print 9 3 you will get 0 3.0 modulo returns the remainder of the division and the division operator returns the quotient of the division
you should use modulo not division operator

19813136
mvp	presenter
it looks like a compromise between mvc and mvp
the last solution i see is to stick with mvp pattern you are actually using it which originally does not allow model classes to be accessed through the view by introducing a presenter layer to link the two you will have to instanciate and synchronize values manually between your javafx properties and your domain classes sometimes it is what you want and the only way to achieve this for instance this way you can revert to old domain value in a form quite easily if it was bindable you would have lost the last correct domain value

19813136
mvp	presenter
the last solution i see is to stick with mvp pattern you are actually using it which originally does not allow model classes to be accessed through the view by introducing a presenter layer to link the two you will have to instanciate and synchronize values manually between your javafx properties and your domain classes sometimes it is what you want and the only way to achieve this for instance this way you can revert to old domain value in a form quite easily if it was bindable you would have lost the last correct domain value
note that you can put your javafx properties in singletons using an ioc framework such as spring to be accessed and binded through different views i see them as part of the presenter

19818643
equals	compareto
if it s violated the ordering is said to be inconsistent with equals
a class whose compareto method imposes an order that is inconsistent with equals will still work but sorted collections containing elements of the class may not obey the general contract of the appropriate collection interfaces collection set or map

19818643
equals	compareto
a class whose compareto method imposes an order that is inconsistent with equals will still work but sorted collections containing elements of the class may not obey the general contract of the appropriate collection interfaces collection set or map
this is because the general contracts for these interfaces are defined in terms of the equals method but sorted collections use the equality test imposed by compareto in place of equals

19820071
multiplying	multiplication
but it certainly wouldn t hurt and would silence the warning to add a ll suffix to make it explicit that you want a value of type long long as for this assuming you have 32-bit int s the constant 1000000 is of type int and the result of multiplying two int values is also of type int
in this case the multiplication will overflow

19820725
cpython	ironpython
now with regard to ironpython not complaining in case a perhaps it handles the method resolution slightly differently from the way cpython does
instance does in fact have a __str__ method which ironpython might be picking up i am not sure the cpython behavior here with respect to old-style classes is canonical or even documented so ironpython may not actually be wrong

19820725
cpython	ironpython
instance does in fact have a __str__ method which ironpython might be picking up i am not sure the cpython behavior here with respect to old-style classes is canonical or even documented so ironpython may not actually be wrong
remember ironpython is a re-implementation of python on the .net framework

19825780
google-chrome	firefox
here is a version that works in google-chrome and probably safari using your methodology
however this won t work in firefox because object inputs to feimage are not supported and from my testing feimage units are pretty buggy in ie

19831683
ssl	https
plain http on port 80 or 5984 is potentially not safe and prone to man-in-the-middle attacks so to fully prevent this couchappy staff decided to accept connections only on ssl on port 443
443 is the default port used by browsers when using https

19832132
soappy	suds
if you want to look at it soappy request response body in console add this lines and then call proxy.getcursondate input update cant get it to work with soappy always get an empty result
i think the problem is that the schema references a type defined in the schema namespace but does not import it without doctor param suds client throw this exception suds.typenotfound type not found schema

19832393
google-chrome	firefox
also place the perspective property here more on that later this is part of the problem as firefox requires it google-chrome does not - this explains why it works there
the next issue with firefox is that overflow hidden set on .home-auto-interactive causes all descendant elements to be flattened according to the spec w3c transform-style

19833997
memcpy	realloc
this gives you some head room so not every time memory grows is it necessary to call malloc memcpy free
first of all i d like to point out you are not addressing the vulnerability as the memory released by free is not being cleared as well same as realloc

19834642
build.gradle	gradlew
myproject myapp build.gradle as you can see this is not official aar library bundle until facebook uploads its sdk to mavencentral we can use this temp solution from the community
edit next file and re-sync project sync project with gradlew files button or restart idea

19834726
bash	zsh
if something else is wrong with your profile and bash is completely broken you can temporarily use a different shell one that doesn t care about your bash_profile with the new command... option in terminal.app s file menu
when prompted for a command enter bin zsh

19836050
freebsd	linux
that work around will not work in freebsd 4.3 and later
however in freebsd 4.6 and later select and poll work correctly on bpf devices so the workaround isn t necessary although it does no harm. you didn t quote the first sentence which is important here - you said epoll which is a linux system call

freebsd	linux
however in freebsd 4.6 and later select and poll work correctly on bpf devices so the workaround isn t necessary although it does no harm. you didn t quote the first sentence which is important here - you said epoll which is a linux system call
that paragraph does not apply on linux

19836325
strcpy	strncpy
so strcpy will keep copying forever reading memory it doesn t have access to and writing past the end of your destination array either of which could cause the crash
you need to either use strncpy which you should always prefer which only copies a fixed number of characters

19838562
client-side	server-side
client-side server-side
i m not sure exactly what you mean because when the client clicks on something assumes that you mean client-side where you can use socket.socket.sessionid but store it in an array of clients assumes you mean server-side where you can access it as socket.id

19839709
multiplication	exponent
then assuming that the result could be computed by squaring the result k times when exponent is not a power of 2 we need to make additional multiplication
it turns out that if we can divide exponent by 2 without remainder we can square the base and divide the exponent

19841379
ssl	https
the reason you get a host is not responsive error is because the ssl handshake failed because the device did not trust the server s certificate so an https connection was never created and it interprets it as if it did not find the server because the ssl handshake occurs at a lower level than http and it cannot distinguish between both cases
if you want to see the ssl errors you will have to use a program like wireshark or charles to look at the network traffic

19842779
rsa	aes
in short before the elliptic curve crypto baked into zmq 4 is considered reliable and becomes standard the accepted solution would be to implement ssl tls over the connection manually and failing that use aes 128 or 256 with a secure key sharing mechanism key sharing is where rsa would appropriately be used
understanding that this is not really an answer to your question i m going to be encrypting the messages directly with rsa before sending them with 0mq

19842779
rsa	aes
edit i know more about encryption now than i did when i wrote this rsa is not an appropriate choice for encrypting message data
use aes either with manually sharing keys this is our approach for the short term or implementing a key sharing scheme as in jim miller s answer.

19843768
bower	npm	client-side	server-side
npm or node package manager it is use for installing managing the node modules server sides usage example npm install express or npm install bower -g whereas bower you use that to install anything that is use client-side usage example bower install jquery or bower install font-awesome ignore my above answer if you are talking about why there is a package on the bower component for node
if so i think they ve registered that in bower but not even sure what can you really do with that since most of the stuff would require you to run it server-side but some library maybe accessible usable client-side

19847743
move	drag
if you want to move around files that are already in your solution to another location within the solution you should move them around using the solution explorer not windows explorer as you ll otherwise get the behavior you are experiencing where visual studio does not know where you move them
you can click and drag files around right-click and copy and paste etc

19848425
sml	prolog
sml uses pattern matching to determine which version of the function definition to use
is non-deterministic and sml doesn t have the facility to backtrack and try another definition if the one it tries fails like prolog

19849044
implements	extends
so is legal but is not as object does not implements
in order x extends y and x super y in generic type declarations are used to mean x is-a y and y is-an x respectively

19849044
super	implements	super	extends
in order x extends y and x super y in generic type declarations are used to mean x is-a y and y is-an x respectively
the java developers did not wish to add a new keyword meaning extends or implements

19853740
quicksort	mergesort
mergesort is stable but quicksort is not
so if you need stability in output you would use mergesort

19853740
quicksort	mergesort
note in java arrays.sort function uses quicksort for primitive data types and mergesort for object data types
because objects consume memory overhead so added a little overhead for mergesort may not be any issue for performance point of view

19853821
udp	tcp
also router switch could be configured to not allow udp traffic
finally if you can t get it to work change to tcp as main transport protocol and use tcpping for discovery of nodes passing in the ip addresses of the two nodes forming the cluster

19854099
implements	extends
i have succeeded in adding a property to an existing iproject despite it not implements ipropertysource and hence would ve been able to just add some functionality by subclassing and overwriting the getpropertydescriptors and getpropertyvalue methods
thanks to greg-449 i was able to understand the standardpropertiesadapterfactory functionality that made a resourcepropertysource from the iproject that extends iresource so a way to work around all this is that you use a subclass of advancedpropertysection to display the iproject s properties.

19855671
opera	firefox
firefox opera are following spec it s not really their fault you don t agree with spec
in firefox media queries consider the width of the scrollbar to be inside the screen width

19856824
dictionary	map
the defaults property on the route class defines a dictionary of default values to use in the event that the incoming url doesn t include one of the parameter values specified
default route will map all requests because it has defined default values for every property in routetemplate means that property is variable if you not provide value for that param in url it will try to take default value if you provide it

19857096
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
the custom exception should extends runtimeexception if you want to make it unchecked else extend it with exception
with unchecked-exception calling code method is not required to declare in its throws clause any subclasses of runtimeexception that might be thrown during the execution of the method but not caught

19857096
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
with unchecked-exception calling code method is not required to declare in its throws clause any subclasses of runtimeexception that might be thrown during the execution of the method but not caught
as the calling method may not handle runtimeexception one needs to be careful while throwing runtimeexception

19867026
gridview	sqldatasource
you essentially need to set the datasource of gridview again and bind the data so you can see the updated data after deleting a row
update after taking a look at the the sqldatasource you have not written a command for deleting the row when you click the delete button

19867026
gridview	sqldatasource
so the changes are not being pushed to the database and that s the reason your gridview is not seeing the change
you need to add a deletecommand to the sqldatasource

19869484
bluestacks	android-emulator
this file can now be accessed on the pc by navigating to c programdata bluestacks userdata sharedfolder
now the messages can be accessed by decrypting the databases this link tells you how the generated html contains a table of users no user names in my case though - but maybe because i hadn t saved the contacts with a name on the android-emulator their statuses though in my case even when some contacts had statuses it did not show up last message times and message histories

19872536
postgresql	greenplum
greenplum isn t postgresql it s a separate product based on postgresql 8.2
do was added in postgresql 9.0

19872867
i2c	spi
if there are a lot of them and the required data rate is low again i2c makes more sense
spi is almost always simpler to use so that s a plus if there s not too many devices

19873277
ssl	https
ps it s a really bad idea to try and proxy ssl - it completely defeats the purpose of ssl
yes i didn t watch the video clip - but simply tell your browser to not use the proxy for https or port 443

19875038
verilog	vhdl
but it ll translate to verilog easily
i m no expert on verilog but it looks as if you might not be asserting reset to your vhdl component before testing it

19881897
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
3 try the latest firefox or google-chrome browsers first
if it works there but not in say safari there are a few steps you need to take to enable webgl in safari first

19886230
lodash	underscore.js
the lodash api was also written with performance in mind so it replaces slower clunky js patterns with better high perf patterns like for loops etc.
also it provides like 30 additional features that isn t available with underscore.js

19886849
prepare	execute
also of importance please note that you should not directly pass in variables to the prepare statement and should instead use the bind_param method this is a more secure method of sanitizing your user input and should shore up vulnerabilities
i believe the crucial issue here is that you ve never execute the sql statement you ve simply prepared it

19888350
realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
since you are now calloc ing each data individually you can and indeed must free that part individually but you cannot free part of the realloc ed array you need to clean it up manually after free ing the data element
you cannot partially free the malloc ed memory

19889872
factors	matrix
matrix where you will find the following the method for data frames will return a character matrix if there is only atomic columns and any non- numeric logical complex column applying as.vector to factors and format to other non-character columns
you can create a list of your matrix and use do.call and lapply to get what you want by the way the data type in your matrix is character not factor

19890303
implements	extends
yes in this case it s not possible to make anotherclass extends abstractexampleimpl but you can write a wrapped inner-class that does this for example then you can just internally make all example methods being actually implements by innerexampleimpl by calling its methods
i guess you mean anotherclass implements example

19890303
implements	extends
well this is what you wanted have anotherclass implements example with some default implementation as well as extends another class or i understood you wrong
since you cannot extends more than one class you have to implements the interface so you can do otherwise this will not be possible

19891930
super	self
such as self super init
for the classb and classc initialization you cannot return self without calling super or assign it a value

19892835
realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
the man page for free indicates free frees the memory space pointed to by ptr which must have been returned by a previous call to malloc calloc or realloc . so reassigning the pointer to something else is not allowed if you intend to pass it to free
this is a bad idea if the call to preaparepaths assigns some other value to pathsforthreads than what was assigned to it by the malloc operation then later when you do this free pathsforthreads

19894117
wav	ogg
but audio wav doesn t exist
see spec here you should use audio vnd.dts for .wav file audio mpeg for .mp3 file and audio ogg for .ogg file.

19894618
cashapelayer	calayer
it seems that you are creating ripplelayer as a normal calayer not a cashapelayer
path is not a property of calayer as far as i remember and you are giving path to the same layer as before

19896024
translation	localization
clicking the view strings that need translation button will take you to string translation
if any of the strings aren t properly formatted for localization the count won t be updated

19899293
stateless	stateful
a stateless protocol does not require the server to retain session information or status about each communications partner for the duration of multiple requests
in contrast a protocol which requires keeping of the internal state on the server is known as a stateful protocol

19899984
sudo	passwd
please double-check your typing when using sudo
type man sudo for more information. to proceed enter your passwd or type ctrl-c to abort. passwd you have not agreed to the xcode license agreements

19905411
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
subclass uinavigationcontroller hide uinavigationbar add custom navigation bar
you do not need to subclass uinavigationbar

19908045
ienumerable	iqueryable
i am having a hunch that you are doing filtering on ienumerable object
if you are doing db operation and doing some filtering on the data set always do filtering on iqueryable object and not on ienumerable list object

19908568
uiview	calayer
i have created a subclassed rmmarker class in mapbox project and i am adding all the components as calayer adding components in uiview then adding uiview.layer doesn t work
you have to add sublayers in the uiview layer

19913002
required	placeholder
bash does not follow the standard in this case and required the -e option to enable this processing
the printf command follows the posix specification and treats literal n in its argument as a linefeed but does not expand such uses in strings that replace placeholder would still output foo nbar instead of foo bar to include an actual linefeed character in a string you can use ansi quoting which has the drawback that the string is otherwise processed as a single-quoted string and cannot contain parameter expansions or command substitutions

19916942
ubuntu	linux
since you mentioned you are in ubuntu you should look at the glibc source code
in general the c library implementations of system calls are done in assembly not in c with a complex series of macros which are for the x86 linux architecture located in sysdeps unix sysv linux i386 sysdep.h with some in various other files elsewhere in the tree also called sysdep.h and sysdep.s - the actual file that calls the macros to implement the write syscall is generated at compile time with several files syscalls.list make-syscalls.sh syscall-template.s asm unistd.h provided by the kernel - not linked here its main contribution is #define __nr_write 4 in general the end result isn t much to look at - it takes three arguments from the stack and puts them in registers and puts the system call number 4 in eax then executes enter_kernel which was historically int 0x80 but now is a code fragment that is in some kind of dynamic block

19918464
hex	binary
for example strings -td myexec from there you can use a hex editor but the main problem is that you wouldn t be able to make a string bigger than it already is
many posix platforms come with the program strings which will read through a binary file searching for strings

19920097
serializable	deserialization
it s not directly possible to serializable a function to json in javascript either though you could write it to a string write that and use eval to read it back in but that would only work in cases where you don t close over any free variables variables that are declared outside the function but accessed within it because those might not be defined in the scope you deserialize to
what you can do in a very limited set of cases is serializable the name of the function and its arguments and then manually lookup the function on the deserialization side either using mirrors or a lookup table

19924023
namenode	hdfs
as such it can only fall in the cp side since taking down the namenode takes down the entire hdfs system no availability
hadoop does not try to hide this the namenode is a single point of failure for the hdfs cluster

19924023
namenode	hdfs
hadoop does not try to hide this the namenode is a single point of failure for the hdfs cluster
hdfs is not currently a high availability system

19925044
ng-view	ng-include
login.html and index.html does not have ng-view
2 once the user is authenticated ng-view must be inlcuded so that all views required on the navigation can work index.html login.html then if authentication passes i change templates ng-include and make home.html the default page home.html has ng-view which will do the usual and the user has access to other pages

19927133
.htaccess	httpd.conf
check your modules used in .htaccess and check httpd.conf whether used modules are loaded
most of the this will be the reason for wamp go to httpd.conf and uncomment loadmodule rewrite_module modules mod_rewrite.so if you try to use module which is not loaded you will get 500 internal server error

19928448
pthreads	fork
on linux however processes can also share memory through suitable system calls on pthreads systems linux processes are created through the fork system call a process called parent can create fork another process called child
c c++ program do not need to be linked to any external library to call fork

19930982
google-chrome	safari
safari browser on ios has a bottom bar unlike google-chrome that is being calculated inside the window height while it isn t really part of the window page
you need to detect cases with user-agent where the client uses safari browser on ios device and then you need to set the height of the body with javascript to and it should solve your problem

19934609
fgets	getline
it s basically a fgets that handles any length of input line by dynamically allocating it
if you have posix you can solve this not by going down in abstraction but by going up to getline

19935595
gif	bmp
these types will be automatically detected if your build of php supports them jpeg png gif wbmp and gd2. 2
it seems that bmp is not supported by imagecreatefromstring or php s gd for that matter 1 it seems to support wbmp which is not bmp

19939309
ssl	https
if you re using urlrewrite to force ssl connections in your web.config it s probably rewriting your localhost address to force https
if debugging with ssl enabled isn t important to you and you re using urlrewrite consider adding into your web.config file s rewrite section

19942706
namenode	hdfs
so your hadoop fs -ls command is listing files directories relative to this location - in your case user li you should be able to assert this by running a aboolute listing and confirm the contents output match hadoop fs -ls user li as these files are in hdfs you will not be able to find them on the local filesystem - they are distributed across your cluster nodes as blocks for real files and metadata entries for files and directories in the namenode
your first call to hadoop fs -ls is a relative directory listing for the current user typically rooted in a directory called in hdfs

19943426
opera	google-chrome
aside from that you would also need -moz-transform scale 1.2 if you want support in firefox 16 -ms-transform scale 1.2 if you want support in ie9 -o-transform scale 1.2 if you want support in opera 12 it will otherwise work in all major browsers
you need the -webkit vendor for the transform property -webkit-transform scale 1.2 as it isn t supported in google-chrome otherwise

19943426
google-chrome	safari
you need the -webkit vendor for the transform property -webkit-transform scale 1.2 as it isn t supported in google-chrome otherwise
same goes for other -webkit browsers like safari

19943779
xslt	schematron
for display purposes of course you can always use xslt to fetch the names of the author and the writing
if you cannot push key and keyref any further and you don t want to eliminate the redundancy in your xml representation then the easiest way to check the constraint you specify is with an assertion either in xsd 1.1 or in schematron

19944312
ubuntu	linux
- 3 best portable as an ubuntu user rule of thumb if it runs on dash the bin sh of ubuntu it will run on virtually anything including your router your toaster and your coffeemachine
4 above all user2719058 is right osx is not linux but bsd-unix so while they can run the same shell the commands are just different enough to make it very very difficult to write a one-script-fits-all

19945325
allocator	stl
now it is not mandatory for an allocator to provide many of the typedefs that were previously required including pointer_type or reference_type difference_type and so on as there is a known good default value
this really maps to current practice in most stl implementations those types are the same in all allocators

19945325
allocator	stl
this really maps to current practice in most stl implementations those types are the same in all allocator
whenever the allocator does not provide the typedefs or the types are the same as the default value provided in allocator_traits there is no point in differentiating the iterators based on what allocator was used to construct the container

19947677
hive	hdfs
while running using hive cli it takes local path as it takes care of uploading files to hdfs to load into table
since hive in-turn runs in a map reduce environment user need to provide hdfs path for the csv file not local path when using hive jdbc

19948306
nfa	dfa
since a dfa does not backtrack the text to be matched is checked against the regex not the regex against the text like a nfa - the dfa opens a branch for each decision throwing away something that is not there is pointless
i suggest j.f.friedl s mastering regular expressions google books he explains the general idea of a dfa dfa engine text-directed contrast the regex-directed nfa engine with an engine that while scanning the string keeps track of all matches currently in the works. in the tonight example the moment the engine hits t it adds a potential match to its list of those currently in progress ... each subsequent character scanned updates the list of possible matches

19949608
express	node.js
here is a good+short description how to handle jsonp in express
if you don t have to deal with websockets then place node.js behind apache via mod_proxy loadmodule proxy_module modules mod_proxy.so loadmodule proxy_http_module modules mod_proxy_http.so loadmodule rewrite_module modules mod_rewrite.so # disable use as forward proxy proxyrequests off # don t handle via headers - we don t care about them proxyvia off # no need to transport host name - not doing virtual hosting proxypreservehost off proxypass page proxypassreverse page # if you get http status code 502 bad gateway maybe this could help setenv force-proxy-request-1.0 1 setenv proxy-nokeepalive 1 in your web-page you can access your api with the same port as your apache and you don t have any problems with cross-domain same-origin-policy

19950395
boost	allocator	boost	stl	allocator	stl
custom allocator for all of the stl boost things that you use might help but is likely a huge job
i would guess that it s stl boost memory allocator that s spreading memory for your collections etc across numa nodes due to the fact that they re not numa aware and you have threads in the program running on each node

19951348
textview	imageview
you can draw all android control event like as button edittext textview checkbox in view imageview you can draw an image in imageview
you can not directly add image on view but you can typecast view to imageview

19953368
google-chrome	firefox
footnote in google-chrome and similar webkit browsers you will see some extra space to the right of the right-most element on the line
this extra space is not seen in firefox where i tested the code

19957926
backgrounding	multitasking
note - its just a request that is not guaranteed to be fulfilled but an attempt of underlying os to better user experience from coding implementation perspective there are primarily 2-3 key steps - a turn on backgrounding modes for backgrounding fetch attribute select app target capabilities backgrounding modes backgrounding fetch b implement this app delegate method - c define your fetch interval typically when app launches - i.e appdidfinishlaunchingwithoptions since it s an event fired by os automatically how to test this behavior during development - well you can simulate test the backgrounding fetch behavior in your app through xcode 5+ using menu debug simulate backgrounding fetch here is the link to the tutorial with sample project
also you can checkout session 204 from apple s wwdc 2013 videos - what s new with multitasking edit - as of today ios 7.0.3 in lack of proper official documentation the practical usage tells that - the enforced minimumbackgroundfetchinterval is between than 5 to 15 minutes anything less than it is not honored

19958307
bmp	png
i have never looked into where the standard is but as you will see all jpegs start with a specific byte and exe start with a specific byte no matter what the content also jpeg is a licensed compressed form of an image and bmp is microsoft windows version of an image with little or no compression i believe
png is open source or gpl licensed and technically your files do not need to be licensed to convert to jpeg

19958622
setcontentview	findviewbyid
you do not have setcontentview r.layout.mylayout
so findviewbyid looks for a view with the id mentioned in the current inflateed layout

19959301
robocopy	xcopy
but robocopy is not copy not xcopy
you are asking robocopy to copy from source to target changed or new files

19960727
listview	gridview
gridview doesn t have the same divider attributes that listview do so you may manually need to add a divider to your list item s view
in your code java classes change any reference of listview to abslistview

19966030
super	extends
however if you leave them in make sure a call to super is performed in each method so that you don t lose the default implementation
this means you want your empty for now method to extends not override the functionality of that same method in parent class

19969301
profiling	debugging
if it s an opengl 3.2 or higher compatibility profiling then yes you can mix immediate mode calls with proper rendering
whether you should or not is another matter you probably shouldn t in production code but it can be useful for debugging

19969490
clang	llvm
llvm the machine abstraction library below clang had been used to do such things
using llvm is not different from using any other assembly translator first you map your arm assembly to llvm assembly then you can compile llvm assembly into something else

19969501
allocator	stl
and you can use it just like a old type array without explicitly allocator the memory although that is not what most ++ programmers do
while this is not directly answering your question -- i would point to that a better practice in c++ is to use the stl lib for this sort of variable length array -- it is safe and simpler and understood by anybody who will maintain it after you

19970634
floating-point	fractions
the problem is that matching template arguments to the program-wide set of instantiations depends on exact equality which based on the machine s particular representation of floating-point values may vary from platform to platform
and since the compiler is not required to provide compile-time emulation of the target machine may vary between compile time and runtime. the solution is to replace double with some other kind of unambiguous representation such as ratios fractions over a fixed amount such as a million or your own floating-point style with integer mantissa and exponent

19974391
postgresql	mysql
if you think that your data in the analytics db is gonna grow large 2tb + don t use mysql but rather postgresql
mysql does not handle big data well

19976675
kerberos	ntlm
i have a similar problem that is only solved by moving ntlm on top of kerberos in the providers as explained by rory or by modifying dns. the problem only occurs in iis7 when the host header of the website exists as a cname alias in the dns. in iis6 integrated windows authentication only uses ntlm by default. in iis7 iws uses kerberos before ntlm by default. replacing the cname record with an a record solves the problem. kerberos has no problems with a records in dns but it has problems with aliases
so apparantly dns cnames are not compatible with kerberos on windows 2008

19978366
floating-point	fixed-point
speaking as a java dev who s had the evils of using double for a decimal representation of anything drummed into him for years i d use decimal rather than floating-point arithmetic for any important calculations involving money
if you absolutely can t use bigdecimal and would prefer not to use double s use long s to do fixed-point arithmetic so each long value would represent the number of cents for example

19982921
primefaces	richfaces
here is my simple which works fine but i not mixed richfaces components with primefaces the message correctly appear after the user edit in table
please try to replace richfaces panel to primefaces panel may be that is occured this problem

19983089
bash	subshell
you can do this with functions not aliases by nohup ing a bash -c which is essentially the same as running an external bash script
in order for this to work you need to mark your function as exported the argument bash_ to nohup provides a name for the bash -c subshell

19984752
strcpy	strncpy
this is not a fault of strcpy in the slightest it is up to the programmers to ensure that the string is going to fit into their buffer for example by calling strlen before copying or ensuring that the string that comes in cannot possibly be longer than their buffer
let s say i want to replace all calls to strcpy with calls to strncpy you shouldn t do that unless you are working with fixed-size strings remember that strncpy not only copies up to the terminating null but also fills the rest of the string with null bytes

19984752
strcpy	strncpy
let s say i want to replace all calls to strcpy with calls to strncpy you shouldn t do that unless you are working with fixed-size strings remember that strncpy not only copies up to the terminating null but also fills the rest of the string with null bytes
if you are looking for a modern replacement of strcpy consider using strlcpy instead

19984777
strcpy	strncpy
in most cases is is enough to use strcpy
strncpy is not an stl function. c has no stl library

19986327
filewriter	bufferedwriter
you are wrapping your filewriter with a bufferedwriter but only closing the filewriter fw.close
since the filewriter doesn t have access and doesn t know about the bufferedwriter it won t flush any possible remaining buffer

19988826
sudo	passwd
add sshkit-sudo to your application s gemfile # gemfile gem sshkit-sudo and require sshkit sudo in you capfile # capfile require sshkit sudo now you can execute a command with sudo as follows task hello do on roles all do sudo cp something something end end
i usually write like this task hello do on roles all do |host| execute sudo cp something something end end edit capistrano 3 does not support sudo with passwd

19988826
sudo	passwd
i usually write like this task hello do on roles all do |host| execute sudo cp something something end end edit capistrano 3 does not support sudo with passwd
however i created a small gem which enables you to use sudo with passwd in capistrano 3 task

19991441
implements	extends
try this since new browsers ie9+ have trim already implements you should only implements trim if it is not already available on the prototype-object overriding it is a huge performance hit
this is generally recommended when extends native objects

19991673
calloc	malloc
the calloc on your system actually touches the memory by clearing it and on many systems memory is not really allocated and thus used up until it is touched by the process to which it is allocated
so just doing malloc does not use the memory until you well use it

19993440
awt	swing
or use a label awt or jlabel swing to display the data
to be blunt your statement i have other graphics components including a paint that i do not want affected. -- is an unrealistic requirement if this is an awt project and if you don t want to use a label

19993440
awt	swing
i ve only been using the awt library however i ll try using a label
thank you for your response and explanation of why i got the nullpointerexception if this is for your own project and not a school assignment then i think that you will want to avoid using awt and instead use swing
