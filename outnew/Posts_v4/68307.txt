cpython	pypy
the statement is not exactly true just like v8 is just an implementation for js cpython is just one implementation for python
pypy has performances matching v8 s

28001846
rpm	yum
aside some versions of rpm but not you on centos 7 can add missing dependencies when given a database of everything including paths to download the package from
on centos 7 yum is the best answer

28002050
pickle	dill
method 1 doesn t work because you can t pickle bound instance methods with pickle
method 2 doesn t work because scipy.stats is doing something tricky something that the dill and pathos author me doesn t quite know what it is without first investigating

28005476
oncreate	setcontentview
your oncreate method has two flaws it does not chain to the superclass with super.oncreate which is typically the very first line in the oncreate method
it does not do anything to create a user interface such as calling setcontentview

28006291
multiplying	multiplication	multiplying	division
i implemented it on an 8051 years ago but that didn t have multiplying divide instructions so it made sense
you re not going to outperform microcoded multiplication and division in regular assembly code

28007055
hex	binary
you need very little buffer memory as you can if necessary receive character-by-character into a state machine and no computer needed - you can if necessary directly encode or interpret it in logic and flip flops you can trivially interact with either end of your system by using a terminal emulator to substitute yourself for the other end without having to add hex dump or binary encoding tools as you would when working with a binary format if you use textual representation of hex your transmitted record lengths are exactly twice the actual data length plus any delimiters
conversely if you use textual representation of decimal or floating point your encoded length varies but you can avoid any incompatibilities in endianess or floating point binary encoding between systems in the general case though that probably does not apply to the specific question here

28011299
swift	objective-c
if swift yo do not need embedded_content_contains_swift
see technical q a qa1881 embedding content with swift in objective-c

28011299
swift	objective-c
see technical q a qa1881 embedding content with swift in objective-c
it seems that you only need to set embedded_content_contains_swift to yes if you are building an app that does not use swift but embeds content such as a framework that does

28011401
couchbase	couchdb
since couchdb has nice and pretty replication algorithm that works over http api ye you only need internet connection to make synchronization authors of couchbase lite found it handy and used it. next since couchbase database uses binary protocol for instead of http replication synchronization they made sync gateway for that http api sync
i am not sure if you can replicate sync gateway backed by walrus or couchbase with couchdb but for sure you can replicate your couchbase lite with sync gateway and or with couchdb

28016651
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
to create an empty file using fileoutputstream assuming from your question as you have shown using fileinputstream below statement will create an empty file whether it exists or not new fileoutputstream filename.ext false .close
the following statement will create the file if not exists and will leave if file exists new fileoutputstream filename.ext true .close

28018410
mongodb	bson
you do appear to be using a mongodb version less than 2.6 or copying output from a robomongo shell which does not support the latest version features
from mongodb 2.6 though the results of aggregation can be a cursor rather than a single bson array

28020934
exponent	addition
edit1 integration precision your current implementation is like this the problem is when you are adding very small and very big value then they are shifted to the same exponent before addition which will round off significant data to avoid this just change it to this now xxx0 is integrated up to max and the whole thing is added to xxx1 the rounding is still there but it is not cumulative anymore
you have to select max value that the integration itself is safe and also the addition xxx0+xxx1 have to be safe

28024170
union	distinct
is called a merge union merge union now let s change the query slightly instead of the concatenation and sort distinct operators we now have a merge join concatenation and a stream aggregate
the merge join concatenation or merge union is not really a join at all

28027603
alloca	malloc
one rule of thumb is if you re not prepared to statically allocate the maximum possible size as a fixed length c array then you shouldn t do it dynamically with alloca either
the reason you re trying to avoid malloc is performance

28029635
pandas	seaborn
but i think it s easier to use the pandas plotting methods here anyway
an easy trick might be to invert the y axis of your plot rather than futzing with the data seaborn barplot doesn t currently support horizontally oriented bars but if you want to control the order the bars appear in you can pass a list of values to the x_order param

28032222
super	extends
super context calls through to the parent class constructor
however gameview doesn t extends any classes and thus there is no parent class to call

28034792
equals	gethashcode
either give it a try and implement something based on the members that participate in equals
if you do not think gethashcode will actually be used in your case say if you absolutely know that you will only be using and not and not linq s distinct etc

28035613
postgresql	mysql
works for postgresql or sql server
mysql doesn t support window functions you would need a substitute sql select last entry without limiting to be clear left join is just shorthand for left outer join so you are already using an outer join

28036303
ng-view	ng-controller
some changes you would need you cannot use ng-controller directive along with ng-view s route bound controller i.e set controller alias in the controller property of the route config controller democtrl as demo
when you use ng-controller directive to instantiate the controller it does not know what is store provider because no such provider service exists

28037101
dictionary	map
dictionary among other things rapidly turns an iterable of key value tuples into the corresponding dictionary
the dictionary will be much faster and it s very fast to create too enumerate yields for i in range len thelist whence the generator expression swapping the tuple as you need to map content to index not vice versa

28037157
debian	linux
on debian packages like libjson-perl only install json.pm and its documentation in a place perl can access it
this is not using linux libraries it is merely an alternative to installing the module minus its dependencies from cpan

28037297
swift	objective-c
you need to add this extension that replaces the performselector for swift and helps in the construction of the mechanism update 06 15 2015 objective-c someone asked for the code in objective-c so here it is
i am not going to run it as i don t have the time right now but it should be quite straightforward as mentioned i have not run this objective-c code it is just a conversion from the swift code

28038266
swift	objective-c
i think you have to declare the swift class as public otherwise it is treated as an internal class and can be only be seen within the same module and this could be the reason why adding it to the same project as files work but as a framework doesn t
other thing that occurs to me is that the framework may need to add objective-c in front of the class declaration so that it can be seen within objective-c classes

28039513
dictionary	map
for numbers in fourb.values numbers.sort the above is better than iterating over the keys followed by indexing into fourb because here you avoid the dictionary lookup
if you love one-liners here s one map list.sort fourb.values but take note if there are many keys in the dictionary as this will return a list of which is immediately discarded--and that s not optimally efficient

28041976
mongodb	bson
refference insert json file into mongodb
if this is not a bson and only json you can use mongoimport --jsonarray

28044722
viewdidload	viewdidappear
you can also fix that only by adding constraints in your interface builder do not forget to remove your code in viewdidload
in viewdidload and when you use autolayout the frame is not yet calculated. so place your code in viewdidlayoutsubviews or in viewdidappear and that should fix the bug

28045414
innodb	myisam
your table must be set up using engine myisam not innodb and the columns you re searching must be set to fulltext indexing
you can easily set your table to myisam in phpmyadmin via the sql tab.

28046600
jar	manifest.mf
not sure that it will help but i had a similar goal i wanted to point to a keystore outside my jar because it depends on the final user certificate
providing that your manifest.mf has this classpath setup class-path

28052050
gif	png
something like outputs an image like make sure to use writeimages not the singular version when writing an animated gif file
png does not support animation

28052123
oncreate	onstart
myservice will be null in oncreate at least when your activity is first created
not only do you not call bindservice until onstart which happens after oncreate but bindservice is asynchronous

28052740
swift	objective-c
core image and gpuimage are both compatible with swift objective-c++ or objective-c
opencv might require a shim to be used from swift but if you re talking performance opencv might not be a great choice

28053459
filewriter	printwriter
first in the addplayer method you created the filewriter in overwrite mode which happens by default
second you aren t closing your printwriter

28056955
wildfly	jboss
you don t specify the server you are using to deploy and i was running into this same issue when trying to deploy my web application on wildfly 8.1 and have my log4j2.xml in the src main resources folder
it s pointed out in this thread that it s not a log4j2 bug but a bug in the jboss wildfly code

28057657
s-function	simulink
to see info on how to inline an s-function using a .tlc file look at the following docsearch inlining c mex s-functions
assuming you have simulink coder and its documentation installed then for a general discussion of how c-mex s-functions are handled open the doc by doing docsearch insert s-function code then click on the link that says insert s-function code -- which may not be the first link

28058941
octal	decimal
note in strict mode using octal syntax starting a number with leading 0 causes syntax error because octal syntax isn t part of the ecmascript standard
numbers with a leading 0 are octal numbers in the same way numbers with leading 0x are hexadecimal numbers normally 09 would cause a syntax error because 9 is not an octal digit in the same way that e is not a decimal digit

28058941
octal	decimal
numbers with a leading 0 are octal numbers in the same way numbers with leading 0x are hexadecimal numbers normally 09 would cause a syntax error because 9 is not an octal digit in the same way that e is not a decimal digit
but apparently most browsers these days auto detect it as decimal instead of raising an error

28062921
google-chrome	firefox
this works in firefox but unfortunately not in google-chrome
it seems google-chrome is bugged

28064568
elasticsearch	kibana
this error happened because you configure the url to your elasticsearch server not correct
it should be refer to elastichsearch host in kibana3 config.js file elasticsearch your ip if you use domain to browser kibana please change ip to domain

28066226
octal	decimal
leading zero will specify octal numeric values are decimal numbers unless prefixed by 0x for hexadecimal numbers 0 for octal numbers
so 0x10 020 16 decimal the octal notation can be confusing - all numeric values that start with zeros are treated as octal but 08 and 09 are not valid octal digits

28066680
super	extends
but if your class is extends another class then that another class is not having any super class that class get extends by java.lang.object class not your class
suppose initially you have class a it not having any super class so it extends java.lang.object class

28066680
super	extends
suppose initially you have class a it not having any super class so it extends java.lang.object class
but in this scenario your class is get extends by class b and b is not extends another class so at this point b will extends java.lang.object class

28067260
equals	compareto
if that s not what you want your comparison will need to use some other discriminator for when the dates are equals
assuming by indexer you mean ordering you just make your type implement and provide a compareto method which compares the date within this to the date within the other foo

28068849
decoder	encoder
i would actually guess that the real hw decoders would be more capable or more compatible than the sw decoder
this may sound counterintuitive but this is especially the case historically with the h264 sw encoder which is very limited. the first non-working resolution has a height that isn t dividable by 16 all the working resolutions have both width and height dividable by 16 while the other one might be too large

28069264
cloudant	couchdb
for example there is an built-in index function for cloudant but no such function for couchdb lucene
couchdb lucene does help to index with lucene but it doesn t work exactly like cloudant

28070304
swift	objective-c
apparently it is not possible anymore to instantiate an object in swift when the name of the class is only known at runtime
an objective-c wrapper is possible for subclasses of nsobject

28070969
innodb	myisam
myisam do not support transactions whereas innodb does
if an operation is interrupted while using a myisam table the operation is aborted immediately and the rows or even data within each row that are affected remains affected even if the operation did not go to completion

28070969
innodb	myisam
if an operation is interrupted while using an innodb table because it using transactions which has atomicity any transaction which did not go to completion will not take effect since no commit is made
table-locking vs row-locking when a query runs against a myisam table the entire table in which it is querying will be locked

28070969
innodb	myisam
as of the writing of this post many shared hosting providers mysql version is still below 5.6.4 which means fulltext indexing is not supported for innodb tables
however this is not a valid reason to use myisam

28070969
innodb	myisam
not that a myisam table that uses fulltext indexing cannot be converted to an innodb table
conclusion in conclusion innodb should be your default storage engine of choice

28077103
pyenv	virtualenv
it appears you re using the debian-provided virtualenv with the python from the pyenv
this cannot work properly because debian has patched site.py distutils sysconfig and probably the virtualenv you re trying to use to make certain assumptions about the file layout of the installed python

28083109
namenode	hdfs
hdfs and yarn mr2 are the core components of hadoop in hdfs namenode was spof but with the introduciton of namnode ha 2 namenode one active and one standby namenode is not spof anymore
you can configure namenode ha in hadoop 2.5 in yarn resource manager was spof but ha can be configured for hadoop version 2.3 onwards

28083200
innodb	myisam
i confirmed that merely changing the myisam sequence tables to innodb causes update locks to be created on the sequence tables after the statement but before the transaction has been committed
these locks are not created when using the myisam sequences

28084460
serializable	deserialization
lambda expressions are a bit more complex as their generated runtime class is not the class which defined it but their defining class is the one holding the code of the lambda s body and in case of serializable lambdas a deserialization support method which is called for validating and re- instantiating the lambda instance
see serializedlambda implementors of serializable lambdas such as compilers or language runtime libraries are expected to ensure that instances deserialize properly

28088068
prepare	execute
now to execute it in pdo you should be using prepare bindparam execute to create a prepare statement bind in parameters and execute it with those parameters you cannot bind the table name though - that must remain a variable
in your current code you have a mixup of the the pdo query method used for simple static queries and the pdostatement execute method which is used to execute a prepare statement

28088965
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
starting from firefox 34 google-chrome 41 safari 9 microsoft edge you can use an es2015 es6 feature called template literals and use this syntax template literals are enclosed by the back-tick grave accent instead of double or single quotes
bonus it also allows for multi-line strings in javascript without escaping which is great for templates browser support as this syntax is not supported by older browsers internet explorer and safari 8 you may want to use babel to transpile your code into es5 to ensure it will run everywhere

28089076
google-chrome	firefox
the reason it looks better in google-chrome is because google-chrome doesn t subscribe to cleartype on windows
ie and firefox both do use it to check this start - adjust cleartype text and toggle it on and off to see the difference

28089111
hmac	md5
according to this post a python snippet to recreate the convention used in web2py would be the following web2py uses hmac which is your secret + the plaintext of the user s password as the final hash and not just a straight md5 sha hash depending on your settings
so you would just need to swap out md5 for sha in the above example to get things working on your end

28089502
laravel	yii
as for me i started using repository in laravel but now i am using it in yii 1 2 too
it is not actually the problem to implement repository in yii

28092489
google-chrome	safari
sessionstate org.jboss.resteasy.spi.unhandledexception response is committed can t handle exception caused by java.io.ioexception broken pipe investigating it i come across something really interesting it was only able to reproduce it from safari browser not google-chrome
the point is that safari has a functionality google-chrome doesn t when safari auto-completes the request it sends the request

28092489
google-chrome	safari
the point is that safari has a functionality google-chrome doesn t when safari auto-completes the request it sends the request
google-chrome doesn t send the request until the enter button is pressed

28093916
google-chrome	firefox
this does not work in google-chrome however
tested ok using firefox or phantomjs for headless control

28096011
punctuation	words
if you want to strip punctuation before comparing then use rstrip
much easier split and either replace the words with the len of the words to replace or just keep the words os not needed you can simply use if you use str.replace as suggested in other answers partial matches will be replaced so also we explicitly pass a delimiter to split so when we rejoin we will keep the original string length intact

28097518
client-side	server-side
from your description you actually need several things not just some small sample client-side library for displaying static maps ex openstreetmap and dynamic data
server-side geospatial service to construct maps from your own shapefiles

28097864
multiplying	addition	multiplying	multiplication
you can multiplying the variable by 1 to force javascript to convert the variable to a number for you and then add it to your other value
this works because multiplication isn t overloaded as addition is

28099807
decimal	ieee
that is you are looking for the numerator in 3333 10000 but the internal representation is when converted to decimal 6004199023210345 18014398509481984 that denominator is 2 54 there s no bit hack that will extract data that isn t there in the first place
the sequence of bits representing the number 3333 is not found in the ieee 754 representation of 2.3333 nor 0.3333 because ieee 754 uses a binary exponent not decimal

28100853
virtualenv	conda
only python packages can be installed into a virtualenv because that s really the only thing that makes sense
conda environments are not python specific

28101564
aggregate-functions	sum
see the list of mysql aggregate-functions
to add up the numbers use sum not count

28109916
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
getbinarydata is a async function that returns the binary data of my image. i use a package called classcraft imagemagick since the graphicsmagick package does not give you as much metadata as imagemagick
i use imagemagick to get all kinds of metadata like exif from my images

28110306
super	implements
create your own state of the art console with super awesome colors and any kind of functionality you want
if not you could simply implements a class say outputwindow that takes messages in some way and shows them in the window

28110988
serializable	deserialization
to understand why shouldserializexxx doesn t help here you should understand that xmlserializer works as follows the first time you serializable a type the xmlserializer constructor internally writes run-time c# code to serializable and deserialize instances of the type and all referenced types using reflection then compiles the code and loads the resulting dll into memory
subsequently serialization and deserialization of class instances are performed by the previously created dynamic dll

28111986
queue	fifo
deduplication checks for messagededuplicationid as an attribute of the queue message and prevents duplicate messages from being both sent and received in the 5-minute deduplication interval following either action by checking the messagededuplicationid
if content-based deduplication is explicitly enabled on the fifo queue messagededuplicationid will be automatically generated using a sha-256 hash of the message body content only not attributes

28113138
super	extends
if you are running 2.2 you can use the new super_method method to examine this this shows that if you call cost you first go to the sugar module s implementation this shows that in sugar#cost you call super then you will jump in to the method provided by milk and finally when you call super from there you end up in the base class implementation
extends adds to the list of ancestors it doesn t replace any existing ancestors - if you examine coffee.singleton_class.ancestors after the second extends you can see that it includes both milk and sugar

28113999
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
string.equals is case sensitive but ef will translate that into sql which may not be case-sensitive depending on the collation of that column or your database if the column does not have a collation specified
you can solve this on the server side by setting the collation of that column to be case-sensitive alter table coaches alter column user_name varchar 20 or whatever the size of your username column is collate latin1_general_cs_as or on the client side by pulling back all records that match a case-insensitive search and then filtering in linq-to-objects so long as you don t have thousands of users with the same username in different casing you shouldn t have too big of an impact by filtering in linq-to-objects

28116414
realloc	malloc
not only realloc here you allocate space for just one pointer and then you try to store 2
if you need space for 2 pointers then the correct way is then you can fill the two elements after checking the return value of malloc so now realloc what if realloc returns null and you alread overwrite the head pointer now you can t do anything else with it so is much safer

28118170
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
this will give a stack trace as array of strings for modern google-chrome firefox opera and ie10+ usage console.log getstacktrace .join n
it excludes from the stack its own call as well as title error that is used by google-chrome and firefox but not ie

28119662
serializable	deserialization
if a field is not serializable it must be marked transient like this this way you won t get an exception
now it s either ok for you that this object will not be persisted and be null again after deserialization or you can do one of the following extend the geodatabasefeaturetable class and implement serializable there and use the extended class instead - note of course if the class is final this is not an option handle serializing that object right in your aggdbfeaturetable class by overriding the writeobject and readobject methods and accessing relevant info from inside your geodatabasefeaturetable object - note it may very well be that not everything you need will be accessible from the outside i hope this helps

28121482
ssl	https
an ssl certificate is issued for the domain name not the ip address
the issue with ip addresses stems from the details of the https protocol and namely just the issue of name resolution

28122838
lisp	scheme
note that lisp is not a single language but a large family of somewhat similar languages
you seem to have tried out scheme repl.it runs biwascheme and clojurescript

28122838
scheme	racket
quote 1 2 3 should be an error in scheme
for example racket another dialect of scheme does not accept them biwascheme is written in javascript and javascript simply ignores extra arguments to any function so the behavior probably comes from there

28123369
g++	gcc
g++ -wall -ddeepak factorial.cpp -o main
you should use g++ instead of gcc in the command because gcc doesn t link to the c++ stl by default and hence it gives an undefined reference to std ios_base

28124700
swift	objective-c
this attribute indicates that the protocol should be exposed to objective-c code and is described in using swift with cocoa and objective-c
even if you are not interoperating with objective-c you need to mark your protocols with the objective-c attribute if you want to be able to check for protocol conformance

28126319
dictionary	map
mainly for my own understanding and that of my beloved rubber duck suppose i have a fold sumlengths that adds the lengths of strings so yields 4 i want overmaps sumlengths to be a fold that takes say a french and a dutch dictionary and makes a new dictionary d such that lookup d bread is 9 length pain + length brood the problem of course is that some words may not occur in all dictionary lookup d sex is length sexe as we dutch are very prudish - so we need the begin value of our fold not only at the beginning of our fold but possibly at any moment
this means it won t do to just lift the step function to map k in that case we could use any instance of applicative instead of our map see below we have to take our begin value all along the way

28126572
boost	allocator
manual the manual approach that doesn t quite require the same amount of pointer trickery resource management could look like this live compiled on coliru notes it reuses code it doesn t do unnecessary dynamic allocator which makes the class much easier to get right for rule of three it uses a data_t struct to get rid of the manual offset calculations you can just do or it adds iterator and begin end definitions so that you can use the sharedmemarray directly as a range with algorithms like boost equal and boost_foreach for now it uses a statically known number of elements n
if you don t want this i d certainly opt for the approach that uses managed segments under 2. because that will take care of all the re allocator mechanics for you

28126946
build.gradle	gradlew
current version is 2.2.1. edit the build.gradle files and make the following change in both files change classpath com.android.tools.build gradlew 0.10.+ to this classpath com.android.tools.build gradlew 1.0.0 btw i know the error message said v1.10 but changing it to that gives another error could not find.. and 1.0.0 seems to work so yeah go figure.
then i select build - rebuild project from the menu and it gives another error error the sdk build tools revision 19.0.0 is too low for project android . minimum required is 19.1.0 clicking on the error message unhelpfully does nothing but i again edit the build.gradle files and change buildtoolsversion 19.0.0 to buildtoolsversion 19.1.0 in both files

28126946
build.gradle	gradlew
then i select build - rebuild project from the menu and it gives another error error the sdk build tools revision 19.0.0 is too low for project android . minimum required is 19.1.0 clicking on the error message unhelpfully does nothing but i again edit the build.gradle files and change buildtoolsversion 19.0.0 to buildtoolsversion 19.1.0 in both files
to sum up the changes see screenshot below then again select from the menu and it will give an error in the gradlew console error task not found in root project android . just ignore it and do again and then it will give an info dialog language level changes will take effect on project reload

28129124
build.gradle	gradlew
so if you have a project from version control that has build.gradle and kin but not the .iml and .idea files use import a non-android studio project
it will detect the existence of the gradlew build files and assume that you know what you are doing whether you really do know what you are doing is left as an exercise for the reader

28131675
persistent	transient
in the ideal case the serialized form for a class persistent throughout its entire evolution and so its uid need never change
it s important to make clear the fact that having a class implement the serializable interface makes all fields not declared transient part of the exported api of the class whether or not those fields are declared private

28131765
bash	zsh
when a login instance of bash starts it looks for .bash_profile .bash_login and .profile in that order and runs the first one it finds
but your app doesn t know which shell he uses so you d better create .profile so zsh and ksh will use it as well

28137934
html5lib	beautifulsoup
the html5lib parser will insert missing html elements where required like the and elements
you should not use the soupselect project with beautifulsoup 4

28137967
swift	objective-c
where objective-c has blocks swift has functions
so it s just a matter of knowing how to read objective-c block syntax - not easy i know that means this is a block taking an nsstring parameter and returning nothing . so you want to supply here a swift function that takes an nsstring parameter and returns nothing

28139600
awt	swing
android does not support the awt
neither does it support swing

prepare	execute
consider upgrading to pdo and prepare statements as a first line of defense
there are several possible reasons that your echo statement was not execute script failed to run ensure that your server can run php scripts and that this script runs

28142175
content-length	content-type
i did not set the content-length since this should be done automatically i used wireshark and could verify that the following request is going to baidu post http 1.1 accept application json content-type application json
content-length 20 host www.baidu.com connection keep-alive user-agent apache-httpclient 4.3.6 java 1.5 phone +8912345 this shows that the request is sent properly which means the client side seems to be fine

ienumerable	iqueryable
if it only supports ienumerable then the query is operated over an in-memory collection of objects
evidently dbsqlquery does not implement iqueryable

so here is a checklist for the row reordering make sure the delegate methods tableview canmoverowatindexpath and tableview moverowatindexpath toindexpath are implements make sure the tableview s editing property is set to yes if you have a custom uitableviewcell make sure you call super layoutsubviews if you override this method
in my case i have implements all the required uitableviewdelegate methods as mentioned in the apple document and in the answers here but still cannot see the reorder control

28149726
swift	objective-c
for example if your project is called myproject #import myproject-swift.h note that this is not the bridging header used to expose objective-c code to swift named
you have to import the swift bridge header file which has name

28155786
implements	extends
you could organize your class structure like this interface people interface student extends people interface employee extends people then your employing students could be class employingstudent implements student employee in case people is a class that cannot be changed you can do interface student interface employee class employingstudent implements student employee so the only difference would be that student and employee wouldn t extends people then
in java it is only possible to extends one superclass

28161272
google-chrome	safari
this isn t an issue with safari against the same page so this seems to suggests it s a recent google-chrome problem rather than being an issue with voiceover
as unobf mentions above safari is the standard browser to test voiceover against on ios

28162219
retrofit	okhttp
as greybeardedgeek says you can use retrofit + okhttp to implement this
and mypatchservice looks something like this your userupdate class could look like this if you do this the json that will be sent will look like this note that lastname is not serialized since it was never set - this is configurable through supplying a custom gson instance to retrofit the request response objects are plain java representations of the objects you send receive over the network

28162623
swift	objective-c
bottom line i would personally hesitate to draw any simple conclusions of swift is faster than objective-c or vice versa
i suspect that there are some algorithms applications where swift is faster and others where it is not

28163873
floating-point	fractions
conversions from a floating-point type to an integer type round toward zero
if you have a floating point value that is very close to 123...but not quite you ll lose all of that fractions value and end up with 122

28165591
equals	icomparable
basically you can define comparing sorting rules as you want - but delegate should take two arguments and return integer less than 0 if first argument less than second 0 if they are equals and integer greater than 0 otherwise
it is not necessary for class of the items in a list to implement icomparable

28171025
backtracking	greedy
given an atom a with a greedy quantifier the number of repetition doesn t really matter here the greedy quantifier will try to match as many a as possible then try the sequel whatever comes after on failure backtracking one repetition at a time and retry with the sequel
the problem is where to backtracking to

28174508
noexcept	throw
however if moving is noexcept then the whole moving-in-a-loop cannot throw and is safe to use to implement the strong exception guarantee
implementing move construction with the noexcept guarantee seems to be a trivial thing for std vector

28178803
xrange	enumerate
when the first number is found that is not in the set it is yielded by next timing for randomized and the sought-after number is 8 timing for ordered and the first free is 100001 note that this is python 3 and range is the py2 xrange use heapq the asymptotically good answer heapq with enumerate now the one above could be the preferred solution if written in c but heapq is written in python and most probably slower than many other alternatives that mainly use c code
just sort and enumerate to find the first not matching or the simple answer with good constants for o n lg n this might be fastest of all if the list is almost sorted because of how the python timsort works but for randomized the set-difference and iterating the first not in set are faster

28179333
setinterval	settimeout
for example timers countdowns are not done with settimeout they are done with setinterval to ensure it does not delay and the code runs at the exact given interval
to look at it a bit differently setinterval insures that a code is run at every given interval 1000ms or how much you specify while settimeout sets the time that it waits until it runs the code

28180045
octal	binary
the first one is a normal decimal number 1010 and the second one is a octal number because of the prefix 0 so in decimal the second number was 9 so what happened is first number second number - decimal- binary and your calculation
you forgot the prefix 0b so this should work for you output 163 in your examle the binary numbers aren t binary numbers

28180461
accelerometer	gyroscope
your point on accelerometer using battery
while each device is different regarding power consumption and this device doesn t use close to what the gyroscope does it will show a marked difference if used non-stop on a full day of active screen use

28189815
cube	skybox
so there is no need to draw a cube with side length of 512
the problem seems to be that the skybox is not located inside of the visible area

28190424
serializable	deserialization
class a a int extends serializable case class c extends a 1
class a a int case class c extends a 1 like cmbaxter s answer points out this pattern where the superclass of the case class does not have a no-arg constructor leads to invalidclassexception on deserialization

28191686
getchar	fgetc
so it doesn t matter how you write the for-loop what is important is to call getchar once per iteration for example this could work or this note that is called the ternary operator and is equivalent to
you are calling getchar twice try this instead getchar which is equivalent to fgetc stdin reads a character from the input stream stdin once you read that character you have to process it because it s removed from the stream so calling the function twice will remove two characters from stdin and hence your count will be wrong

28194371
imperative	declarative
even in those case if you follow the mindset of imperative programming like the one i pointed out there should not be a problem
therefore the problem you pointed could be a problem but actually not a big problem compared to the advantages that we gain from declarative markups

28196968
g++	gcc
so i commented this path in .bash_profile now gives usr bin g++ and its version indicates that it is from xcode and there is no ld library not found for -lgcc_ext.10.5 error
i had the same problem on os x 10.8 with both current xcode and gcc installed by homebrew

28197814
xjc	maven-jaxb2-plugin
i have debugged java.util.serviceloader and it turned out that plugins should be passed as argument to xjc not to classpath of java
actually all maven plugins like jaxb2-maven-plugin or maven-jaxb2-plugin know about this feature and form xjc argments correctly

28198590
build.gradle	gradlew
just copy this in your app module s build.gradle inside dependencies closure sync your project with gradlew
dont follow the above tutorial the shown approach is useful when the library has not published as maven or gradlew dependency.but as github page say it is published on maven

28199083
viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidload	viewwillappear
- void viewdidload all objects are instantiated but geometry frames etc is not yet setup correctly
- void viewwillappear bool animated geometry is now correct view hierarchy is ready for display here transition animations are run as appropriate - void viewdidappear bool animated animations complete

28201054
swift	objective-c
so to convert your array to an array of float s you can do something like this is where swift can confuse when you get to objective-c because this is all done implicitly i believe
in objective-c you cannot add simple c types to nsmutablearray s nsmutablearray can only contain objective-c objects

28202142
inline	inlining
so because you don t know at compile time which function will be called you cannot inline the call
if you run the code with trace inlining flag however if you change anything so that either .fn is always the same function or foo and bar have different hidden class i did this by doing before the bar.fn -assignment but there are a ton of different ways to achieve it such as constructors and prototypes which you surely know are the way to go for high performance javascript to see what changed between versions run this code as you can see the results differs between node10 and iojs i haven t followed development of v8 in details recently so i couldn t point the exact reason but these kinds of heuristics change all the time in general

28204120
dictionary	map
this method returns the array of dictionary satisfying that condition
the second step uses the map method to transform each dictionary into the value corresponding to the favorite drink key - taking into account that a dictionary lookup always returns an optional to account for missing key and that the filter has already excluded all dictionary not having a value for that key it s safe to apply the forced unwrapping operator

28205122
fgets	fread	fgets	getline
on the bright side that makes the scan quadratically faster but computing the wrong result more rapidly is not really a win. you cannot use fgets to read binary files because the fgets interface doesn t tell you how much it read
you can use the posix 2008 getline interface instead or you can do binary input with fread which is more efficient but will force you to count newlines yourself

28208904
sudo	passwd
for exampe sudo chmod 644 etc passwd if you don t have sudo access then you ll have to speak to your systems administrator about changing the permissions of the file
if that s not permitted by your company s security policy you can be granted sudo access to read the file with something like this level of sudo access is quite restrictive as it only allows you to cat that one file

28212065
bower	npm
if you really need the most recent version of prettyjson you could use npm for this specific dependency or ask the developer to update it s bower repository
you cannot instruct bower to do this

28218011
bash	zsh
and at least this solution will work only on zsh and there only on new versions while the original would run unaltered on bash
in very new versions of zsh works for 5.0.7 but not 5.0.5 you could do this matches files with name that are readable r and regular

28218206
icomparable	compareto
that s a design flaw imo but never mind... the way to fix this is to use generics or even better use the generic form of icomparable that way you ll avoid boxing when you call compareto .
although an int is an icomparable an isn t an

28221768
centos	linux
i tested this on puppet 3.6.2 on centos 6.4 explanations the sha tag is here to specify to crypt the hash method we want 6 is the type of hash for sha-512 1 - md5 2a - blowfish not in mainline glibc
added in some linux distributions 5 - sha-256 since glibc 2.7 6 - sha-512 since glibc 2.7 thx davey and wiki_crypt sys.stdout.write is here to avoid n of print os.urandom 16 create a 16 bits long binary string base64.b64encode encode this string in base64 take the first 8 characters of this string as base64 encoding length may vary generate is a puppet function that create text when on the puppet master

28222772
multiplying	addition
they may affect whether the multiplication gets performed before or after d gets called but only in very rare circumstances d calling a java native interface which alters the numerical rounding mode used in multiplication in a way java doesn t know about would code have any way of knowing or caring whether the multiplying was performed before or after d
otherwise what s important is that in the first case one addition operations will act upon a and b and the other upon c and d

28224475
serializable	deserialization
another approach if you do not own the source code of the myclass class you can not modify it is to create a custom serializable as described in the jackson docs
there are multiple java libraries available for serialization deserialization

28226221
setinterval	settimeout
setinterval is not the same as settimeout
setinterval will run a piece or block of code periodically in a given interval while settimeout will run it only once or rather each time appviewmodel is invoked

28226363
setinterval	settimeout
the first is that based on your description of the issue it sounds like you might want setinterval and not settimeout
the difference is that setinterval will continuously execute based on a certain interval of time whereas settimeout will only execute once after the time has elapsed

28226363
setinterval	settimeout
the difference is that setinterval will continuously execute based on a certain interval of time whereas settimeout will only execute once after the time has elapsed
the second issue is that as others have mentioned is that the first call to self.refreshservers does need the parenthesis in order to execute the first call and the reference inside setinterval should not have parenthesis

28226814
uiview	caanimation
as it turns out changes to layer properties are not caught by the animation methods on uiview like animatewithduration
so they have to be added to the layer using caanimation

28228015
noexcept	throw
internally the implementation likely uses std move_if_noexcept which despite the name is really move if noexcept or if noncopyable
the strong exception safety guarantee is not provided for noncopyable elements that have a throw move constructor

28228732
fseek	fgetc
so the fseek should not be necessary
but if you look at the result of the fgetc the old value always seems to be reading the pixel at 54

28230864
openmpi	mpich
mpifort is the generic fortran compiler wrapper in openmpi and it seems that it picks module files from mpich thus the error when compiling the code with use mpi
your mpirun definitely comes from mpich and it cannot properly launch openmpi executables

28230864
openmpi	mpich
your mpirun definitely comes from mpich and it cannot properly launch openmpi executables
the same is true for orterun that comes from openmpi and it cannot properly launch mpich executables

28233845
hex	binary
in order to safely convert arbitrary binary data into text you should use something like hex or base64
encodings such as utf-8 are meant to encode arbitrary text data as bytes not to encode arbitrary binary data as text

28234479
fgets	strtol
read a line via fgets is a great first step
2 methods strtol better error handling and sscanf sscanf only ever parses the first number in the string. is not quite so

28236115
opcache	apc
the opcache built into recent php versions doesn t provide apc-like user storage - it s just for the bytecode caching
you can install apcu to use the apc cache driver but otherwise you ll want to select a different cache mechanism

28238670
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome has long been an exception. a sorting function should have certain behavior
it should accept two values and return a negative number if the first value is less than the second a positive number if the first value is greater than the second zero if the two values are equal this sorting function does not actually do that so even in a stable-sorting environment such as firefox it can return a somewhat surprising result

28238930
implements	extends
the plug-in is very simple and similar things are not hard to implements
if you wish to make something similar yourself or perhaps extends the automated build failure analyzer plug-in to fit your needs the jenkins plugin tutorial and extends jenkins pages are a good starting point for jenkins plug-in development

28238981
super	extends
there is a working plunker let s have a translation.json like this now let s introduce the super parent state root this super root state is not having any url not effecting any child url
now we will silently inject that into every state as we can see we use setting parent - and do not effect extends the original state name

28240233
gradle	ivy
gradle will then check for updates every 24 hours but this can be configured using the resolutionstrategy dsl
from the gradle forums at since snapshots are a maven concept they aren t treated as anything special in an ivy repository

28240586
build.gradle	gradlew
that twowayview-master build.gradle file isn t a buildscript for a standalone module
it lacks any sort of apply plugin statement that would tell gradlew how it should compile something

28245393
setinterval	settimeout
this works because settimeout will insert it s callback into the callback queue 1 second later thus after the setinterval callback that changed the value to bar
obviously when dealing with ajax using a settimeout to fix this isn t going to be consistent due to differences in network speed

28247245
addition	multiplication
the point is that the underlying breeze vectors have all of the linear algebra manipulations you would expect - including of course basic element wise addition that you specifically mentioned
some of them are already exposed sum of squares however the selection of such available methods is limited - and in fact does not include the basic operations including element wise addition subtraction multiplication etc

28248166
google-chrome	firefox
not only does it not have live editing even basic handling of callbacks can be problematic at the moment and there are many reports of bugs google-chrome has devtools bugs too but are not usually as noticeable
the firefox devtools are actually in standard firefox too

28249053
ssl	https
ssl the s in https does not generally place any restrictions on how your ips work
the ssl certificates are often issued to domains and or hostnames

28251669
daemons	systemd
people also gets confused with the recommendation to store users credential using a salt hash algorithm with the need to store credentials for a daemons to access services like database servers or message brokers
i always see the naïve solution to encrypt credentials with the password for the key being stored in plain text anywhere else in the software which will only cause problems for systemd administrator but not for an invasor

28253043
spaces	delimiter
for example does not use the skip parser so it will match integers delimiter by exactly one spaces
if you want to allow the integers to be delimiter by more than one spaces for indentation purposes or so and depending on the way you want to handle tabs and other non-newline whitespace you can use a more complex delimiter

28254751
realloc	strdup
the pointers returned by strdup will be stored in an array of managed via realloc
if you re not on a sufficiently posix-ish platform then you ll need to use fgets with checking to find whether you actually read a whole line using realloc to allocate more space if your initial line isn t long enough

28255499
equals	gethashcode
gethashcode is not and cannot be collision free which is why the equals method is required in the first place
the problem is within your gethashcode method change it to in your current code equals is not called as the current gethashcode returns two different integers so no point in calling equals

28255499
equals	gethashcode
the problem is within your gethashcode method change it to in your current code equals is not called as the current gethashcode returns two different integers so no point in calling equals
if gethashcode of the first object is different than the second the objects are not equal if the result is the same equals is being called

28255499
equals	gethashcode
if gethashcode of the first object is different than the second the objects are not equals if the result is the same equals is being called
for more details on how to implement gethashcode

28257108
punctuation	words
w can be used to match words characters so that punctuation is removed from the results outputs i want to walk my dog and why not see java api documentation for pattern
a regex can also be used to split words

28257133
svg	vml
unfortunately cufon was designed for the old ie vml language not svg so you would need to add an extra conversion or use raphael to convert to svg path data
for working with svg it might be just as easy to use a general font-converter tool to convert to svg fonts then extract the glyph data and transform it to the correct size and to flip the y-axis

28261400
swift	objective-c
but swift is smart enough to recognise that the array should be immutable from outside myclass so this achieves a very similar effect to the old objective-c paradigm of maintaining a private nsmutablearray and exposing a public readonly nsarray that creates an immutable copy of the private array when called
in actual fact swift is really smart with passing by value and may not even make a copy of the array until the point it is modified and even then may only keep track of the changes internally

28263205
jar	war
to have you sources jar file copied using the aforementioned configuration you have to tell maven to generate project sources which is not done by default
this can be seamlessly done using the maven-sources-plugin using a necessary trick by mentioning a maven in which sources will be generated that must come before the package phase default phase for the maven-war-plugin the prepare-package phase otherwise you won t get those sources included in your war file

28264242
comparator	comparable
otherwise use the comparator returned by collator.getinstance on the results from calling tostring on the objects
the third and fifth rule are the cause of your issue you are returning number.class which does not implement comparable

28264446
dns	spf
check this line in the header i think you have not correctly configured the spf entries in your dns
see this google products thread about this i can see that you have no spf entries defined for racebooking.net you need to define an spf entry like you also need to include any other host from which you might be sending email ie web applications sending email from racebooking.net

28267201
backgrounding	multitasking
you can detect that the mediaplayer lost focus and start backgrounding playback when the page is being navigated from
however this will not cover the case of the user multitasking away from your application or the case of the screen being turned off

28267793
pickle	dill
dill has pickle debugging tools in dill.detect
i can t see what object you d like to debug as your code above is not due to pickle but i can show an example below regardless

28273482
persistent	transient
in your example you ve been using assigned identifier doesn t changes when you persistent your entity
the problem arises when you use a generated identifier identity sequence because the transient entity state will have a null id while the persisted entity state will have a not-null id and that happens over the lifetime of the same object reference and the equals hashcode requirements demand that these checks don t yield different results without explicitly changing the object state

28275428
multiplying	multiplication
step by step starting from this dataframe we can first do the part with the product method multiplying over axis 1 but only for the second level and then we can just group by dates and no grouping by port needed anymore and take the sum this gives the same output as
you indeed do not need to unstack to get what you want using the product method to do the multiplication you want

28276493
ioexception	bufferedwriter
both outputstreamwriter and bufferedwriter don t throw ioexception in their constructors so it not clear what problem they would cause
in the case of bufferedwriter you could get an outofmemoryerror

28279114
aggregate-functions	sum
and since there are no aggregate-functions in your having clause these predicates can be in the where clause
couldn t you just write since there are no aggregate-functions sum

28279651
google-chrome	firefox
seems that google-chrome doesn t display the pdf titles at all. i tested the link in your comment biblioteca.org.ar and it displays in firefox as - 211756.pdf seems there s an empty title and firefox then just displays the filename instead of the full url path
i reproduced the same behaviour using this piece of code opening it in firefox yields the needed result i found out about settitle in reportlab s user guide

28283414
fseek	fread
in particular it is not possible to fseek fsetpos within such a construct because its length is not known a priori
some functions like fopen getc fread etc will work though

28283634
avr	microcontroller
it has only primitive timer and video generation peripherals anything else is done in software the processors take four cycles per instruction compared to the avr s typical one or two and you could just as easily have gotten a cortex m4f based microcontroller which do have floating point
for the topical question no it is not necessarily bad to use global variables in a microcontroller

28283863
linefeed	delimiter
the command that is adding the linefeed linefeed is not the read command but the echo command
read does not return the line with the delimiter still attached to it

28283901
ienumerable	icollection
that means that whether the ienumerable or iqueryable version of the method is called is determined at compile-time not at run-time
even if appcontext.user is an iqueryable at run-time it doesn t matter since it s declared as an icollection at compile-time which impelments ienumerable the ienumerable extension method will be called

28285068
comparator	comparable
if you don t supply a comparator to the treeset then it will rely on its elements being comparable to sort them
if they re not comparable then a classcastexception will result

28285068
comparator	comparable
the elements are ordered using their natural ordering or by a comparator provided at set creation time depending on which constructor is used
but the hashmap class is not comparable so you must supply a custom comparator so the treeset knows how you want to sort them

28285068
comparator	comparable
but the hashmap class is not comparable so you must supply a custom comparator so the treeset knows how you want to sort them
you cannot sort your hashmap s without a comparator whether they re in a treeset or any other collection

28289694
spaces	delimiter
the last 7 columns should never contain spaces so those were explicitly assigned in the that was created
of the few items from that that we not assigned we created a spaces delimiter string

28300145
implements	extends
implements this method is not difficult
just extends simplejparepository class from spring data jpa and implement the method yourself

28301127
hex	binary
it s not too hard to write a program that reads in an ascii file that looks like hex pairs but then converts it to a true binary file with the corresponding bit patterns
that is it takes a file that looks like 63 a0 de and converts this ascii file to a binary file that begins 0110 0011 which is 63 in binary

28302759
kerberos	ntlm
kerberos cannot however replace ntlm in all scenarios principally those where a client needs to authenticate to systems that are not joined to a domain a home network perhaps being the most common of these
the negotiate security package allows a backwards-compatible compromise that uses kerberos whenever possible and only reverts to ntlm when there is no other option

28305437
client-side	server-side
no need to do it from client-side
i would do it on server-side check if at least one client is up if not then shutdown basically a one-liner create a scheduled task on the server that runs this script - let s say all 5 minutes

28305738
google-chrome	safari
you will be only able to see it working on google-chrome fireforx or other browsers with webm support
the only solution for you could be the httpgetendpoint providing media in mp4 format or any other format supported by ie and safari but creating the live stream in that format is very tricky and we the kurento team did not had the time for implementing that and this feature is not in our short term roadmap

28307941
coalesce	nvl
sample table and data execute with different predicates get execution plans bad plans for coalesce and is null or good plan for nvl the filter operations allow the optimizer to choose a different plan at run time depending on the input values
warnings filter operations and this nvl trick are not well documented

28310234
viewmodel	caliburn
my editprocessor interface and viewmodel look like this stripped down from all not so interesting stuff
i m using caliburn micro for the viewmodel-view binding

28310316
swift	objective-c
as string i hope that in the next update to swift all of that can be reduced to what we had in objective-c
in objective-c we could write as several here have discovered the above does not apply in swift at least it never has for me

28310316
swift	objective-c
in objective-c we could write as several here have discovered the above does not apply in swift at least it never has for me
here s how you do this in swift for accessing three indices in an nsdictionary for a string let cityname mydictionary

28313333
lxml	beautifulsoup
i am afraid you are dealing with a non well-formed and broken html which scrapy and underlying lxml is not able to parse reliably
for instance see this unclosed div inside the li tag i d switch to parsing the html manually with beautifulsoup

28313386
google-chrome	firefox
in this particular case though the limit isn t in your gpu it s in google-chrome
the proof is that it works in firefox

28313972
scikit-learn	libsvm
these probability estimates are not trustworthy and if i remember correctly the ability to compute probability estimates was removed from the scikit-learn library a few releases ago for this reason
still if you insist on using svm look at a practical guide to support vector classification from libsvm

28314195
swift	objective-c
this is also described in the section using swift from objective-c in the apple docs note that xcode will give a warning in the objective-c header file when you use the forward declared protocol cannot find protocol definition for analyticprotocol but this is can be ignored - the implementation will be found at compile time
it is not possible to import the xcode generated swift header in objective-c header files

28314195
swift	objective-c
it is not possible to import the xcode generated swift header in objective-c header files
so since you want to use swift code in an objective-c header file you will need to forward declare the classes and protocols you want to use in the objective-c header file like this protocol analyticprotocol

28318670
opencart	magento
opencart -- code has almost no comments no use of namespaces limited psr compliance no api documentation
magento 1 had the limitation of no namespaces because it relied on zend framework 1 which was pre-namespace but magento 2.0 has namespace support while not throwing the baby out with the bathwater zend 1 classes have been kept and wrapped in namespaced classes

28322781
google-chrome	safari
this is because google-chrome will fire on both the webkittransitionend and transitionend events as mentioned by the previous answer
however removing webkittransitionend will result in the callback not firing in safari

28323988
opencart	magento
i don t like magento opencart and that s why 5 years ago i chose prestashop for ecommerce developement
magento has unnecessarily complex class tree and of course the developers charge usually a lot more because they have a lot of work and opencart is a way below the others - having not a single comment in the code is a just not professional no indexes at all on the database tables it does not even uses template engine

28324374
google-chrome	firefox
left firefox 35 right google-chrome 40 firefox hides the div if it s empty and google-chrome let the user edit it by adjusting his height to one line
when you click the new paragraph button both browsers add two in the and the result will be the same this is because google-chrome removes the default style it applied before to the empty contenteditable div since it s not empty anymore

28325259
super	implements
resourcehandler is super basic and isn t meant for advanced concepts like gzip caching resume partial range request etc.
you cannot use jetty handlers with gzip compression that s only implements as part of the servlet layer

28326354
express	node.js
if you re using express use the static middleware to tell it to serve that directory
node.js web servers do not serve directories unless you explicitly tell them to

google-chrome	firefox
apparently google-chrome ignores attempts to redefine style property which is supposed to be an object cssstyledeclaration object not a string
in this sense firefox behavior seems inconsistent

28327659
daemons	systemd
sighup as a notification about terminal closing event doesn t make sense for a daemons because daemons are detached from their terminal
so the systemd will never send this signal to them. then it is common practice for daemons to use it for another meaning typically reloading the daemons s configuration. this is not a rule just kind of a convention

28328312
junit	testng
junit is not much flexible for these
i prefer testng over junit

28328717
selecteditem	selectedindex
i have seen a loss of focus cause such a combobox to generate a selecteditem changed event and the new value is not the object originally added to combobox.getitems but a string representation of the original object
it seems that selectedindex can be used to work around this

28329399
viewdidload	viewdidappear
by the time you hit viewdidload the constraints engine has not yet been applied and the starting location of the views has not yet been established
so feel free to add the original constraints in viewdidload but you will want to defer the animatewithduration until later in the process viewdidappear

28330442
set	bag
if you need to be able to add remove or count the items in a set then use a collection if you care about a sort order and need the order to be correct then use a list in chart form the and in system.collections.generic are two classes that implement these interfaces
but they aren t the only classes is an ordered bag of objects is a bag where you are not allowed to access items by index icollection

28331346
listview	gridview
and the second one looks more straightforward to use in my opinion second thing dinamically adding new rows and columns is not a good idea you d have to update all the column and row indexes of all your images every time you add a new row column delete an item from your collection. try using a listview bind the source to an observable collection and use an horizontal wrapgrid inside the listview. then simply create your own datatemplate with an image bind its source to each element of your observablecollection and you re up you ll be able to add new images without worrying about the layout and the grid indexes
edit this is the general idea in xaml or as rob caplan said you can use a gridview the end result is almost the same

28331574
multiplying	multiplication
so multiplying by the float 0.1 is not quite the same as dividing by 10
it gives a different result as you observe of course neither result here is exactly 1.4 it s just that the multiplication by the float 0.1 has a slightly greater margin of error than dividing by the integer 10

28332154
vim	emacs
of course given that emacs comes with a vim compatibility package called evil mode it might not be as bad as it seems.
you could use e2ansi a package that use emacs in batch mode to perform syntax highlighting

28333346
macports	homebrew
if you used something other than homebrew yes some of us actually did it weird like macports your could be funky
binaries may be located in other areas opt local bin grunt and possibly opt local bin npm additionally if you use macports to install npm then subsequently install bower the binary will not be located where you d expect

28334584
build.gradle	gradlew
go into the module s build.gradle file and change apply plugin com.android.library to apply plugin com.android.application you may also have to add an applicationid under android.defaultconfig
note that if you have other modules that depend on this library those dependencies will break if you convert the library to an application in android gradlew you re only allowed to depend on library modules not application modules

28336506
innodb	myisam
check out the comparison here or just google myisam vs innodb 129 000 hits
with the innodb storage engine the default reads are non-blocking - so two selects cannot block each other

28339931
sse	avx
this combines two tests into one but keeps the quick out for the second two tests currently compiling using the 128 bit sse instructions this is faster than all s but using the 256 bit avx2 setting was slower even with all s
however if you set up your program to test lots of points in an array you can get it to fully vectorize and the a dramatic performance improvement still with sse not avx or avx2

28347120
pdcurses	ncurses
something similar for windows is implemented in pdcurses
you can have a look on ncurses library which could help you but i m not sure about windows support in it

28347742
portrait	landscape
according to the mdn docs orientation value landscape | portrait media visual accepts min max prefixes no indicates whether the viewport is in landscape the display is wider than it is tall or portrait the display is taller than it is wide mode
example to apply a style sheet only in portrait orientation note this value does not correspond to actual device orientation

28352004
rational-numbers	fractions
you have to convert the input to rational-numbers first
this is not as easy as it sounds because decimal fractions like 0.7 cannot be represented exactly as a binary floating point number and would be stored as something like 0.69999999999999996 in a double . so it is not completely obvious how to get from there to 7 10

28358865
client-side	server-side
as mason commented you can use localstorage of the browser to store the data on the client-side in case the internet connection is not available
there is no way you can tackle this problem in c# because it runs on the server and if the connection goes off any data from the client would not reach to the server and hence no server-side code will be executed

28360399
textview	imageview
in general i only seldom use buttons but tend to make other views textview imageview .
clickable instead in case you need some kind of indication on whether or not the textview was pressed you can add a selector as a background. for this have a look here

28362902
pascal	delphi
so i would write it like this i suspect that you are actually compiling for x86 because the delphi x64 compiler does not support mixing pascal and asm as you do in the question
so as i understand things the code in the question does not compile under the delphi x64 compiler

28366632
swift	objective-c
this post explains how to call swift from objective-c don t forget to set your target build to ios 7.0 as a lower sdk does not support swift
it is possible to use swift in combination with unity

28367744
punctuation	words
this removes whitespace punctuation and other non-word stuff
to make a list of words from a string where words is a sequence of latin letters split by a regular expression which means not a letter

28371465
decimal	ieee
from the decimal.py source code and from the special values section you say you read an attempt to compare two decimal using any of the or operators will raise the invalidoperation signal if either operand is a nan and return false if this signal is not trapped
note that ieee 754 uses nan as a floating point exception value

28371465
decimal	ieee
moreover the special values section mentions note that the general decimal arithmetic specification does not specify the behavior of direct comparisons
these rules for comparisons involving a nan were taken from the ieee 854 standard see table 3 in section 5.7

28371853
build.gradle	gradlew
if you re developing a library there isn t really a top-level build.gradle that top level applies to all modules in a multimodule project but a library is best implemented as a standalone single module
probably the best practice would be to have a single build.gradle file for your library module and include a buildscript block in it with the repository and android plugin gradlew version

28371853
build.gradle	gradlew
probably the best practice would be to have a single build.gradle file for your library module and include a buildscript block in it with the repository and android plugin gradlew version
that way it stands alone better and it s not implicitly dependent on being in a project that has a top-level build.gradle file

28371853
build.gradle	gradlew
there s a huge caveat which kind of renders a lot of this moot however -- if you include this module with its own buildscript block in a project that has a top-level build.gradle with a competing buildscript block the top-level build file will win and it will ignore the block in your module
this probably isn t much of a problem but if your module relied on a specific version of the android gradlew plugin for example and it was in a project that used a different version of the plugin then your module would lose and it could run into problems

28372452
swift	objective-c
if you create a subclass of this class in swift you will not have access to super.init
if you create your subclass in objective-c code without implementing your own you will be able to construct your subclass with

28374095
gruntjs	package.json
try to add the following there to get gruntjs working source
openshift needs gruntjs separately added to package.json it does not contain it out of box

28374416
direct3d	directx
if you are writing a win32 desktop application and or have windows 7 consider downloading and installing this template direct3d win32 game visual studio template also i highly recommend using vs 2013 community rather than vs 2013 express for windows desktop if you fit the quite generous license requirements--if not buy vs 2013 pro
the directx templates provided by visual studio are for windows store windows phone or universal apps

28376134
dictionary	map
for each letter construct a bit map of the locations in the dictionary of the words containing that letter
each bit map will be long but there will not be many

28376677
dictionary	map
then i send this list to the client as a dictionary from string to bool always true
the client simply checks to see if the server contains a map tile before making the request so the server doesn t have to worry about what to return i left it as returning a 204 error if an invalid request is made

28383849
prepare	execute
mysqli does not support named parameters so you stmt is not compiling and mysqli prepare is returning false
additionally mysqli does not support passing the param to be bound through mysqli_stmt execute so even if you switch to positional placeholders your execute will fail

28386697
ciimage	uiimage
you cannot call uiimage ciimage and use that uiimage as the image of a uiimageview
uiimageview requires a uiimage backed by a bitmap cgimage

28387391
equals	compareto
you get two bigdecimal that are not equals according to equals because they don t have the same scale
value-wise they are equals though which is why compareto will see them as equals

28388805
google-chrome	firefox
firefox has never had a standards-complaint promise implementation that uses microtasks whereas google-chrome bluebird and others correctly use microtasks
you can see this in how a microtask which executes sooner than a macrotask but still async falls inside the transaction boundary whereas a macrotask from firefox s promises does not

28393501
dns	spf
the remote e-mail server may use greylisting dns blacklists validate spf records or validate the sending domain e-mail address
depending on the remote e-mail-servers setup spf validation fails the server may even reject your e-mail completely so it does not appear the spam folder of the e-mail recpient

28398874
implements	extends
regarding making your enum implements an interface vs extends template methods for every enum value i d stick to the template methods since as you said there won t be any other enum or class implements those methods
implements an interface would make sense if you had many enums or classes that need to fulfill a contract but this doesn t seem to be the case

28399600
bash	tcsh
unlike in most linuxes bash is not the default shell in freebsd
rather tcsh is the default

28400254
bower	npm
note do not require this via bower etc use 6to5 polyfill
you have to include the browser-polyfill.js file available from the browser-polyfill.js file within the 6to5 directory of an npm release

28401909
cdr	cons
4 note that scheme tries to use the simplified list notation as long as it can it only falls back to explicitly dotting things once it reaches a pair which doesn t have a pair or the empty list as its cdr element
therefore in your original example the second element of that cons pair is a pair so scheme uses the list notation

28403907
ssl	https
so having or not a installed ssl is not the problem
looks like you need to keep a very hard attention to your cloudflare layer in order to get redirected to https protocol

28404625
octal	decimal
in ruby to get the octal string use fixnum#to_s
correction in c character constant is j not j string literal in c character constants are of type int there is no difference between 106 decimal integer 152 character constant in octal and j character constant

28404937
tcpreplay	wireshark
tcpreplay is treating any maximum packet length 65535 as not trying to capture the entire packet but warning about for example 65534 is a bit silly
tcpdump and wireshark recently boosted the limit to 262144 to handle some usb captures

28404975
jax-ws	jax-rs
dr jax-ws is meant for xml based web services such as soap
jax-rs does not have the same restriction

28404975
jax-ws	jax-rs
more info the jax-rs api only provides code-first approaches whereas jax-ws allows for both code-first generally not recommended and contract-first using wsdl files more commonly recommended
jax-rs 2.0 introduces the client api which is a smart wrapper for httpurlconnection that has a lot more mapping capability jax-ws is also a wrapper but the data it deals with in the reference implementations is just xml

28405870
erlang	elixir
firstly you tokenize the input then you create the abstract syntax tree last step is to evaluate it with in the last step erlang can see that there are undefined variables and raise an exception
in elixir most language features are implemented as macros so the last step is not taken during function definition but when it is called

28405917
spaces	delimiter
other no-break characters non-breaking hyphen u+2011 figure spaces u+2007 narrow no-break spaces u+202f tibetan mark delimiter tsheg bstar u+0f0c w3c recommends using the word-joiner whenever you need to connect two characters or words so that they do not wrap
1 to get the same functionality formerly provided through the zero-width non-breaking spaces authors should use a word joiner u+2060 instead however no-where in the html4 character reference is word-joiner mentioned

28407008
draggable	droppable
if the draggable has been accepted once it will be refused by all other droppable could be done with the droppable accept parameter too like accept not .dropped and the class added to ui.draggable
just set a css class on ui.helper of draggable

28414458
.htaccess	httpd.conf
it ll give you some understanding of what the .htaccess exactly does and does not and how it is related or unrelated to any scripts
the file with filename .htaccess is an extension to the webserver configuration most commonly httpd.conf that is loaded automatically by apache when a file or script is loaded or executed in the directory or any child-directories where the .htaccess is placed

28415813
namedtuple	dictionary
to define that structure in a namedtuple you will instead have to have an attribute that is itself a tuple you can retrieve the value stored against the key exactly as you can for any other either with the original namedtuple or a new one
the issue here is with your namedtuple definition not the dictionary key structure itself which will work just fine when the namedtuple reads the field_names parameter it thinks you re trying to create a field named integer2 and doesn t realise that you mean it to be a nested tuple

28416430
nexus	artifactory
disclaimer i am the author of repository management with nexus and nexus trainer for sonatype the sponsor of the free central repository the project lead of the android maven plugin and have pushed some android libraries to central by rebuilding from aosp
no matter what the default is in the build.gradle file - in a team based development effort you should really use a repository manager like sonatype nexus or jfrog artifactory and not reference those upstream repositories directly

28417893
profiling	debugging
anyway here is the full command line that it s working for me now xcodebuild -exportarchive -archivepath myarchive.xcarchive -exportpath myapp.ipa -exportformat ipa -exportprovisioningprofile provisioning profiling full name note am running this command after copying the archive in a folder desktop then change the terminal location to that folder cd dekstop and then run the command also don t forget to change the provisioning profiling based on your archive build configuration release or debugging you can change that from the scheme setting to either make a debugging or a release build
it turns out that i was using the wrong commands to be specific this part here is wrong the correct one is this -exportprovisioningprofile provisioning profiling full name provisioning profiling full name is the same name that appear in xcode not the udid i don t know why many people suggested that also there is no need to specify the signing identity

28420676
client-side	server-side
it s a bit tougher to reliably parse this in cold fusion without the possibility of accidentally adding it twice without invoking a tool like jsoup but the jquery version is client-side and works by obtaining data from the dom rather than trying to hot-wire into it a jsoup implementation works similarly creating a dom-like structure you can work with
when talking about client-side vs server-side you have to consider the mythical user who doesn t have javascript enabled or who turns it off with malicious intent

28420974
swift	objective-c
the hybrid nature of such properties isn t a good fit for swift
xcode 7 swift 2 beta xcode 7 adds support for annotating generic types in objective-c

28424641
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
it has been supported by old opera a while google-chrome or was it ff.
can t remember just recently started to support it and firefox or google-chrome ie will support it later it will just be ignored if not supported so there s no harm providing it

28425467
sudo	passwd
if you have access to that users account your ssh key is accepted you can simply define the user per task through remote_user if you do not have access you can use the sudo flag to execute a task with root permissions
but make sure you set the permissions correctly or the user might not be able to read write those files also you can define the username as which the sudo command is executed with sudo_user if sudo requires a passwd from you you have to provide it or the task will hang forever without any error message

28427259
rsa	aes
rsa is quite slow so it s not really suitable for encrypting decrypting large blocks of data
it s normally used to encrypt decrypt the keys of a faster symmetrical cypher eg aes

28429984
rsa	dsa
if the signature algorithm is based on rsa you can retrieve the document digest value by decoding the value using the signer s public key from his certificate and extracting the digest from the decoded digestinfo object
if the signature algorithm is based on dsa or ec dsa you cannot retrieve the digest value at all

28433355
bower	npm
now to you question you have following options declare wich file you want to download bower install but remember this file cant be updated easily search for a js only package expample with bootstrap bower install bootstrap-css-only but remember these packages sometimes are not up to date use bower-installer recommended install the bower-installer npm install bower-installer --global and now follow the tutorial bower-installer github sorry for my bad english -
i think you didn t unterstand the meening of bower bower is handling you dependencys so if you do a bower install jquery it should download all files

28436704
super	self
the only exception is do not put super .foo in class a because foo is not defined in object
solution alternate solution the mro of d a c in the first case includes all classes as well so with correct ordering of super and print ... statements one can make it work class a object def foo self print the super .foo class b object def foo self print world class c b def foo self super .foo print is class d a c def foo self super .foo print nice d .foo further reading to understand inheritance order class d c a or class d a c and mro see

28437325
udp	tcp
the problem here is really that udp is not a protocol
it s a transport like tcp

28440959
firefox	safari
firefox this code relies on opening the link in an iframe that will trigger an error when a protocol is unrecognized on success it will open the url as normal
example usage safari this code relies on opening the url in a new tab whose win.location.href will before undefined within a second but probably less time if the url was not recognized

28441626
junit	testng
note that this will run junit tests inside testng but not the other way back
the trick is to use both frameworks annotations in the test classes and use testng asserts for junit compatibility

28442311
prepare	execute
every time you execute an sql multiple things happen prepare execute fetch you want every single step to be minimal
if you do all of these on the db the prepare execute may take longer but usually is less than all the queries combined but fetch which sometimes is the biggest becomes 1 not n and usually has also less records that the others combined

28442311
prepare	execute
if you do all of these on the db the prepare execute may take longer but usually is less than all the queries combined but fetch which sometimes is the biggest becomes 1 not n and usually has also less records that the others combined
then do execution plan to optimize your prepare and execution steps

28442507
onclick	onchange
the onclick attribute is not supported in chrome and ie when used on option elements
the best cross browser method would be to use the onchange attribute on your select remove all onclicks on the option tags and then write a third function to determine whether to call the show or hide functions you wrote

28445495
info.plist	ipa
it always ended with an error could not inspect the application package. and some warnings in device console after spending hours i got it fixed by adding the application requires iphone environment in info.plist
i had the same issue and was unable to install the ipa

28446185
punctuation	words
also you might want to think about some more interesting test cases if your code is supposed to handle arbitrary text with various types of punctuation
one approach is to use a regular expression that replaces vowels not preceded by a words boundary

28446681

28449303
division	subtract
using integer floor division won t run into rounding issues as you stretch floating point arithmetic beyond its limits
you can see this rounding error happen when you push n large enough the extra 1 there comes purely from the fact that you ran into the limits of floats i m not sure why you keep subtract one from n

28450454
swift	objective-c
link - more info form dev forums swift 1.1 allowed you to define +load methods with class func load but they were not actually run at startup time of your app like objective-c +load methods are
swift 1.2 bans them to avoid the impression that this might work

28453341
swift	objective-c
i developed a lot of apps in objective-c that are in apple store and now several in swift and so far users can not tell the difference if one is much faster than the other
swift is unlikely to result in applications that run much faster than applications developed in objective-c

28454204
ssl	https
as of december 2014 paul irish s blog on protocol-relative urls says 2014.12.17 now that ssl is encouraged for everyone and doesn t have performance concerns this technique is now an anti-pattern
if the asset you need is available on ssl then always use the https asset

28455640
uialertview	uialertcontroller
fortunately in ios 8 apple introduced a new class called uialertcontroller that allows you to get the behavior that you are after and they have deprecated the uialertview class
unfortunately what you are after isn t possible with a uialertview

28457335
ssl	https
but full ssl strict does not work because cf expects heroku to present yourdomain.com cert and gives an error page - you can of course get such a cert youself and pay heroku for serving it to cf but that s going back to square one.
you do get benefits of cdn but it s not completely free ssl on heroku . this situation is discussed in the cloudflare article configure cloudflare and heroku over https

28465936
base	fractions
in general for a fractions a b you can only get a fixed number of digits after the decimal point in a given base x if you can reduce a b to the form c x n for some integers c and n
that s because floats are stored as binary fractions a number divided by a power of 2 and 73 100 cannot be expressed as a non-repeating fractions in binary

28467478
xstream	jackson
other packages such as xstream and kryo do however
as of the time i am writing this it seems that jackson does not serialize inner classes or anonymous classes correctly

28467601
client-side	server-side
which is the functionality for the offline type. the online access token doesn t mean that it works for your client-side authentication done in the browser and the offline works for the server-side
you mentioned that you can get an access token refresh token and authorization code from the client-side of your app

28468261
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome versions prior to 65 actually did allow the download attribute on cross-origin files without cors headers but firefox chose not to citing potential social-engineering attacks
mdn documents this behavior for firefox 20 under the download attribute section for the a tag behavior that has not changed since

28472747
onresume	onpause
try putting this method in onpause as the view get ready for any modification during onresume .so either put some delay in the onresume take the screenshot in async manner using handlers or if the screen shot is not that critical take the same in onpause and call the function before super.onpause call
in one of the stackoverflow post the code below sample is working. i have tested the same in onpause

28473000
serializable	deserialization
when you create an xmlserializer for the first time it uses reflection to write c# code to serializable and deserialize all statically discoverable referenced types then compiles and loads that code into a dynamic dll to do the actual work
no code gets created for types that cannot be discovered statically so deserialization will fail for them

28474378
swift	objective-c
this is how a version with more swift and less objective-c would look like
uifont.fontnamesforfamilyname familynames.objectatindex indfamily objectatindex being a objective-c method that returns id returns a anyobject instance in swift not a string

28477084
freebsd	linux
since macos is based on bsd not linux it might be possible to create a new mesos containerizer based on freebsd jails but docker doesn t support jails either
mesos uses cgroups with or without docker on linux but the mesos containerization on os x only supports posix isolation which will launch a task in a thread and monitor it for completion

28481833
swift	objective-c
create an objective-c command line tool and change the search paths not swift
you can create a swift framework for the code you d put in your command line tool but the tool itself must not compile any swift code

nunit	mstest
the way i am currently doing this is with nunit
i had the same problem and could not find a good way to do it with mstest

28482908
equals	compareto
you also need to implement the interface in addition it is preferable that your class also implements the boolean equals object another method that would behave as if it returned
having compareto is not enough

28486664
equals	gethashcode
since equals won t be called unless the hash codes are equals you can just take it out by always returning 0
the rules for gethashcode state that things that aren t equals can return the same hash code so you aren t breaking semantics here

28486664
equals	gethashcode
the rules for gethashcode state that things that aren t equals can return the same hash code so you aren t breaking semantics here
the equals method then just compares to see whether the old string starts with the new string

28488551
odoo	openerp
it might not be the brightiest way but you should be able to do something like this if you don t want to drop existing stat rows each time you could do something like in these answers about postgresql insert or update edit if you want to use the new api you could add these imports from openerp import api from datetime import date from dateutil.relativedelta import relativedelta then the method could become since stat doesn t seem to be an odoo model it s not accessible via the orm api and we have to use sql
if i am mistaken and stat is an odoo model the code could become i didn t use age in stat here since it s a bad practice it changes at least once every year for every people but you could see this question about calculating age from date and mix it in the code

28500768
swift	objective-c
18391046 18383574 for example the following conflict between the objective-c setter for properties in a class and the method setproperty in its extension is now diagnosed to fix this you need to make all you method signatures unique as objective-c does not provide method overload or don t inherited from nsobject if you need swift only class
this is cause by the change stated in xcode 6.3beta release notes swift now detects discrepancies between overloading and overriding in the swift type system and the effective behavior seen via the objective-c runtime

28500825
punctuation	words
the simplest way is to use string split and split on spaces but that might not do what you want if there is punctuation
the following code uses that simple split and checks whether any of the words appear in the keywords array

28504381
octal	binary
therefore in this case you want to combine s_irusr user read s_iwusr user write and s_irgrp group read you can see each permission individually by displaying the octal number in binary form this breaks down as follows # usr 0b 110 100 000 # user read yes # user write yes # user execute no # grp 0b 110 100 000 # group read yes # group write no # group execute no # oth 0b 110 100 000 # other read no # other write no # other execute no
0640 is an octal number that is the meaning of the leading 0 which doesn t count as a digit and means the following permissions see wikipedia the first digit is for the file s owner and as 6 is 110 in binary where the bits are r ead w rite and e x ecute permission respectively means read and write permission

28504381
octal	binary
0640 is an octal number that is the meaning of the leading 0 which doesn t count as a digit and means the following permissions see wikipedia the first digit is for the file s owner and as 6 is 110 in binary where the bits are r ead w rite and e x ecute permission respectively means read and write permission
the second digit is for the group and as 4 is 100 in binary means read-only

we can work around this by making an objective-c category that doesn t use varargs and calls what we need just be sure to #import uiappearance+swift.h in your bridging header

28505940
swift	objective-c
casting in swift requires that there be a type hierarchy relationship between the casted types and pkphysicsjointweld is not a subtype subclass of skphysicsjoint so the cast fails
you can work around this issue by avoiding the cast to with this you lose some type safety joint is an anyobject so like objective-c s id type the compiler lets you call any method on it

28510196
swift	objective-c
update in swift 4 we also recommend from swift3+ to avoid nsstuff when there is swift equivalent nsurl url
i code in objective-c it should be easy to convert it in swift small modification in fact but the explanation is not that much related to code

28510362
udp	tcp
udp is connectionless there wouldn t be a separate connection
probably the best way to think about is that the connection is the tcp thing but data can also be sent using udp while the connection exists

28510362
udp	tcp
probably the best way to think about is that the connection is the tcp thing but data can also be sent using udp while the connection exists
since udp doesn t always work over the internet i would strongly suggest separating the transport layer from other program logic

28510362
udp	tcp
since udp doesn t always work over the internet i would strongly suggest separating the transport layer from other program logic
your transport layer can make the tcp connection and using the tcp connection agree to try udp

28510718
ssl	https
see the relevant commands are if you want to add ssl certificates to the boot2docker instance it s going to be something similar boot2docker ssh followed by sudo
as of docker version 1.3.1 if your registry doesn t support https you must add it as an insecure registry

28512451
multiplying	multiplication
it avoids multiplying bignums by turning into
not only does this do fewer multiplication the majority of the multiplication which are left are smallnum bignum instead of bignum bignum

28515230
viewmodel	caliburn
another problem is that if you register your viewmodel with no reason for them to be singletons your solution would not work because ioc.get will return a different instance of your viewmodel
the right way to implement your use case is to use messaging using ieventaggregator in caliburn

28516535
clang	llvm
now it s not that clang is useless for you
clang compiles c++ to llvm ir

28517204
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
in my opinion it is besser to use case-sensitive names
hostname is not the same as hostname unless you declared the constant to be case-insensitive like this define hostname www.dbhost.com true

28517794
move	drag
the vertical border can be move and during an update it seems to have move to 100 right
this results in the logcat to be collected but not displayed move your mouse pointer to the right of the tool window and just drag logcat back into view

28518621
swift	objective-c
so it turns out there was probably a bug in the past that when you were adding a swift file it would add ask a bridging header but it wouldn t add that line to your project which means you d stay in this state resulting in
i could only find that out because i moved around files in my project and when i added objective-c files to the project it asked me about a bridging header although i had one already

28520265
cdr	cons
following function defun cartesian lst1 lst2 let acc dolist v1 lst1 acc dolist v2 lst2 push cons v1 v2 acc creates cartesian product of two supplied lists as list of conses where # car is an element of lst1 and # cdr is an element of lst2
note however that calling # cartesian on such product will return malformed result - cons of cons and element this happens because members of the first set are conses not atoms

28521151
mp3	wav	mp3	flac
the best though least helpful way to do this is not to use mp3 files as your source files
wav flac or m4a files don t have this problem

28522840
quicksort	mergesort	quicksort	heapsort
heapsort is o n log n guaranted what is much better than worst case in quicksort
heapsort doesn t need more memory for another array to putting ordered data as is needed by mergesort

28523302
quicksort	timsort
note that going by the rigid definition of big-o quicksort isn t quick at all -- it s worst-case proportional to n squared when you just happen to pick a terrible pivot each and every time.
expected-time wise it s fine though nowhere as good as timsort because in real life the situations where you repeatedly pick a disaster pivot are exceedingly rare.

28525979
uilabel	uitextview
secondly using nsattributedstring with uilabel is not as reliable as using it with uitextview
the attributedtext of a uilabel does inherit the attributes from the text of uilabel if the attributes are not explicitly provided

28529860
.htaccess	httpd.conf
1 make sure your .htaccess still intact
re-copy it over from your installation files or locate one of the optimized versions online such as this one 2 if that doesn t work then then mod_rewrite is probably disabled in your wamp s httpd.conf file

28531309
ionic	angular
now that there s famo.us angular i don t see why you couldn t use ionic and famo.us in the same app although i haven t tried it yet
summary ionic sticks with the regular dom for rendering and focuses on mobile design ux patterns

28533769
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome has a security restriction that doesn t allow you to access cookies unless the page is running from a web server
firefox will work without a web server with cookies

28537612
build.gradle	gradlew
make sure that your build.gradle file is correct and does not contain invalid logic incorrect dependencies valid markup structure etc.
after several attempts trying to build my first gradlew project i was stack with several problems and i would like to share few tips first of all make sure that you are using valid gradlew build system

28537612
gradle	ivy
the build file which you can see above i built it with the next configuration ------------------------------------------------------------ gradle 1.10 ------------------------------------------------------------ build time 2013-12-17 09 28 15 utc build number none revision 36ced393628875ff15575fa03d16c1349ffe8bb6 groovy 1.8.6 ant apache ant tm version 1.9.2 compiled on july 8 2013 ivy 2.2.0 jvm 1.7.0_55 oracle corporation 24.51-b03 os linux 3.13.0-32-generic amd64 make sure that old version of gradle was removed from your local machine
because no guarantee that both gradle versions will not conflict together

28542607
implements	extends
you can create a custom class that implements that contract and pass it to the render method
note that presenter is an interface not a class therefore you must implement it not extends it

28542967
super	extends
in your case you cannot create an anonymous class using test because you cannot specify the super constructor arguments as you ve seen
if a trait extends a class all the classes that mixin the trait has to be either a subclass of that class or a descendant class of that class

28544853
super	self	super	implements
in python 2.x the equivalent will be or in python 3.x class minimumbalanceaccount bankaccount def __init__ self minimum_balance super .__init__ however you must understand that this will just run whatever __init__ method it finds first from the base methods
so in terms of multiple inheritance it would be difficult to call __init__ methods of various other classes if super is not implements in the base classes

28544853
super	implements
so in terms of multiple inheritance it would be difficult to call __init__ methods of various other classes if super is not implements in the base classes
so please avoid using multiple inheritance at all costs or implements super in all classes

28548048
udp	tcp
udp is a datagram protocol where each packet means a single entity independent of the other packets udp does not detected duplication reordering etc
tcp instead is a stream protocol that is the whole transfer consists of a single unstructured octet stream similar to a large file

28549095
swift	objective-c
additionally the swift compiler may bypass the objective-c runtime to call devirtualize or inline swift methods that were not marked dynamic even if they were marked objective-c
this means that in some cases swizzling could be possible only for calls dispatched through objective-c

28549260
swift	objective-c
swift doesn t implement the load class method on extensions
unlike objective-c where the runtime calls +load for each class and category in swift the runtime only calls the load class method defined on a class

28550402
uiview	calayer
i wanted to be able to set the bordercolor and shadowcolor on an uiview through the interface builder but the type of a layer s bordercolor property is cgcolor just like shadowcolor which is not one of the types allowed to be changed in the user-defined runtime attributes feature
so i made an extension for calayer and i added two properties called bordercolorib and shadowcolorib that are of type uicolor runtimeattributes.h runtimeattributes.m now i alredy be able to set this two properties through interface builder like this in the user-defined runtime attributes section identity inspector make sure the uiview is selected and add the following runtime attributes layer.borderwidth number 1 layer.bordercolorib color somecolor layer.shadowcolorib color somecolor layer.shadowopacity number 0.8 layer.shadowoffset size 5 5 layer.cornerradius number 5 here is an image to show you how i did .

28559147
spaces	delimiter
this can be mitigated to some extent with tr -s if all rows start with at least one spaces this works tr -s | cut -d -f2 an alternative is to use sed to remove all whitespace from the start of line on the other hand to retrieve file sizes you are better of using stat
the problem is that cut does not support patterns as delimiter

28565322
oncreate	findviewbyid	setcontentview	findviewbyid
you need to those inside oncreate after you called setcontentview
i m not 100 sure but i think you can t do the findviewbyid at the instance constructions

28566113
profiling	instrumentation
according to the memory monitor in xcode this is causing unbounded memory growth and eventually memory warnings and force quits - but profiling the memory usage using the allocations instrumentation shows the memory usage to be stable
believe instrumentation and the allocations information - not the memory monitor in xcode

28567439
swift	objective-c
swift structs are not accessible from objective-c
this is stated in the using swift with cocoa and objective-c book from apple you ll have access to anything within a class or protocol that s marked with the objective-c attribute as long as it s compatible with objective-c

28569100
hex	binary
it is there only for readability for example binary data can be easier interpreted in hex than decimal notation
the way constants defined in the source code does not do anything for performance as it will be converted to binary representation by compiler

28570667
fseek	fread
if both writer and reader are developed in c and are supposed to run only on the same machine use the fseek with the sizeof type used in the writer in the offset parameter
if the machine that writes the binary isn t the same that will read it you probably don t want to even read the doubles with fread as their format may differ due to possible different architectures

28571269
subtract	addition
if you instead subtract n from 1 you ll get into a cycle and the recursion will continue forever or rather until you run out of memory
the same problem doesn t occur with addition because addition is commutative

28571567
jar	war
try to compile project1 to a jar i assume it s a .war now and put the jar on the classpath
war files are not library files as jars are

28572542
firefox	safari
this caused firefox not to load the stylesheet at all
chrome and safari probably account for some common mistakes in the markup

28574329
rsa	dsa	ecdsa	rsa
from the file #define pem_string_x509_old x509 certificate #define pem_string_x509 certificate #define pem_string_x509_pair certificate pair #define pem_string_x509_trusted trusted certificate #define pem_string_x509_req_old new certificate request #define pem_string_x509_req certificate request #define pem_string_x509_crl x509 crl #define pem_string_evp_pkey any private key #define pem_string_public public key #define pem_string_rsa rsa private key #define pem_string_rsa_public rsa public key #define pem_string_dsa dsa private key #define pem_string_dsa_public dsa public key #define pem_string_pkcs7 pkcs7 #define pem_string_pkcs7_signed pkcs #7 signed data #define pem_string_pkcs8 encrypted private key #define pem_string_pkcs8inf private key #define pem_string_dhparams dh parameters #define pem_string_ssl_session ssl session parameters #define pem_string_dsaparams dsa parameters #define pem_string_ecdsa_public ecdsa public key #define pem_string_ecparameters ec parameters #define pem_string_ecprivatekey ec private key #define pem_string_parameters parameters #define pem_string_cms cms some things will be more difficult than others
for example its obvious what a rsa public key is but its not so obvious what a public key is

28577485
super	self
when you call super it does not know if you have already called it
both of your calls to super child self .__init__ call the base1 implementation because that is the nearest parent the most immediate superclass of child

28577660
super	self
here s a concrete example of how not using super might go wrong
suppose you ve got class foo object def frob self print frobbign as a foo class bar object def frob self print frobbign as a bar and you make a subclass class foobar foo bar def frob self foo.frob self bar.frob self everything s fine but then you realize that when you get down to it foo really is a kind of bar so you change it class foo bar def frob self print frobbign as a foo bar.frob self which is all fine except that in your derived class foobar.frob calls bar.frob twice

28578811
swift	objective-c
the swift compiler treats the statement only as a declaration. therefore the variable is not defined anywhere causing the linker error
to solve the problem you have to move the definition to an objective-c file and change the declaration to an extern declaration alternatively you can just remove the static modifier to make it work with swift

28580948
ng-app	ng-controller
as for your question the view doesn t show anything due to the following errors few mistakes first of all ng-app should be moved to the html tag
second if you use a variable from a controller you should use ng-controller

28583517
http	spdy
from what i understood http 2 is not a replacement for websocket but aims to standardize spdy protocol
in http 2 server-push is used behind the scene to improve resource loading by the client from the browser

28584475
ssl	https
this should be done using ssl which browsers have built in support for
you can recognise when ssl is in use and properly configured because the url will start with https not http the browser will show some indicator chrome for example will display a padlock next to the url clicking on the padlock and then examining the connection tab will tell you more about the encryption that is in use once the password is on the server it shouldn t be subject to two-way encryption

28584560
textview	imageview
it seems that when you use wrap_content or match_parent in your imageview not textview on your custom action bar xml layout you will have padding in your action bar otherwise you don t have
so please try changing your xml as below setting fixed size to the imageview and you can also add some margin_left for a better look

28588324
dictionary	map
python is only able to destructure sequences not dictionary
so to write what you want you will have to map the needed entries to a proper sequence

28592208
spaces	delimiter
it is not recommended to give a zero-length extension when in-place editing files as you risk corruption or partial content in situations where disk spaces is exhausted etc. zero-length
try this sudo sed -i s|#banner none|banner etc sshd_banner| etc sshd_config by changing the delimiter you do not need to escape the your original post missed one at the end

28594006
rsa	aes
regarding your second question certificates are used with asymmetric encryption algorithms like rsa and are therefore not relevant to aes which is a symmetric algorithm
yes the aes algorithm is standardized and the machine used has no influence on the result of the encryption

28594961
cakephp	yii
here is the code for the set function cakephp s set function to fully understand it you should also read the render function
in cakephp views are assumed to have the same name as the public function so it s not common to see render in the controller as you would see a lot for example in yii

28596411
build.gradle	gradlew
you need to add compile org.json json 20160212 to your top build.gradle like
if you are using libgdx it not comes with a gradlew setup making multy project builds streamlined

28596622
multiplying	subtract
you need to multiplying that value by a thousand
and subtract 86400 seconds doesn t mean exactly one day all the time since there are two days in the year that are one hour longer resp

28599198
uicollectionview	uitableview
uicollectionview is more generic than uitableview and you can custom almost thing on it
if you want to have right legal spacing not a trick you can try uicollectionview instead of uitableview

28599310
implements	extends
one difference between implements runnable and extends thread is that by extends thread each of your threads has a unique object associated with it whereas implements runnable many threads can share the same object instance
a class that implements runnable is not a thread and just a class

28603708
junit	mockito
when using maven tycho junit hamcrest and mockito the only way i was able to make this work and resolve all dependency classpath classloader issues correctly was the following way create maven module with the following entries in the pom.xml ... ... use following entries in the manifest.mf and finally in your unit test fragment add this new bundle as a dependency
as is mentioned in the comments the root cause is that the eclipse orbit package of mockito which i had added to my target platform is signed and because of a bug in the underlying cglib you cannot mock unsigned classes interfaces with a signed mockito

28606082
jsf	seam
see also adding omnifaces to jsf 2.2 with weld app gives nullpointerexception exactly same problem with weld faces-config with from-outcome not being string boolean fails with nullpointerexception exactly same problem with seam
this is caused by the combination spring webflow 2.3.x and jsf 2.2

28606690
boost	allocator
live on coliru both the above uses use boost iostreams in header-only mode no runtime dependency on boost shared libraries
since you re trying to avoid allocator and you re using boost anyways use boost iostreams custom devices ps lest it s not obvious by using streams you get all the goodness combine with boost format if you want printf style or positional argument format strings combine with boost locale for localized messages gettext and formatting ordinals dates numerics ... live on coliru this will just stop writing output after buf has been filled

28612499
portrait	landscape
probably because the portrait mode has several orientations uideviceorientationportrait uideviceorientationfaceup ... that trigger the notification hence the control style change request
so the second step of my fix was to handle the fact that it is not necessary to change the mpmovieplayercontroller s controlstyle if we are already in the correct screen orientation. in my case the solution was to verify that the status bar was hidden as i hide it in landscape maybe the point here is that we should not set the controlstyle if it is already set to the wanted value

28613510
google-chrome	firefox
so i just solved it by calling fullscreen mode where window is the google-chrome window not the object window
i tryed a lot of things i fount over internet but no success because there is no xul in firefox for android

28617603
ioexception	printwriter
unfortunately most things that write throw ioexception which isn t permitted by the consumer functional interface that foreach expects
but printwriter is different

28617732
division	modulo
those do not correspond exactly the module code associates the a register copy and a nop instruction which are essentially free in terms of runtime compared to the following division to the loop line the source code while the standalone module associates it to the line above. you can see that in the machine code tab when using in kcachegrind. this is will have something to do with different registers being available for the two variants due to the different number of function calls that imply spilling stuff onto the stack
lets look at the modulo loops to see if there is a significant runtime difference module standalone the difference is one register to register copy mov edx ebx likely again caused by different register pressure due to earlier function calls this is one of the cheapest operations available in a cpu probably around 1-2 cycles and good throughput so it should have no measurable effect on the actual wall time

28617795
express	node.js
rather than leveraging frameworks like express for their request handling they created their own clone of sinatra which of course makes it almost the same as express express is also a sinatra clone but subtly different and means that none of express s middleware or plugins can be reused
similarly they embed v8 but not libuv which means they do not offer the same non blocking apis as node.js and therefore users cannot be sure about whether a given npm module will work there

28619739
sudo	passwd
the -h flag is actually for the sudo command and not for pip
as taken from the docs the -h home option requests that the security policy set the home environment variable to the home directory of the target user root by default as specified by the passwd database

28622163
pickle	dill
dill also given you the option to not pickle by reference so you can serialize dynamically modified objects and class instances class methods bound and unbound and so on
if you use the dill module either of your two approaches will just work as is

28622163
pickle	dill
this means pickle does not work on objects defined in __main__ and it also doesn t work on many dynamically modified objects
dill registers __main__ as a module so it has a valid namespace

28623362
ftp	telnet
if you connect with an ftp client to the server the client gets the welcome string and as that does not conform to the ftp protocol specification the client errors
the same would happen if you connect with any other client that uses a specific protocol a web browser http a terminal client ssh or telnet etc

28624068
memcpy	memmove
your memmove calls are shuffling memory along by 2 to 128 bytes while your memcpy source and destination are completely different
somehow that s accounting for the performance difference if you copy to the same place you ll see memcpy ends up possibly a smidge faster on ideone.com memmove 002 0.0610362 memmove 004 0.0554264 memmove 008 0.0575859 memmove 016 0.057326 memmove 032 0.0583542 memmove 064 0.0561934 memmove 128 0.0549391 memcpy 0.0537919 hardly anything in it though - no evidence that writing back to an already faulted in memory page has much impact and we re certainly not seeing a halving of time.

28624236
memcpy	memmove
it was then realised that memcpy doesn t need to be and frequently wasn t defined to handle overlapping areas in any particular way
the end result is that memmove was defined to handle overlapping regions in a particular way even if this impacts performance

28627746
noexcept	throw
from memory they simply assume that it is noexcept because throw move constructors are not common and not being able to move would be a critical problem
the core issue is that it s impossible to offer strong exception safety with a throw move constructor

28628113
qthread	qobject
the default run implementation in qthread runs an event loop for you the equivalent of the important thing about an event loop is that it allows objects owned by the thread to receive events on their slots which will be executed in that thread
those objects are just qobject not qthreads

28628113
qthread	qobject
those objects are just qobject not qthread
important note the qthread object is not owned by its own thread

28631429
swift	objective-c
see swift is very type-safe language
so when you mess any different type it s better to say to compiler what we are going to mess. so hash2 line will look like this here you just say that dictionary will be with keys type of string and values with any type anyobject goes from nsobject in objective-c and here any type because dog.self and person.self doesn t goes from objective-c and not the same type then while unwrapping you need to say what type it will be so next code will be like this here i just try not only to get key from dictionary but to cast it for person.type type

28633425
firefox	safari
css scoping is supported only in firefox 21+
it is not currently supported in chrome internet explorer safari or opera

28634683
firefox	safari
if you are not tied in to webkit-based debuggers and can also debug using firefox s inspector using firefox developer edition might be your answer
this version of firefox includes webide and valence which together make it very easy to debug safari on ipad

28635185
hive	hdfs
if you want to move your data to the hive warehouse you ll need to load it in with a command like load data inpath your file or folder on the hdfs into table your_table
if you don t want to move the data you can create an external hive table which doesn t move the data

28644014
memcached	opcache
if you really need more you ll need to check out the other possibilities already mentioned in the comments like using a loadbalancer and multiple application servers using memcached or memcached to cache database queries and other load heavy operations switching to another database system like a nosql system be careful of the consequences changing your architecture to a static site with webservices providing interactive content
to answer your question yes you should not run xcache and zend opcache at the same time

28646346
cdr	cons
here returning #f to that context implies that the or-expression will return the pair cons 3 5 and thus the cdr x will fail
in cdr x you will get an error if x doesn t evaluate to a pair where the cdr is a thunk

28646346
cdr	cons
in cdr x you will get an error if x doesn t evaluate to a pair where the cdr is a thunk
in your first expression the initial value of x is cons 2 lambda cc #f

28649364
direct3d	directx
the direct3d win32 game vs template i reference above sets it to support windows vista or later in the pch.h
directx is not deprecated

28650018
udp	tcp
udp protocol is connectionless and thus you really cannot create connections between 2 sockets in the same manner as with the tcp client and server
thus you also cannot do the listen system call on an udp socket as it concerns only the tcp server sockets

28650548
udp	tcp
it is much easier to impose a messaging paradigm on tcp than it is to impose a reliable paradigm on udp and for this reason it is in most cases more appropriate to use tcp for all network i o than udp
as philip says with udp you either get the entire datagram or not at all

28656147
required	placeholder
here s a more generic approach that doesn t required you to provide a pattern works for multiple placeholder and can match a placeholder over multiple words too
say we have the following template and input string so we parse all the placeholder names and add them to a map first

28657077
octal	decimal
when you write then 01001 is an octal number and 01936 is a decimal number with gnu awk at least because it contains a 9 so you re asking whether
my suspicion is that you have in this way constructed overlapping ranges and that the problem could be fixed by removing the leading zeroes from all conditions since the octal interpretation does not apply to the input data

28658517
super	self
thus in case you know what class to deliver to do not use super but call the method explicitly class b a def say self print this is b i let a speak for me a.say self
often one says that a method in superclass can be called with super .method self which is not quite the whole truth

28658517
super	self
often one says that a method in superclass can be called with super .method self which is not quite the whole truth
the super is often not the correct thing to do in that it does not call the method in superclass but the method that is in the next type in the current object s types method resolution order

28658517
super	self
the super is often not the correct thing to do in that it does not call the method in superclass but the method that is in the next type in the current object s types method resolution order
wrong because we have also class c a def say self print hey it is me c class d b c pass now we create an instance of d and invoke say on it d .say the output is this is b i let a speak for me hey it is me c that is super delegated the execution from b.say to the class c that the b is not aware at all and b is neither a subclassing nor superclass of c

28658517
super	self
wrong because we have also class c a def say self print hey it is me c class d b c pass now we create an instance of d and invoke say on it d .say the output is this is b i let a speak for me hey it is me c that is super delegated the execution from b.say to the class c that the b is not aware at all and b is neither a subclassing nor superclass of c
the super is a misnomer

28662324
calloc	malloc
if you re not familiar with this way of calling calloc see here
as usual with malloc check arr2 against null before proceeding

28664089
haskell	ocaml
as a semi-unrelated side-note in haskell this could be accomplished by a van laarhoven traversal this value intsoffoo generally traverses foo touching each int with the inj function and smashing all of the effects of these touches together to re- build the resulting foo
not sure how to accomplish this in fieldslib but here s an ugly draft in ocaml

28665175
viewdidload	viewdidappear
your code isn t working because you re calling it from within viewdidload
you need to call it from viewdidappear instead - see this question for more details

28666542
spaces	delimiter
i am not sure your input has single or multiple combination of delimiter dash comma hypen spaces and hash but the below solution will work for both

aggregate-functions	sum
group by according to the book fundamentals of database systems elmasri navathe 2011 6th ed another type of request that cannot be expressed in the basic relational algebra is to specify mathematical aggregate-functions on collections of values from the database. ... we can define an aggregate-functions operation using the symbol ℑ pronounced script f 7 to specify these types of requests as follows grouping attributes ℑ function list r where grouping attributes is a list of attributes of the relation specified in r and function list is a list of function attribute pairs
in each such pair function is one of the allowed functions such as sum average maximum minimum count and attribute is an attribute of the relation specified by r

mono	xamarin.android
others have reported similar issues ssl connections are unreliable see the best workaround i can recommend to you at the moment is to use modernhttpclient which is a httpclienthandler implementation that uses a native api and thus doesn t involve the mono network stack plus it s considerably faster too
unfortunately you haven t provided more information about what you are trying to do but i can confirm that we are seeing similar buggy behavior in our xamarin.android apps

28669163
innodb	myisam
myisam will do in most situations but if you have a high number of updates or inserts compared to your searches and selects then you will get better performance out of the innodb engine
to get the best performance out of innodb you need to tweak the parameters for your server otherwise there is no reason not to use it

28670054
wildfly	jboss
that s not how a javaee application making use of webservices is expected to be provided and deployed on a javaee container like wildfly basically because the container is responsible for supplying the ws engine functionalities
in particular when it comes to wildfly apache cxf is internally used hence by adding some cxf libs in his deployment the user can possibly end up into complex classloading issues that he might not be able to easily solve. anyway the message says what has to be done jboss modules dependencies has to be defined in the deployment

28670095
symfony	silex
for more details check the silex controller resolver code and also the symfony s httpkernel one
silex does parameter conversion in controllers and in controllers only so in the controllers methods you can type hint and expect to automatically have the instance but not anywhere else

28672471
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
when copied and pasted from browsers tested 2015 as expected for and for google-chrome and firefox on mac on windows 10 it keeps the characters and pastes hard hyphens into notepad and invisible soft hyphens into applications that support them
ie win7 always pastes with hyphens even in ie10 and safari mac copies in a way which pastes as hyphens in some applications ms word but not others find on page works for and on all browsers except ie which only matches exact copied-and-pasted matches even up to ie11 search engines google matches words containing with words typed normally

28673847
ironruby	ironpython
there is a fcntl.cs in ironruby however maybe this could be used as a base for implementing one in ironpython
as far as i can see the fcntl module of cpython is a builtin module implemented in c - those modules need to be explicitly implemented for most alternative python interpreters like ironpython in contrast to the modules implemented in plain python as they cannot natively load python c extensions

28673847
cpython	ironpython
as far as i can see the fcntl module of cpython is a builtin module implemented in c - those modules need to be explicitly implemented for most alternative python interpreters like ironpython in contrast to the modules implemented in plain python as they cannot natively load python c extensions
additionally it seems that there currently is no such fcntl implementation in ironpython

28674138
g++	gcc
your command line should look like g++ main.cpp -o outname
you are using gcc to compile c++ code which results in c++ system headers not being considered in the header lookup process

28679423
decimal	ieee
converting the exponents to decimal removing the offset and re-adding the implied 1 in square brackets 0.1 and 0.2 are to add two numbers the exponent needs to be the same since the sum is not of the form 2 n 1. bbb we increase the exponent by one and shift the decimal binary point to get there are now 53 bits in the mantissa the 53rd is in square brackets in the line above
the default rounding mode for ieee 754 is round to nearest - if a number x falls between two values a and b the value where the least significant bit is zero is chosen

28680754
udp	tcp
this is not possible in a generic way for at least the following reasons udp is a datagram protocol where each packet is independent from the other
tcp instead is a stream protocol

28680754
udp	tcp
while it would be possible to concatenate the udp packets to a tcp stream it is not clear at which boundaries the tcp stream should be split to generate the packets
with udp duplicates packet loss and reordering of packets could happen

28680754
udp	tcp
with udp duplicates packet loss and reordering of packets could happen
if you cannot be sure about the proper order and that you got all messages and exactly once you can not construct reliable a tcp stream from it

28680754
udp	tcp
once you forward tcp to udp these acks can not be done because udp does not have such mechanism
it might still be possible to do application specific translations like udp dns to tcp dns or similar

28682286
sse	avx
with out the flag gcc uses legacy sse and clang fails to compile with error sse4.1 instruction set not enabled
with xmmintrin.h which is legacy sse header both compilers produced avx versions in the presence of the flag and legacy ones when it was absent

28687252
memcpy	strdup
this memcpy copies the pointers that are in args but does not allocate and copy memory for the actual strings in args
for that you will want to iterate through args instead of memcpy and use strdup to create new copies of the strings

28687948
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
improving css3 transition performance jerky css transform transition in google-chrome it is also known that google-chrome does not do as well a job accelerating css transitions as firefox and ie
why transitions for some css properties are slow and none fluent css3 transform difference in firefox and google-chrome and ie in fact given that google rejected pointer event on the ground of speed which ie solved by gpu acceleration it can be said that google-chrome and webkit in general - safari is even slower is lagging behind on this front and the only way to help is contributing code to chromium webkit

28688005
implements	extends
use a wrapper around the post-feature-extraction part of the pipeline here svc to remove the unlabelled data note you cannot just implements this as a transformer
perhaps extends from svc is simpler a bit like what myvectorizer does above but without using the global data hack. an advantage of this approach is that it applies regardless of the gridsearchcv input as opposed to the hack of injecting the full data via a global variable

28688851
spaces	delimiter
on the plus side values with spaces will not trip this up
without using re assumes that your values and keys will not contain the string so its only appearance will be as a delimiter

28690149
opera	firefox
firefox firefox won t download the image called with background image if the styles are hidden but they will still download assets from img tags. opera like firefox does opera won t load useless background-images. internet explorer ie like webkit will download background-images even if they have display none
so to answer the question of why a quick argument for either side firefox - don t load until the content is visible no reason to load something not being viewed improve page load time

28690939
division	multiplication
your friend has a point a division actual division not just writing in c is slower than a multiplication
for doubles the ratio is about 4 for the latency and division isn t pipelined whereas multiplication is so the throughput ratio is much worse around 20

28690939
division	multiplication
for doubles the ratio is about 4 for the latency and division isn t pipelined whereas multiplication is so the throughput ratio is much worse around 20
these numbers are for haswell but are typical integer division is slower than floating point division but using floating point multiplication on integer causes two conversions

28690939
division	multiplication
these numbers are for haswell but are typical integer division is slower than floating point division but using floating point multiplication on integer causes two conversions
the conversions aren t too bad so in total the floating point multiplication is still faster

28691555
setinterval	settimeout
i don t see any problem runnning this on ff. so this means the code you put ain t causing the issue. like i said in the comment in this case using setinterval is better and harder to get a bug. if you need more help show us more codes edited eparker files other test_settimeout.html this could be related the reason why the issue is happening only on ff. i see the short amount of lag when i run the page with firefox which doesn t happen in google-chrome
the code below is a sample of loop of settimeout

28693108
realloc	malloc
if you do any of the following between modules that depend on different crts you ll have trouble and in this specific case you re not implementing com objects properly malloc memory in one module and realloc or free in another fopen a in one module and fread fwrite fclose etc
in another setjmp in one module and longjmp in another note that there are things you can do use memory malloc ed by another module keeping the responsibility of reallocating and freeing on the originating module use some interface that interacts with files fopen ed by another module keeping the responsibility of its use on the originating module don t use setjmp longjmp across unrelated or losely coupled modules define callbacks aborting error codes whatever but don t rely on unwinding techniques even if provided by the os you can see a pattern here

28695689
ffmpeg	libav
when you launch a pipeline with a playbin it s this implementation that will get used not your system-wide ffmpeg
the whole of libav and before ffmpeg is wrapped by gst-libav previously gst-ffmpeg

28696259
factors	mean
variable scoping can also be a factors - global scope variables hang around if you re not careful so perl can t tidy up
perl itself will generally manage it s own memory usage and recycle free space internally so a big number doesn t necessarily mean there s a problem

28697663
ireport	subreports
when you were using file path you could put the full path to the subreports file and ireport would find it
since you changed to an inputstream ireport doesn t know how to find the subreports to compile it

28698481
sudo	passwd
there are a few alternatives use nvm install node using homebrew fix npm permissions old answer you have no permissions to write use the sudo command sudo npm install -g cordova ios-deploy then enter your passwd
edit as the answer got 5 upvotes i would like to recommend not using sudo when installing cordova or other npm packages and change the node install to not require sudo

28700216
super	implements
this is quick but ll is less powerful than g lr and mantaining a hand-written parser can quickly become a nightmare if you aren t super careful with all edge cases
ll parsers can be also implements as table parsers like lr are but hand-editing the table is guaranteed to become a mess sooner or later

28708577
set	bag
i wanted to be able to add something very simple to my main view and child partial view to allow the javascript method after an ajax post in the partial view to be set by the main view
i call the partial view from the main view with one of the following lines depending on whether you need to pass model data or not mycallback is the name of a javascript function for example from here you could ask for this value in the controller action and then from the action add the value to the view bag but if you are going to use this on multiple partial views it would be cleaner to have a filter attribute do this for you

28708768
factors	mean
so we can do a few things change the load factors - this could impact the performance of the map set the initial capacity to list.size 0.75 + 1 the best option is the latter of the two let me explain what s going on here list.size 0.75 this will return list.size + 25 of list.size for example if my list had a size of 100 it would return 133
we then add 1 to it as the map is resized if the size of it is equal to 75 of the initial capacity so if we had a list with a size of 100 we would be setting the initial capacity to 134 this would mean that adding all 100 entries from the list would not incur any resize of the map

28709273
setinterval	settimeout
i ve cheated by only going through colours between #100 and #fff to show that the setinterval can work
i would take a different approach using setinterval instead of settimeout something like note that there is a bug in setcolor - it s not prepending 0s to the string so all colors before #100000 will not work correctly

28711468
momentjs	datejs
--update nowadays datejs is outdated and not maintained so use momentjs
--update --update using datejs just write something like new date .cleartime .addseconds 15457 .tostring h mm ss

28711716
junit	jmockit
i had a few instrumented jars imported in the classpath which were not required for the junit execution or coverage
these instrumented jars were causing jacoco session to be incorrect as we also had jmockit integration as mocking framework

28712117
innodb	myisam
that is not directly available in innodb
something like it available in myisam where you have a 2-column primary key dipaddr rowid

28721935
serializable	deserialization
if you really want to use messaging you should probably serializable the data to json or xml pass that to your service then deserialize the data into whatever object you are using in that layer
in this way you don t need any dependency on the data types of the other layer because the deserialization process does not necessarily require such dependencies

28723302
viewdidload	viewdidappear
also -- i ve learnt this the trial-and-error way -- if you try locking in the app on viewdidload or viewwillappear viewdidappear it s not going to work
i see from your logs that you re trying to lock the app in viewdidload . try using a timer instead maybe that s your problem

28724756
factors	matrix
or work with the internal integer representation and you can always get back to the levels labels again via using a data frame would seem to be not ideal for this as each component of the data frame would be treated as a separate factors whereas you seem to want to treat the array as a single factors with one set of levels
if you really wanted to do what you want which is have a factors matrix you would most likely need to create your own s3 class to do this plus all the methods to go with it

28724841
factors	matrix
note that if you add class matrix to your factors some but not all things start working produces this doesn t fix rbind etc
unfortunately factors support is not completely universal in r so many r functions default to treating factors as their internal storage type which is integer this is what happens with matrix cbind

28724841
factors	matrix
unfortunately factors support is not completely universal in r so many r functions default to treating factors as their internal storage type which is integer this is what happens with matrix cbind
they don t know how to handle factors but they do know what to do with integers so they treat your factors like an integer

28725054
spaces	delimiter
that script outputs the following for me these solutions both assume that each field in the form of key value and that no values contain the comma followed by a spaces
if the latter isn t true then you might want to change the logging delimiter if you can to something that s more distinct

28726867
spaces	delimiter
you can do this with tr keep in mind that you will probably also need to account for spaces after the period so you don t end up with leading spaces at the beginning of each sentence in your table and you may also want to account for additional whitespace empty lines between each paragraph
when using delimiter files the standard db2 import and load utilities do not have the ability to specify a row record terminator

28727499
postgresql	mysql
what you are trying to do is not possible in postgresql since it doesn t allow you to use an alias within the same query as a field
different from mysql where you can do it

28729570
neo4j	titan
i haven t checked in a while but last time i did neo4j did not support these
orientdb and titan among others do

28730247
xslt	xquery
you can therefore do it using saxon-he 9.6 using xquery but not using xslt
we moved xquery 3.0 and xpath 3.0 support into the he product when they became w3c recommendations

28732691
cefsharp	cefglue
however integrating cefglue into your winforms or wpf app may be more difficult than cefsharp
this isn t currently supported by cefsharp

28735401
profiling	benchmarking
you might find compare faster slower than strcmp for strings often differing in the first character or three but the other way around for long strings that are equal or only differing near the end so make sure you try different kinds of input before you conclude you understand the performance profiling
update output of improved benchmarking at the thing that proved crucial to get it working meaningfully was outwitting the compiler s ability to predict the strings being compared at compile time note that in general strcmp is not functionally equivalent to or .compare when the text may embed nuls as the former will get to exit early

28736998
ubuntu	debian
i recommend you to remove both packages from ubuntu and pip and then reinstall only using pip apt-get remove --purge python-scrapy pip uninstall scrapy after those actions finished you can install it again using pip and then if you do scrapy version you should get as response the newest version in your case it should be 0.24.4
edit you can read this in scrapy documentation python-scrapy is a different package provided by official debian repositories it s very outdated and it isn t supported by scrapy team

28737146
jar	war
you should not need to put the jar anywhere else
suggest you check that the war file does indeed contain the jar file as expected

28744336
intersect	contains
the problem is that it seems that after a except and intersect a distinct follows automatically not really
it just means that it s a set-based operation - so the result will never contains two equal under your equality comparison results

28747278
persistent	transient
field annotated with transient will not be persistent
you can add jpa s transient

28752295
glfw	sdl
sdl2 does not extract this information from the pixel format it selected smarter frameworks like glfw do this but it naively tries to query it from gl
i m using sdl s built-in function sdl_gl_getattribute which returns the values that sdl uses to create the context not the actual context attributes as i understand it

28752303
xslt	schematron
still xslt is not a validation language
i assume someone is eventually going to contribute an xslt answer - so i would like to suggest something else schematron

28752303
xslt	schematron
if the input document contains the following structure the validating application would complain saying that schematron files can be interpreted with the schematron reference implementation - an xslt stylesheet - or environments like oxygen
aside note it would not be too difficult to translate the sch rules above to xslt because they are very similar

28753835
centos	linux
the reason is amazon linux keeps changing the abi application binary interface and is not compatible with centos rehl
you can create the package and build your package on amazon linux by using this script

28762487
oncreate	setcontentview
in oncreate or you re not doing it before findviewbyid or you re using a different layout.xml
most likely you re missing setcontentview r.layout.your_layout

28763722
fgets	fread
fgets is useful for reading text but not so much for binary data
use fread instead and don t do the silly seek to the end trick to find the size of the data

28764625
cstdio	iostream
in c++ stdio.h became cstdio in c++ you are not supposed to use it use iostream instead
iostream is the c++ header for the input output classes and objects std cout std cin ... . stdio.h is the c header for printf scanf .

28766204
inline	constexpr
the relevant clause is basic.def.odr 6 which states that an inline function can appear in multiple translation units but only given that ... a name can refer to a non-volatile const object with internal or no linkage if the object has the same literal type in all deﬁnitions of d and the object is initialized with a constant expression 5.19 and the object is not odr-used and the object has the same value in all definitions of d
as the objects are const they have internal linkage per basic.link 3 a name having namespace scope 3.3.6 has internal linkage if it is the name of ... a non-volatile variable that is explicitly declared const or constexpr and neither explicitly declared extern nor previously declared to have external linkage ... however taking the address of or forming a reference to a variable for argument passing is odr-use so f_a2 and f_b2 are invalid

28767060
ssl	https
on the networking side you cannot redirect at the ssl layer - hence you need a full https server and redirect the get post request once the ssl handshake is complete
the response code and the actual do_post or do_get implementation would be exactly the same for both http and https

28769675
oncreate	setcontentview
you do not have to return view in oncreate method
setcontentview r.layout.stop10

28771588
hive	hdfs
i wouldn t say it s necessarily a mapreduce vs hive difference though there are possible reasons it could be more common to run into this type of slowness using hive
it s true that metadata operations like stat getfilestatus have a slower round-trip latency on gcs than local hdfs on the order of 30-70ms instead of single-digit milliseconds

28773514
g++	gcc
your code will work with g++ not gcc
use g++ instead of gcc

28773672
swift	objective-c
as shown in the documentation you cannot make a static framework library with swift and dynamic libraries are only supported in ios 8+
the only option i recommend is that you develop an objective-c static framework for ios 7 and then begin to use swift when you wish to drop ios 7 support

28775868
implements	extends
we know that classa and classb will implements their sanitizeauthor methods differently
the abstract class abstractsanitizer was made the way it was because the sanitizeauthor method from the the sanitizerinteface isn t implemented in abstractsanitizer so we have to extends it to provide the functionality

28776166
bash	zsh
the cross-shell version is complex but it should work robustly bash verified on 3.57 and 4.4.19 ksh verified on 93u+ zsh verified on 5.0.5 - be sure to call this outside of a function cross-shell bash ksh zsh posix-compliant
not a one-liner single pipeline for technical reasons and not fully robust see bottom explanation bash note the technique was adapted from user5754163 s answer as it turned out to be more robust than the original solution 1 bash allows return statements only from functions and in a script s top-level scope only if the script is sourced

28776166
bash	zsh
note that causes a syntax error in bash zsh and dash so be sure to execute it conditionally in multi-shell scripts
unlike in bash and are not guaranteed to be exactly identical in the non-sourced case as may be a relative path while is always a full path so must be resolved to a full path before comparing

28776166
bash	zsh
unlike in bash and are not guaranteed to be exactly identical in the non-sourced case as may be a relative path while is always a full path so must be resolved to a full path before comparing
zsh contains information about the evaluation context - call this outside of a function

28779153
punctuation	words
normalize the string to lowercase remove punctuation split into tokens - use some stemming algorithm like porter snowball
after that you could filter out pairs that do not share any or substantial amount of words

28779418
swift	objective-c
if you re going to create your instances of classtwo in swift and just make existing instances available to objective-c by passing them to objective-c methods or storing them in properties that s not a problem
but if you want to create instances of classtwo in objective-c you need to provide a way to do that

28779876
subtraction	modulo
the subtraction of unsigned values is well-defined by 3.9.1 basic.fundamental 4 unsigned integers declared unsigned shall obey the laws of arithmetic modulo 2 n where n is the number of bits in the value representation of that particular size of integer
46 46 this implies that unsigned arithmetic does not overflow because a result that cannot be represented by the resulting unsigned integer type is reduced modulo the number that is one greater than the largest value that can be represented by the resulting unsigned integer type

28779883
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
the video works in firefox and google-chrome but not iphone or ipad
read more here on mobiforge.com about byte-range requests in appendix a streaming for apple iphone first the safari web browser requests the content and if it s an audio or video file it opens it s media player

28780966
build.gradle	gradlew
build.gradle application.java
i m not sure if you are using gradlew as your build system

28783236
listview	gridview
well there is no listview in mvc
at least i hope there isn t. listview is a webforms control just like gridview or repeater or any other data-bound control that would do this

28783706
debian	linux
if you remove that line i believe the full build will not descend into that directory attempt to build a debian package or any other linux redhat rpm
the debian installer package is underneath of that

28785041
boost	stl
or use boost multi-index container
stl does not have the kind of container you may write your own using std unordered_map and std list

28785100
union	distinct
you need to use the array.length property to get the number of distinct users in a or b use the following db.a.distinct user .length db.b.distinct user .length to get the number of distinct users in a union b use array.prototype.concat and array.prototype.filter
you can t use count with distinct to get the number of distinct users in your collection because it is not an array method and distinct returns an array

28785165
ansible	puppet
if you compare it with ansible puppet does not support running ad-hoc commands inherently otherwise
it does not work over ssh like ansible does

28786121
google-chrome	firefox
it doesn t work in my browser google-chrome
which probably means you re using firefox

28787133
swift	objective-c
interestingly this works just fine in pure swift classes
for example this works as expected the reason it does not work for you is because you are working with objective-c classes since uibutton is an objective-c class all its subclasses will be too

28790021
uiview	subviews
i assume from the error you are reporting and your code that firstview is a uiview
now you have added inertia as a subviews of firstview but that does not create a property named inertia on the view

28790604
rdf	owl
second the rdf xml syntax so to express that as an owl ontology in rdf xml syntax the final layout would look like this
first some theory owl doesn t provide built-in primitives for defining part-whole relations as explained in the w3c working draft

28790718
nsstring	nsobject
instead make one for uitextfield or nsstring
this isn t something you want for all nsobject it is just for checking the length of a string for a uitextfield

28790751
vsto	add-in
ok i finally found an answer to this it appears since vsto 4.0 - you must have |vstolocal at the end of the manifest registry key for it to use the .config file from the folder and not from the cache
my issue was solved by adding |vstolocal to the regkey but since i want the add-in dll to be placed on a network drive this caused trust issues with outlook which for some reason appearse to be not supporting network drive-installed add-in by default

28794826
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
the tab bar controller sees that the selectedviewcontroller is not a uinavigationcontroller and applies the normal layout rules
but contained navigation controller sees that its tabbarcontroller property contains a valid uitabbarcontroller instance and assumes that it is still responsible for handling the tab bar height when laying out the content your view controller

28797998
implements	extends
the override keyword is also not required for methods that are implements an abstract method or i guess not doing anything at all in this case
so really b is equivalent to or really just since b will be assumed to be abstract trait b extends a similarly to the linked answer i can imagine once scenario where using override might be useful for readability

28801184
super	implements
our trait tries to call a super type method that isn t implements
one solution is to add a default to the super trait pollable this sorta works here but is sorta dumb in a lot of real world applications

28805873
strcpy	strncpy
this is not only inneccessary it is also dangerous because strcpy could overflow the buffers
taking care of overflow with strncpy couldtruncate the input strings

28807359
build.gradle	gradlew
the problem was that the buildtools were not being setted by the build.gradle as we expected
instead there was another plugin rosjava android which was calling the gradlew build

28807682
postgresql	mysql
let s look at the example table order matters when the words are quoted when we remove the quotes it will search for rows containing words database or comparison order doesn t matter now if we want to get rows containing either word postgresql or phrase database comparison we should use this request fiddle make sure that the words you are searching for are not in the list of stopwords that are ignored
here is how you can use mysql full text search here you need not have to break the bigger input string into an array to compare with each individual word

28811844
junit	mockito
however for more complex scenarios i find it easier to just use a local rabbitmq together with a junit rule to only run the tests if rabbit is running
in some cases it s not trivial but the spring amqp framework itself uses mockito fairly extensively for mocking

28812314
build.gradle	gradlew
copy the mylib-0.1.aar file into the libs folder add these lines to the bottom of build.gradle should be app not project so far so good
here comes the most important point gradlew needs to access the network for dependencies unless offline mode is enabled

28813582
strdup	malloc	memcpy	malloc	strcpy	malloc
in situations like that you should use strcpy like this if all members of planete are primitives or arrays you could simply memcpy the entire thing like this if nomplanete were a pointer you would have to do a separate malloc or use strdup
it looks like you do not need a separate malloc for nomplanete because it is an array

division	subtraction
if 10 4 were treated as the division of two int then the result would also be an int and that cannot be assigned to a double . note that this is different from which does an int division and converts the result to double . double has an init _ v int constructor and therefore 10 4 can be treated as the division of two int here
it really looks a bit strange if we summarize these results now we can apply these results to your expression 10 3.0 - 10 3 the first part 10 3.0 can only be a double therefore - must be the floating point subtraction operator and thus 10 3 must also be a double

28813854
google-chrome	safari
use google-chrome instead
it s march 2015 and the add watch expression feature is not yet present in safari

28815536
required	placeholder
this required escaping data for presentation for example the htmlspecialchars method
if you re disciplined about using placeholder you shouldn t have any problems with your database security

28820357
nsorderedset	nsset
you could keep the order of your objects by using an nsorderedset
if you implement isequal and hash on your object it will automatically not allow duplicate objects in an nsset

28821190
inline	inlining
it does inline sendtissues and sendmonkeys but doesn t go the next step to inline request as well of course it s entirely possible to make tiny changes to this and not get the code inline - such as adding some conditions that depend on variables that the compiler can t determine at compile-time
edit i did add a string and an integer to foo and updated these with an external function at which point the inlining went away for both clang and gcc

28821708
base	fractions
there are two different possibilities for the final two characters if localhost_number is not set this value is the fractions part of the time of reception normally in units of 1 2000 of a second but for systems that must use base 36 instead of base 62 because of case-insensitive file systems the units are 1 1000 of a second
if localhost_number is set it is multiplied by 200 100 and added to the fractions part of the time which in this case is in units of 1 200 1 100 of a second

28824727
addition	modulo
this assumes that subtract ages will not cause an overflow which could happen if their signs differ essentially making this addition and the sum of their magnitude was greater than age s type can hold
another important point to note is don t use subtraction for comparing integral values because result of subtraction can overflow as every int operation in java is modulo 2 32

28824794
client-side	server-side
client-side schmlient-side the main point of vaadin is that as a programmer we think in terms similar to building a desktop app
we do not really worry about client-side versus server-side of the app

28825547
ssl	https
when a client connects to tidtcpserver ssl tls is not activated by the server by default so the server can analyze the client maybe even communicate unsecurely with it before deciding whether ssl tls is needed
this is to facilitate the server listening on multiple ports where not all ports use ssl tls at all think http vs https and to handle starttls -based protocols

28826534
express	node.js
nginx is sometimes used in concert with node.js it has many features but not usually as the main functionality that express offers
you can read for yourself the api that express offers here and get a direct feel for what it adds to the base http server

28826841
inline	inlining
the only solution is to define function in every files which need inline thoses functions
inlining occurs during compilation and not linking and inlining is only available with completly defined function at compilation time

28830213
inline	inlining
not actually makes very little difference results struct get property 0.3097832 seconds struct inline get property 0.3079076 seconds struct method call with params 1.0925033 seconds struct inline method call with params 1.0930666 seconds struct method call without params 1.5211852 seconds struct intline method call without params 1.2235001 seconds you re best letting the compiler do its thing until you find that you re seeing some real measurable performance issues
you could apply to the method to try and force inlining however from this programmer.se answer you can see that inlining vs

28830766
super	implements
what you print out is not my methodvisitor but the value returned by the super invocation of visitmethod in other words the default value returned by classvisitor.visitmethod returns an object to visit the byte code of the method or null if this class visitor is not interested in visiting the code of this method
since the abstract class classvisitor does not implements any action it has no interest in visiting the method and therefore null is the perfect return value

28831932
qwindow	qwidget
i found a solution it is necessary to install event filter on qwindow and process events there eventfilter
it is possible to install event filter on qwidget container but it doesn t work on os x

28835778
azure	hdinsight
linq to hive as shown in microsoft .net sdk for hadoop in codeplex is part of an incubator project and not included in azure hdinsight .net sdk yet
so as of now i can t use linq to query the hdinsight hive table via the official sdk

28837856
jar	war
it is usual that it contains jar files and or web archives war files
java runtime will not execute an ear file as it will do for a jar file using java -jar so you cannot use the command line for running a java executable

28839535
client-side	server-side
your conta function will need to return a jsonresponse instead of an httpresponse in order to do the redirect on the client-side
you re trying to check a server-side value on the client but the problem is that the if c.alive statement only gets evaluated when your view is rendered - not as the status of c changes

28842531
bower	npm
however the answer form this stackoverflow thread worked - bower command not found basically the author there said i wasn t setting npm prefix properly and to fix that the following was required
i had the same problem but for some reason the top answer here reinstalling bower and running sudo bower install --allow-root didn t work for me

28842596
comparator	comparable
from the api public static t max collection coll comparator comp returns the maximum element of the given collection according to the order induced by the specified comparator
all elements in the collection must be mutually comparable by the specified comparator that is comp.compare e1 e2 must not throw a classcastexception for any elements e1 and e2 in the collection

28843291
thin	webrick	thin	unicorn
all is not lost as in order to run your project locally on windows you can use other less demanding gems - i used thin for a while but then realised that rubymine would quite happily load up the rails application with webrick
if you have a production linux server and want to use unicorn there but prefer using thin locally you can edit your gemfile as follows platforms ruby do gem unicorn end platforms mswin do gem thin end this will load the appropriate gems depending on the environment

28845144
factors	mean
to be clear you are aiming to avoid sustained high load where there are tasks every tick rather than aiming to minimise the scheduling delay. correspondingly the metric you should be looking at when considering the fudge factors is the load not the lateness
if you have full knowledge of the system the number of tasks their rescheduling intervals the distribution of their execution time you could in principle exactly solve for a handicap value that would give you a mean target load when busy or would say only exceed the target load 10 of the time when busy or so on

28858284
boost	allocator
the solution is to use boost scoped_array
this line dynamically allocates a single float and initializes it to size it isn t allocator an array of size elements

28859309
viewdidload	viewdidappear
in your viewdidload method instead of use edit for your specific project you re not getting the _pagecontrol it s returning nil because the storyboard has not completed instantiating your view controller in the viewdidload
i thought it would need to go in viewdidappear animated but that didn t work either so i cheated by delaying requesting it for 0.2 milliseconds

28860064
oncreate	setcontentview
create a new fragment class called mytabhostfragment like this now in your mainactivity modify your displayview method like this and make sure that in the oncreate method of your mainactivity you have setcontentview r.layout.activity_main
and not setcontentview r.layout.tabhost

28862413
tostring	string.format
the reason is because of call to tostring in string.format and not specifying the place holder
string.format 0.0000 coefficient.tostring string.format with your format should expect a floating point number it will not work on string values for string values format would be ignored and passed value will be returned

28863623
octal	decimal
therefore all es5 compliant implementations will parse as decimal and not as octal
ecmascript 3 said when radix is 0 or undefined and the string s number begins with a 0 digit not followed by an x or x then the implementation may at its discretion interpret the number either as being octal or as being decimal

28863623
octal	decimal
ecmascript 3 said when radix is 0 or undefined and the string s number begins with a 0 digit not followed by an x or x then the implementation may at its discretion interpret the number either as being octal or as being decimal
implementations are encouraged to interpret numbers in this case as being decimal

28866204
super	extends
it s interesting to note that because all classes are extensions of the class object there is a call to a super class constructor at the beginning of every constructor that you ll ever write - either an explicit one you ve included with or without arguments or the default super class constructor if you do not specify
when you have a class that extends some other class eg cougar extends feline there must be a call to the super class at the top of the constructor

28867330
single-quotes	double-quotes
use single-quotes on the argument to solve this
you re using double-quotes on the argument to bash here so the in the argument is expanded by your current shell not by the bash command you re executing

28869687
ssl	https
try changing the default project url to the ssl one in web project- properties- web- project url to the url with https
it looks like iis express is not starting the project under the https url

28871455
fgets	fgetc
try this example where usage of fgetc allows using fscanf instead of fgets + sscanf note this code will work when your file has only numbers separated by single n or spaces for case of letters or combinations as number n space before newline it becomes unstable
in c not c++ you should combine fgets with sscanf function

28874430
swift	objective-c
reference so far phonegap not support swift yet
it s support only for objective-c ios

28877561
swift	objective-c
rather than force swift down the developer s throat apple has made it easy to allow objective-c to interoperate with swift
apple s intention to replace the objective-c language using swift it is not practical in the short term simply due to the fact that developers are deeply entrenched in objective-c

28881935
opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i don t know if google-chrome or opera do but i suspect they don t either
firefox doesn t support screen-sharing from android yet it may in the future

28886009
swift	objective-c
either with an optional cast or with a forced cast if you are sure that all objects are strings since nsarray bridges to array seamlessly you can alternatively use the array enumeration or if you need the elements together with their index update for swift 3.0 with enumerateobjects using enumerate as swift array enumerate elements and indices as swift array
in swift you cannot tweak the block closure signature as in objective-c you have to cast explicitly

28889761
junit	testng
in junit you can do parameterized testing with zohhak
it let s you write i m not aware if there is something similar in testng but it s rather easy to implement using custom dataprovider that scans annotations of a current test method you can also check spock

28890591
google-chrome	firefox
find and children as example in google-chrome seem to work differently with regard to namespace
firefox is consistent however for all methods while google-chrome doesn t like s fontslot firefox doesn t like fontslot by itself

28890611
translation	localization
the only thing you may need to do yourself is to extend the grunt script to parse for any custom translation functions you may add but maybe you can live without those than you wouldn t need to do anything
this is more a comment than an answer however my repu still is too low o localization normally is only needed client side there are exceptions but not many and they can be dealt with and as meteor is quite young with an own templating engine it s normal that you find more hacks than stable solutions

28892567
build.gradle	gradlew
go to file project structure click app in the list on left click dependencies tab on top click green plus click file dependencies find your library should be in libs folder if not add it in system exploler click ok apply ok rebuild gradlew if you get error change build.gradle in your library compilesdkversion minsdkversion targetsdkversion to match with your app build.gradle
edited answer gradlew change it

28893654
dictionary	map
here s how you can implement a visible cache instead of clearing the map keep track of which places are currently shown on the map along with the marker in a dictionary
if the place is in bounds only add a new marker if the place doesn t exist in the dictionary

28894680
erlang	elixir
the record module that now exists in elixir is only used for two things to work with short internal data to interface with erlang records this means you should probably not be using them unless you are trying to extract record information from an erlang file
regarding your original question here s how i would convert erlang records and elixir structs back and forth

28894788
uiview	subviews
when you do viewwithtag it will return a single uiview object it doesn t work well with views with the same tag number
so it will return the first uiveiw it comes across with the tag 8 so what we want to be doing is looping through all the subviews held within that one view

28897097
express	node.js
the node.js response object doesn t have a send method so i m assuming you are using express
from the documentation when the parameter is an array or object express responds with the json representation restify does the same thing you can pass send either a code and body or just a body

28902914
google-chrome	firefox
this sound like a case of missing chain certificates. google-chrome usually downloads missing certificates while firefox does not
but firefox on desktop caches chain certificates it finds in other connections so it works if the user visited other sites before which used the same chain certificates

28904483
build.gradle	gradlew
for example in your build.gradle specifiy compilesdkversion 16 if you haven t installed the lvl 16 platform files your app won t compile
gradlew will ask you to download them via the sdk manager but not download them for you

28904984
trie	tree
a suffix trie is a special data structure that can be viewed as an automaton. since this is a suffix trie and not a suffix tree each substring of the original string has an explicit state in the trie that represents it
any leaf of the trie will represent a specific suffix of the original string

28904984
trie	tree
the complexity will be o n² where n is the length of the original string because the number of nodes in a suffix trie is o n²
edit after being downvoted i insist on the fact that we are working on a suffix trie not a suffix tree

28905297
rpm	yum
you could not perform update with rpm because on install path was glibc-common-2.12-1.149.el6_6.4.i686 package
only one glibc-common package is allowed. look at your yum output

28905966
division	modulo
i figured out the answer to your second question because it was bugging me too--zac s response is close but the loss of the result of 1 4 is because of python 2.x is truncating integer division results
so it s evaluating the modulo first then the division which since it isn t float is returned as 0

28905979
pickle	dill
from python cannot pickle a file object or any object with a reference to a file object because python cannot guarantee that it can recreate the state of the file upon unpickling
from dill extends python s pickle module for serializing and de-serializing python objects to the majority of the built-in python types

28906587
mapply	do.call
arguments this still is not flexible because you ll have to specify each argument since mapply accepts only .
do.call is handy for cases where you have a function s arguments in a list do.call mapply c cbind mylist r has a dotted mapply that accepts its .

28908085
division	multiplication
while there are instructions that are clearly documented to work that way integer division for example there are very strong indications that integer multiplication is done in a constant number of cycles in modern processors regardless of input
the note in intel s documentation that initially made me think that the number of cycles for integer multiplication can depend on input data doesn t seem to apply to these instructions

28908120
allocator	stl
the docs describe it as follows a is a dynamically growable array of t however just the storage re allocator is lockfree threadsafe not the elements itself
a concurrent_vector never moves an element until the array is cleared which can be an advantage over the stl std vector even for single-threaded code and operations on concurrent_vector are concurrency safe with respect to growing not for clearing or destroying a vector

28908234
google-chrome	firefox
so adding to link-to helper solved my issue note in google-chrome elements inside just work fine
another issue in firefox and solution to it - make sure you re not using any anchor elements inside

28911068
ssl	https
i m not sure whether a web proxy would help in anyway because the browser always interprets these links as http even if your server is ssl enabled
for more information about mixed content the correct way to deal with this situation is you must modify all your links to load content with https

28912088
swift	objective-c
therefore because nsmutabledictionary and fbgraphobject do not formally conform to fbopengraphobject the swift cast fails
you can create objective-c apis to perform the cast as a workaround

28912341
implements	extends
so the user class doesn t need to implements those methods as long as they are inherited
if you want you could implements them and override extends the inherited functionality

28913426
super	self
to execute init code for a new document the problem in swift is that you can not call a convenience initializer in super
instead you must delegate to a designated initializer in self

28916046
wildfly	jboss
jboss 7 is an implementation of javaee 6. wildfly 8 is an implementation of javaee 7
wildfly is the new name of jboss so that the company jboss and the application server jboss cannot induce confusion anymore

28916046
wildfly	jboss
wildfly is the new name of jboss so that the company jboss and the application server jboss cannot induce confusion anymore
think of wildfly 8 as jboss 8 just with a different name

28916343
single-quotes	double-quotes
when using the print function with a string enclosed in single-quotes a single-quote requires an escape character but a double-quote does not
for a string enclosed in double-quotes a double-quote requires an escape character but a single-quote does not print hello print hello print hello print hello if you want to use both single- and double-quotes without worrying about escape characters you can open and close the string with three double-quotes or three single-quotes print in this string i can use either. print same with this string

28918258
prng	random
there are two kinds of interpretation of the word pseudo in pseudo random number generator prng
it can either mean that the results may not be fully random

28921725
wildfly	jboss
basically jboss 7.x jee6 jboss eap 6.x jee6 wildfly 8.x jee7 red hat typically backports security fixes from newer versions into older versions red hat also typically releases feature packs that allow you to access newer features specs
so if it is a very important project and you do not need jee7 specs you may want to use jboss eap which is the productized version of jboss 7

28926628
glfw	sdl
if you want more control over event management there s glfw
originally not intended for opengl but opengl support having found its way into it pretty soon there s sdl which is very popular among game developers also aaa ones

28929889
boost	allocator
support array types - either one of unknown size or one of fixed size - in both cases a boost shared_ptr is returned note that std shared_ptr does not support arrays at this time
allocate_shared is used just like make_shared except that you pass an allocator as the first argument

28930337
super	extends
this means when compiling super and sub a compile error should return as sub.get has the same erasure as super.get but neither overrides nor overloads super.get
it cannot override because the bounded type x extends number is not a subtype of the type x and it cannot overload because the return type is not part of a method signature

28931710
inline	inlining
however a little known fact is that inline can also hurt performance your cpu has an instruction cache with a fixed size and inlining has the downside of replicating the function at several places which makes the instruction cache less efficient
so from a performance point of view it s generally not advisable to declare functions inline unless they are so short that their call is more expensive than their execution

28932496
daemons	systemd
afaik tomcat does not support socket activation so if you want to use an privileged port and run the daemons under an unprivileged user jsvc might still be necessary
in general most of the functionality provided by jsvc is provided by systemd with the exception of opening of privileged ports see below

28932496
daemons	systemd
systemd opens the socket and hands it to the daemons as an open file descriptor like stdin stdout stderr
the daemons can then be started as unprivileged user and does not drop privileges itself

28933342
wildfly	jboss
which ever one used may not have a difference in the marshalling result but is relevant to the next part of this answer also see here - though this mentions jboss as7 i m not sure if it applies to wildfly
i think wildfly uses jackson 2 by default though

28933860
scheme	racket
if you re really interested in using r 5 rs scheme there exists an implementation of srfi 19 time data types and procedures bundled with racket
r 5 rs does not have a module system so there is no formally-specified way of loading external libraries in pure scheme

28933860
scheme	racket
r 5 rs does not have a module system so there is no formally-specified way of loading external libraries in pure scheme
you ll need to use the racket # require extension to load the srfi implementation # require srfi 19 this will give you access to all the srfi 19 functions and values

28933979
google-chrome	firefox
namely #advertise i use the adguard extension in google-chrome and below is the css it plugs into my html pages to hide ads so im guessing your using an adblocker in firefox
it is the opposite for me your entire site works in firefox for me but not in google-chrome looking through your code its being caused by your naming conventions

28935545
base	fractions
this standard gives 52 bits to the significand fractions approximately 16 decimal digits of accuracy 11 bits to the exponent and 1 bit to the sign plus or minus in particular a number like 0.4 can not be represented as for some fractions in base 2 and an exponent that can be represented with 11 bits -1022 through 1023
viewing 0.4 in hex for example we see the best approximation in our set of numbers is trying to represent this in base 2 we have but written in base 2 has a repeating string of four binary digits 0.1001100011000110001... so can never be represented using a finite number of binary digits

28936315
portrait	landscape
it will not see where you forced the other viewcontrollers into portrait
in the project file make sure you are supporting the landscape orientations now in all of your viewcontrollers that should still be portrait only add this code when your mpmovieplayercontroller view becomes fullscreen it will be a new viewcontroller layered on top of everything else

28939939
bash	zsh
bash 1 if parameter is unset or null the expansion of word is substituted
otherwise the value of parameter is substituted while the zsh manpage does not explicitly mention that word is again expanded this is covered by the above mentioned rule

28939939
bash	zsh
for bash it is explicitly stated that word is expanded
but for zsh it states that word is printed and not substituted

28939968
inline	inlining
the inline keyword is considered a hint to compilers however most compilers are much better at deciding what to inline than programmers so they usually ignore this hint
use for the inline keyword nowadays it to allow functions to be defined in the header and not generate multiple definition link errors which has nothing to do with inlining really

28939968
inline	inlining
use for the inline keyword nowadays it to allow functions to be defined in the header and not generate multiple definition link errors which has nothing to do with inlining really
also please note that inlining happens at a function call site so it doesn t make sense to say a function is inlined since it may be inlined in some places and not in others depending on the code around it

28942522
lisp	scheme
e.g. if you do in scheme this would be a function of three arguments but in common lisp it s a function of any positive non-zero number of arguments
this doesn t allow all scheme arglists

28943381
queue	fifo
updates amazon sqs now supports fifo queue
for a start amazon sqs is a pseudo-queue which means the delivery of every message if it reaches the queue is guaranteed but not in a fifo fashion which usually happens in a queue

28943381
queue	fifo
for a start amazon sqs is a pseudo-queue which means the delivery of every message if it reaches the queue is guaranteed but not in a fifo fashion which usually happens in a queue
if the order of messages is important to you and you want the queue to work in a fifo fashion the amazon sqs documentation states to handle this in your application logic as the messages from the amazon sqs will reach you out of sequence

28943456
lisp	scheme
define in scheme is not easily implemented in common lisp
it s not easily implemented in scheme either

28945725
exponent	addition
for example you could write the following function that will exponentiate a number note that the function returns a double value since if your exponent is negative the result cannot be expressed with an integral type
yes it is possible to only use addition to do exponentiation

28947972
google-chrome	firefox
apparently google-chrome doesn t reset the window.scrolly variable on hard refresh
according to my tests on osx firefox does

28951014
xjc	maven-jaxb2-plugin
next the jaxb schema compiler xjc which is called by the maven-jaxb2-plugin is not deterministic therefore the generated source code is not guaranteed to be identical between different code generations
this is definitely not an issue in the maven-jaxb2-plugin and i also won t call it a bug in xjc

28956885
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
runtimeexception are unchecked-exception that means you do not need to handle them
therefore c is a valid way of handling runtimeexception because c talks about doing nothing

28957784
spaces	linefeed
the s in the search pattern stands for any whitespace character tab linefeed carriage return spaces formfeed the + is there to match also multiple whitespace characters not just one
you can remove spaces and newlines using preg_replace and you can reverse a string using strrev

28957916
bmp	png
if you open a device using png bmp pdf etc
as suggested by andrie the best answer the windows with plots will not pop up open just .png bmp or .pdf files will be created

28962334
backtracking	greedy
therefore since the greedy algorithm will not provide optimal answers and even if it did i doubt that it would work with limited coins you should try dynamic programming or some enlightened backtracking
the wikipedia link is sparse on details on how to decide if a greedy algorithm such as yours will work

28963502
coalesce	isnull
the isnull return value is always considered not nullable assuming the return value is a non-nullable one whereas coalesce with non-null parameters is considered to be null
so the expressions isnull null 1 and coalesce null 1 although equivalent have different nullability values

28965220
octal	decimal
so for correctly converting of string to octal number you should use the intval function
it does not work because permissions should be in octal not in decimal

28965220
octal	decimal
it does not work because permissions should be in octal not in decimal
when you type 0755 as number - it is in octal format

28967268
dictionary	map
to access it you need to give the string you want as an index like so you also shouldn t put the imports on the same line although this is just a readability issue more detailed explanation dataset is a dictionary which on some languages is called a map or hashtable
in a dictionary you access values in a similar way to how you index in a list or array except the index can be any data-type that is hashable which is ideally unique identifier for each possible value

28969276
stateless	stateful
there s not much to be gained by running a stateless session
if you can achieve what you want using a regular stateful session leave it at that

28969796
postgresql	mysql
let s look at the example table order matters when the words are quoted when we remove the quotes it will search for rows containing words database or comparison order doesn t matter now if we want to get rows containing either word postgresql or phrase database comparison we should use this request fiddle make sure that the words you are searching for are not in the list of stopwords that are ignored
you can do it using mysql full text search here you don t need to break the bigger input string into an array to compare with each individual word

28972319
namenode	hdfs
if a network partition makes the client unable to communicate with either namenode then the cluster is effectively unavailable
hdfs high availability makes hdfs more available but not completely

28972659
sudo	passwd
basically i was looking for a way to send sudo commands through the notebook probably not very wise but i needed it for what i was doing
and i couldn t get a prompt for the passwd

28972894
translation	localization
all compiled translation files .qm should be in the translation directory and you would load them as shown in qfiledialog localization
unfortunately the qt libraries don t come with all translation for all languages and not all the translation supplied are complete

28973221
scheme	racket
still if you need to interact with scheme code that s probably your only reasonable option
racket pairs are different from scheme pairs since racket pairs are immutable while scheme pairs are not

28973221
scheme	racket
racket pairs are different from scheme pairs since racket pairs are immutable while scheme pairs are not
as far as i know there is no way to check for racket s immutable lists in pure r n rs scheme

28973221
scheme	racket
as far as i know there is no way to check for racket s immutable lists in pure r n rs scheme
however it is possible to use scheme s mutable lists in racket though of course that isn t really recommended

scheme	racket
however it is possible to use scheme s mutable lists in racket though of course that isn t really recommended
#lang racket require compatibility mlist test2.ss define a mlist 1 2 3 b a here s an excerpt from the documentation for compatibility mlist this compatibility mlist library provides support for mutable lists

.htaccess	httpd.conf
mon mar 09 23 08 08.289609 2015 core alert pid 4856 tid 1668 client 1 53855 c xampp htdocs shop .htaccess invalid command expiresactive perhaps misspelled or defined by a module not included in the server configuration this means you don t have mod_expires loaded
you need to uncomment out that line in the httpd.conf or use a2enmod if you have that

28973651
scheme	racket
force is not needed but it will overwrite an earlier version. then you just change your code to be scheme code hit run in racket and see the magic
when you say your code is written in racket

postgresql	mysql
here is an updated version of his answer using postgresql
the second part of sgeddes s answer doesn t work on postgresql the fiddle uses mysql

28975955
setinterval	settimeout
the package i use and like for this purpose is percolate studio s synced-cron the answer to why setinterval is not working in your case is addressed in the meteor documentation timers meteor uses global environment variables to keep track of things like the current request s user
to make sure these variables have the right values you need to use meteor.settimeout instead of settimeout and meteor.setinterval instead of setinterval

28977626
punctuation	words
note that this doesn t account for punctuation capitalization and so on
if you only want unique words the following will work actually set open filename.txt .read .split this creates a list open filename.txt .read .split of all the words in the file

28978432
vsto	add-in
here is my vsto add-in code when i open a workbook from our sps site i see the messagebox please try this same vanilla bare bones code and if the workbook open event still doesn t fire then check your trust center settings go through all the settings trusted locations trusted documents add-in file blocking privacy options
suggest you convert your com add-in to a vsto add-in to future proof it

28978432
vsto	add-in
suggest you convert your com add-in to a vsto add-in to future proof it
i know this is office2010 specific though from office2013 onwards com add-in are not fully supported - irrespective of sharepoint

28984455
multiplying	multiplication
num is not actually used in multiplying so there is no reason to pass it in
instead declare multiplying without the argument and call it from __main__ like this there seems no point in checking within multiplying whether it is supposed to perform multiplication as does this line and you try to call multiplying recursively which will fail .

28984739
centos	linux
i came to the following code it checks etc oracle-release for oracle enterprise linux etc redhat-release for rhel other derivatives etc suse-release for suse derivatives lsb_release output for any other linux it also cuts out irrelevant words centos release 6.3 final - centos 6.3
lsb in name lsb_release states for linux standard base but doesn t so standard

28988581
octal	decimal
your number isn t being changed rather it s exactly what you ve defined it as -- an octal number
when you begin a number with 0 it will actually represent that value as base-8 as opposed to base-10 -- decimal -- which you re used to

28989694
realloc	malloc
2 check the return value of function 3 in the case of realloc use a tmp variable to avoid memory leak 4 always call free once for each call of c m re alloc not doing so will result in memory leaks
a few generally accepted thoughts on malloc calloc and realloc function use 1 do not cast the return of these functions when using c

28991270
lemmatization	stemming
seems to me that you have two problems on your hands lemmatization which breaks words down into their lemma sometimes called the headword or root word
this is more difficult than stemming as it doesn t just chop suffixes off of words but tries to find a true root are be

28991846
ubuntu	debian
you used i assume ubuntu s version of pip which installs to usr local lib python2.7 dist-packages
see here . you used a locally built version of python and because it s locally built it uses usr local lib python2.7 instead of usr lib python2.7 and because it doesn t have debian ubuntu customizations it doesn t check use dist-packages

28991846
ubuntu	debian
see here . you used a locally built version of python and because it s locally built it uses usr local lib python2.7 instead of usr lib python2.7 and because it doesn t have debian ubuntu customizations it doesn t check use dist-packages
solution you should be able to add usr local lib python2.7 dist-packages to your usr local bin python s sys.path but since you re using ubuntu it s easiest to let ubuntu do the work for you use usr bin python instead of a local version

28993591
onresume	onpause
again if your activity comes back to foreground then onresume is called
so it is not like onresume is called before onpause

28993591
onresume	onpause
so it is not like onresume is called before onpause
whenever activity is returning from onpause state onresume gets called instead of onstart or oncreate

28993720
allocator	stl
using custom allocator in c++03 is difficult and not portable anyway so you should aim to use a c++11 compiler if you need to do this
i looked at allocator classes but it seems stl containers must be able to use the default constructors to create the allocator that s not true all containers can be constructed with an allocator explicitly so you can create your allocator object and then pass it to the container

28993720
allocator	stl
i looked at allocator classes but it seems stl containers must be able to use the default constructors to create the allocator that s not true all containers can be constructed with an allocator explicitly so you can create your allocator object and then pass it to the container
if you re using not using c++11 yet then you need to provide a lot more members for your allocator to meet the old requirements but the one above is ok for c++11

28993925
profiling	debugging
writes to text files can fail for similar reasons because for example you re writing to a user profiling location that the system account doesn t have
use session.log - that will write your debugging information to the msi log file that should help trace what s going on

28996622
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome has developer tools built in which allows you to inspect
if you are not in google-chrome firefox also has an inspector or you can download and use firebug

28997340
bellman-ford	dijkstra
bellman-ford is the one that can detect negative cost cycles and works with negative edges
dijkstra will not work if you can have negative edges

28997808
serializable	deserialization
oh yeah sure you can do that - but a true pass-through can only be made if you avoid deserializing the message altogether which you can easily do by using your own serializable
if you implement iserializemessages as say passthroughserializer you can configure the publisher like this as you can see your serializable needs to be able to turn an incoming receivedtransportmessage basically just a dictionary of headers and a into a message which is the same headers and an in your case you would just actually not do any deserialization and just pass the into the message and conversely pass it out again when it s time to create a transportmessagetosend

28999441
swift	objective-c
there are two methods for doing this 1 the following allows for a pure swift implementation by exposing the ifaddrs.h interface directly but sadly requires an exact path to the header file which is not desirable if you re ever going to release your library as open source
module.modulemap add to swift code import ifaddrs 2 the second way is to create an objective-c class which provides an interface to ifaddrs.h but hides the actual import of ifaddrs.h the source .m file

29000789
spaces	delimiter
it is trivial to add additional search and replace values to the spaces delimiter lists
if you want to include a spaces in the search or replace list then you must alter the t option delimiter to a character that is not used in either list

29006549
coalesce	isnull
coalesce param1 param2 param3.... can contains multiple parameter and there is condition of having it s 1 value mujst not be null
you can use isnull or coalesce both are same with a small difference

29012880
setinterval	settimeout
it will not have any impact on your setinterval call
the only difference between having the setinterval inside the settimeout is that it will only be triggered after the 800ms delay has elapsed

29013919
verilog	vhdl
not tested with verilog add the generated wrapper vhdl file to your project and assign it to a library. now specify one or more ipcore read directorys clickable this image shows my chipscope icon wrapper for 1..15 ports in the background
15 vhdl files are loaded as placeholders

29015836
division	modulo
so the code might look like remember to check that secondnumber is not zero otherwise you ll run a into division by zero
the simplest way to check if one number is a multiple of another is to use a modulo remainder after division operation

29016503
inline	inlining
my personal preference would be to use the inline version since the separate definition doesn t provide any value but i don t think it matters much
there is no difference aside from the existence of the eqset identifier and inlining concerns which can be solved with an pragma

29016688
pascal	delphi
the delphi compiler always names c++ namespaces for pascal unit names by uppercasing the first letter and lowercasing the remaining letters but this .hpp file has an all-uppercase jni namespace
the delphi compiler would not makes those mistakes

29016825
swift	objective-c
you re thinking of swift properties like they re equivalent to objective-c s ivars but that s not right
swift s properties are equivalent to objective-c s properties the methods that access the ivars

29019414
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome you must clear your cache. maybe it stupid but i spend all day to this problem maybe someone find it usefull
i found solution i used google-chrome and it not works when i try it in firefox all is good

29020135
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
2 even though your method throws nullpointerexception since you marked the method with throws exception compiler warns you to catch it in it s callers
3 same as 1st answer 4 same as 1st answer illegalargumentexception extends runtimeexception 5 thrownpe does not throw anything at all

29021516
3des	aes
this means that an 8 byte message will be 16 byte long for 3des and 16 byte long for aes
for example if the lengths of the plaintext messages are distributed uniformly then there is a 50 chance that you can distinguish between the two because 3des can have 24 byte ciphertexts but aes cannot

29021516
3des	aes
for example if the lengths of the plaintext messages are distributed uniformly then there is a 50 chance that you can distinguish between the two because 3des can have 24 byte ciphertexts but aes cannot
or said differently you can find out if it is 3des in 50 of the time but you cannot say for sure if aes was used

29021862
bash	zsh
in bash variables not supported
however valid in ksh and zsh

29022889
swift	objective-c
when the objective-c method name is converted to swift the first parameter becomes the method name so you get the short answer to your question is that you are overriding the function with that signature not the tableview property
the objective-c syntax of that same method is which gives a method signature of tableview numberofrowsinsection when you are used to objective-c you kind of mentally ignore the tableview part and focus on the numberofrowsinsection

29023365
apache	nginx
if you are going the passenger + apache route the key step you seem to be missing is to run passenger-install-apache2-module which provides the right values for passengerroot passengerdefaultruby etc
locations.ini is a passenger + nginx config related item and does not apply for passenger + apache config

29023365
apache	nginx
locations.ini is a passenger + nginx config related item and does not apply for passenger + apache config
see the phusion passenger users guide apache version for details about how to configure passenger with apache

29023969
pickle	dill
other answers will fail as pickle cannot pickle a file handle
dill however can serialize almost every python object -- including a file handle

29026133
client-side	server-side
you can not create a site for your shop by using only client-side scripting languages if you want to maintain database
if you want to keep data in any database like mysql then you have to use some server-side technology php asp.net or jsp etc.

29027881
profiling	debugging
thanks paul for fixing this issue - we do not get that exception anymore. but we still are not able to get the profiling object - when we call com.ibm.sbt.services.client.connections.profiles.profileservice smartcloudoa2 .getmyprofile it returns null
during debugging we saw that sbt is internally calling in order to get my profiling feed

29030076
fread	calloc
the fread implementation _io_fread in libio iofread.c similarly multiplies nmemb and size together and only uses them to calculate the return value after that
unlike calloc it does not check for overflow. i m guessing the reasons for having two parameters might be historical

29030539
comparator	comparable
you will need to create a custom comparator which performs the operation you want and pass it to the sort method along with your list for example.
point2d does not implement the comparable interface

29030642
implements	extends
from documentation of you can see all elements in the list must implements the comparable interface which is enforced by so list should be declared to store elements of type which extends implements comparable but point2d.double doesn t implements comparable so it is not valid type
for this cases java adds method which allows you to create your own comparator so you could compare elements which don t implements comparable or to compare them in a different way than predefined

29030759
spaces	delimiter
proper csv requires separators and any fields with or spaces need to be wrapped with double quotes also any double quotes appearing in the fields need to be doubled two consecutive double quotes are treated as an escaped double quote
using non standard delimiter can be done but requires configuration on the client side app standard csv format does not

29031061
queue	fifo
queue or stack is an implementation technique and not really a data structure
if you want fifo implementation you implement queue on either arrays or linkedlist yes you can implement this technique on both these data structures hashmap hashmap is used whenever you want to store key value pairs

29031529
cdr	cons
t cons square-tree-map car t square-tree-map cdr t sq t should be if pair
by doing the above i saw that another if-check should be build around it to make sure we are not trying to map over a single value which is not possible in the end cons a car and a cdr is a redundant operation since by definition

29031953
union	distinct
select tutorsubject1 from tbltutor where tutorsubject1 is not null union select tutorsubject2 from tbltutor where tutorsubject2 is not null union select tutorsubject3 from tbltutor where tutorsubject3 is not null the important point here is that the union operator removes duplicates
you can use the union operator to get the distinct list of subjects

29035064
implements	extends
you can have the interface and then have an abstract class implements this interface and then have all other classes extends the abstract class
the abstract class doesn t have to extends the class from where you want to call the method you could call it from an instance of that class too

29036474
csv	tsv
you only have tried comma-separated and semicolon-separated csv
if you had tried tab-separated csv also called tsv you would have found the answer utf-16le with bom byte order mark tab-separated but in a comment you mention that tsv is not an option for you i haven t been able to find this requirement in your question though

29036997
clang	llvm
make_unique isn t available through gnustl from clang
you can try using llvm libc++ instead

29040308
bash	zsh
you can use extended globs which give you some regex like functionality another option is that bash has the operator in the conditional construct to match strings against a regex
this doesn t work in a case statement but works in an if finally if you want to do regular expression matching portably so it will run in other posix shells like ash dash ksh zsh etc you can call out to grep

29042930
client-side	server-side
if you could directly access files above the documentroot from the client-side browser then you would have a huge security vulnerability
however your server-side relative file-system path not a url resolves ok so you can access your xml files

29046519
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome seems to apply box-sizing border-box
to an input element as soon as you change the type to search but firefox doesn t do that currently i would say that firefox is right about that but i need to check this in the specs

29048193
octal	hex
advice for json implementers the json specs both version clearly say that hexadecimal and octal forms are not allowed
if you add support for hex and or octal or some other unofficial extension to your json parser you are adding to the fragmentation of the json standard

29048681
google-chrome	firefox
i used both firefox s and google-chrome s element inspectors and saw repeatedly that when the infobox got removed google maps api explicitly set the active cursor to the hand instead of leaving it as the default in a primary child div of the map
i added a document.body.style.cursor definition to your initialization code in the jsfiddle just to make sure the browser itself was not confused about the cursor even with that added using the element inspector say in google-chrome you will see that the div immediately below the div class gm-style ... gets its cursor style explicitly changed to a url of the hand when the infobox gets removed

29049536
jboss	weblogic	glassfish	weblogic
but you could do the following in netbeans to verify this select new project select java ee in categories enterprise application client in projects then click next give a projectname then click next you won t see oracle weblogic 12c in server drop-down list eventhough oracle weblogic 12c already configured in netbeans . but you d see glassfish jboss etc in the server drop-down list
oracle weblogic 12c doesn t support application client container i.e application-client.xml . i couldn t get a doc link for this

29049804
swift	objective-c
this of course works perfectly because you re setting a property as swift requires
as an educational aside you may sometimes see cases where when accessing objective-c properties from swift you not only can but must use the getter and setter methods - dot notation won t even work

29051537
daemons	systemd
and more than creating the listener is not done inside http daemons new
you can just check the errno from the underlying systemd call for problems while initializing the underlying socket

29051748
ssl	https
mine turned out to be a variable called ssl that was set to 1 when using https and not set at all when using http
i used that variable to redirect to https with php which is so much nicer than using htaccess but i think that any of the _server variables can also be accessed using htaccess if you re keen to continue to use that

29054116
jtextfield	jtable
jtable are not simple components like the jtextfield like other swing components they have an underlying data model check this example from the javadoc like in every ui object that follows the mvc pattern you don t use the graphical component to understand the values it has you use the data model
in you case save a reference to the data model of the jtable you created and call getrowcount to know how much data you have previously loaded

29054978
fgets	fread
fgets does not tell you how many bytes it read so you cannot safely read past the null bytes
you need to use fread and fwrite most probably

29056400
postgresql	mysql
to use the distance-measurement stuff in geodjango you ll need postgresql mysql s geospatial extension doesn t support lat long distance measurement
also if you use the mysql geospatial extension you ll have to use myisam tables instead of innodb

29056504
onclick	onchange
use the onchange event of the select instead as already discussed in this question javascript onclick alert not working in chrome
you should not use the onclick event within option elements

29061063
punctuation	words
i think apart from the s bit that you seem to want as one piece which doesn t make that much sense to me since for other punctuation chars such as
or you want individual parts you could do it by simply splitting at any whitespace or words boundary preg_split # s| b#u i search 1 regex regular expression to that s it is

29061431
ienumerable	ilist
ilist implements both ienumerable and icollection and add the integer indexing access to items which is not usually required as ordering is done in database
i remember it this way ienumerable has one method getenumerator which allows one to read through the values in a collection but not write to it

29062413
rspec	capybara
so the following two snippets of code are equivalent by default rspec sets app_host to which is why you can write code like when using capybara and rails straight out of the box and you don t have to write localhost every time
i was confused about app_host but after a dig around in the capybara source code it seems like it doesn t actually do very much

29064467
scikit-learn	libsvm
stuck for sometime then i went back to check the original libsvm package since oneclasssvm of scikit-learn is based on the implementation of libsvm as stated here
at the main page of libsvm they state the following for option -b that is used to activate returning probability output scores for some variants of svm -b probability_estimates whether to train a svc or svr model for probability estimates 0 or 1 default 0 in other words the one-class svm which is of type svm neither svc nor svr does not have implementation for probability estimation

29064965
swift	objective-c
you just need to learn enough about swift to translate from objective-c
however i have no idea how to do it in swift as described in the initialization section of using swift with cocoa and objective-c in swift you do this the fact that you re using cocoapods to manage this framework doesn t have any bearing on the situation

29065859
client-side	server-side
client-side scripts will typically effect data or ui elements already rendered on the clients screen pop-up alert on button press form validation etc which does not require any sort of server communication
it depends on whether the script is written in a server-side or client-side scripting language

29066121
hex	binary
call integer.parseint str 16 in a try-catch if you get a numberformatexception it wasn t a valid hex encoded int
computers perform math with binary not decimal and not hex

29068630
serializable	deserialization
according to your implementation only the user id is serializable to the session keeping the amount of data stored within the session small
when subsequent requests are received this id is used to find the user which will be restored to req.user in passports we are given option to write our own serialization and deserialization logic so that we can choose any appropriate database and not tied with strict rules

29071604
implements	extends
well one approach is to extends org.apache.xerces.dom.documentimpl which extends org.apache.xerces.dom.coredocumentimpl which implements org.w3c.dom.document
this approach doesn t require much code but it still makes us implementation dependent on xerces since we are extends documentimpl

29073038
swift	objective-c
it looks a swift compiler bug at least version 1.1 discussed here in a release build closures are not invoked sometimes especially when they are sequenced like the problem appears in swift only not in objective-c
it can be workarounded by setting swift compiler optimization level to none -onone if your app does not require the better performance by the optimization

29075731
spaces	delimiter
from rfc 2046 the only mandatory global parameter for the multipart media type is the boundary parameter which consists of 1 to 70 characters from a set of characters known to be very robust through mail gateways and not ending with white spaces
if a boundary delimiter line appears to end with white spaces the white spaces must be presumed to have been added by a gateway and must be deleted. it is formally specified by the following bnf so basically you should use a boundary string which doesn t contain a #

29076097
implements	extends
look in to mybatis dynamic sql mechanism it has been implements by sqlnode.apply dynamiccontext
however select without annotation will not pass parameter via dynamiccontext see also org.apache.ibatis.scripting.xmltags.xmllanguagedriver org.apache.ibatis.scripting.xmltags.dynamicsqlsource org.apache.ibatis.scripting.xmltags.rawsqlsource so solution 1 use selectprovider solution 2 extends languagedriver which will always compile sql to dynamicsqlsource

29077808
jar	war
exception is very self explanatory how to solve it. in your case add com.mysql.jdbc.driver driver class jar in your build deployment lib path you can download it here read here offical
java.lang.classnotfoundexception occured due to class not found in your project war ear

29077824
serializable	deserialization
serializable is a method for persisting data not code
the code for the serialized class needs to exist at deserialization time inside the jvm in which you are doing the deserializing

29080876
bower	npm
you probably ran sudo npm install -g bower when you installed bower because without sudo it didn t work
when that happens the owner of the bower program is not you but the root user and thus you have no access to it

29080876
bower	npm
when that happens the owner of the bower program is not you but the root user and thus you have no access to it
try this delete bower follw this post do npm install -g bower without sudo

29082672
h.264	hevc
there is a great example here but it s too large to copy-paste you calculate your target bitrate using and you launch ffmpeg two times one pass analyzes the media and the second does the actual encoding edit h.265 hevc is even better at compression 50 of h.264 size in some cases but support is not yet widespread so stick with h.264 for now
if you are targeting a certain output file size the best way is to use h.264 and two-pass encoding

29084345
swift	objective-c
likewise if you drag a .shader or .fsh or .vsh or really anything else that s not a swift c objective-c etc source file into your project that ll be treated as a bundle resource by default
i created a swift file changed its name for myfragment.shader that s your problem

29084740
ssl	https
this header will be present if the client contacted your outer server with http with ssl and the outer server communicates with an inner server over http without ssl
the inner server would not know that the initial request was with ssl and would send back a response to the outer server and then to the client to redirect to https

29091803
swift	objective-c
to your podfile because because apple doesn t let you build static libraries that contain swift
unlike objective-c apple doesn t ship the swift standard runtime libraries with ios

29093296
profiling	debugging
there are two reasons brackets uses a separate profiling for this remote debugging is off by default and enabling it requires re-launching chrome
using a separate profiling means your existing browsing session doesn t have to be restarted which would be disruptive if you have lots of tabs open

29093296
profiling	debugging
using a separate profiling means your existing browsing session doesn t have to be restarted which would be disruptive if you have lots of tabs open
it reduces security slightly -- other processes on your local machine could use the remote debugging api to monitor interfere with other browsing you do in this chrome window

29094170
single-quotes	double-quotes
the most important things in this case to keep in mind are these 2 if you have a variable var inside double-quotes then it will get substituted your string will now contain value whereas if it is in single-quotes then it will not get substituted it remains in your string as if you are need single-quotes as part of your string then use double-quotes around the string
i don t like contractions and i can t bear to use them. if you need double-quotes as part of your string then use single quotes to surround the string

29095183
gif	png
it echo sorry only jpg jpeg png gif files are allowed this is limitation simply because your code limits it as such
if the file is not of jpg png jpeg or gif it won t allow the upload

29095251
clang	llvm
i ll structure my answer with a list so that you get the full picture the answer to your main question being concluded in the last list item since mavericks the default compiler suite has been clang llvm instead of gnu gcc
synonyms for gcc and g++ that point to clang and clang++ respectively have been kept in order to preserve backwards compatibility and since clang is very much backwards compatible with gcc there s no reason not to do so

29095414
implements	extends
implements custom solution since the combobox does not support this functionality out of the box you will need to implements it yourself if you need it
good way is to use vaadin extensions to extends existing combobox component with functionality required

29100839
spaces	delimiter
as spaces seperates the numbers each getline is getting a string containing that number
the getline works as follows- getline cin str delim extracts characters from cin and stores them into str until the delimitation character delim is found or the newline character n where the delim is not there means getline cin str the extraction also stops if the end of file is reached in is or if some other error occurs during the input operation. if the delimiter is found it is extracted and discarded it is not stored and the next input operation will begin after it. each extracted character is appended to the string

29101689
shadowing	named
from the code in the myfunction method it s not possible to access the local variable from the scope outside it as the parameter is shadowing the variable
using this.logging doesn t access the variable it would access a property of the object by the same named

29102635
bash	subshell
you might want to re-read the bash man page s sections on compound commands and conditional expressions caps per the man page
your question puts the condition inside a subshell which is unnecessary. if you want to match arguments etc against regular expressions you can use a format like this or that said a regular expression isn t really needed here

29102689
aggregate-functions	sum
anytime you select aggregate-functions like avg sum max min etc.
alongside other columns you must group by all columns which are not aggregate-functions or constants

29103276
mp4	h.264
there are two h.264 stream formats and they are sometimes called annex b as found in raw h.264 stream avcc as found in containers like mp4 an h.264 stream is made of nals a unit of packaging 1 annex b has 4-byte start code before each nal unit s bytes
2 avcc is size prefixed meaning each nalu begins with byte size of this nalu some notes the avcc mp4 stream format doesn t contain any nals of type sps pps or au delimter

29104148
clang	llvm
note that clang still uses your system linker ld and this is fine
currently llvm does not yet provide a fully functional alternative to this program but they are working on it

29106289
ioexception	filewriter
public filewriter string filename boolean append throws ioexception constructs a filewriter object given a file name with a boolean indicating whether or not to append the data written
you need to use the filewriter constructor that takes a boolean argument indicating whether to append to the file or not

29107639
uialertview	uialertcontroller
the above should dismiss the alert automatically but if not you can implement alertview _ alertview uialertview clickedbuttonatindex buttonindex int and dismiss the alert from there
uialertcontroller is only available in ios8 or later per the apple docs

29108993
nhibernate	queryover
this class members can be used with queryover or criteria queries to ultimately generate sql from entities mapped with nhibernate
here s an example using the criteria api and the projections.property method since queryover is built on top of the criteria api you can still drop into the methods when queryover doesn t support what you re trying to do for some reason

29110756
floating-point	fixed-point
if the bass_data_fixed flag is used then the fft values will be in 8.24 fixed-point form rather than floating-point
each value or bin ranges from 0 to 1 can actually go higher if the sample data is floating-point and not clipped

29113638
serializable	deserialization
but if you think that is a performance-hit to your application than you should either use a text-field and serializable deserialize the json hashes when you need to or even better don t use activerecord at all
by creating heaps of classes and using magic-methods activerecord creates so much overhead that you shouldn t worry about the deserialization of json

29114553
profiling	debugging
there are two reasons brackets uses a separate profiling for this remote debugging is off by default and enabling it requires re-launching chrome
using a separate profiling means your existing browsing session doesn t have to be restarted which would be disruptive if you have lots of tabs open

29114553
profiling	debugging
using a separate profiling means your existing browsing session doesn t have to be restarted which would be disruptive if you have lots of tabs open
it reduces security slightly -- other processes on your local machine could use the remote debugging api to monitor interfere with other browsing you do in this chrome window

29115802
calloc	malloc
otherwise if the argument does not match a pointer earlier returned by the calloc malloc or realloc function or if the space has been deallocated by a call to free or realloc the behavior is undefined
so you cannot pass a pointer to free which is not returned by malloc or family

29122037
jar	war
you re probably using external configuration in the form of application.properties in the current directory when you re running your application as a jar
however current directory isn t very useful when deploying as a war in an external tomcat

29123321
listview	gridview
with listview you can simply declare the listview as root element and then add other scrollable content as headers or footers
gridview natively does not support this but fortunately there is subclass implementation of headergridview which solves this problem

29126124
ienumerable	iqueryable
so you are using a hammer like a screw and you complain that it isn t the right instrument - the extension methods given by microsoft that don t produce collections are normally iqueryable -safe except with expression vs func just out of curiousity the official reason of msdn is the iqueryable interface inherits the ienumerable interface so that if it represents a query the results of that query can be enumerated
enumeration causes the expression tree associated with an iqueryable object to be executed

29127962
rsa	aes
rsa is not a substitute for aes
aes is a symmetric cipher that can quickly encrypt and decrypt large messages

29129190
equals	gethashcode
since the gethashcode method built into string doesn t work that way the dictionary will need to get such a method from somewhere else and is the most logical place since the need for such a hash code would be very strongly associated with an equals method that considers fox and fox identical to each other but not to box or zebra
while it would be possible for a to have its getvalue and similar methods call equals on every single stored key to see whether it matches the one being sought that would be very slow

29132281
behat	codeception
however codeception does and behat can do so with the vipsoft extension
this blog post raises the question of what value codecoverage might be when running behat tests the nature of acceptance tests is not really to tests units of code but to assure that the behavior of your application meets a certain set of criteria behat scenarios

29133440
move	drag
compare it with chrome s result now just move the mouse just a hair console output now next set of tests now click outside the first span element and without releasing the mouse drag it to within the span element and then release
do not move the mouse after release

29134523
g++	gcc
after that i typed in gcc -c myclass_wrap.cxx -i c program files java jdk1.7.0_60 include -i c program files java jdk1.7.0_60 include win32 it s c++ code so in general prefer to compile with g++ instead of gcc though not strictly necessary g++ -c myclass_wrap.cxx -i c program files java jdk1.7.0_60 include -i c program files java jdk1.7.0_60 include win32 finally i typed in ld -g myclass_wrap.o -o libmyclass.so which produced bunch of undefined reference errors like myclass_wrap.o myclass_wrap.cxx .text+0xa8 undefined reference to __cxa_allocate_exception that example for building a shared library from the swig documentation was not for c++ so c++-specific symbols were not found by the linker nor was it for windows
assuming you re using the mingw version of gcc for windows use the following to compile a dll myclass.dll instead g++ -shared -o myclass.dll myclass_wrap.o for more information on building a dll with mingw see this example on the mingw site

29134630
profiling	debugging
you can use the flash remote debugging option just create a new remote debugging profiling then hit debugging and intellij waits until a swf debugging file is launched on your computer it can be with a standalone player or plugin in a browser
both of them need to be debugger versions and your swf needs also to allow debugging in flash cc default does not accept debugging you need to change the publish settings

29137699
fgets	getline
getline is far more flexible handling the allocation of space for you with fgets it is up to you
not to mention getline returning the actual number of chars read without having to call strlen

29148954
calloc	malloc
you can also use calloc if you don t want to have those lines
malloc doesn t initialize the members of the struct

29150774
symfony	silex
bolt cms is based on silex php micro-framework which in turn is based on symfony components not symfony framework
there are not any bundles but silex s serviceprovider s

29150843
google-chrome	firefox
you are getting a warning in google-chrome which is why it s being ignored but you won t get the same warning in firefox
mdn shows that it s a valid value because it is supported in firefox but it will be ignored anywhere else it s not supported

29151376
uiview	subviews
if you make a change to uiview which causes it to setneedslayout but layoutifneeded is not called therefore layoutsubviews is not called it will not update and therefore could cause issues with your animation
if you call it before hand it will ensure that if there was a change that needed your layout to be updated then it will apply it to your view and all of its subviews before animating

29154242
google-chrome	firefox
i wanted to add a couple things here the google-chrome bug referenced in damien s answer is still not fixed yet
printing in firefox works as expected

29154293
swift	objective-c
this gives some room for hacking in contrast to objective-c which parses the format string at compile time swift does not do that and just interprets it at runtime
use this one it s the same as printf or the objective-c formatting

29156780
ssl	https
some have suggested running jenkins from within tomcat and letting tomcat handle ssl i ve not tried this personally yet however
this looks like a known issue with trying to use https directly from the jenkins.war

29160972
postgresql	mysql
if you re not using mysql just replace mysql with sqlite or postgresql or whatever
to get the database connection parameters server username password etc if you re using mysql you can do this on my local development machine this gives driver mysql host localhost database local_dev_db username root password not-my-real-pwd ...obviously you should never show your password or any of these other details in your live app

29162026
super	implements
not super scalable
i think i ll end up implements 1 unless some parse pro has some last minute advice

29162912
profiling	instrumentation
to exactly specify the code position where profiling should start use the client request callgrind_start_instrumentation
callgrind_start_instrumentation start full callgrind instrumentation if not already enabled

29164498
oncreate	setcontentview
just a note if you want to continue to not see snapshots in recent list for the entire app all the implemented activities should specify in the oncreate method the flag getwindow .addflags windowmanager.layoutparams.flag_secure
before setcontentview

29164604
oncreate	setcontentview
just a note if you want to continue to not see snapshots in recent list for the entire app all the implemented activities should specify in the oncreate method the flag getwindow .addflags windowmanager.layoutparams.flag_secure
before setcontentview

29171551
client-side	server-side
that s how single page applications with client-side framework like angularjs came to being
the term templating is not used in the case of server-side

29176011
libstdc++	libc++
xcode the apple supplied compiler tools comes with two implementations of the std lib gcc s libstdc++ version 4.2
libc++ the first is very very old and does not support anything in c++11 such as

29179242
comparator	comparable
as you already noted implementing comparable and using the comparator method is probably the way to go in this case
another option is to create a comparator see the docs specially if it doesn t make sense for the class to implement comparable or if you need to compare objects from the same class in different ways

29179407
rar	zip
what makes rar cracking so difficult is a different salt for each rar file and more importantly the large and variable number of hash iterations that are needed before the decryption test can be performed
the newer zip process is similar but the iterations are not variable--last i checked--making it somewhat easier

29183202
bash	zsh
example as you can see it states zsh and not bash . to fix this i needed to add source .nvm nvm.sh to the .zshrc file as when starting a new terminal my deepin terminal zsh reads .zshrc and not bashs .bashrc
why does this happen this happens because when installing nvm it adds code to .bashrc as my terminal deepin terminal uses zsh and not bash it never reads .bashrc and therefor never loads nvm

29184194
zlib	libpng
it s slightly off topic but for gentoo you use crossdev to install the toolchain then a crossdev specific version of the normal package installation mechanism host -emerge to install zlib into the toolchain
also the arguments --with-zlib-include and --with-zlib-lib are not supported by any current version of libpng i can find

29185053
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
throws runtimeexception when some specific thing happens but then it probably belongs to javadoc not to method signature
runtimeexception is unchecked-exception and therefore can be thrown from any place in the code

29187000
ssl	https
specifically and i quote... note after april 2013 google does not issue ssl certificates for double-wildcard domains hosted at appspot.com
.appspot.com . if you rely on such urls for https access to your application change any application logic to use -dot- instead of .

29188105
robocopy	xcopy
robocopy is included in all windows versions from vista on the win7 version might run under xp as well - not tested though . besides it is way faster and and and.
there is no mirroring option in xcopy

29189881
uiview	subviews
well from the documentation of a uiview the value of this property is a floating-point number in the range 0.0 to 1.0 where 0.0 represents totally transparent and 1.0 represents totally opaque
this value affects only the current view and does not affect any of its embedded subviews

29196373
comparator	comparable
you could be getting which doesn t work unless you explicitly override comparator for that instance of object
the correct solution to this is to introduce a type parameter to the method such that the type you care about is bound to comparable

29197013
google-chrome	safari
ideally if the site runs fine on google-chrome it will be generally fine on safari too i m not talking about the older versions
one more thing google-chrome is css prefix free however safari may need -webkit prefix for some cutting edge features

29201807
firefox	safari
fixed in firefox 44
concerning safari 8 it s just not supported

29206307
vim	emacs
i originally started with vi real vi not vim and later started using emacs
these days i tend to use both but emacs more because emacs has some features i need which are not in vim

29207731
strdup	malloc
if you want a modifiable string or note that strdup is not standard but it s available on many implementations
you can assign in this way but then you don t need to reserve space with malloc hello world has his own address at some read only segment and any attempt to modify the string results in undefined behavior so you are not allowed to free it

29209923
uilabel	uibutton
i would suggest you to create custom uibutton and there add uilabel and uiimageviews to button
please be aware that you are allowed to add as much elements to button as you want since uibutton is subclass of uiview this is possible only through the code not through interface builder

29210321
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
there are several things you can do return null not the best practice though because the method s client will be forced to handle the possibly returned null and if he doesn t a nullpointerexception can be thrown
your method would look like in this case the client will have to deal with the case of null results throw illegalargumentexception or some other exception you can throw illegalargumentexception to denote there s no corresponding node for the provided id

29211729
aggregate-functions	sum
aggregate-functions in the select clause of a query that does not have a group by clause will return a null record
declare t table k nvarchar 50 val int select sum val avg val min val max val from t the above returns one row with all nulls

29212439
bower	npm
the source not including node or bower will be on their workstation
once they ve installed node.js they ll run npm install and the node directories will be created automatically for your project by downloading them from the internet

29212924
udp	tcp
since udp sockets do not accept but they do receive the distinction between boss group and worker group is meaningless and in the cited example the variable is just called group
it performs the same function as worker group in a typical tcp server namely it processes the incoming data

29219800
lemmatization	stemming
the stanford arabic segmenter can t do true lemmatization
however it is possible to train a new model to do something like stemming تكتبون ت+ كتب +ون يتصل ي+ تصل if it is very important that the output is real arabic lemmas تصل is not a true lemma you might be better off with a tool like madamira

29220573
ubuntu	debian
last but not least mosh is very nice on the ubuntu laptop as it automagically resumes sessions when i am back on the local network at home or work
in my case mosh from debian ubuntu on server and client

29220886
junit	testng
note that junit does not execute the test cases in the declared order - unless you use annotation fixmethodorder methodsorters.name_ascending
neither does testng by default

29222895
factors	matrix
as far as i know there is no way to keep the classification column in or at least not as a factors
and that is because the output is a matrix and therefore it is always numeric

29225971
profiling	debugging
the first thing that chef does when it starts - whether it s chef-solo or chef-client is profiling the system with ohai
a main difference between chef-solo and chef-client is that debugging log level will show the ohai output with chef-client but it does not with chef-solo

29228418
google-chrome	firefox
references sdk window utils sdk windows nsiwindowmediator working with windows in google-chrome code
firefox add-ons generally run in a scope where the global window object is not defined if it is defined depends on how the portion of your code that is currently running was entered

29230965
rsa	aes
on ios common crypto supports both asymmetric rsa and symmetric aes encryption
if there is not a compelling need for pki public key infrastructure use aes

29233463
queue	fifo
i am not sure why you need a fair synchronous queue and manage the thread access in fifo order
i had never seen this in real and also not sure if your application will work correctly even if you manage the fifo

29237662
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
you have to be sure that this controller is an uinavigationcontroller something like that should work
if rootviewcontroller is a uitabbarcontroller then rootviewcontroller.navigationcontroller won t work since your tabbar does not have a navigation controller

29237858
comparator	comparable
as others have already said you have objects in your array that cannot be compared using the comparator method in comparable however you can still do a sort by using a comparator as long as you have a well defined way of ordering integer and string
here is an example that orders objects based first on their class name and if they are the same class by using a comparator it s ugly but it works provided all the objects in your array implement comparable

29240007
implements	extends
interfaces do not implements other interfaces
interfaces can only extends other interfaces

29241658
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in terms of your last question i found this out for ie websql - not supported indexeddb - extensible storage engine for firefox websql - not supported indexeddb - sqlite for safari websql - sqlite indexeddb - sqlite for google-chrome websql - sqlite indexeddb - leveldb sources the webkit project
to address your first question websql was never implemented in either internet explorer or firefox

29243756
spaces	delimiter
you may be able to use the csv module if it s not tab delimiter you could read in the file line by line and split on white spaces
remove blank spaces and you ll have a line of data

29244400
serializable	deserialization
short answer is yes storing configuration as a serializable json document will give you the flexibility of changing and propagating changes easily likely with less code
ideally let the client do the deserialization assuming documents are fairly small 5k processing cost is negligible and as long as your access pattern is key vale based the database performance should not be different from accessing any other row by primary key

29246203
haskell	ocaml
these are called disjunctive patterns and haskell does not have them
ocaml and f# do. there are a few typical workarounds however

29246404
sudo	passwd
that s why there is not a chance to protect a directory from browsing by such a user unless you restrict the list of commands the user can execute with sudo
one idea could be to put the folder on a separate partition which is encrypted with a passwd

29250773
implements	extends
because it hasn t been implements yet
extends the subset of rust that counts as constant expressions can be done backwards-compatibly so there s no rush to do so before 1.0 and it s not even settled how it should be done how much should be allowed whether there should be a constexpr mechanism and how powerful it should be etc

29253196
super	extends
.----------. | enum | | yourbase | -------- ---------- .----------. | yourenum | ---------- this on the other hand is entirely ok .--------. | object | -------- | .--------. | enum | -------- | .----------. | yourenum | ---------- when the documentation says all classes in java extends java.lang.object class implicitly it simply means that each class either extends object directly or indirectly through it s super class
it simply means that you can not let your enums extends anything else than the implicitly extended enum

29254105
seaborn	matplotlib
now as part of setting itself up seaborn modifies to 0.5725490196078431 0.7764705882352941 1.0 which is an rgb tuple
if seaborn is not used then the value is the matplotlib default which is b a string indicating the colour blue

29254105
seaborn	matplotlib
if seaborn is not used then the value is the matplotlib default which is b a string indicating the colour blue
c_values is then used later on to actually plot the graph within ax.scatter the issue arises because the keyword argument c can accept multiple different types of argument it can accept - a string such as b in the original matplotlib case

29258933
lodash	underscore.js
i suggest when working with arrays collections consider working with lodash underscore.js two great modules that will make your life easier
i think finding an item by title is not unique enough consider using id but it is your choice this is how you can implement it easily with underscore.js another option without underscore.js below

29259429
client-side	server-side
i m not completely sure how ci handles cookies but it might also not store it client-side because of the secure entry so you can try disabling that as well
the cookie you are setting is likely stored server-side

29263171
persistent	transient
see what is persistent context
an unsaved transient instance is not in the persistent context

29263171
persistent	transient
an unsaved transient instances is not in the persistent context
transientobjectexception javadoc thrown when the user passes a transient instances to a session method that expects a persistent instances

29263171
persistent	transient
a persistent entity has both an in-memory object identity and a database identity defined by a database representation row uniquely identified by a primary key
a transient entity does not have a database representation whether or not the app has set the entity s unique identity field s

29263171
persistent	transient
if the persistent context participates in a transaction the in-memory state of the managed entities will get synchronized to the database
a detached transient entity cannot be used with any entitymanager operation that requires a managed instance

29265381
primes	modulus
but these aren t going to help when trying to find the roots modulo a primes p
use the ground_roots function along with the modulus keyword argument

29270033
bower	npm
based on the details in your comments specifically run ls -ld users user .npm bower because the problem is when npm tries to mkdir within that meaning that directory is probably not writeable for user
some most likely at some point along the way you installed something with sudo npm

29275795
scheme	racket
else might be mit scheme whose cond-expand only tests for srfis
the closest thing there is is cond-expand aka srfi 0 which is available on some schemes but not others racket for example doesn t have it and your code won t compile if you try to use it

29275795
scheme	racket
the closest thing there is is cond-expand aka srfi 0 which is available on some scheme but not others racket for example doesn t have it and your code won t compile if you try to use it
for those scheme that do have it it looks like a cond form except you test for booleans that tell you things about the compiler interpreter

29280707
spaces	delimiter
you cannot determine where ends and begins because you are allowing spaces characters in both values
i recommend you change to a delimiter that isn t allowed in the input data

29284893
implements	extends
actually it does work on all nested screens so i don t understand the solution of gábor that i tried without success well it works until a certain point but it s a mess of multiple toolbars because when the user click a sub preference screen only the fragment is changed see not the toolbar that remains always active and visible but a custom behavior should be implements to close each fragment accordingly
in the main class settingsactivity that extends actionbaractivity the following methods should be implements

29285127
rpm	yum
install memcached through rpm the easiest way to install memcached is through a package manager such as yum or apt in your case yum because its redhat
however memcached is not available from the default collection of packages so the first thing we need to do is add a new rpm red hat package manager server so that we can install memcached through yum

29285127
rpm	yum
however memcached is not available from the default collection of packages so the first thing we need to do is add a new rpm red hat package manager server so that we can install memcached through yum
one of the best 3rd-party rpm servers is provided by dag wieers which will provide us with up-to-date packages that are not provided by red hat directly

29285127
rpm	yum
note that you must find the rpm server string that matches your architecture and software
do not use the url unless you have a 32-bit machine running centos 5.x instead get the server that s appropriate from now we can simply use yum or apt to install memcached afterwards you can confirm memcached is up and running by calling it

29287747
super	extends
super call in class extends inner
we expect two things to happen before a constructor is run the base class object if extends is not used constructor should have been run the enclosing instance if any should have been fully constructed and a reference to it is going around in the program java enforces the first rule by automatically placing a super call at the beginning of your constructors

29289963
division	modulo
the operator is modulo not division even though it kind of looks like it would be
division is

29290858
jpql	hql
jpa s query will expect that you use jpql jpa query language like the prepared query in the entity select t from tblemployee t now from tblemployee is hql hibernate query language you should use it when you are not using hibernate as a jpa provider but directly using hibernate classes such as session
in short if you are including imports from java.persistence do not add imports from org.hibernate and use jpql begins with select

29292838
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
my application has an initial rootviewcontroller that inherits from uitabbarcontroller each of it s uitabbar relationship controllers inherit from uinavigationcontroller allowing me to pushviewcontroller from them
here s what you d do if your rootviewcontroller did not inherit from uinavigationviewcontroller basically you check what the currently presented tab is and then push from that view controller rather than the rootviewcontroller that inherits from uitabbarcontroller

29292949
move	drag
select avd window by mouse press alt and space key then a menu will appear on avd window select move use your arrow key to move it down you should use down arrow key
i think the title of your avd windown may be moved to out of screen can not use mouse to drag it down you can use following steps to move it down via keyboard

29293004
multiplying	division
there is nothing to subtract from 9 after multiplying 3 times 3
note that doing the division with a calculator will not show the result referred to here by this operation

29298529
postgresql	mysql
in postgresql oracle and sql server you can use the following syntax mysql does not support full outer join so you have to use a union with two joins note this syntax will work on most rdbms however it will provide different result than the full outer join if there are duplicates in the joined columns
edit this handles duplicates in the joined columns edit the actual solution by the op from the comments below its basically the same as the mysql query from above but doing a group by before on each table to remove duplicates inside each table before

29300371
allocator	stl
so the comparison to shared_ptr is not very relevant because it has completely different uses for an allocator that don t apply to containers
the original motivation for allocators in the stl was to encapsulate details about the memory model specifically near and far pointers of segmented memory

29302246
operands	scalar
that is if the left operands is true the right operands is not even evaluated
scalar or list context propagates down to the right operands if it is evaluated

29304497
base	fractions
in simple words the fractions numbers are encoded in computers using a fixed number of bits digits in a similar way we write the real numbers on paper we use base 10 to write the numbers the computers use base 2 to handle them
but not all the fractions numbers can be written using a finite number of digits no matter what base we use to write them

29304497
base	fractions
for example 1 10 is 0.1 in base 10 but it cannot be represented using a finite number of digits in base 2
in fact only the fractions having the denominator a power of 2 have a finite representation in base 2

29309443
comparator	comparable
you haven t passed a comparator to the treeset constructor so the treeset will rely on its items being comparable
but they aren t comparable hence the exception

29310882
comparator	comparable
because the operator doesn t work on objects you must use the equivalent functionality which is the comparator method in the comparable interface
ensure that the type t is comparable by providing an upper bound

29312145
super	self
put another way init being shorthand for __init__ the reason the super inside a.init finds b.init and not object.init is because siblings are searched first
and in the context of self log a b b will be checked first before the parent class

29312161
ubuntu	linux
if the process is ran in say ubuntu shell and this is not r specific for example using rscript my_file.r ctrl + c kills the process ctrl + z suspends the process within r shell ctrl + c kills helps you escape it
self answer pretty much summary of other s comments and answers in rstudio esc works on windows mac and ubuntu and i would guess on other linux distributions as well

29314099
gif	png
photographs gif only supports a 256 colour palette so it will degrade a photograph considerably this is not a plausible option
minimal loss of quality png loses no quality jpeg loses some due to its compression technique

29316104
set	bag
for example we can construct a set of red and blue with an | like this behind the scenes all this does is assigning 5 to purple because 4 | 1 is 5
but since your program interprets 5 as a set of two colors the meaning of that 5 is not the same as that of an integer 5 that represents say the number of things in a bag

29316104
set	bag
but since your program interprets 5 as a set of two colors the meaning of that 5 is not the same as that of an integer 5 that represents say the number of things in a bag
you can check if a set has a particular member by applying to it the flags used by i o library work in the same way

29316654
setinterval	settimeout
i tend to avoid setinterval whenever i can always paul irish talks about this in this video
what i do is wrap a settimeout in a function that recursively calls itself with a condition that allows me to easily stop or to let the data decide when it s not needed anymore

29319328
opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
in webkit browsers such as google-chrome safari and modern opera middle-clicking on a link fires a preventable click event
this behavior differs from firefox and ie where middle-clicking a link will not fire a click event

29319683
opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
this html5 attribute is only supported by google-chrome 14+ firefox 20+ and opera 15+ on desktop none on ios and all current majors except webview on android
-a workaround for ie 10+ is to not hide destroy the link generated by clicksave and ask user to right-click save target as -no known workaround for safari

29319735
sudo	passwd
capistrano 3 does not support sudo with passwd and you cannot use sudo with passwd in capistrano task with only capistrano 3 gem
however i created a gem sshkit-sudo which is an sshkit extension for sudo with passwd input capistrano 3 depends on sshkit

29320633
viewdidload	viewdidappear
i have had the same problem with attempting to perform a segue inside the viewdidload function and the error that comes up seems to be that the view you are attempting to load with the segue is not in the window hierarchy
changing the call to viewdidappear seemed to fix the issue as mentioned in this other post whose view is not in the window hierarchy note the language is objective-c not swift but it can be translated

29323536
google-chrome	firefox
however if your png has some other color profile such as adobergb then perhaps firefox is not compensating whereas google-chrome is
in this case the firefox image is technically displayed incorrectly although it will match rgb font colors in your html whereas the google-chrome image is displayed correctly to the creator s original intent for the colors but will not match the rgb font colors in your html which are specified in srgb

29324517
innodb	myisam
i think now vs sys_date is the least of your problems. you are using innodb not myisam i hope
myisam uses table locks and you won t be able to keep up. let s consider that way all the queries will be looking at the beginning of the table that will get all the data for the page and do it quite efficiently

29327928
memcpy	strcpy
to copy arrays in general use memcpy
to copy a c- string it better easier to use strcpy instead like the above is equivalent to more on how to handle strings in c is here to have printable being a char -array declare it as hprintable printable and do not use the address-of operator on prt when calling blockhex

29328295
ubuntu	debian
for information on how to configure what starts on ubuntu see boot howto - ubuntu community wiki
you re really asking about postgresql on debian or ubuntu as it s the packaging and wrapper utilities doing this not postgresql its self

29334460
super	self
super is not really an object pointer
if it were it would have the same pointer value as self

29338643
implements	extends
also i don t see where you initiailze your views and your activity does not implements onclicklistener interface
context is not declared and initialized change this to similarly for the other intent your mainactivity extends activity java.lang.object android.content.context android.content.contextwrapper android.view.contextthemewrapper android.app.activity so to get context you can have mainactivity.this

29342160
realloc	malloc
if the buffer is not large enough to hold the line getline resizes it with realloc 3 updating lineptr and n as necessary
the manual for getline strongly hints that the line pointer is not a fixed buffer but a pointer to an allocated string since it states alternatively before calling getline lineptr can contain a pointer to a malloc 3 -allocated buffer n bytes in size

29342804
bower	npm
in general npm is used for managing your back-end dependencies and bower is responsible for your front end dependencies
there are 2 config files package.json here are listed your dependencies that are not used in browser bower grunt

29342804
bower	npm	gruntjs	package.json
there are 2 config files package.json here are listed your dependencies that are not used in browser bower gruntjs
to install all dependencies in package.json run npm install

29344121
subtraction	addition
your first example is 1110 0101 -27 1100 0111 -57 1 1010 1100 -84 -27 -57 second example subtraction 1110 0101 -27 0011 1001 +57 1 0001 1110 30 ignoring msb -226 including msb but note that the output is 1 bit wider rtl does not give you access to the carry but rather an extra sum therefore the inputs are sign extended
1 1110 0101 -27 1 1100 0111 -57 1 1010 1100 -84 1 1110 0101 -27 0 0011 1001 +57 0 0001 1110 30 note in the correctly sign extended subtraction the msb is 0 but for your addition with the second value unsigned you need a 0 to show it is a positive number and you will have bit growth of 1 bit 1 1 1110 0101 -27 0 0 1100 0111 199 0 0 1010 1100 172 -27+199 here the extended bit not a carry is 0

29349099
sudo	passwd
sudo doesn t take passwd from stdin but from the terminal device
add your date to the sudoers file so you can run it as root without a passwd

29351580
jboss	glassfish
finally i found the solution thx to jboss doc that are better then glassfish and netbeans togheter
the problem is caused by the presence of an app composed by two modules - ejb - web that two modules are contained in an ear that cause of netbeans has no application.xml so glassfish simply doesn t look at glassfish-web.xml and using asadmin can t work too

29351909
spaces	delimiter
find the string length and subtract that from the cell width to get the number of empty spaces to fill you could also then add ellipsis if that is acceptable and the cell cannot fit your string
if you re trying to pass information between programs though you should always have the data in a fixed form delimiter etc

29352146
strdup	malloc
note if one absolutely must use strdup it is easy to write a custom function to do so
in your insert function you do not allocate malloc space for the word pointer you are trying to strcpy to usually this code would exit with a segmentation fault because you are copying data to memory you don t own but this is easy to fix you ll want to allocate one extra byte above the string length to allow for the null terminator

29352146
strcpy	malloc
in your insert function you do not allocate malloc space for the word pointer you are trying to strcpy to usually this code would exit with a segmentation fault because you are copying data to memory you don t own but this is easy to fix you ll want to allocate one extra byte above the string length to allow for the null terminator
you do not need or want to cast the result of malloc

29353135
persistent	transient
not all instances of a persistent class are considered to be in the persistent state
for example an instance can instead be transient or detached

29355646
google-chrome	firefox
in general google-chrome does not support h264 encode for webrtc just because vp8 is their primary royalty free codec and answer to h264 which has way too many patent-related complications
now fairly recently cisco released openh264 - which is what firefox has implemented to support h264 as well

29355990
mp4	h.264
here s an example tag with mp4 and webm fallback included with direct link fallback if browser doesn t support html5 some mobile devices if you need to convert videos to mp4 try the excellent tool handbrake also is a good resource
container mp4 video codec h.264 audo codec aac

29360468
wildfly	jboss
steps to use you own jaas loginmodule by the way this resource jboss as7 helped me a lot in my situation implement your own principals login module how to do this you may find in i-net pack this to jar install like module into wildfly if you need to use it in many projects using cli install jar as module hint from resource things to remember when you create your own module do not forget to add dependency on org.picketbox and javax.api in the module.xml of your custom module
add security domain in wildfly gui cli or manual edition standalone.xml and my mistake was at this step

29367943
boost	stl
there is support for different ui win qt and it interfaces well with stl boost containers structures
comparing to opencascade that does not even have a proper stl compatible iterator class that is a significant difference

29381526
elasticsearch	kibana
using es-hadoop see similarly you can connect other datasources to elasticsearch like logstash es-hadoop or 3rd party technologies like apache flume fluentd and many others. see -
no you cannot connect kibana directly but you can connect elasticsearch to hadoop

29381726
sse	avx
you have to compile with arch -avx because it is the latest and it is backwards compatible with sse sse2 sse3 ssse3 sse4 sse sse4.1 sse4.2 but the inverse is not true
a avx cpu inplements all the sses but avx is an instruction set foreign to sse cpus

29381726
sse	avx
you should not swap avx instructions and sse not only due to design complications but also internal cpu complications
furthermore you do not want to go around changing the fpu state from avx to sse because that in itself causes a performance overhead that most people do not consider

29383881
udp	tcp
it turns out that logstash gelf.rb is not using tcp but udp
i had to add gelf udp as one of the graylog message input responsible for accepting log messages

29383998
bash	zsh
as for the inverse operation - getting a signal name by its number - use the kill builtins in bash ksh zsh and dash all support this and while bin kill should support this according to posix not all implementations do the kill from procps-ng 3.3.9 version found on ubuntu 14.04
to get a signal s number by its name in bash ksh or zsh you can simply use since this uses the kill builtin as opposed to the external-utility version bin kill this should work on any platform where these shells are supported

29385051
viewmodel	caliburn
second this automatically databound to viewmodel should not be a performance problem in caliburn.micro because plain binding in wpf uses refelection anyway
not sure if caliburn uses reflection internally as well but even if it does it s hardly noticable at runtime if you dont do it in iterative scenario inside itemsscontrol with 1000+ items

29387414
google-chrome	firefox
the following works for me in google-chrome 41 i ve tried several ideas for firefox including opening an actual web-page but nothing seems to work
as far as i understand any browser will close a tab or window with xxx.close if it was really opened by js but firefox at least cannot be duped into closing a tab by opening new content inside that tab

29392465
prepare	execute
instructions for halting script execution in google chrome dev tools 1 prepare your code first by creating a global variable 2 any place where you may wish to quit test the value of this variable 3 pause execution of script on-or-before the above test line s 4 switch to console 5 type 6 continue script execution
script will return false when it execute the test from step 2 above notes a this trick works with global variables and objects but it will not work with local variables

29393761
union	distinct
if you do not want distinct results then you should always use union all to make sure the database is not checking for potential dupes
union used by itself removes duplicate rows uses an implied distinct as per the sql spec

29393931
implements	extends
go ahead an spend some time googling around and you will find all the edge but not so edge cases where hacks have to be implements to work around a by design buggy behavior
sometimes you have to extends or copy the source code of these classes from the android source code to modify a private or protected field don t get me wrong fragments work

29399121
setcontentview	findviewbyid
notmainactivity calls setcontentview with r.layout.activity_main as parameter that contains a viewpager and not a listview
since you don t have a listview declare in to that layout findviewbyid android.r.id.list returns null and when you try access it calling setadapter the nullpointerexception is thrown

29401454
swift	objective-c
if this protocol were implemented in swift we d get to choose whether the return type is optional or not and swift would prevent us from returning nil to a method that didn t define a non-optional return type
in objective-c we were always passing around pointers and pointers could always be nil

29401454
swift	objective-c
objects either exist never nil or it is unknown whether or not they exist which is where swift optionals come into play
previous to xcode 6.3 this therefore meant that any swift code that used any objective-c code would have to treat all object references as swift optionals

29403713
division	subtract	division	exponent
you can get rid of that division statement when computing the first part of the dft matrix
also the first part of the dft matrix in the exponent you need to divide by the total length of the signal not the length subtract by 1

29409986
clang	llvm
fresh compiler-rt build doesn t contain this library and fresh clang is not using it
and i failed to compile since i didn t sync the other llvm projects before compiling i only put compiler-rt inside llvm projects directory and build from llvm build root directory

29414873
factors	mean
the above code could be implemented using the built-in scala streams but there is a performance and memory use overhead of a constant factors that this algorithm does not require
using streams would mean that one could use them directly without the extra iterator generation code but as this is used only for final output of the sequence it doesn t cost much

29415182
qthread	qobject
in short don t subclass qthread as the functionality you re creating resides in the main thread not the thread that qthread handles
create a qobject subclass with a slot connected to the started signal

29420969
google-chrome	firefox
this happens with and without having the google-chrome dev console open
ie 11 doesn t seem to work in the same way but i don t have firefox installed right now

29422218
multiplying	multiplication
edit if you have duplicate date values then what you could do is left merge the other df s value column and then multiplying the 2 columns so the following should work the above assumes that the date columns have not been set as the index already
if you set the index to be the dates for both df s then multiplication will align where the indices match the question is whether you want nan values where the rows are missing or not

29426923
swift	objective-c
in swift you can omit self and in objective-c you can use _fueltank or whatever backing variable you synthesized to access the property backing variable directly but it is a good idea to get into the habit of using self as it makes it clear that you are accessing a property and not a local or global variable
also in objective-c it ensures that any setter getter methods are invoked

29428223
google-chrome	firefox
mdn says this was implemented recently starting with gecko 30.0 firefox 30.0 thunderbird 30.0 seamonkey 2.27 here s how the change got implemented in firefox and chromium revision 184788 as for google-chrome people report this started happening somewhere around version 39
i m not sure how to link a revision changeset to a particular version of google-chrome

29430676
swift	objective-c
i believe it can be translated to this in swift var filter gpuimageinput or var filter gpuimageoutput
this is not a generic in objective-c

29436196
mp3	wav
note that for this very purpose the display at the bottom of the inspector clearly shows you that you cannot loop an mp3
here s the same sound as mp3 versus wav obviously it is trivial to convert audio files between formats

29436862
sudo	passwd
bin sh echo p sswd from python set sudo_askpass to your helper script and invoke sudo -a
your example is a very special case as sudo reads the passwd from the terminal -- not from stdin

29436862
sudo	passwd
however there is a little know feature of sudo allowing to invoke an external program to read the passwd
this is absolutly not something i would encourage but if you really want to do that and are confortable with the idea of storing a passwd in plain text as part of a script you might go that way prepare an helper script to send the passwd #

29440433
opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
the issue on google-chrome and family like little brother opera didn t check cousin safari is that selection does not apply to the implicit block wrapper created by adding a text node before a block element
this can be seen even without images the result looks like this on google-chrome after a ctrl+a that s exactly what happened to those images

29440585
swift	objective-c
add a new target to your project by clicking the plus sign here select framework library for the appropriate platform ios os x choose cocoa framework or cocoa touch platform dependent and click next give your module a name and change the language to swift or leave it as objective-c it doesn t matter you can use both
add a swift file to your module add some code to your swift file

29441747
vb6	vba
i think you should have the transpose method in vb6
since vb6 is very similar to vba i think i might have a solution which does not require this much code to redim a 2-dimensional array - using transpose

29441747
vb6	vba
since vb6 is very similar to vba i think i might have a solution which does not require this much code to redim a 2-dimensional array - using transpose
the solution vba what is different from op s question the lower bound of arrcity array is not 0 but 1

29442028
innodb	myisam
also you must ensure that you are using the innodb storage engine for your tables or your foreign keys won t work at all
they are not supported in the myisam engine type

29443027
odoo	openerp
not | or and list of term operators usage input records record 1 openerp record 2 openerp record 3 opensource record 4 opensource record 5 open record 6 open record 7 odoo record 8 odoo record 9 odooopenerp record 10 odooopenerp like - returns case sensitive wildcards - open search
o p open opensource openerp odooopenerp not like - returns results not matched with case sensitive wildcards - open search

29443027
odoo	openerp
name odoo parent_id false - returns name domain result true name odoo parent_id openerp - returns name domain result parent_id domain result
value 15 - term left side has 10 in db and term right our value 10 will not match child_of parent_id 1 #agrolait child_of - return left and right list of partner_id for given parent_id these operators are largely used in openerp for comparing dates -

29443185
strcpy	malloc
at last your my_strcpy is not behaving like the standard strcpy which does not allocate memory using malloc
and your use of malloc is wrong since sizeof src is always 8 on linux x86-64

29443602
persistent	transient
is the zoomed state ephemeral or is it persistent
otherwise if it s transient and the geometry of the view doesn t change you might be able to get away with modifying the two properties as appkit won t have a reason to reset them before you complete the animation

29444072
coalesce	nvl	coalesce	isnull
in some databases there is a shorthand function for coalesce if you only need two parameters
these functions may have names like nvl ifnull isnull depending on the database or may not exist at all

29444516
bmp	png	bmp	ppm
i have tried everything i know to get imagemagick to create a 24-bit colour bmp from a greyscale 32-bit png file including +matte to remove the alpha channel -type truecolor to force a colour output bmp4 output.bmp to force a bmp4 bmp3 output.bmp to force a bmp3 bmp2 output.bmp to force a bmp2 -colors 16|256 to force number of colours -depth 8|24 to set the bit depth passing through ppm format and back to get rid of png settings writing via netpbm s ppm2bmp ppmtobmp and all to no avail
i cannot get imagemagick to create a 24-bit color bmp from a grey 32-bit png

29444516
bmp	png
i cannot get imagemagick to create a 24-bit color bmp from a grey 32-bit png
update i have worked out a horrible hack that will make you a 24-bit bmp as follows

29444727
setcontentview	findviewbyid
setcontentview r.layout.activity_main
since main.xml does not contain the listview findviewbyid will return null

29445547
multiplying	multiplication
when cpus were so simple that they did not even have built-in multiplication instructions so we had to invoke routines to multiplying numbers and these routines would of course contain loops that would iterate as many times as the number of bits of the numbers being multiplied so these bit-shifting tricks would yield much much better performance back then
and again this would be at the expense of program length invoking a multiplication routine takes fewer bytes than performing two or more shift operations. but nowadays nothing of that sort holds true anymore

29448417
subtraction	addition	subtraction	modulo
furthermore bitwise not and bitwise and or are a complete system of boolean operators so whatever bitwise operation you imagine bitwise subtraction to be you can implement it easily with those
bitwise addition adding each bit with the corresponding bit of the other operand with no carry between bits alternatively modulo 2 1 is just xor available in most languages

29449462
viewdidload	viewwillappear
if you look at the vc s contentview.frame in viewdidload you ll see that it is the size defined in the xib storyboard not the correct size
you should probably put your animation in viewwillappear however viewwillappear is called every time the vc s view is displayed not just the first time so you need to allow for that

29451313
calloc	malloc
on a system with only 2 gib of memory i think its safe to say that at least the calloc implementation on my box behaves opportunistically
it is not a feature of malloc that makes it opportunistic

29452017
super	extends
your employee class contains a constructor with the following parameters and your faculty and staff classes which extends employee contain this explicit call to super super name address phone email
the number of arguments in the call to super and the number of arguments in the employee class constructor do not match

29453212
swift	objective-c
swift code will be more resistant to hooking but it should not be completely impossible
nsobject subclasses and swift classes that are declared objective-c should be as accessible as objective-c code

29455816
ubuntu	linux
if it is not that what you look for then first option not if it is exactly what you look for but it can serve to you as aid i leave you like installing plugin in ubuntu you can find in the page
next i also leave the information you ... i have put h tttp but really it is http it changes it before using it to get started press ctrl+alt+t to open terminal then follow the steps below 1. run this command to add the official repository 2. download and install the key wget -q -o - h ttps dl-ssl.google.com linux linux_signing_key.pub | sudo apt-key add - 3. update the package lists to make it available sudo apt-get update 4. finally install the plugin via synaptic package manager or by this command sudo apt-get install google-talkplugin ... font h ttp ubuntuhandbook.org second option another way to use gtalk hangout in ubuntu would be installing this plugin of chrome in the direction

29457777
swift	objective-c
swift on the other hand does support overloading that s why it works when you remove the inheritance
objective-c does not support method overloading you have to use a different method name

29458124
udp	tcp
if you are using udp sockets each message is stand alone you will receive a separate message for each message sent but not necessarily in the same order
if you are using tcp or unix sockets data may be received in chunks of different sizes than those used for sending

29460382
persistent	transient
each websocket connection or long polling http request does not imply the creation of a persistent hub
hubs are transient instances created upon each logical connections and each method calls

29460445
uilabel	uitextview
uilabel is a view uitextview is a view too the method boundingrectwithsize is not the same thing as a view frame is just the bounding rect to contain that text
as suggested by aaron uitextview contains padding while uilabel not

29460871
dictionary	map
however this is not generally a good practice it s better to leave it as creating a new dictionary which you could always assign to the old variable note there s no version of map on arrays that does in-place alteration unlike say sort sorted
there s no direct way to map the values in a dictionary to create a new dictionary

29460871
dictionary	map
but if you extend dictionary to have an initializer that takes a sequence of key value pairs you could then use this to create a new dictionary the other downside of this is that if you alter the keys you cannot guarantee the dictionary will not throw away certain values because they keys may be mapped to duplicates of each other
but if you are only operating on values you could define a version of map on the values only of the dictionary in a similar fashion and that is guaranteed to maintain the same number of entries since the keys do not change in theory this means you could do an in-place transformation

29463772
wildfly	jboss
you are probably using the following parameter in your jboss jboss.bind.address 0.0.0.0 i am using this parameter in my wildfly for him to accept external connections from any ip because my wildfly is exposed on the internet
the problem is that if you do not specify the jboss wildfly settings which ip that hornetq should report to the jms clients that are doing remote loockup hornetq will assume that the ip is what is set in jboss.bind.address

29464935
postgresql	mysql
to close the tunnel ssh -s .ssh tunnel_54321_remote_machine_mysql hal remote.machine.com -i .ssh hal.key i first learned about this method from the postgresql docs
not a solution to your server firewall issue but a workaround as you are able to ssh into your database server you can try ssh remote port forwarding from your mysql server to your local machine and then connect the mysql client to the local port

29465098
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
using javascript to change the favicon in ie11 html js demo note this works in google-chrome firefox ie11+
it doesn t work in ie10 or earlier opera 12.15 or safari 6.0.5 mac

29465268
comparator	comparable
the type does not implement the comparator interface and thus cannot be used in a linq orderby expression
if for example you wanted to order the articles by the number of tags you could do that like this because count will return an integer and an integer is comparable

29467669
swift	objective-c
there are the following limitations when it comes to swift with objective-c it avoids magic strings allowing the use of ordinary ide refactoring tools however in swift selectors are magic strings
the objective-c runtime only provides type information for properties not method or initializer parameters

29467669
swift	objective-c
there is no other way to do this in swift
its worth mentioning there are additional limitations when using typhoon with swift pure swift classes - not extending a cocoa base class or declaring the objective-c directive - don t support introspection dynamic dispatch or dynamic method invocation

29470323
apache	nginx
so if your web application has a performance bottleneck on php processing then replacing apache with nginx will not be a solution
following article explains a details research done on comparing static contend delivery and php script result delivery using apache + mod_php and nginx + php-fpm

29473406
serializable	deserialization
since you cannot change the structure you can write a custom serializable and deserializer to handle this basically the key is now given by arrays.tostring which is a readable representation of the elements in the array instead of its tostring method
but as you see the deserialization process has to assume that this representation won t change this is quite risky as any modification in the result of arrays.tostring would break the process but you have to deal with it.

29474490
rsa	aes
all you need to do is generate random aes key encrypt large file under aes key encrypt aes key under rsa key also encryption alone is usually not enough
that means your choice of aes cfb could be improved

29474772
uilabel	uitextview
the user will not know that it is a uitextview as opposed to to a uilabel
if you don t like that solution then what i would do is use instead of a uilabel a custom view that draws the text

29474973
jar	manifest.mf
if you obfuscate the classname with the main method you can no longer call that class to run the jar
in theory you could modify the manifest.mf in the jar to refer to the obfuscated classname but i m not sure the benefit of that since it is pretty clear what you are calling at that point

29478259
super	implements
this would be super easy if you were using a framework like angular or even just posting with ajax in general
but that s a pretty big change that might not be worth going through and implements just for this case

29483813
fgets	realloc	fgets	getline
if you have a non-posix system without getline you might use fgets 3 but then you have to take the pain to allocate the line itself test that you did not read a full newline terminated line and repeat
then you need to pre-allocate some line buffer using malloc before calling fgets and you might realloc it if a line does not fit and call fgets again

29483813
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	fgets	realloc
then you need to pre-allocate some line buffer using malloc before calling fgets and you might realloc it if a line does not fit and call fgets again
something like a general rule would be to always initialize pointers declare in your case and always test for failure of malloc calloc realloc

29483821
armadillo	openblas
basically you need to install openblas first then install armadillo not from a linux repository but the downloaded version
instead of linking armadillo based code with blas you link with openblas

29485265
google-chrome	firefox
btw you can play with the gainnode interface in firefox example to disable the googautogaincontrol the end-user cannot disable in the browser this functionality right now. the advanced user can edit preferences in the about config in firefox but in google-chrome does not exist
the googautogaincontrol as mediatrackconstraints is specific to google-chrome webkit

29488325
phpunit	behat
as i see the topic is about functional tests and if the tool is phpunit it doesn t mean that tests must be unit because it is possible to make functional tests with it too but i believe that it is not the best choice of the tool for functional tests
i will recommend you take a look to other a great tool for functional tests like behat

29488493
recvfrom	datagram
then use sendto and recvfrom functions from socket api to send and receive datagram with your chosen boundaries
rely on data itself datagram 1-byte-len header data assume empty header is invalid length byte must be 1..255 assume there s often a datagrame 4 4-byte-header no-data in the stream alternatively compile most frequent datagram length list 5 10 13 200 validate data to detect when you are out of sync recovery scenario could be something like this processing 5 header-set-speed 255 173 14 0 oh no speed 255 doesn t make sense assume synchronisation is lost scan forward looking for likely start byte 4 found 4 100 23 34 56 4 78 .

29493271
implements	extends
if you look at filedialog.py you ll see that the dialog is implements in python
so all you have to do is to extends the class savefiledialog and override the method ok_command with one that doesn t allow to select an existing file name

29493953
octal	decimal
if you prefix an integer literal with one or more 0 digits in java it is going to be interpreted as an octal number - not a decimal number
the octal value 000100 is 64 in decimal

29496219
factors	matrix
the latter will remove one level for your first factors but keep all the levels for the others so it depends on the ordering of the variables
this may or may not work but you could try creating the model matrix for each variable separately and then cbind ing them together

29498469
serializable	deserialization
spring components are usually not serializable or should not be serializable at all
injecting spring components in vaadin components linked to a vaadin ui is tricky because them should be declared as transient and re-populated after deserialization

29500379
jlist	jtextfield	jtextfield	jtable
if you wish to append the entire list create a string from the list and set the text of the jtextfield with that string you might wish to have them separated by some character - below uses a comma not entirely sure what you are after but a jlist or jtable might be more appropriate to display list information
the text in the jtextfield will only reflect the last item of the list

29500762
fgets	fgetc
when you are allocating memory dynamically you will want to change to you read read up to maxl -1 chars or a newline if using fgetc etc.. or read the line and then check whether to determine whether you read the entire line if using fgets
posix requires all lines terminate with a newline if you read maxl characters fgetc or did not read the newline fgets then it is a short read and more characters remain

29500762
fgets	realloc
posix requires all lines terminate with a newline if you read maxl characters fgetc or did not read the newline fgets then it is a short read and more characters remain
your choice is to realloc generally doubling the size and try again

29502069
spaces	delimiter
this should cope with an indeterminate number of instances in any one cell and also where the last instance is not followed by a spaces
although tagged with excel-vba you offer no code and do have formula in your title so i suggest replace with say | where the first character is distinctive working on a copy of your data select all home editing - find select replace... find what replace with | replace all. select the relevant column data text to columns delimiter next delimiter other only | finish

29505015
ssl	https
if you want to use it in an async action you can write something like ssl does not have anything to do with basic authentication
you can use https for api either directly or through a front-end http server like ngnix

29505313
division	multiplication
in css calc division - the right side must be a therefore unit based values cannot be used in division like this
also note that in multiplication at least one of the arguments must be a number

29507606
rdf	owl
you re trying to output relative iris in the rdf xml
owl api does not support that except by actually creating entities with relative iris as you do in your code

29510663
floating-point	fractions
for base-radix types it is the value of digits digits-1 for floating-point types multiplied by log 10 radix and rounded down
the standard 32-bit ieee 754 floating-point type has a 24 bit fractions part 23 bits written one implied which may suggest that it can represent 7 digit decimals is 7.22 but relative rounding errors are non-uniform and some floating-point values with 7 decimal digits do not survive conversion to 32-bit float and back the smallest positive example is 8.589973e9 which becomes 8.589974e9 after the roundtrip

29512737
rsa	aes
using rsa to encrypt a large file is not a good idea
you could for example generate a random aes key encrypt it using rsa and store it in the output file and then encrypt the file itself with aes which is much faster and doesn t have any problem with large inputs

29512866
ienumerable	iqueryable
however if you were not working with an iqueryable an ienumerable then the following code is used the issue is that depending upon the filtering utilised to get the ienumerable in the first place could contain all records so use an iqueryable where possible for optimal performance of pagedlist
the example on github illustrates that it is using an iqueryable which is then utilised by topagedlist which implies that the code is pretty optimised and will not in itself return all records.

29515988
fold	combinators
i d typically suggest using combinators like fold and avoiding explicit recursion but in this case i think it s less of a slam dunk the explicitly recursive version is a lot clearer
you can do this with a fold it s possibly not quite as specifically applicable as you d like and it s a little noisy but it works the basic idea is that you re carrying along an accumulator that also indicates the state of the processing

29527146
serializable	deserialization
part 2 the actual answer to the question to configure serializable without modifying the inherited library ok i ll give it a shot
the problem seems to be that you re using the compact framework which does not have the same serializable deserialization capabilities as the full .net framework

29527146
serializable	deserialization
the problem seems to be that you re using the compact framework which does not have the same serializable deserialization capabilities as the full .net framework
so we need some custom serializable here

29528809
noexcept	throw
however what you can do in c++11 is mark functions to be noexcept meaning that they won t throw
this gives the compiler some freedom to optimize some things it otherwise won t be able to because it doesn t know whether the function can throw or not

29530203
centos	linux
in linux systems centos 6.x ffmpeg installation process and php example - this process is done in my centos 6 and created thumbnails using php
step1 - please check if any existing ffmpeg available or not in your linux server .if available please remove that files

29531813
erlang	elixir
you need to either update elixir to v1.0.4 or downgrade erlang to 17.4
elixir v1.0.3 does not work with erlang 17.5

29531906
bash	tcsh
solution use a shell that does such as bash
tcsh does not support functions

29532315
swift	objective-c
for overriding objective-c methods in swift this went unnoticed in xcode 6.2 and is now properly diagnosed in xcode 6.3 beta
note that the corresponding practice in objective-c overriding methods in an objective-c extension of the same class is also not allowed see avoid category method name clashes if the name of a method declared in a category is the same as a method in the original class or a method in another category on the same class or even a superclass the behavior is undefined as to which method implementation is used at runtime

29532837
qregularexpression	qregexp
ok after some more digging into the docs i found it really is a new class it has improvements but it is only available in qt5 so you can t use it if you want to compile on both qt4 and qt5 notes for qregexp users the qregularexpression class introduced in qt 5 is a big improvement upon qregexp in terms of apis offered supported pattern syntax and speed of execution
the biggest difference is that qregularexpression simply holds a regular expression and it s not modified when a match is requested

29535590
seaborn	matplotlib
your code seem to be working fine when seaborn is not imported when seaborn is imported you could do the following solution 1 assuming you have imported seaborn like this import seaborn as sns you can use the seaborn boxplot function resulting in solution 2 in case you want to keep using the matplotlib boxplot function from automatic whisker-sensitive ylim in boxplots resulting in
from the look of your plot it seems you have imported the seaborn module

29535590
seaborn	matplotlib
from the look of your plot it seems you have imported the seaborn module
there is an issue with matplotlib boxplot fliers not showing up when seaborn is imported even when fliers are explicitly enabled

29536622
tiff	png
if it was not a tiff return null to tell the webview to handle the request itself
if a tiff was requested open httpurlconnection to the tiff url and read the data convert the tiff to a jpeg or png ex

29537434
swift	objective-c
i could stop creating this compatibility header by setting in build settings - swift compiler - code generation - intall objective-c compatibility header to no
since i ve not written objective-c code in my project there is no problem with this option but this is rather a workaround than a solution for generics in the compatibility header

29537991
decimal	ieee
for a quick-and-dirty conversion to decimal routine in the case you have access to log10 but not to sprintf it may be sufficient
the thing about frexp is that if you are using ieee 754 binary floating-point or pdp-11 floating-point it simply reveals the representation of the floating-point value

29538305
oncreate	onstart
try adding the setbeaconlayout line in the oncreate method
depending on how your start your service the onstart method may not get called

29539722
rar	zip
the media type for rar files is not officially registered at iana but the unofficial commonly used mime-type value is application x-rar-compressed
application octet-stream means as much as i send you a file stream and the content of this stream is not specified so it is true that it can be a zip or rar file as well

29546656
udp	mtu
the ip header alone is 20 bytes but udp or tcp will also have their headers and of course there is also an ethernet header
most likely but not garanteed the network is en ethernet network which means the mtu is around 1500

29546825
udp	tcp
if you were to use udp then you could broadcast this easily but even then you are confined in the boundaries of your subnet
tcp is a peer to peer protocol that has 2 ends and is connection oriented. if you stick to tcp as communication mechanism for this you will have to iterate though all your subscribers setup a connection send and close because tcp is not multicast

29547197
config	ini
and when phpunit encountered this as an error netbeans didn t know how to report it in the output window because the local ini config was not set to do so
the issue stemmed from a few things incorrect config of php.ini error messages were not being raised but more importantly incorrectly setting server vars

29549628
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
i d reimplement paint and make use of qgraphicsview s level-of-detail mechanism see here and just not convert the string nor paint anything below a certain level of detail zoom level
if you can use qt 5.4 qgraphicsscene minimumrendersize might also come handy

29550234
comparator	comparable
the comparator .. is part of the comparable interface
a primitive type is not a java object and so the method comparator does not exist

29551718
swift	objective-c
the documentation does seem to imply an enum swift documentation objective-c documentation but in xcode if you ask to see the defintion of one of these enum values uilayoutpriorityrequired for example you will see that they are actually defined in the header file as constant floats
objective-c header file so although we may like to think of the pre-defined layout priorities as enum values as the documentation suggests the layout priorities are not really defined as enums

29553323
.htaccess	httpd.conf
mod_rewrite second option involves mod_rewrite untested pseudo-code in your etc httpd conf httpd.conf or wherever httpd.conf lives in your distro enable rewriteengine you can do it per vhost too if you wish so rewriteengine on also don t forget to set allowoverrides for your directory then in your .htaccess do note that if you apply rewriterules in .htaccess you have to setup rewritebase otherwise you ll be seeing weird redirects
if you set it up from httpd.conf - you can still do it but it is not required

29556011
swift	objective-c
edit 2 see will s comment for swift 2 and on
use edit this is because the error messages are for objective-c not adapted for swift

29558169
required	placeholder
both picasso and glide required only 1 line of code to load an image and have a placeholder and error image
customizing the behaviour also doesn t required that much work

29559573
g++	gcc
in practice if using the same compiler and version for the two different standards if compiling with the same g++ using on one hand and using on the other hand you are likely but not sure to get some compatibility
notice that in practice on linux debian x86-64 the libstdc++ is dependent of the version of gcc you are using to compile your code

29572384
vbscript	jscript
vbscript is not necessary
you can use any programming language powershell jscript any .net language except batch

29573555
ienumerable	ilist
your task object doesn t implement ilist you need to convert it not cast it casting won t help it s not wrongly casted it s genuinely not something that implements ilist as it s just an ienumerable returned by linq not backed by an actual physical collection
the easiest way to do this would be to turn it into a list which does implement ilist so after your distinct simply toss a .tolist

29575462
innodb	myisam
even if you do have file per table setup you still shouldnt try and just copy the data files because innodb may not have flushed all changes from the ib_logfile s to the ibdata .ibd file so you could well end up with corrupt data
you can do it for myisam tables but you shouldn t and there are also other files that to be copied as well as the .frm is only the table definition

29578642
addition	multiplication
indeed integers with addition operation form a correct monoid
of course it isn t multiplication on integers would form another proper monoid both instances are correct but now we have a problem if you would try to evaluate 1 mappend 2 there is no way to figure out which instance must be used

29578828
realloc	malloc
freeing realloc -ed memory is not different from freeing malloc -ed memory in that all you need is to call free on the result at the end when you no longer need the memory
your code however has a pattern that may lead to a memory leak you are assigning realloc -ed block back to result without checking it for null

29579968
multiplying	division
note that you can also multiplying by two with bitwise operator but with left shift instead of right shift
it would not be the same shifting to right of 1 bit is the same as doing a division by two

29580301
ftp	smb
you cannot connect to an .accdb database file using the ftp or sftp or http protocol
the only way you can connect to an .accdb file is via windows networking which uses the smb protocol

29581348
libstdc++	libc++
the libstdc++ implementation of std atomic relies on gcc s __atomic built-ins which are compiler magic
the libc++ implementation of std atomic makes use of the _atomic keyword which is defined by c11 and supported by clang++ but is not defined in standard c++

29581963
implements	extends
class user extends activerecord implements identityinterface here s how your user class declaration should look
from your implementation and structure you not returning object of class which implements identity interface

29582178
ssl	https
you can find the property yml files in src main resources and you need to update the application.yml or if it is only for development in application-dev.yml with the following properties server ssl key-store keystore.p12 key-store-password mypassword keystoretype pkcs12 keyalias tomcat now you can package your application with maven or gradle if you chose that for your jhipster application using mvn clean package and run the application using mvn spring-boot run
you can now access your application on for simplicity i did not change the port but ideally you should change it as well in the properties files but i left it out since they are already defined in application-dev.yml and application-prod.yml so you would have to change it in there or remove it and put it in the general application.yml optional add redirect http to https you can only enable one protocol through the application.properties so when you do this like above only https will work

29583159
xslt	xquery
xml input xslt stylesheet xml output actually i am not using a programming language
well you know xquery is a programming language

29587296
swift	objective-c
likewise when you implement one of these methods in your own class swift will force you to use the override keyword because it thinks you re overriding a method on nsobject even though that s not the case
this is an example of an obsolete design pattern in older objective-c code that doesn t map well to swift

29591101
implements	extends
also i think you meant which is then presumably used to implements an iterable set
as far as i can tell the issue is that iset doesn t also extends iterable like that way it satisfies the condition of also being an iterable

29592878
union	distinct
given that the row produced by the first subquery cannot duplicate any produced by the second union all would be a better choice than union
if you want to remove duplicates from the results of the second subquery then you should use select distinct in that subquery

29594905
swift	objective-c
swift - objective c++ interop is not supported you cannot import c++ code directly into swift
instead create an objective-c or c wrapper for c++ code

29594992
decoder	encoder
even though the algorithm can provide different results this does not prevent an encoder decoder combination from being deterministic
all that is required is that the resulting huffman code be properly transmitted along with the coded data so that the decoder can decode it

29597415
decoder	encoder
ffmpeg sets a default mux decoder delay value of 0.7 seconds
this is set in the ffmpeg_opt.c this delay value is added to the pts value of each packet if the copyts flag is not set in libavformat mpegtsenc.c in this case the encoder doubles the delay value therefore an extra 1.4 seconds get added to each packet s pts

29598167
rspec	capybara
you should go with rspec and airbone
capybara is not designed for testing apis

29598368
spaces	delimiter
that is at least if you don t want to rely on some potentially fragile white spaces convention present in the one and only provided example string that the row separator is the only | not preceded by a spaces
your question at least does not provide this as the specification for a row delimiter

29598484
portrait	landscape
but remember it will only work in portrait when you turn the ui to landscape the image can never stay square while filling the width and being fully onscreen at the same time
edit the image should not try to stretch beyond screen bounds in portrait as long as you do not tell it that it should be this far from the bottom edit - 2 set the background view constraints to superview

29600190
swift	objective-c
the enabled properties of uibutton is inherited from uicontrol and in objective-c declared as therefore the protocol method has to be and the implementation similarly as in swift 1.2 error on objective-c protocol using getter
the compiler error message note objective-c method isenabled provided by getter for enabled does not match the requirement s selector enabled gives a hint about the problem

29600430
octal	hex
the driver doesn t know how to interpret xabcdef style output and is trying to decode it as octal escape notation
an old jdbc driver from before bytea_output support was added plus a server where escape to hex by default would explain this

29602179
ienumerable	iqueryable
if you want the clients of your repository to be able to further customize the queries they can execute you should expose iqueryable but if you want full control in your repository on how the database is queried you could use ienumerable
i prefer to use ienumerable because that doesn t leak the use of entity framework throughout the application

29606054
hex	binary
if you actually want to handle the ciphertext as a string you need to convert it into a textual representation like base 64 or hex
ciphertexts are binary data which might contain bytes that are not printable

29606081
quicksort	mergesort
quicksort cannot be used on lists
for lists mergesort is the way to go as long as the list contains more than one element split it into two lists sort each of them then merge the two sorted lists into one since both lists are sorted only the heads have to be compared

29606402
swift	objective-c
you can t use inline c c++ methods in swift you have to create a wrapper in either objective-c or objective-c++
the official documentation states you cannot import c++ code directly into swift

29607291
ecdsa	rsa
it supports ecdsa for my use case the more common rsa hash functions etc
the only problem with ecdsa is it does not interpret compressed ec public keys 33 bytes correctly

29608123
prng	random
to answer your and other posters concerns unless your server has a true random number generator highly unlikely every solution will use a prng pseudo-random number generator
shortid uses node.js crypto module to generate prng numbers however which is a much better generator than math.random shortid s are not sequential which makes it even harder to guess them while shortid s are not guaranteed to be unique the likelihood of a collision is extremely small

29608494
postgresql	greenplum
or you need to develop in community postgresql only avoiding using features in ppas that might render dumps backward-incompatible and use community postgresql s pg_dump when creating dumps from ppas
edb will be able to tell you more if you are in fact using their product not some other 3rd party fork like greenplum

29611002
sudo	passwd
below code works but if i add sudo in kill statement it doesnt
i guess the problem is with sudo - usually when we try such command from terminal it ll immediately prompt us to enter the passwd which is not happening in the code posted

29617545
daemons	systemd
the specific daemons process that handles this is the beaker-watchdog daemons
if this daemons is running but doesn t find a file the beaker job running on this systemd will not have a console.log file

29628810
inline	inlining
hence anywhere it encounters this function being called in the program it enters the complete body of the function every time instead of jumping to the one location where the function resides in memory no that s not what inline means in the context of a function definition
that s the optimisation of function call inlining which the compiler can apply to any call if it thinks it will improve the code

29629340
keystore	jks
just to clarify since i was not sure how to deal with it after reading those hints - i have put all certificates and private key into pkcs12 keystore and then configured tomcat to use that keystore instead default jks
it didn t worked for me with jks - keytool was importing only private key and my site certificate from pkcs12 file but intermediate certificate was missing

29629621
swift	objective-c
here s a brand new aop library for ios written in objective-c with swift support
only before advice and after advice are available but in the most cases it s enough to solve your problem. note that it may be required adding dynamic keyword to your function when the interception against pure swift class method doesn t work correctly

29629718
build.gradle	gradlew
you need to change your volley dependency in build.gradle of your project app structure level from compile com.mcxiaoke.volley library 1.0.+ aar to compile com.mcxiaoke.volley library 1.0.+ include mavencentral in repositories section. in your app build.gradle add mavencentral in repositories section after release section
note - google doesn t provide a build of volley for gradlew but there are mirrored copies of volley published for use in gradlew

29631005
des	aes
the example they gave you is using aes not triple des
triple des takes 3 56 bits for the key expanded to 3 64 which is 168 or 192 bits depending on how you count the bits

29635721
imperative	declarative
maybe at some point in the future better compilers will allow for better optimization of declarative programs but right now we have to fall back to imperative programming when performance becomes an issue
current compilers for declarative stateless code are not very smart

29641907
swift	objective-c
so swift cannot access the sqlite3.dylib c code directly but my objective-c code can which works as the middle guy between sqlite3.dylib and swift code
so i was able to use sqlite3.dylib in a swift project by doing the following i created the bridging header

29642593
prepare	execute
this will help then note that prepare does not execute the query it only prepares it
you then need to bind the parameters in particular i would bind the current date rather than hardcode it into the query string and then you need to execute the query via

29643898
jspm	npm
i m new to jspm too and had a similar reaction about the large config.js sizes but here s a few things i ve learned 1 i wouldn t use jspm for node modules that you only want to use on the server side development machine
you can just continue to use npm for those

29644408
documentfilter	jtextcomponent
use a documentfilter to change what gets entered into a jtextcomponent or a documentlistener if you want to know when the content of the field changes
keylistener will not take into account what happens if the user pastes text into the field or if the field is modified programmatically see documentfilter examples and implementing a document filter and listening for changes on a document for more details if your bar code scanner is injecting key events into the event queue you may wish to inject an artificial delay into the documentfilter as you won t want to process the field until after all the key strokes are entered

29646965
bottle	flask
you cannot deploy a flask application with bottle because bottle is a framework
not a server nor a a tool to deploy flask apps

29647400
aggregate-functions	sum
unfortunately the result set of a select statement that works with for all entries is not allowed to use aggregate-functions
in my eyes the best way in this case is to compute the sum from the result set in the abap layer

29652507
bmp	png
support bmp is not supported in all browsers
there is no requirement to support other formats than png my emphasis user agents must support png image png

29653311
profiling	benchmarking
creating a custom allocator can be tricky and takes time to profiling benchmarking your specific use case
note -- benchmarking like this aren t meant to be realistic but are useful to determine the upper bound of how fast something can be

29655460
gunicorn	uwsgi
gunicorn s logs were not the most helpful out of frustration i tried uwsgi and it immediately displayed the issue finally
ok...so the gunicorn-app.sh needs some variables so i added the following tested it with service gunicorn start.

29656797
ssl	https
this is consistent with the behavior that i ve noted works fine on ios works fine in chrome on laptop file and localhost works fine when using http apparent cors pre-flight request failure when using https for now i ll just be using non-ssl access to my api so i can move forward and i ll let the server admin know there s something wrong with ssl probably an intermediate cert that android doesn t trust
i believe i ve found the issue android doesn t like one of my intermediate ssl certificates

29659372
rvm	bundler
this may not answer your question if you don t use rvm or similar ruby version tool
i believe it relates to bundler and gemsets as well

29659929
knitr	latex
you probably shouldn t have since knitr will include them for you
also i find it best when latex does not resize the figures at all they re already of the right size

29660207
margin	text-align
to #buttons and for the white space on footer there s a margin on your body so change your body html to this update here s the jsfiddle - full screen preview - jsfiddle view
for your top right icon not inline with the rest of the menu i would alter the css like this for your buttons not centering add text-align center

29661195
serializable	deserialization
it is tricky to answer the serializable question because the performance characteristics depend hugely on your models
there are 4 costs of interest here serializable cpu payload size directly impacts network bandwidth network latency deserialization cpu it wouldn t amaze me if the existing provider is using binaryformatter in which case it is indeed possible that the cpu and bandwidth numbers could be lower with a different serializer such as protobuf-net

29662558
super	self
in apple s notes adopting modern objective c using this macro introduces a few restrictions the implementation of a designated initializer must chain to a superclass init method with super init... that is a designated initializer for the superclass
the implementation of a convenience initializer an initializer not marked as a designated initializer within a class that has at least one initializer marked as a designated initializer must delegate to another initializer with self init...

29663016
realloc	malloc
in your case a typical usage would be note that you don t have to and shouldn t cast the result of malloc calloc or realloc
fortunately you don t need to move memory around yourself realloc does that for you

29663540
implements	extends
two-way adapters and n-way adapters are hard to implements in systems not supporting multiple inheritance
if adapter has to extends the target class it can not extent another class like adaptee so the adaptee should be an interface and all the calls should be delegated from the adapter to the adaptee object

29664093
ffmpeg	libav
i recommend ditching avconv and getting ffmpeg the real one from ffmpeg
not the old charlatan from libav

29664257
kde	gnome
is a hard task and very difficult because nix doesn t provide a friendly api to modify environment because desktop shells fragmentation gnome kde etc
the windows shell is explorer.exe and provides shell and desktop experience explorer.exe shows to you the desktop the start button bar and the explorer window to navigate across files devices and directories so in windows we have a only program to do this linux or osx follow another design in linux we have a desktop manager gnome kde lxde it shows to you the desktop but for file interaction we have a different program called file manager nautilus dolphin etc

29664548
junit	testng
if your story class is logintest it will look for login_test.story . in the story class put this method then run it as junit test from eclipse
i don t know you found solution for it or not and don t know testng but if you want to run it using junit make sure you have the following things your java story class should extend org.jbehave.core.junit.junitstory

29664715
serializable	deserialization
if a serializable class does not explicitly declare a serialversionuid then the serializable runtime will calculate a default serialversionuid value for that class based on various aspects of the class as described in the java tm object serializable specification
however it is strongly recommended that all serializable classes explicitly declare serialversionuid values since the default serialversionuid computation is highly sensitive to class details that may vary depending on compiler implementations and can thus result in unexpected invalidclassexceptions during deserialization

postgresql	mysql
in postgresql you should generally stick to the relational modelling just like you are currently using in mysql
postgresql s arrays are useful but should not be your first choice for data modelling for numerous reasons coarse fetch lock and write granularity for arrays

29666512
union	distinct
you can do this with a union which selectively targets both columns
a pseudo order is required to ensure that the stories are ahead of the chapters select x.thecolumn from select distinct title as thecolumn title 1 as myorder from fables union select titledisplay as thecolumn title 2 as myorder from fables where titledisplay is not null x order by x.title x.myorder x.thecolumn

29667264
keystore	jks
keystoretype the type of keystore file to be used for the server certificate
if not specified the default value is jks

29667723
inline	inlining
the difference is pretty much exactly what the difference is when both functions are not inline
inlining methods class-member functions will be marginally different in that the compiler must ensure that the current object this is available to the inlined code but aside from that there isn t really a significant difference

29668376
factors	mean
when you delete any row or truncate the table for postgres it doesn t mean that sequence is going to start from starting value it just continues from the last value and increments it by the increment_by factors
consider this sequence as an example sequence public.test_a_seq column | type | value ---------------+---------+--------------------- sequence_name | name | test_a_seq last_value | bigint | 7 start_value | bigint | 1 increment_by | bigint | 1 max_value | bigint | 9223372036854775807 min_value | bigint | 1 cache_value | bigint | 1 log_cnt | bigint | 26 is_cycled | boolean | f is_called | boolean | t now i delete rows and add two rows with default values on primary key after that factors of last_value would increment by 2

29668485
viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidload	viewwillappear	viewdidappear	viewwillappear
remove the function you are using in viewdidload and put it in viewdidappear
viewdidload is only called when you create the view for example show it but if you pop back viewdidload will not be called but viewwillappear will be called instead

29670644
swift	objective-c
i myself am also taking the standford course and i got stuck here for a long time too but after some searching i found something from here xcode release notes and it mentioned something below swift 1.2 is strict about checking type-based overloading of objective-c methods and initializers something not supported by objective-c
this code would work when invoked from swift but could easily crash if invoked from objective-c

29670644
swift	objective-c
this code would work when invoked from swift but could easily crash if invoked from objective-c
to solve this problem use a type that is not supported by objective-c to prevent the swift compiler from exposing the member to the objective-c runtime if it makes sense mark the member as private to disable inference of objective-c

29670644
swift	objective-c
19826275 overrides of methods exposed to objective-c in private subclasses are not inferred to be objective-c causing the swift compiler to crash
explicitly add the objective-c attribute to any such overriding methods

29670966
sudo	passwd
by default sudo prompts for a passwd
basically you have two options of solving that running jenkins as root which is obviously not what you d like to do or allowing the user that jenkins runs under to execute pip specifically without a passwd

29672466
lemmatization	stemming
if you want more sophisticated results you have to deal with lemmatization which also has several libs stanford corenlp it is not so complicated really or cicwn based on wordnet
if you are ok with coarse results like updates - updat and the weight is crucial use stemming

29673772
ciimage	uiimage
common tricks to getting around this issue as stated your options are uiimagepngrepresentation or jpeg determine if image has cgimage or ciimage backing data and get it there neither of these are particularly good tricks if you want output that isn t argb png or jpeg data and the data isn t already backed by ciimage
my recommendation try ciimage while developing your project it might make more sense for you to avoid uiimage altogether and pick something else

29675334
super	implements
a super invocation from foo will return an instance of object because foo doesn t explicitly extends any class hence it extends object
you only need to implements your tostring override as return string.valueof objects or string.valueof objects.get myindex - check for empty null in the second case

29679466
concurrenthashmap	readwritelock
unfortunately concurrenthashmap doesn t support atomic bulk inserts updates
to achieve this you should use shared readwritelock

29681973
equals	compareto
another thing you should pad attention to is that you are calculating the hash code based on exact char values but combine it with the use of comparetoignorecase to decide whether two keys are equals
you should decide whether you want to match case insensitive in that case you would have to adapt the hash code calculation or you want to do an exact match in that case you shouldn t use comparetoignorecase but simply equals you may use compareto but there s no reason to do so when you just need a test for equality

29682122
jqplot	highcharts
i m not sure how tied to jqplot you are but many libraries have this sort of option baked in
highcharts has it and is free in most cases if that is your concern and i saw it in amcharts recently too

29684277
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it looks somehow like a real google-chrome bug because it doesn t occur for me in safari mobile + desktop or firefox mobile + desktop only on google-chrome for smaller screens
tried it now with ios google-chrome ios simulater safari - no problems with scrolling or overflow

29684277
google-chrome	safari
tried it now with ios google-chrome ios simulater safari - no problems with scrolling or overflow
now tried it with google-chrome on mac os x with debug tools set to a mobile device which one doesn t matter and facing this issue i will come back with a possible fix for this or maybe an already added issue for google-chrome on mobile android

29685216
persistent	transient
these do the same things as their persistent counterparts except the return values are themselves transient
note in particular that transient are not designed to be bashed in-place

29686717
translation	localization
i suggest that you check out translation process article in the help file and take a look at the system locales sm.20.05.50 and the translation dictionaries sm.20.05.40 screens
you can do coding to rename a column globally however there s an alternative solution that doesn t involve any programming - you can use the localization feature in acumatica to change labels captions messages throughout the application

29687259
interpolation	splines
the interp1d function at present does not allow to specify the boundary behaviour for linear interpolation we simply don t have a choice about it
for higher order interpolation interp1d uses the splines constructor scipy.interpolate.splmake with the default parameter so again no choice on the boundary behaviour there

29689138
realloc	strcpy
as it is the first 10 rows will realloc just fine but the last 10 rows are not yet valid pointers so calling realloc on those last 10 rows is undefined behaviour that at the least will corrupt the heap and probably result in a seg fault event
strcpy requires the source string the one on the right to be a pointer to a nul terminated array of characters

29693359
mathml	mathjax
below is an example that shows how to enable all mathml features mathjax can provide including the mml3.js extension for experimental features
the question linked to in the op is somewhat dated and describes how to include mathml in xhtml not html since that was not actually valid back then

29693359
mathml	mathjax
chrome does not support mathml so you ll need a polyfill
mathjax can render both presentation and content mathml

29694610
intersect	contains
edit #2 very nice addition from stephanb sql fiddle to list all intersections join the table onto itself and filter away the reverse intersection select any overlapping objects just note that you should remove the if you are working with contains as while in the following picture non-exhaustive list 2 intersect #6
6 intersect #2 0 intersect #1 #2 #3 #4 #5 1 intersect #0 #5 0 contains #1 #3 #4 and #5 #1 #3 #4 and #5 are within #0 1 contains #5 #5 is within #1 0 st_contains #3 #4 and #5 1 st_contains #5 edit #3 searching by distance working in with circles mysql does not directly support circle as a geometry but you can use spatial function buffer geometry distance to work around it

29695044
subtract	addition
even if you go through all the trouble of extracting the year number the month number the day-of-the-month the hour and the minute and concatenating all those into something that looks like a number you still cannot treat it like a number because for example subtract 2 from 201504170001 gives 201504169999 not 201504162359
so in order for it to work you would have to use numeric multiplication and addition instead of string concatenation meaning that you would have to multiply the year number by the number of minutes in a year and add to it the month number multiplied by the number of minutes in a month and then add to it the day-of-the-month multiplied by the number of minutes in a day and so on but in order to do that you would first have to know whether each month has 30 or 31 days and it gets further complicated by the fact that february may have 28 or 29 days depending on whether it is a leap year

29699194
comparator	comparable
see the javadoc public treeset comparator comparator constructs a new empty tree set sorted according to the specified comparator
all elements inserted into the set must be mutually comparable by the specified comparator comparator.compare e1 e2 must not throw a classcastexception for any elements e1 and e2 in the set

29699341
swift	objective-c
however note that optional methods do not exist in pure swift they are there only because objective-c have them so there is no big reason for swift to have special grammar for optional methods
also note that even objective-c doesn t have a special grammar for checking of existence of optional methods

29700927
jar	manifest.mf
that s not how it works that way you are creating a jar archive with that .java file in it
if you want to create the jar manually if you want to do it one time instead of using a build tool like ant or maven it could have some educational value you have to compile your .java file to a .class with javac add it to the jar and then modify the meta-inf manifest.mf manifest file to specify calculator as value for the main-class attribute

29703422
implements	extends
for more details about observable see for example implements an observer pattern in dart or dart observable of getters
extends observable by itself does nothing yet. you need to annotate the getters with observable and if you are not using polymer you also need to add the observable transformer to pubspec.yaml

29705155
swift	objective-c
realm uses objective-c variadic arguments for the method which aren t supported in swift
this is why realm offers a file which adds a few swift conveniences rlmsupport.swift which you can drag into your project

29705946
nsmutablestring	nsstring
with the copy property attribute the recipient wants to ensure that the object is not mutated later behind his back i accept an nsstring but the caller passes me an nsmutablestring and retains it as well so that my string can now be changed behind my back
by calling copy i turn the nsmutablestring into an nsstring which is immutable

29713887
crossover	mutation
by other way if your problem is in a no distinguishable way discrete -that is if you do not have pde expressions of any kind or if these pdes are really trivial to solve or if there is plainly not any physical process involving states- and your problem is mainly based on expert rules databases lookups or processing large data systems and you have discarded -by any reason you find pertinent- to not have a dynamical model from these data- then and only then i would try to guide the ga as a brute force method with random crossover stages between the better solutions
a discrete bayesian framework would even be useful here from the probability estimates for every mutation stage

29717640
ocaml	sml
now consider the foldl function which is written in standard ml and not ocaml
it is defined as the biggest difference between the foldr functions of haskell and sml are in haskell the reducer function has the type

29719278
google-chrome	firefox
if your is indeed firing but you are not getting the right scroll position 0 try changing the way the scroll position is returned i found out that document.documentelement.scrolltop always returns 0 on google-chrome
this is because webkit uses body for keeping track of scrolling but firefox and ie use html

29719505
prepare	execute
that coupled to the fact their flexibility is seldom needed means that it s often preferred to use pdostatement prepare and pdostatement execute to prepare statements and execute them regardless of whether they return results or not
useful if execute multiple times and or in a hot path

29721362
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and firefox render the font with blur as seen in the animated gif made with google-chrome and firefox tends to make jagged sides for the triangles
ie 11 has the best quality output for the fonts and triangles but it doesn t support smil animations and therefore doesn t render the hover effect on the burger hexagon the overflow property for the links is ignored and the boundaries of the triangles aren t maintained i used crossbrowser testing to test safari support and the hexagon menu works on that system too

29732830
gson	jackson
gson doesn t support definition of property order out of the box but there are other libraries that do
jackson allows defining this with jsonpropertyorder for example

29733443
comparator	comparable
you can change the signature of your class like this notice that also the definition of comparator is changed to take a node as an argument instead of a generic object
your class node doesn t implement comparable interface

29736339
swift	objective-c
the swift programming language swift 2 . ibooks
it sounds to me like you re trying to avoid a retain cycle with a block like you do in objective-c where instead of referencing self you create a weak version that is not how swift handles this problem

29739250
portrait	landscape
i don t think mobile safari can be forced in landscape because some users can simply turn on portrait orientation lock through control center
if i were a web designer i wouldn t force landscape or portrait onto people

29740118
factors	mean
insert these two lines in the pollutantmean function to see whether you are dealing with numeric columns if you see factors or anything other than numeric then you will know that your input data contains something other than pure numbers
try explicitly returning the mean values from your custom function like this if this doesn t fix the problem then you likely have data frame columns which contain character data causing r to give you na values

29740585
postgresql	mysql
i don t know if postgresql work like mysql but maybe some error with the socket so it will work since the shell know where the socket is but not php
edit maybe you ll ask yourself why the hell socket would be a problem since i typed 127.0.0.1 well i had the same problem with my mysql installation where i couldn t connect with localhost 127.0.0.1 but could connect with the shell without any problem and had to use the real ip of the machine to connect it was just a socket problem

29742327
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
so simply use your uiviewcontroller only rather than using uinavigationcontroller on uinavigationcontroller
you made mistake is nested uinavigationcontroller as its recommended not to use more than a single uinavigationcontroller while nesting

29744764
ostream	ostringstream
it s complaining that str is missing in aka std ostream not std ostringstream
std ostringstream s still returns it inherits these operators from std ostream which has no str member

29745629
google-chrome	safari
if it doesn t appear the first time unplug and replug usually fixes it head to google-chrome inspect in desktop google-chrome and click inspect under your device a new google-chrome window will open with all the juicy abilities you need - inspect code set breakpoints look at network speeds access the console and so on you can also do this on ios via safari
as keval says if you re running android you can debug on-the-fly using google-chrome enable developer options on your device settings about then find build number and keep tapping it...yes really

29746818
dictionary	map
to digress slightly dictionary as said before has the same issue on the key values which is basically a set so any map that works either on the or the doesn t ensure a consistent mapping but one that changes the values only would be ok
it wouldn t be a true map though since dictionary s are collections of tuples not on value only

29746818
dictionary	map
it wouldn t be a true map though since dictionary s are collections of tuples not on value only
so there could be something similar to mapvalues which would be correct but still not a true map on the collection

29749036
codeigniter	cakephp
the first cakephp versioning being tested against php 5.5 out of the box is versioning 2.3.6 in case the desired php versioning isn t being tested already you can always fork the cakephp github repo and add additional php versioning to the travis codeigniter configuration to see whether the tests are passing requires a travis codeigniter account and a github hook
first of all you should really really upgrade your cakephp installation 2.1.1 is already 3+ years old

29749888
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome for example this was not at all possible back in 2010 and it looks like nothing has changed there
in firefox however an addon can actually do this

29751895
floating-point	fractions
eight-bit floating-point formats aren t totally uncommon as a data-storage format μ-law audio encoding for example is basically a floating-point format
they re not generally used to store fractions so much as to store approximations of fairly-small integers in an even-smaller space

29754802
floating-point	fixed-point	floating-point	fractions
in some sense this is the smallest floating-point format that isn t totally degenerate but you d still never use it because it s worse in basically every way than a 4-bit signed fixed-point format with one fractions bit
the smallest floating-point format that really passes this test in a general setting is half precision though there are some niche uses for 8b formats

29754871
opensuse	linux
thanks to brettof86 s comment about opensuse
in my case linux mint 17 i did various things and i m not sure about which of them are totally necessary

29755609
comparator	comparable
a treeset that isn t given a comparator must assume that its elements are comparable but they aren t
you were right to determine that you need to create a comparator to tell the treeset how to order the elements

29758285
flask	django
1 maybe you should consider flask web-framework which is not dependent on particular orm as django does
so you will be not obligated to fit your data in django orm models

29763972
dictionary	map
an attempt to insert either a null key or a null value to a dictionary will result to a nullpointerexception but you can use map interface it provides the exact same functionality of a dictionary.you can use it as bellow you can also use a custom class as below you can use getter and setter to get and put values not needed to remember the key names every time you may get some other advantages by this way
a dictionary is an abstract class that maps keys to values and there is dictionary class in android refer link you can find a note at class overview do not use this class since it is obsolete

29763972
dictionary	map
a dictionary is an abstract class that maps keys to values and there is dictionary class in android refer link you can find a note at class overview do not use this class since it is obsolete
please use the map interface for new implementations

29764305
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
thanks a lot. i was able to solve the problem on google-chrome using the following responseutil.download urlencoder.encode downloadfilename utf-8 in
however the encoding is still not proper in firefox and safari

29765363
google-chrome	firefox
the document.mouseover does not work for ie and firefox. however i have tried this this works for google-chrome and ie and not firefox
still working to get firefox right

29765692
prepare	execute
as per this comment in the php manual here s an explanation of what you are facing please be advised for people who sometimes miss to read this important manual entry for this function if you do not use mysqli_stmt_store_result and immediatley call this function after executing a prepare statement this function will usually return 0 as it has no way to know how many rows are in the result set as the result set is not saved in memory yet
mysqli_stmt_store_result saves the result set in memory thus you can immedietly use this function after you both execute the statement and save the result set

29766610
uiview	calayer
from a uiviewcontroller uiview subclass
calayer and its subclasses are not affected by autolayout

29769868
cpython	pypy
although not directly related to your question it is possible to have typed allocation in cpython for example using the typed array type
now pypy is a different beast

29776004
primes	palindrome
there is a function for testing a number as being a primes here
based on your comments i now see you are looking for the max and not all of the primes palindrome

29776004
primes	palindrome
based on your comments i now see you are looking for the max and not all of the primes palindrome
to get the max primes palindrome you can just step backwards from the max value

29776471
noexcept	throw
by specifying noexcept true you claim that the function never throw exceptions
by specifying noexcept false or not specifying anything you do not claim that the function never throw exceptions

29777213
build.gradle	gradlew
in your root build.gradle make sure buildscript section contains jcenter repository and andcom.novoda bintray-release 0.2.7 classpath
it looks like gradlew could not find this plugin in all specified repositories

29777904
swift	objective-c
this method isn t yet available in swift so you have to do it in objective-c
i made a class method in a utility objective-c class to set it up this works but it s definitely not ideal

29779461
move	drag
select avd window by mouse press alt and space key then a menu will appear on avd window select move use your arrow key to move it down you should use down arrow key
i think the title of your avd windown may be moved to out of screen can not use mouse to drag it down you can use following steps to move it down via keyboard

29779577
swift	objective-c
swift enums are not compatible with objective-c so you have to convert them to something that is
works because swift automatically handles the translation of int into the type nsnumber which objective-c can handle

29781290
innodb	myisam
translating the theory into practice with the innodb storage engine it doesn t make sense to specify order by as a table attribute since an innodb table will always be ordered by its cluster index
in the case of the myisam storage engine specifying order by may improve performance of some queries

29783672
portrait	landscape
i did had similar problem when i found out that my code did not work with landscape mode and only worked in portrait mode
in my old code when in landscape the tableview can not scroll lower than visible view and it bounced back to top row when scroll not letting me see the lower rows

29784642
content-length	content-type
content-length 0 is how you would indicate to the receiver that there will be no body unless you re using something like chunked encoding
rfc 7231 says a sender that generates a message containing a payload body should generate a content-type header field in that message ... so it doesn t say explicitly what to do if you re generating a message that doesn t have a payload body but it certainly seems implied that not sending a content-type header would be appropriate in that case

29785035
swift	objective-c
objective-c does not support method overloading but swift does
so either you shouldn t be inheriting from am objective-c class if you can or you can just use different method names

29785778
implements	extends
presumably the gcc team since they had to implements vlas for c decided that implements them similarly for c++ would have a decent payoff without too much effort
extends them as you suggest would have required considerable work not least designing the semantics so they can be used consistently for what they probably did not consider to be sufficient benefit -- especially since c++ has much more powerful features in the standard library container classes

29785877
octal	decimal
010 is 10 in octal which is 8 in decimal
09 is not a valid octal number since there is no digit 9 in the octal system just 0-7 so php silently ignores your error and gives you a zero

29785877
octal	hex
in fact php ignores everything after an invalid digit in octal numbers 01493 014 12
funnily enough it does not ignore invalid hex digits 0xfgf is an error

29787015
bower	npm
please note bower isn t npm and you still need to manually include files in a build system or reference them from the html one at a time
projects should not share bower dependencies

29788168
jar	war
another option would be this plugin allows you to build a standalone jar out of your web project by packing a standalone version of tomcat into the jar
a web project war can not just be saved as jar

29791224
jar	war
all you need is however if you want to be able to launch the app from within an ide with eclipse s run as - java application while developing or build an executable jar or a war that can run standalone with spring boot s embedded tomcat by just java -jar myapp.war command an entry point class with a main method might be helpful
main method is not required for the typical deployment scenario of building a war and placing it in webapps folder of tomcat

29794887
rsa	aes
in general you cannot use rsa to encrypt data larger than the key size in a single pass the limit is infact slightly shorter than the key size depending on padding
to encrypt larger amounts of data you would typically use a hybrid approach whereby you generate a symmetric key say aes and use that to encrypt your data

29796092
directx	gdi
drawing to a win32 window not a console you can draw to a win32 project a number of ways including graphics apis like opengl and directx
the simplest way is to use windows gdi graphics device interface which is simply a number of functions which are part of windows.h

29796839
inline	inlining
notice that even today while a compiler will inline any function is sees fit it must still have access to that function s definition
so while the inline keyword is not required as the hint please inline this you may still find you need to use it to enable the compiler to do the inlining if it chooses to do so

29796839
inline	inlining
so while the inline keyword is not required as the hint please inline this you may still find you need to use it to enable the compiler to do the inlining if it chooses to do so
without it you might not be able to get the definition into the translation unit and without the definition the compiler simply cannot inline the function

29801321
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
the reason why your solution works in google-chrome and firefox is that they support the download attribute - safari doesn t yet
i did a quick research - i looks like safari does not support what you are trying to achieve

29803832
itextsharp	razorpdf
as for using itextsharp good places to start would be itextsharp tutorial how to convert html to pdf using itextsharp how to add page number in footer in pdf by itextsharp
razorpdf does not have the ability to set the page numbers in the pdf file

29803832
itextsharp	razorpdf
i had a similar problem and tried various packages razorpdf itextsharp and hiqpdf
if you re not limited to razorpdf i d recommend looking into hiqpdf

29807165
wildfly	jboss
dr is that wildfly only creates a new log4j module if it can find log4j.properties or log4j.xml on the classpath for the application
this process was during a migration from jboss 4 to wildfly and the server was mis-configured and the configuration could not be found no errors are reported however because wildfly just uses its own default configured in standalone.xml

29807165
wildfly	jboss
this process was during a migration from jboss 4 to wildfly and the server was mis-configured and the configuration could not be found no errors are reported however because wildfly just uses its own default configured in standalone.xml
basically had to make sure the log4j.xml was on the classpath for the application so that wildfly would create a new log4j module to use

29812194
viewdidload	viewdidappear
when you start it in the viewdidload it s already done the animation by the time it gets to the viewdidappear assuming of course you did the fade in over about .5 second
you do not want to start any animations like a fade in on the viewdidload

29812927
required	placeholder
placeholder does not required to be quoted
drop the quotes from the placeholder value being added to the list

29813315
oncreate	setcontentview
this not suppose to be in class variables this need to be inside oncreate method
after setcontentview as a method variable

29815271
postgresql	mysql
in oracle or postgresql this kind problem can be solved relatively simple with row generator
unfortunately mysql doesn t have any simple way to generate rows you should have to do it manually

29820820
namedtuple	dictionary
i d go for a namedtuple in this case since you will hopefully know up-front what constituents your key will have
json does not support what you are looking for neither does python since dictionary objects are not hashable

29823198
mongodb	bson
shell helpers like numberlong and numberint are used to represent values in mongodb s bson data types that do not have a native javascript equivalent
referring to my sample json i want value of show_image to be inserted as false instead of bindata 0 ma and publish_date to be inserted as 1136091600 instead of numberlong 1136091600 while it s ok to insert publish_date as a unixtime if that suits your use case you may find it more useful to use mongodb s date type instead

29825618
equals	compareto
according to javadoc of the equals unlike compareto this method considers two bigdecimal objects equals only if they are equals in value and scale thus 2.0 is not equals to 2.00 when compared by this method
so equals checks if the objects are exactly the same

29825635
equals	compareto
for compareto it has to work on what is greater than or less than and since the values are neither greater than or less than they can only be equals but not equals
bigdecimal equals checks that the contents of the two bigdecimal object are the same

29826165
ubuntu	linux
from the ubuntu manpages for lscpu online indicator that shows whether the linux instance currently makes use of the cpu
this is in line with your sample output provided it means that of the 8 cpus you have cores 0 to 6 are online making a total of 7 cpus online one is offline however your linux instance isn t making use of that one

postgresql	mysql
you have to replace the mysql with postgresql manually
the one-click digital ocean install doesn t really do anything with the database other than install the mysql software on the server and set up a default user

google-chrome	safari
this is a known issue of the driver and has been for some time and cannot be fixed due to an underlying bug in the google-chrome browser itself
the architecture of the safari driver doesn t allow for full-dom screenshots

email	dkim
however we don t need credentials on sending email to its mail server i.e gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com example below my question is how is mail coming from another smtp server ever delivered since that smtp server will not have gmail credentials
here is the python script i am running as i have made myself clear from discussion above we don t need gmail credentials to connect to gmail mail servers however if we connect to gmail mail servers using personal computers we can get away with sending a few email but to send more email we need to build domain reputation and accountability using dkim spf etc thats a whole different spectrum

icomparable	compareto
you should implement in addition to icomparable for performance
set the breakpoint on compareto not equals

29832389
subtract	addition
the first thing you do in your loop is that means later when you do the following to_date c1_x.data_pedido - to_date last_date you are subtract c1_x.data_pedido - c1_x.data_pedido
in addition to that i would suggest not trying to cast a date as a date

opennlp	stanford-nlp
the opennlp models are not compatible with stanford-nlp
stanford-nlp currently does not support dutch

29835459
bash	zsh
to solve these problems bash ksh and zsh have nonstandard features that do allow determining the actual script path even in sourced scenarios and also detecting whether a script is being sourced or not
for instance in bash always contains the running script s path whether it s being sourced or not and can be used to test whether the script is being sourced

29836236
vbscript	vba
so in vbscript the equivalent would be this is not a direct answer but a hint to give you an idea on how it is done
i have not explored which functionalities in vba are supported in vbscript so you need to explore on that as well

29836424
jsonb	hstore
it s a pity you cannot upgrade postgres 9.4 has jsonb and much added functionality for json
in particular json_build_object would be perfect for you return as array of json objects in sql postgres almost but not quite while stuck with postgres 9.3 you can get help from hstore to construct an hstore value with id_2 as key and cat_ids_array as value hstore id_2 text cat_ids_array text or hstore id_2 text array_to_json cat_ids_array text then json_agg hstore id_2 text array_to_json cat_ids_array text but the array is not recognized as array

portrait	landscape
detailsactivity portrait mode processing as discussed before if the user clicks a list item and the current layout does not include the r.id.details view detailsfragment does this then the application starts the detailsactivity activity to display the content of the item
the helper function creates a new fragment in landscape to draw the details in portrait starts an activity detailsactivity to manage the detail fragment -- that is create a new detailsfragment and add it to the root view using fragmentmanager as shown below

the helper function creates a new fragment in landscape to draw the details in portrait starts an activity detailsactivity to manage the detail fragment -- that is create a new detailsfragment and add it to the root view using fragmentmanager as shown below
the detailsactivity embeds the detailsfragment to display the selected play summary when the screen is in portrait orientation this is a secondary activity to show what the user has selected when the screen is not large enough to show it all in one activity

29840886
google-chrome	firefox
the source of your confusion is likely that google-chrome s implementation of getstats pre-dates the standard and has not been updated yet the example you link to is chrome-specific so i presume you are using google-chrome
if you were to try firefox you would find that it implements getstats to the standard however it does not support all the stats in the standard yet and fewer stats overall than google-chrome s old api

29840886
google-chrome	firefox
if you were to try firefox you would find that it implements getstats to the standard however it does not support all the stats in the standard yet and fewer stats overall than google-chrome s old api
since you didn t specify a browser i ll describe the standard and use firefox to show an example

29840886
rtp	rtcp
for instance mediatrackid links to rtcmediastreamtrackstats for the track this rtp data belongs to
a particularly squirrelly case is rtcp data which is stored in the same dictionaries as above which means you have to check to know you are looking at rtp data and not rtcp data

29841343
client-side	server-side
the hash value is for the anchor so it is only client-side it is often used in client-side framework like angular for client-side routing
the anchor is not available server-side

ubuntu	linux
ubuntu 16.04 sudo apt-get install gcc-multilib for some reason on ubuntu 17.04 i also needed to install the version specific one sudo apt-get install gcc-6-multilib then a minimal hello world main.c compiles without warning with and . main.out outputs hello world and file main.out says and qemu-i386 main.out also gives hello world but fails on an x86_64 executable with . main.out invalid elf image for this architecture furthermore i have run the compiled file in a 32 bit vm compiled and run an ia-32 c driver + complex ia-32 code so i think it works - see also cannot find crtn.o linking 32 bit code on 64 bit system it is a shame that this package conflicts with the cross compilers like gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf running versions of the question we are able to run 32-bit programs directly on 64-bit ubuntu because the ubuntu kernel is configured with according to whose help on the kernel source tree reads include code to run legacy 32-bit programs under a 64-bit kernel
you should likely turn this on unless you re 100 sure that you don t have any 32-bit programs left. this is in turn possible because x86 64 bit cpus have a mode to run 32-bit programs that the linux kernel uses

hex	binary
here is the hex dump of a serialized qstringlist with the three test strings in it 00 00 00 03 00 00 00 06 00 61 00 61 00 61 00 00 00 06 00 62 00 62 00 62 00 00 00 06 00 63 00 63 00 63 and here is the one with only the three test strings without the qstringlist 00 00 00 06 00 61 00 61 00 61 00 00 00 06 00 62 00 62 00 62 00 00 00 06 00 63 00 63 00 63 as you can see they are different therefore you cannot deserialize qstringlist from a data stream which was not serialized from a qstringlist
so in case your binary file is composed of serialized qstrings then you ve already figured out the most straightforward approach

29854340
super	extends
this is an example where the super class has a use-case where it can be instantiated and does not need to be abstract
there are many situations where you would want to extends from concrete classes

29854385
client-side	server-side
by definition with server-side processing enabled client-side filtering will not be performed
client-side processing - where filtering paging and sorting calculations are all performed in the web-browser

29854565
noexcept	throw
the rules in 8.4.2 2 do not apply to special member functions that have been explicitly defaulted after the initial declaration except destructors which are special cased in 12.4 3 to be noexcept true unless you declare it noexcept false or the destructors of one of the data members or base classes can throw
thus unless you specify to be noexcept true it is assumed to be noexcept false

29857016
hex	binary
converting hex to bin with these is straightforward converting back is not that trivial
i assume we have a good number that can be split into groups of 4 binary digits each

29858522
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome treats them like undefined and doesn t change the page contents
firefox does various things if it returns null it displays the string null

29860103
google-chrome	firefox
the html5 spec does not recognise the form controls as replaced elements and suggests that they be rendered as inline-block which would make google-chrome s behaviour correct but there are many ways in which all the browsers including google-chrome simply don t behave that way
from a backward compatibility perspective with old web content the firefox behaviour is more reliable

29860531
apache	nginx
there really aren t any objective reasons to use apache over nginx
in fact there may actually be performance reasons why nginx is superior

29865963
multiplying	division

oncreate	findviewbyid	setcontentview	findviewbyid
because currently not calling setcontentview method in oncreate method of activity to set layout for current activity so call setcontentview in oncreate by passing layout it in which error textview available
when i do findviewbyid r.id.textview

29875717
google-chrome	firefox
for google-chrome webkit browsers the container is not required and the commented code in the sample is alone enough but firefox requires to container
i think behavior in firefox is the correct one because input elements generally aren t expected to support pseudo-elements and hence it is better to retain the container to be future-proof points to note this sample is tested on google-chrome 44.0.2376.0 dev-m 42.0.2311.90 m firefox 36.0.4 internet explorer 11 and opera 28

29876211
dictionary	map
edit as others have suggested you might be better off using and instead of using a dictionary with an int as the key an actual array could be used
not familiar with php but it looks like your array has a map of string to string or int

29876520
cpython	pypy	cpython	ironpython
thus exec source global_vars local_vars is guaranteed to work the same way in cpython 0.9.9 1.x 2.x 3.x
and i have also verified that it works in jython 2.5.2 pypy 2.3.1 python 2.7.6 and ironpython 2.6.1 there are subtle differences so that not all python 3 code works in python 2 namely is valid in python 3 but not in python 2 and so is but i really don t know any reason why anyone would want to use these constructs in real code

29877541
google-chrome	firefox
i ve implemented it using js for links that wrap over not more than 2 lines - you can resize the frame to see it at work in my google-chrome 39.0.2171.95 the underline under a wrapping a doesn t work at all while in firefox it displays like in your screenshot above
primarily this is because your a element is inline default and when it wraps any pseudo child elements that depend on its width get 0 width in google-chrome and the element s width on the first row in firefox

29881041
3des	aes
3des is also not that good because brute forcing cost is 2 112
brute forcing cost for aes is 2 128 2 192 2 256 depending on the used key size

29881096
required	placeholder
the getmenunode method allows us to create the menu options we required for our custom section. we state that if the node is the root utilities then allow us to add child nodes and refresh the node collection. however if we are lower in the node tree keyphrase then we only want users to be able to delete the node ie the user shouldn t be allowed to create another level of nodes deeper than keyphrase create an api controller for our keyphrase crud requests create the custom section views with angular controllers which is the current architectual style in umbraco 7. it should be noted that umbraco expects that your custom section components are put into the following structure app_plugins backoffice we need a view to display and edit our keyphrase name target phrase and url this utilises umbraco and angular markup to display data input fields dynamically and associate our view to an angular controller that interacts with our data layer then we need html and corresponding angular controller for the keyphrase delete behaviour utilise umbraco s linkpicker to allow a user to select an internal or external url. we need html markup to launch the linkpicker and an associated directive js file that launches the link picker and post the selected url back to the html view there is one final js file that allows us to send data across the wire with everyone s favourite http verbs get post handles put too here too and delete in addition we will need a package manifest to register our javascript behaviour implement tweaks to allow the cms portion of the solution to work correctly
at this point we ve almost got our custom section singing but we just need to jump a couple more umbraco hoops namely a add a keyphrase event class that creates our keyphrase db table if it doesn t exist see point 8 b fire up umbraco and associate the new custom section to the target user from the user menu c alter the placeholder text for the custom section by searching for it in umbraco-- config-- en.xml and swapping out the placeholder text for utilities intercept target content fields of target datatypes when content is saved or published the requirement i was given was to intercept the body content of a news article so you ll need to create a document type in umbraco that has for example a title field of type textstring and bodycontent field of type richtext editor

29886372
hex	binary
0x8 is the hex expression of the integer 8
c will be 1 if either i or j but not both have a 1 in their 4th bit - that is a bitwise and with 0x8 binary 1000 returns 0

29891846
bower	npm
not really an answer but worth noting with the shift of managing front-end libraries to bower i don t expect work item #1914 will ever be implemented
i d highly recommend to look into how you can use the combination of npm bower and grunt to achieve your custom folder structure

29893297
queue	fifo
it sounds like you need fifo ordering per dispatch id so the ideal would be to have dispatch queue as the abstraction
that would explain your concern about hashing as not providing uniform distribution as some dispatch queue may be more active than others and unfairly balanced among workers

29893297
queue	fifo
that would explain your concern about hashing as not providing uniform distribution as some dispatch queue may be more active than others and unfairly balanced among workers
by separating the queue from the worker you retain fifo semantics and evenly spread out the work

29894764
super	self
i would be able to give you a more detailed answer if you would post the dbbackend implementation but my guess is that you override emailbackend.__init__ without calling super dbbackend self .__init__
edit you are indeed not calling super dbbackend self .__init__ in emailbackend.__init__ but super emailbackend self .__init__

29901526
rethinkdb	couchdb
firebase is not a nosql database obviously but it provides some of the realtime features of rethinkdb
couchdb might also be a good option since it s also an open-source nosql database and it also has support for change notifications which are a way to pull changes from a particular table different from changefeed s push model

29904718
mathml	mathjax
the nativemml output processor relies on the browser s native mathml support to handle line breaking when it is used. since line-breaking takes extra processing and so can slow down the mathematical output it is off by default but you can enable it by adding to your page just before the tag that loads mathjax.js itself
however in your example there s a lot of tabular mathematics layout using though people using tex as input are often not aware mathjax converts all inputs to mathml internally

29905673
calloc	malloc
you would be better served by using calloc rather than malloc followed by memset ... 0 ...
since the malloc library knows that the kernel will zero-fill freshly-allocated pages it knows it doesn t need to do an explicit memset to satisfy the zero-filling contract of calloc

29906440
ansible	puppet
i m not sure whether that maps cleanly to ansible s guest host
nevertheless puppet dsl functions run on the master during catalog building

29908305
profiling	debugging
the compiler doesn t support any form of instrumentation specifically for profiling like -p -pg -prof but compiled rust programs can be profiled under tools that do not require custom instrumentation such as instrumentation on os x and perf or callgrind on linux
i believe such tools support using dwarf debuginfo as emitted by -g to provide more detailed performance diagnostics per-line etc. but enabling optimisations play havoc with the debugging info and it s never really worked for me

29908310
uiview	subviews
as the error message suggests you re trying to add an object that isn t of type uiview as a subviews to the cell
add the ctpgraph object to an instance of type cptgraphhostingview then add this as a subviews to the cell furthermore you shouldn t really be accessing cells like that

29908338
imperative	declarative
however this is a very imperative api and might not fit well with an app that is otherwise declarative
in a recent project i implemented something like this with a declarative api using componentwillreceiveprops very similar to your own solution by comparing the property given to the component the last time it was rendered with the property given to it this time we can determine that the audio clip time needs to be adjusted

29908338
imperative	declarative
i think the best solution involves creating a special component with the sole job of hiding such an imperative api behind a declarative api
then your application doesn t need to know about the imperative api

29913531
build.gradle	gradlew
you already have compilesdkversion 20 in your app build.gradle file where it actually matters
now its showing error 16 0 gradlew dsl method not found runproguard runproguard was renamed to minifyenabled in the android gradlew plugin some time ago

29915793
requestfactory	gwt
in many cases you could use one or the other almost interchangeably autobeans requestfactory the editor framework placehistorymappers in gwt could be done using annotation processors but not always
gwt generators not only generate code they also tell gwt to use it

so while vim isn t the perfect tool for this as mentioned in the comments a hex editor is the right better tool it can be done
open the file in binary mode either via or via

29922579
qbs	qmake
there is no easy transition from qmake to qbs especially for more complex projects
the javascript-like syntax of the qbs language is not easy to grasp and documentation is scarce

29922579
qbs	qmake
the javascript-like syntax of the qbs language is not easy to grasp and documentation is scarce
there are imho only two other tools available that are of the caliber to replace qmake cmake the well known build tool

29923062
gunicorn	uwsgi
using gunicorn with a gevent worker should also work
the uwsgi documentation has a section on running in gevent mode but miguel commented uwsgi does not work with this extension either because it does not allow a custom gevent loop to be used

29923099
comparator	comparable
this approach ensures that whatever e you pass in that it s also a comparable so you can simply delegate to each object s comparator method while preserving the required type bound on the anonymous comparator
in this scenario there s not much value in deciding what to do based on if the array is an a or a - all of them implement the comparable interface

29923099
comparator	comparable
since the method doesn t allow for it it doesn t make sense to sort anything that isn t comparable either - we don t allow for the passing of a custom comparator which would address this issue
in that scenario what would be most ideal is if you relied on the natural behavior of comparable instead of your hand-written comparison method

29923885
bash	tcsh
the problem is that tcsh apparently removes escaping backslashes from history expansion exclamation points that it sees in double quoted strings whereas bash for some reason i ve never understood does not do that i m not sure you can get an exact duplicate of that alias in bash since i don t think bash will do history expansion on an alias expansion so the closest you can get is a function that takes files as arguments
that example is a tcsh alias not a bash alias

29927598
ienumerable	iqueryable	icollection	iqueryable
you want to receive a collection of users with not null value in email property so you come up with following code in the case of exposing users as ienumerable icollection you return all users from your database and then having the collection in the system memory you search it for users with not null value of email property
the query generated by ef and sent to database in this case looks like in the case of exposing users as iqueryable you return all users with not null value in email property already from the database

29931389
google-chrome	firefox
a couple of things i discovered google-chrome will use the storage event if the scanner is not set to open google-chrome automatically and will use the hash event after it becomes default
firefox will never use the hash event but opens an extra window unless you call the scanner with window.location.href thanks roland there are a couple of other anomalies but no deal breakers

29931438
google-chrome	firefox
while not an answer some interesting insight i found when working on this problem with google-chrome fetching the resource from cdn is a deferred call while fetching an item from the cache seems in fact to be a blocking call despite being quite fast
firefox didn t seem to this exhibit behavior consistently and i didn t even bother with ie

29932507
dictionary	map
you cannot create a dictionary using the todictionary syntax you used
its available overloads are listed here and all require lambda expressions to map the key and value properties to use from the given input

29936215
google-chrome	firefox
test case on changing object tag to iframe it works in google-chrome but not in firefox. my bad
it was due the firefox browser setting that was directly downloading the file instead of previewing

29936953
comparator	comparable
you need to provide a custom comparator which knows how to sort lists by their size
map.entry.comparingbyvalue will only work if the values in the map are comparable and list is not comparable

29936958
bash	zsh
the following recipe would do what hapens here is that the evaluation of the shell attribute value is delayed to the converge phase we have to use a if-then-else construction here with a ternary operator as i find it more readable to fallback to a shell we re sure will be present i used bin bash but a failsafe value would be bin sh or the shell attribute will be nil which is not allowed
with this delayed evaluation the test on the presence of bin zsh is done after the package has been installed and the file should be present

29937416
spaces	delimiter
| pipe s 20 g sub 20 for a spaces g means global so do it for every match on the line hth
sed -n -n switch means dont print s s is for substitutions is a delimiter so the command looks like s thing to sub subsitution optional extra command means the start of the line means match 0 or more of any character so it will match the longest string from the start of the line up to this is a capture group whatever is matched inside these brackets is saved and can be used later when the hat is used inside square brackets it means do not match any characters inside the brackets the same as before means 0 or more matches the capture group combined with this means capture any character except

29937718
sudo	passwd
check it with sudo service postgresql status your postgressql is not running on port 5432
you can check it typing sudo netstat -nl | grep postgres you have something wrong trying to connect to your db like the username the passwd or the databasename

29939696
daemons	systemd
the upshot of this is that if your daemons links with a framework that s not daemon-safe you can t predict how it will behave in general
it might work on your machine but fail on some other user s machine or fail on a future systemd release or fail for different input data

this error may be due to wrong permissions for usr local hadoop_store hdfs namenode folder or it does not exist
to rectify this problem follow these options option i if you don t have the folder usr local hadoop_store hdfs then create and give permission to the folder as follows sudo mkdir usr local hadoop_store hdfs sudo chown -r hadoopuser hadoopgroup usr local hadoop_store hdfs sudo chmod -r 755 usr local hadoop_store hdfs change hadoopuser and hadoopgroup to your hadoop username and hadoop groupname respectively

29941775
sudo	passwd
authentification utilities like sudo are generally reading the passwd from the controlling terminal thru dev tty see tty 4 not from standard input
but you could pass -s to sudo to ask it to read passwd on stdin you could use expect which is able to deal with terminals but you could simply configure your etc sudoers to disable passwd checking

29945830
spaces	delimiter
i have assumed that spaces is not a column entry instead it is empty string
then your 1.csv becomes if that is your scenario then this code will work so couple of changes from your script you have to specify the delimiter for reader as well

29946503
bash	subshell
... presumably does because the current shell executes it and bash -c presumably doesn t because that s a fully external process or something
that last bit is speculation and to my mind the subshell behavior here is entirely unhelpful and makes set -e unreliable which is why many people suggest avoiding it

29946762
strcpy	malloc
use strcpy instead
also please do not cast the return value of malloc and family

29948715
mp4	h.264
mp4 is not really a format but a container that can hold video in different formats
firefox supports only h.264 encoded video

29949198
comparator	comparable
the relationship between comparator and equals is briefly mentioned in the javadocs for comparable it is strongly recommended but not strictly required that x.compareto y 0 x.equals y
generally speaking any class that implements the comparable interface and violates this condition should clearly indicate this fact

29951976
required	placeholder
according to the html5 spec constraint validation if the element has its required attribute specified and either none of the option elements in the select element s list of options have their selectedness set to true or the only option element in the select element s list of options with its selectedness set to true is the placeholder label option then the element is suffering from being missing
if a select element has a required attribute specified does not have a multiple attribute specified and has a display size of 1

29951976
required	placeholder
if a select element has a required attribute specified does not have a multiple attribute specified and has a display size of 1
and if the value of the first option element in the select element s list of options if any is the empty string and that option element s parent node is the select element and not an optgroup element then that option is the select element s placeholder label option

29954743
super	implements
for any other selector or if your pasteboard support is on call through to super and return what it returns
this should work there s a problem though the presence of a responder in the responder chain which implements -copy will in and of itself cause the copy menu item to be enabled even if it wouldn t otherwise be if your object weren t in the chain or didn t implements -copy

29955015
pyenv	virtualenv

sepal_length sepal_width petal_length petal_width species 0 5.1 3.5 1.4 0.2 setosa 1 4.9 3.0 1.4 0.2 setosa 2 4.7 3.2 1.3 0.2 setosa 3 4.6 3.1 1.5 0.2 setosa 4 5.0 3.6 1.4 0.2 setosa pandas if you do not want to import seaborn but still want to access its sample data sets you can use andrewwowens s approach for the seaborn sample data note that the sample data sets containing categorical columns have their column type modified by sns.load_dataset and the result might not be the same by getting it from the url directly
the iris and tips sample data sets are also available in the pandas github repo here

inline	constexpr
dr there s a difference between a function being inline or more precisely being an inline function as defined in 7.1.2 2 and being declared with the inline specifier
the constexpr specifier makes a function inline but isn t an inline specifier. specifiers are described in subclause 7.1 of the c++ standard and are an element of the grammar

29958491
draggable	droppable
you re just changing the background of the droppable not actually moving the draggable
if you want to move it then add the following lines to dropped function if you just want to change the display of draggable then try this edit regarding the id you don t need to pass it to the function

29960771
jar	war
you only need the jar to compile your code
note that whether you use jetty or tomcat doesn t change anything this jar is provided by the servlet container so it must not be inside the war file

29964795
serializable	deserialization
org.jboss.weld.exceptions.illegalstateexception weld-000227 bean identifier index inconsistency detected - the distributed container probably doesn t work with identical applications this exception will be thrown when a weld cdi proxy instance of a serializable class has incompatibly changed after deserialization after tomcat restart
most likely you have during developing edited a serializable session or view scoped managed bean while not having touched the serialversionuid

29967130
variance	kurtosis
higher kurtosis means more of the variance in the image is the result of infrequent extreme deviations as opposed to frequent modestly sized deviations
so you would expect the not paper to have a higher kurtosis because it has lumps of other stuff in the image rather than the fairly uniform paper

29967264
elasticsearch	kibana
i was able to resolve the issue by correcting the date format in elasticsearch
the powershell convertto-json command in my script was converting a timestamp object to a date format that did not cooperate with kibana

29971412
super	self
alternatively use the super function which produces a bound method so a method object where self has been bound to an instance
to call the overridden __init__ method directly on the class you need to explicitly pass in self because methods looked up on a class are not bound to an instance since python cannot know what the instance would be in that case

29971529
google-chrome	firefox
in your case you could also use google-chrome the review the certificate and then store extract all intermediate certificates from the certificate view
it looks as if the certificate chain is incomplete and thus firefox and likely other browsers cannot verify the site certificate

29974635
swift	objective-c
update for swift 3 4
unicode escape sequences are differently in swift from those in objective-c the unicode character u+fffc is escaped as this is your string now remove all u+fffc characters note that options and range are optional parameters and not needed in this case

29979157
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome canary version 44.0.2387.0 canary 64-bit supports the spec on mdn but does not support the navigator.battery namespace
firefox supports the navigator.battery namespace but does not support the navigator.getbattery function

29979157
firefox	safari
firefox supports the navigator.battery namespace but does not support the navigator.getbattery function
safari version 8.0.5 10600.5.17 doesn t support anything referring to the battery api that i can tell

29980855
trie	tree
building off of yazanpro s trie suggestion it was possible to build a solution which not only can search the words but also stop additional searches where abc needs to be omitted so there is no need to check for abcface abchole abchead.
the logic inside the tree hydration is currently in place to format from an non-optimized list of words to construct an optimized list of words 10 to a line

29982311
calloc	malloc
two options make curr point to an instance of item allocate memory dynamically for curr using malloc calloc and later free it after its use
it is also a good idea to check if malloc calloc did not fail by checking its return value

29983148
super	extends
the purpose of the super keyword in java is to allow you to access the instance fields instance methods or the constructor of a super class from which a class extends
since every class in java extends from object implicitly a call to super in a constructor for a class that does not extends from any class means a call to the no-arg constructor in the object class

29985670
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	calloc	malloc
as haccks commented this would not work if you make y point to another memory location provided that this memory location wasn t returned by malloc calloc realloc
in c you should not cast the result of malloc calloc realloc

29985670
realloc	calloc	calloc	malloc
in c you should not cast the result of malloc calloc realloc
also checking the return value of calloc to see if it was successful is good

29989126
udp	tcp
udp differs from tcp in that you don t expect an acknowledged confirmation response. for example udp will be best for video conference because if 25 picture frames are sent to the server every second and 4-5 are lost on the way - there is no reason to send the lost frames again and therefore no reason to get an acknowledged confirmation response for each frame. however udp will not be the best for sending a profile picture because if the server didn t received the picture - it has to be sent over and over again until we get an acknowledged confirmation response from the server saying it got the picture
you wrote an app which need to communicate with server every minute and let the server know the position of the client udp might be a good practice here because maybe you don t really care if a few network packages are lost because others will be sent later on

29991956
lisp	scheme
the only cases i could recommend script-fu instead of scheme are if you are already proficient in scheme lisp and not in python at all or if you are just adapting fixing an existing script
tricks like what you describe are all you gonna get using scheme script-fu

29992924
lxml	html5lib
and there s a couple of bugs on this one general and one specific to lxml
note that it s not possible to use the html5lib tokenizer alone to achieve this the tokenizer has its state changed by the tree construction step at various points

29994515
swift	objective-c
the swift equivalent of instancetype without being generic this can be used from swift and from objective-c
generic methods are not visible from objective-c
