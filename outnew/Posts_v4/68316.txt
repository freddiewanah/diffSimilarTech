setcontentview	findviewbyid
your setcontentview r.layout.activity_main
has not been called before you make your call to findviewbyid

textview	imageview
another linearlayout with layout_weight 1 and vertical orientation which will contain the two textview 3
imageview sorry for not posting any code

equals	compareto
see compareto document notes to implementers for objects a b and c the following must be true a.compareto a must return zero. if a.compareto b returns zero then b.compareto a must return zero. if a.compareto b returns zero and b.compareto c returns zero then a.compareto c must return zero. if a.compareto b returns a value other than zero then b.compareto a must return a value of the opposite sign. if a.compareto b returns a value x not equals to zero and b.compareto c returns a value y of the same sign as x then a.compareto c must return a value of the same sign as x and y
i think in you function public int compareto periodehtconflit phtc when two dates are equals you should return 0

38003834
sqoop	hadoop
you can not use sqoop in your case
sqoop runs in hadoop and uses jdbc to connect with the db

38003834
sqoop	hadoop
sqoop runs in hadoop and uses jdbc to connect with the db
if hadoop nodes can not connect with the db server then you can not use it

38004254
namedtuple	dictionary
you access attributes with dot syntax not keys with bracket syntax but it s much more memory efficient and it s immutable so it can go in a set you can then use the namedtuple like a regular tuple so for id status in loc works or use named attribute access instead for record in loc print record.id record.status
if id is unique it seems more likely that what you really want is just a dictionary mapping id to status

38013106
super	self
here i avoid it by calling the superclass implementation of __getattribute__ the na√Øve way of calling getattr self item would fail class a object def __getattribute__ self item print item return super a self .__getattribute__ item def x self print 4 which gives note that both __getattr__ and __getattribute__ apply equally to attributes and methods which are more or less just callable attributes
there are a couple of obvious problems with your code class a object def __getattr__ self item # 1 print item return self.item # 2 def x self # 1 again print 4 __getattr__ will only be invoked if item cannot be found the normal way

38019924
punctuation	words
explanation g represents either end of previous match or start of input if there was no previous match yet when we are attempting to find first match s+ represents one or more non-whitespace characters to match words including non-alphabetic characters like or punctuation negative-look-behind will prevent accepting whitespace which has apple before it i added another negative-look-behind before apple to make sure that it doesn t have any non-whitespace which ensures that this is not part of some other words in replacement represents match from group 1 the one from s+ which represents words
so we are replacing words and spaces with only words effectively removing spaces warning this solution assumes that sentence doesn t start with space words can be separated with only one space

38020438
fgets	fread
you should probably use fread rather than fgets since the latter is really designed for reading text files and this is clearly not a text file
your updated code in fact does have the very problem i originally wrote about but have since retracted since you are now using fread rather than fgets i.e

38024609
viewdidload	viewdidappear
whenever i would add anything to my uiscrollviews i would just do it all in viewdidappear since it seems like viewdidappear accounts for your screen sizes and constraints while viewdidload is really just for initialization and things that should remain true for the whole time the app is available for the most part
from what i ve seen with manipulating uiscrollviews...it s probably best not to do that in viewdidload

38024748
setinterval	settimeout
when that ajax call returns it should call settimeout not setinterval to execute updatemessages after a 5 second wait
when the ajax call in updatemessages returns it will call settimeout again to call updatemessages after a 5 second wait

38025208
inline	inlining
it is not worth defining as inline a short function which runs by itself a significant time
there is no point inlining a matrix multiplication for example the call overhead is insignificant w.r.t

38025307
uiview	subviews
third if you want the frame of the uiview to be dictated by the drawing code alter your paintcode function like so next in shapestestui you should pass the parameter rect of drawrect to the modified paintcode function and last you should give the desired cgrect when initializing block1 in your view controller
first your code does not show a method being added as a subviews as this is not possible

38026393
firefox	safari
not tested in firefox
above code works for me in ie10 and ie11 and now also works in chrome and safari

38026524
bower	npm
npm install bower bower init create a .bowerrc file and put in it bower install bootstrap --save include the script in the html file
you do not want to use npm for the client side part of the application bootstrap included

38026570
memcpy	memmove
the reason is that memcpy only works if the source and destination do not overlap
memmove on the other hand is guaranteed to work properly even if the source and destination do overlap

38032891
persistent	transient
all non-transient instances variables that are not annotated with the transient annotation are persistent
when property-based access is used the object relational mapping annotations for the entity class annotate the getter property accessors and the persistence provider runtime accesses persistent state via the property accessor methods

38032891
persistent	transient
when property-based access is used the object relational mapping annotations for the entity class annotate the getter properties accessor and the persistent provider runtime accesses persistent state via the properties accessor methods
all properties not annotated with the transient annotation are persistent

38034319
g++	gcc
try g++ instead. most likely automatically linking issue
if you just run gcc on a c++ file it will not just work like g++ does

38035546
ecj	javac
thats not the first time javac ecj behave differently in inference of type parameters
in that case you can give javac a hint with function

38039598
implements	extends
as mentioned by tweakmag the disadvantages of creating a folder structure and copying the entire model or controller for a single function override most important being future upgrade could introduce new features that would not be available unless it is remembered to copy across the new versioning of that file and implements the changes again. thus a solution can be to extends the core class model or controller and just write the method you want to override instead of copying all the methods
for example if you want to say override a method getproductcollection in mage_catalog_model_category here will be the steps create a custom namespace module folder with etc folder in it register the module in app etc folder by creating namespace_module.xml setup the config.xml in namespace module etc create model folder in namespace_module and a php file category.php now the main difference here is we extends the magento s core class instead of writing all the methods the getproductcollection method is overridden so it ll be called instead of the method defined in the core model class

38040409
inline	inlining
also usually the compiler can make good asm on its own and inline asm is a very brittle way to optimize
one of the many major problems is that constant propagation after inlining isn t possible through inline asm. anyway let s try it with a working example of gnu c inline asm see the code with asm output on the godbolt compiler explorer and for the same function with no asm statement

38041859
client-side	server-side
dr yes it is possible but there are better alternatives important concepts angularjs is a synonym for angular version 1 angular2 is synonym for angular version 2 not backwards compatible with v1 primeng is a components library that depends on angular2 primefaces is a components library that depends on jsf jsf and angular2 are mvc frameworks where each one has injection mechanisms based on annotations annotation although the terminology is similar the underneath of both mechanisms is very different angular2 + primeng is used with typescript recommended or javascript on the other hand jsf + primefaces is used with java primeng is client-side primefaces is server-side the company developing primeng is the same company developing primefaces and recently we as users have seen a very good synergy where if there is an improvement in one component is then ported to the other library
right now 2016 primefaces has more components than primeng and feels more polished implications of using primeng + jsf primefaces each framework has different lifecycles with different concepts and implications given that one is client-side and the other is server-side if you start to use both frameworks you have to understand them at great detail

38042448
laravel	yii
so laravel should actually be able to check password with your hashes if you cannot find a method which is integrated in laravel itself you can surely use the password_verify function to check the hashes
the yii generates password hashes through the crypt function and according to the documentation it generates bcrypt hashes

38043989
operands	scalar
end note the value computations of the operands of an operator are sequenced before the value computation of the result of the operator
if a side effect on a scalar object is unsequenced relative to either another side effect on the same scalar object or a value computation using the value of the same scalar object and they are not potentially concurrent 1.10 the behavior is undefined

38051197
dictionary	map
can be done like this some notes and improvements dictionary is not a good variable name in python alternatives to the complicated expression converting bool to int if you can leave the values as bool s xyz in line credit jonclements
better to use dictionary comprehension than map

38053608
udp	tcp
if you probe a udp port it might not answer because a packet filter drops your packet the service does not understand the probe and thus does not bother to answer the service is not willing to answer to packets from arbitrary ip addresses in all of these cases nmap s verdict ist open|filtered
since udp has no handshake like tcp there is no reliable way to tell open apart from filtered

38054124
ssl	https
activating ssl in contrast is a one time configuration
you can redirect from plain http to https but you cannot activate ssl tls from htaccess

38054124
ssl	https
you can redirect from plain http to https but you cannot activate ssl tls from htaccess
to activate ssl tls you must use sslengine among other directives sslengine on as you can see from the documentation context server config virtual host this is only possible in server config or virtual host context but not in directory and .htaccess context

38054673
noexcept	throw
they look like the two sides of the same medal -- by using type traits and sfinae you can have code which shows different behaviours depending on which standard library implementation you use if it marks some functions as noexcept constexpr or if it doesn t and that defeats the purposes of having a standard in the first place.
the standard says yes 17.6.5.12.1 restrictions on exception handling res.on.exception.handling any of the functions defined in the c++ standard library can report a failure by throw an exception of a type described in its throw paragraph

38057129
google-chrome	firefox
breakpoints set in source maps files do not trigger unlike in google-chrome
to disable source maps in firefox click on gear icon in the top right corner of firefox dev tool then unselect show original sources

38059157
sudo	passwd
steps create the group sudo groupadd ambari grant the group permission to run the command using visudo
run sudo visudo and add one of the following lines to the end of the file or note the first option will not require the user to type their passwd to execute the command

38064228
accelerometer	gyroscope
on some devices they are implemented in h w on some devices they use the accelerometer + the magnetometer on some other devices they use the gyro
on nexus s and xoom the gyroscope is currently not used

38064859
persistent	transient
the persistent column shows the number of objects that currently exist while the transient column shows the number of objects that have existed but have been deallocated
so if you expect an object to be deallocated but the number in the transient column doesn t change then you know the object hasn t been deallocated and you have a problem

38064899
nunit	mstest
i am biased because i work on nunit but the advantage of nunit or xunit is that both frameworks offer more functionality like data driven tests parallel execution and a host of advanced features
that said there is nothing wrong with mstest especially if your team is not very experienced with unit testing

38067674
bash	subshell
a few things in bash is equivalent to the same test command check the man page so those and || are not logical operators but rather the shell equivalents parentheses in posix shell are not a grouping operator
they will work here but they open a subshell you are better off using standard test options of -a and -o making your if statement though based on your logic it sounds like you actually want something like

38072828
opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
look at the question here to see an informative discussion about it. the gist is webkit is an opera rendering engine and it works in google-chrome as well because google-chrome s rendering engine gecko is based on webkit
from looking at this css-tricks post it seems that to get the best support you should add another css rule without the -webkit- but it would still not have support across all browsers look at the final paragraph with the browser-support summary in the post just to reiterate this will not fix your problem with ie and firefox as they just don t support the clip-path property yet

38078411
sudo	passwd
you may use sudo which you can control better read your os manual about it beware using such in non interactive mode is considered as harmful.
for security reasons su doesn t takes passwd everywhere else than from an interactive terminal

38080512
swift	objective-c
do try catch in swift catch swift errors which are an entirely distinct thing from objective-c exceptions
realm follows foundation s pattern for error reporting api misuse errors throw exceptions which are not intended to be caught and can t be caught in swift and recoverable errors throw swift errors or use nserror out parameters in objective-c

38084651
comparator	comparable
for more about the differences between comparable an comparator see java comparable vs comparator
the benefit is that you can then use treeset with objects that do not implement comparable but for which you can provide a comparator

38084656
hex	binary
since you seem unable to take two concepts given at different times and combine them here is the whole thing in one place in sequence problem you have input in hex and want output in hex but openssl enc takes input in binary not hex and produces output in binary or base64 but not hex
deduction you must convert the input from hex to binary

38088132
super	implements
a simple recursive function does the trick as torazaburo points out in a comment if you can use es6 destructuring assignment cleans up the implementation even more or it gets super sugary sweet with arrow functions the underscore implementation does provide some other conveniences though i m guessing these are here to maintain compatibility with native array.prototype.reduce
i personally wouldn t implements reduce this way but that s beside the point

38088950
jar	war
unlike java applications that have packaging as a first class citizen be it a jar or a war this concept isn t baked in most development environments
that s why there a big push towards docker it allows you to insulate your app and gem dependencies and plug it into the production environment much like dropping a war into a container

38090504
dns	spf
this basically mean that you shouldn t have more than one txt entries in your dns
if your spf is too long you can make use of other txt entries and they will be concatenated

38094695
google-chrome	firefox
there s no way to be sure that s actually going to be true not even on google-chrome
because google-chrome s implementation of number#tostring 36 outputs more digits than firefox s

38095049
firefox	safari
but once i tried again on my firefox mobile it was gone
looks like chrome and safari are ignoring this css but not firefox

38095461
sudo	passwd
then stop the mysqld process and relaunch it with the classical way sudo etc init.d mysql stop sudo etc init.d mysql start this is borrowed from you can check also another method to reset mysql passwd
1 stop the mysql demon process using this command sudo etc init.d mysql stop 2 start the mysqld demon process using the --skip-grant-tables option with this command because you are not checking user privs at this point it s safest to disable networking

38098680
postgresql	mysql	sudo	passwd
reset root passwd with or if you d already set a root passwd which i doubt otherwise you wouldn t be able to log in via sudo then it would be mysql users are not linked with unix users unlike postgresql
the solution is to provide a passwd for the root mysql account if you ve not done so already

38099143
tensorflow	cudnn
the method is as bellows first link the cuda library using the following command sudo ldconfig usr local cuda lib64 then i can import tensorflow in vscode
however there is still one error which is as bellow although the program can run it seems that the program cannot find the cudnn library

38101305
prepare	execute
remove the parameter from if you call it with parameter the query will be executet not the prepare statement
see the javadoc int executeupdate string sql throws sqlexception execute the given sql statement which may be an insert update or delete statement or an sql statement that returns nothing such as an sql ddl statement

38101756
implements	extends
the compiler not being able to make proper conclusions suspects that you might have somewhere wanted to declare a function but because it has not found any code of that sort it tells you that you haven t implements it yet and you haven t declared it either
what i suspect because i understand not only fortran but also to some extends english is that it s more likely meant to be an array of type

38102768
intersect	contains
notice that it s not necessary to worry about whether or not the endpoint-swapping actually guarantees that the new pair of line segments ac and bd don t intersect -- while it seems obvious that they won t all we actually need for the proof of correctness is to show that .
when a solution exists see my comment giving an example instance where it does not it can be found by finding a minimum weight matching in a complete bipartite graph that contains a red or black vertex for every point and for every red vertex u and black vertex v an edge u v of weight equal to the euclidean distance between their corresponding points

38104262
countif	named
then use countif like and if it is not 0 then there is a match
for vba it is application.countifs range a a named range b b lastname .... if you have any questions left just ask

38108104
super	extends	super	implements	implements	extends
there s no problem in having a class implements autoclosable even if it s super class doesn t
actually as all the classes in java extends java.lang.object either directly or indirectly all the autoclosable s eventually extends a class that doesn t implements this interface

38108104
implements	extends
actually as all the classes in java extends java.lang.object either directly or indirectly all the autoclosable s eventually extends a class that doesn t implements this interface
if your class has some semantic of close ing it you should probably have it implements autoclosable

38108115
swift	objective-c
changing to swift has actually saved me from mistakes that i was making without even realizing it because of dynamic typing imposed on me by the apis the fact that objectatindex returned an id though to be sure this is less likely to trouble you today thanks to lightweight generics
can someone explain what someone explain what objective-c can support that swift fundamentally cannot when developing apps what i used to take advantage of in objective-c was not so much dynamic typing as dynamic messaging

38108991
antialiasing	transparent
in the questio the image is rendered on not a very bright background example #888 the result is that the antialiasing only has a range of 7 bits halving the dynamic range
the problem is compounded by the fact that if the image is rendered onto a transparent background where the antialiasing is achieved by varying the alpha channel resulting in the introduction of a second level of artifacts

38109546
implements	extends
you must call this from an activity if you want it to be a valid context since activity implements context interface
since you re calling it from a class which does not extends activity surely you get an error since this is not a context in that case

38109800
qthread	qobject
a qthread is a thread handle not a thread itself
if you want to run something in another thread it belongs in a plain qobject that you move to a thread

38109800
qthread	qobject
you don t need to derive from qthread at all
you also shouldn t move a qthread s base qobject to the thread itself

38110873
swift	objective-c
the following may help compile c code and expose it to swift under linux linking a c library and its supporting library in swift linux
since objective-c as used on apple s platforms is not well supported on linux i think a better approach might be to access the sqlite c api from swift by either using a system module or bridging header

38110873
swift	objective-c
since objective-c as used on apple s platforms is not well supported on linux i think a better approach might be to access the sqlite c api from swift by either using a system module or bridging header
you might also want to wrap the sqlite api in a c library exposing a subset of the api that you need in a simplified form more suitable to be called from swift

38111011
dictionary	map
let s begin with labels object.keys dictionary returns an array of all the keys from dictionary so we put labels object.keys dictionary now we need the values for the data array with object.keys and map we can do it easily we use object.keys to get an array of all the keys in dictionary and then map to get each value from it s key like this working fiddle both object.keys and map are part of the ecmascript 5 specification so this wont work on es3 ie 8 or lower but you can get pollyfils for both of those functions array.prototype.map polyfill object.keys polyfill
you re not doing bad all you need now is to map that object into the data and label fields

38116781
ssl	https
lastly the office store does not allow non-https add-ins at all so if you re planning in distributing your app through the store you will definitely need ssl
it will actually be an issue in the online versions of office because the apps themselves are always https and thus generate mixed content both http and https if your app isn t

38118063
build.gradle	gradlew
then it tries to download the dependency from the repositories you have added in the projectc build.gradle or top level
in this moment gradlew doesn t use the projectb build.gradle but only uses the pom file

38118742
swift	objective-c
error handling in swift differs than error handling in objective-c
in swift the nsjsonserialization.datawithjsonobject doesn t have a parameter for error

38127859
zlib	libpng
the visual studio 2010 defaults for a win32 dll or static library project are as follows release debug dll md mdd static library md mdd also be sure to build libpng zlib and your project all for the same platform 32-bit or 64-bit
be sure that your project and your libpng.dll were built with the same settings as explained in the projects vstudio readme.txt that comes with libpng warning libpng 1.6.x does not use the default run-time library when building static library builds of libpng

38130649
sudo	passwd
convince sshpass to do its usual trick on the sudo prompt
i have not tried it but it may be as simple as doing sshpass -p passwd sudo something

38130649
sudo	passwd
i have not tried it but it may be as simple as doing sshpass -p passwd sudo something
if not i seem to remember the latest versions of sshpass have a way to change its expected passwd prompt similar to what expect is doing

38131971
strtol	strtod
if you d like to accept floating point values then use strtod instead it works almost in the same way doesn t take the last argument that strtol does
edit i actually changed the code to use strtod instead since it accepts a larger variety of numbers

38132871
oncreate	onstart
yes i suppose when you look for the cycle of life of an activity you have the oncreate that will create you view and the onstart that will start your view
i suppose you can had you ui on the create and it will be ready when onstart will be called but i m not sure that is the best way to do it

38133095
google-chrome	firefox
if you are you re web push with google-chrome for android the replacement behavior your seeing is expected and isn t configurable
same behavior on google-chrome for desktop and firefox

38134682
profiling	instrumentation
valgrind is not a profiling
it is a slow dynamic instrumentation platform with many tools built on top of it

38134682
profiling	instrumentation
valgrind and both tools are not native profiling they do not profiling application as it will run on real cpu in real life
instead valgrind executes program on the virtual machine and callgrind cachegrind instrumentation machine code with counters

38135264
inline	inlining
this can cause inlining of previously not inline functions
since inline functions generally perform faster this can lead to performance improvements

38135707
haskell	idris
the compile-time evaluator is part of the idris kernel and is implemented in haskell using a hoas higher order abstract syntax style representation of values
since everything is known to have a normal form here the evaluation strategy doesn t actually matter because either way it will get the same answer and in practice it will do whatever the haskell run-time system chooses to do

38140569
stateless	stateful
stateless instances can have -1 because they can be created and destroyed without impacting state
the number of partitions for a stateful service is not dynamic

38147440
swift	objective-c
first in swift and then expose to objective-c through a category
you can bridge variadic functions in c to swift but not the other direction

38147440
swift	objective-c
you can bridge variadic functions in c to swift but not the other direction
see using swift with cocoa and objective-c interacting with c apis variadic functions for more on that

38147530
implements	extends
in java 5 generics were introduced and the signature of this method could be changed to where t is not the element type without difficulty because of the way type erasure is implements for old code which used or subclassed arraylist rather than the method signature stayed the same
b extends the raw type a

38148135
jar	war
additional note if you are using the build-helper-maven-plugin buildnumber-maven-plugin or any other similar plugin to generate meta-data later on used by the maven-jar-plugin entries for the manifest file you most probably have executions linked to the validate phase and you still want to have them during the jar jar build step and yet keep a fast execution
in this case the almost harmless overhead is to invoke the validate phase as following mvn validate jar jar deploy deploy yet another additional note if you have not jar but say war packaging use war war before install deploy instead

38148507
g++	gcc
in cmd for gcc type gcc --version in cmd for g++ type g++ --version if it is installed then proceed
now compile your .c or .cpp using cmd for .c syntax gcc -o exe_filename yourfilename.c example gcc -o myfile myfile.c here exe_filename myfile in example is the name of your .exe file which you want to produce after compilation note i have not put any extension here

38148662
ubuntu	linux
to install lxml on ubuntu you first will need to install the binary dependencies sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev libxslt-dev python-dev then you will be able to install lxml using pip pip install lxml you cannot install libxml or libxslt using pip as they are not python packages
official documentation has the installation steps for linux mac os and windows

38150142
pandas	dask
using dask using pandas using python csv
you can use dask.dataframe which is syntactically similar to pandas but does manipulations out-of-core so memory shouldn t be an issue

38150915
inline	inlining
now there s one final piece of this puzzle that isn t in the documentation which is that unless you tell ghc not to inline your top-level value produced using unsafeperformio you might still end up with sites where you use defaultservices having their own unique set of services
e.g. without forbidding inlining this would happen mdash

38151074
union	distinct
also take out all your distinct it probably won t speed it up but it seems silly because you are doing a union and not a union all
take this filter and add it to each individual query in the union and insert into headquartersfiles it might seem like this makes a lot more filters but it will actually speed stuff up because you are filtering before you start processing as a union

38158764
swift	objective-c
try this #selector dataretrievaloperations.retrievecategories with omitting class or protocol name in #selector ... notation swift assumes the enclosing class which may be a viewcontroller i guess
one more issue it seems swift cannot implement objective-c protocol methods with default implementation in protocol extension. i think i have heard something about this but i couldn t find any articles for now. you may need to implement it in your own class s extension or find another way

38159878
g++	gcc
this is formalised in the c++11 standard at 21.4.2.9 it s worth noting that gcc s libstdc++ as used by g++ does throw an exception when passed a nullptr what basic_string _s_construct null not valid
i might infer from your mention of gdb that you re using g++ - in which case this probably isn t your problem unless you re using an older version than me

38161307
super	extends
using the same example as above if you have class bar s string and you extends it class foo val x int val y int s string extends bar s you are invoking the super constructor at the same time as you are declaring that you are extends it ie the extends bar s part
so given those two points above since all constructors must chain to the single primary constructor of a class and that single primary constructor only invokes a single super constructor you cannot exactly translate your java example in scala

38161669
swift	objective-c
swift 3 beta makes special treatment for properties with leading is . for the property isdefault swift generates isdefault as getter and setdefault as setter not setisdefault
use setdefault in your objective-c code or make it a computed property and give objective-c names manually

38165593
decimal	ieee
if an ieee 754 double precision is converted to a decimal string with at least 17 significant digits and then converted back to double then the final number must match the original
the same article goes on to note that by compromising precision even smaller positive numbers which do not meet the standards precision requirements can be represented the 11 bit width of the exponent allows the representation of numbers between 10 -308 and 10 308 with full 15 17 decimal digits precision

38167148
serializable	deserialization
also you should define owner field in your serializable as read_only
then the field will not be required during deserialization

38168853
comparator	comparable
in java you can sort by having elements of collection all implement comparable interface or by implementing comparator class
when you implement comparable in elements of collection that comparators sort is used as default sort order so with only implementing comparable you will not be able to get both sort orders

38172146
scheme	racket
try the above scheme implementations in case you do get any errors paste them here in case you don t have these versions which would be weird but i don t know your situation and are doing the course on your own try to do it without simply.scm and any time you find something s missing in your scheme try to copy only that definition from simply.scm or modify your code so that it s not needed -- that s the hardcore way
it seems to work with guile 2.0.11 chicken s intepreter 4.10.0 gambit s interpreter gsi 4.2.8 mit-scheme 9.1.1 racket will not do afaik you d have to modify this file quite heavily at least change set

super	implements
jls-15.27.2 lambda body unlike code appearing in anonymous class declarations the meaning of names and the this and super keywords appearing in a lambda body along with the accessibility of referenced declarations are the same as in the surrounding context except that lambda parameters introduce new names
therefore you re trying to call removelistener with a object as parameter that doesn t implements invalidationlistener or changelistener which means none of the removelistener methods is applicable

38173162
required	placeholder
if they are not initialized to a default value they are required to be in the url in order to match
consider the defaults in the route definition these are the values that will be used as both the match and the output in the routevalues if the placeholder is not supplied in the url

passenger	puma
passenger enterprise has some nice tools that hold your hand if you re not an expert system administrator
puma also has some tools but they are not as powerful as what passenger enterprise provides

38174106
passenger	puma
puma also has some tools but they are not as powerful as what passenger enterprise provides
puma requires system-level expertise if you want to get the same control and insights as passenger enterprise

38174373
jar	war
with spring boot you create a jar not a war file as your artifact
usually the war file would be deployed to a webcontainer you need to run separately like like tomcat

38177414
postgresql	mysql
note that postgresql will actually enforce the length limit whereas sqlite doesn t really care and will allow you to insert strings greater than the declared size
but the mysql mariadb driver will enforce the 255 character limit in django db backends mysql validation.py

38185292
super	extends
note that the super in the call is not needed
super.getapplication call getapplication in the super class which is android.app.service kiahapplication super.getapplication cast result of super.getapplication to kiahapplication which is class kiahapplication extends application kiahapplication super.getapplication .setservicerunning true

38186618
ubuntu	debian
image issues the distro you are running on in your container is not ubuntu 14.04 but the one that java 8 was built from
if you took the java image from official library on docker hub you have a hierarchy of images coming initially from debian jessie

38187745
realloc	malloc
your program invokes undefined behavior because you re passing a pointer which was not previously returned by dynamic memory allocator family of functions to realloc
according to c11 chapter 7.22.3.5 the realloc function emphasis mine if ptr is a null pointer the realloc function behaves like the malloc function for the specified size

38187745
realloc	malloc
according to c11 chapter 7.22.3.5 the realloc function emphasis mine if ptr is a null pointer the realloc function behaves like the malloc function for the specified size
otherwise if ptr does not match a pointer earlier returned by a memory management function or if the space has been deallocated by a call to the free or realloc function the behavior is undefined

38189983
direct3d	directx
intel hd graphics 4000 2500 aka ivy bridge or 3rd generation core or later supports direct3d feature level 11.0 but it may not be considered sufficient performance by the developer publisher to support this particular title
the version of the directx runtime you have installed which describes what the os software can support is not the same thing as the direct3d hardware feature level which describes the support your video hardware provides

38189983
direct3d	directx
the version of the directx runtime you have installed which describes what the os software can support is not the same thing as the direct3d hardware feature level which describes the support your video hardware provides
see this blog post and msdn direct3d feature levels for example if you have windows 7 installed then you have the directx 11.0 runtime or the partial directx 11.1 runtime update

38189983
direct3d	directx
with windows 10 you have the directx 12.0 runtime which supports 11.3 or with the november 2015 build 10586 11.4 as well as 12.0 the version of the directx runtime doesn t indicate anything about whether or not the system is running a direct3d 9-era shader model 2.0 part which would be d3d_feature_level_9_1 or d3d_feature_level_9_2 a shader model 3.0 part d3d_feature_level_9_3 a direct3d 10 video card from 2006 d3d_feature_level_10_0 or d3d_feature_level_10_1 a direct3d 11 video card from 2010 d3d_feature_level_11_0 or a just released latest card d3d_feature_level_11_1 d3d_feature_level_12_0 or d3d_feature_level_12_1
in fact with windows 10 an application can be using directx 11.4 and in theory require a d3d_feature_level_12_1 direct3d feature level video card to run

not in firefox 47 ie 11 safari 5

38190116
postgresql	mysql
for example mssql recent versions of oracle and postgresql have these constructs but mysql does not
imho it is a real pain for mysql users because in recent years mysql started to lean towards standard but in some strange manner - by default it switches off its non-standard hacks but does not implement standard counterparts

38192753
factors	mean
use the levels argument to specify factors levels
now column y is the independent variable response while column group is the dependent variable covariate before statistical modelling we can use boxplot to visualize your group data boxplot y group dat ## formula method for boxplot we see that group ns and exsm do not appear to have noticeable difference in mean but other two levels are quite different in mean

38193705
realloc	malloc
so the code should instead be something like it s important that is initialized to null before the first call to realloc or you will have undefined behavior
the expression that you use in your call to malloc will not work as you expect it to

38194589
swift	objective-c
therefore the usage of nstimer is not more swifty but the need for late binding is more obfuscated to make swift developers feel better
if i wanted to use objective-c i d not be writing swift.

38196563
calloc	malloc
you can use calloc or you can use a size of as argument to malloc
malloc x only reserves x bytes not x floats

38200908
spaces	delimiter
notice the extra spaces this works fine. in your code the delimiter chars where set to -s
you actually did not set the delimiter option for read correctly

38203000
openssl	m2crypto
install says on the installation on macs apple does not provide on more recent versions of mac os x at least certainly since 10.11 any version of openssl so it is necessary to use brew or similar packaging systems to install third party packages
a mac os x users suggested that this series of commands gave him a working copy of m2crypto on his system i am afraid that completely automagic pip installation doesn t work atm

38205949
lisp	prolog
lisp is a functional programming language or rather and imperative language with a pure functional subset and so the relational programming that prolog enables does not carry over to lisp at least not directly because a function is only a special case of a relation and can be expressed easily whereas expressing a relation in terms of functions is more involved
most notably a function only works in one direction and so you cannot expect to use lisp directly to answer more general cases that are easily possible with prolog

38217530
ssl	https
maybe your website doesn t have the ssl flag enabled and the generated certificate do not handle your website
on the web hosting offer of ovh the https protocol is available after the deployment on all the load balancing infrastructure

38223370
icmp	tcp
rfc 3022 icmp error packet modifications section in a napt setup if the ip message embedded within icmp happens to be a tcp udp or icmp query packet you will also need to modify the appropriate tu port number within the tcp udp header or the query identifier field in the icmp query header
but the client doesn t know the external query id the code in pwnat use 0 as the identifier of original request it sends an icmp time exceeded packet to the server even if the packet can reach nat-s in front of the server nat-s can t find the active mapping for the embedded packet most of nat implementations will drop it

38230654
debian	linux
the easiest solution is to use java 8 see . i am on debian 8.5 jessie and using openjdk 8 instead of the stock 7 version from jessie backports solved the issue building gnucash-android on my system
it is a problem with java gradle on linux not recognizing the ssl certificate

38231267
pyopengl	pyglet
moderngl is a great alternative to pyopengl you can use the modern opengl api with less code written
moderngl will not create a window by itself but you can integrate it in pyglet pygame pyqt5 and even in glut

38233406
jruby	rubinius
for example jruby s --jdb flag to run under the java debugger simply doesn t make sense for ironruby rubinius macruby topaz cardinal mruby or yarv
rubinius s flag to turn on the sampling profiler doesn t make sense for implementations that don t have a sampling profiler

38235016
gradle	ivy
maven and gradle have support for dependency management but ant does not
your project should switch to maven gradle introduce a dependency manager such as ivy or hand-roll a half-baked custom solution you can call whatever ant target you want

38238061
ssl	https
it is necessary that not only the transfer of the sensitive data is protected by ssl but also anything leading to this transfer
if this is not the case one could use tools like sslstrip to do an active man in the middle attack and replace any https targets with http targets without being the victim aware of it

38238180
punctuation	words
the standard lexical analyzer removes punctuation characters and splits on whitespace
therefore the regex you ve built was matched against each words independently not the entire sentence

38242383
apache	nginx
no it does not need to be apache
you can also use other http servers such as for example nginx or node

38244363
jar	war
as i mentioned in duplicate so question put this line into your application.properties second option is to pass system variable to in this case it is expected to be located in current directory outside of the jar file
reaction on comment if you are using war file your main class is not used at all

38245783
opera	google-chrome
check if it works for http 2 in opera and if so that s your problem
google-chrome now insists on using alpn for http 2 so you need to build nginx with openssl 1.0.2 or above which isn t available as a packaged version on most platforms yet so you might have to install manually from source for now

38254410
octal	decimal
the disadvantage of this approach is that leading zeros may lead to unexpected results as set a interpretes numbers with such as octal ones
so for instance 012 is converted to decimal 10 and 08 and 09 are converted to 0 as 8 and 9 are not valid octal digits

38255460
swift	objective-c
the following is equivalent to using sktbattery_getcurlevel swift objective-c
edit sktbattery_getcurlevel isn t supported in swift

38255682

google-chrome	firefox
however none of the previous answers actually say how to fix this so here is a method to force google-chrome to treat the autocompleted value as a real value
several things need to happen in order and this needs to only run in google-chrome and not firefox hence the if

38271358
jspm	npm
it appears that this is not true at least currently. you can install jspm globally on a hosted controller
i was able to solve this with a build process that looks like this npm install npm install -g jspm node c npm modules node_modules jspm jspm.js install 1 installs all of the local dependencies from my package.json

38271358
jspm	npm
alternative solution i have not tested this next option in a build yet but you should be able to skip the extra build steps and just use the scripts feature of npm to do the jspm install
in this case you won t need the npm install step nor the run node step above

38272765
sudo	passwd
so the fix will be to change become_method to sudo or if you know root s passwd enter that one instead of your user s passwd
in sudo su - root the root privilege is gained by sudo rather than su that is why the latter doesn t ask for the root passwd since it is invoked by a process already in the role of the root user

38272765
sudo	passwd
in sudo su - root the root privilege is gained by sudo rather than su that is why the latter doesn t ask for the root passwd since it is invoked by a process already in the role of the root user
however in your setup you have specified become_method su which expects root s passwd

38272801
sudo	passwd
sudo su - root is not the same thing as become_method su
su tries to switch to another user by default root and requires you to authenticate as them that is enter their passwd

38273063
super	self
the second call to super .save tries to force an insert with the same pk you previously saved
you should not pass self to save

38274829
dictionary	map
your classes will work fine as you ve defined them except you need to change the name of the dictionary property inside your root class from items to listinginfo to mirror the json property name
alternatively you could use a attribute to map the items dictionary to the listinginfo property in the json. after making that change i would also recommend renaming your root class from listinginfo to something else that makes sense to you like maybe listingresponse but that is not strictly necessary

38274873
swift	objective-c
swift doesn t allow protocols to have optional requirements-- if the protocol declares something it s required
objective-c has long had the idea of optional requirements and swift recognizes this when you use objective-c when declaring the protocol

git-svn	svn2git
git-svn is not the right tool for one-time conversions of repositories
it is great if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for a one-time conversion you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case

with flask a lot of people will reach for sqlalchemy to handle the data access layer
if you re not completely sold on flask one of django s major selling points is that you get a basic admin interface for your models for free

38278549
flask	django
if you re not completely sold on flask one of django s major selling points is that you get a basic admin interface for your models for free
django is more of an opinionated framework which may be better if you re just starting out and want to get up and running quickly

atom-editor	gedit
so with the help of package-sync now i can just sync those mininal config files to have my atom-editor settings and packages consistent across multiple machines
this is how to do it use ubuntu as an example install atom-editor and install package-sync through edit -- preferences -- install as the screen shot shows open your command pallete and type create package list and there will be a packages.cson file under your .atom folder. edit the gitignore file gedit .atom .gitignore make sure the content is blob-store compile-cache dev storage .node-gyp .npm .apm packages atom-shell this is a screenshot of the .gitignore file this makes sure the content downloaded by atom-editor from the internet will not get synced to your dotfiles repo

equals	gethashcode
but as i tested it doesn t care what equals returns
because you have to implement a matching gethashcode

38284234
prepare	execute
however be warned if you are using this function to build sql statements you are strongly recommended to use pdo prepare to prepare sql statements with bound parameters instead of using pdo quote to interpolate user input into an sql statement
prepared statements with bound parameters are not only more portable more convenient immune to sql injection but are often much faster to execute than interpolated queries as both the server and client side can cache a compiled form of the query

38287242
set	bag
the value for must be explicitly set since there s nothing between it and as well why you ll see some values out of order
if each bag will have the same exact layout not necessarily same values but same table layout then you could parse this using a class no need for external libraries making note to ensure the property is utilized example then to use this is a more simplistic example and you could use other methods like regex but it s more to illustrate how to parse the table

38287278
subtract	addition
or do a simple experiment like this with a processor you are using and look at the flags to figure out which is subtract from which and or whether or not they invert the carry out and call it a borrow
we can see from doing it with paper and pencil as in grade school that addition boils down to one column at a time you have a carry in plus two operands and you get a result and a carry out

38288677
octal	decimal
so if gives you error invalid digit 8 in octal constant the reason is obvious 8 is not a valid octal digit
integers can be expressed in decimal octal or hexadecimal form

38288690
swift	objective-c
the signature of unsafeaddressof is as you know swift arrays are value types and you cannot pass them to anyobject
so when bridging to objective-c feature is available your array is converted to nsarray

38290176
atom-editor	notepad++
besides that parsing such code by regex is not always a good idea you d probably need a more powerful regex flavor than provided by the atom-editor
how about notepad++ which supports pcre

38293565
margin	text-align
you are setting margin auto on the div so the div will be centred however you have also left the div as width auto so it will be as wide its container once you account for margins padding and borders
you are setting text-align center on the div so the inline children of the div will be centred but the table is not inline so it isn t affected some of the table cells contents might be depending on inheritance

38295467
http	spdy
you d be much better moving on to http 2

hex	binary
or as an exact float in hex notation or in a way most easily understood by just about everyone while it may not be immediately obvious every finite binary float is exactly representable as a finite decimal float the reverse is not true
the decimal 0.1 is not exactly representable as a finite binary float and the decimal some_float constructor produces the exact equivalent

38295695
decimal	ieee
the decimal 0.1 is not exactly representable as a finite binary float and the decimal some_float constructor produces the exact equivalent
here s the true value of pi followed by the exact decimal value of math.pi and a caret on the third line points to the first digit where they differ true 3.14159265358979323846264338327950288419716939937510... math.pi 3.141592653589793115997963468544185161590576171875 math.pi is the same across almost all boxes now because almost all boxes now use the same binary floating-point format ieee 754 double precision

opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
there s a nice explanation here but it boils down to from the article browser support is now good in the latest releases works in google-chrome firefox edge v14 safari v10.1 opera safari ios v10.3 android browser and google-chrome for android however ie will likely not get official support
github has a polyfill available which is recommended to support older browsers still largely in use esp versions of safari pre march 2017 and mobile browsers from the same period

aggregate-functions	sum
you are already doing this with the crossapply. i m assuming you want the sum of the values here but you can change the aggregate-functions when you need something else
hourlyaggregate as select key sum value as value from crossappliedstep group by key tumblingwindow hour 1 you should then be able to look back into the stream to get the previous value lookback as select key last value over partition by key limit duration hour 1 as previous_value value as current_value from hourlyaggregate then calculating the delta is easy second we want to use the hoppingwindow with duration is 60min overlap is 10min with previous window then we use the topone with time stamp by asc and desc to get the first and last value then get the difference but did not get we wanted get more than two values during one hour

super	extends
either explicitly call a person constructor that is defined super a b c or do not have arrayinobj extends person
arrayinobj is extends person and in the constructor for arrayinobj it is implicitly calling the person constructor super by not explicitly calling a different super

the problem is the super .__init__ self it should be super .__init__
moreover it is not necesssary to use super in this case see what does #39

38312480
implements	extends
let s consider a protocol requiring this initializer and a class implements it this gives the error initializer requirement init can only be satisfied by a required initializer in non-final class a
this makes sense as you could always declare a subclass of a that doesn t inherit that initializer so we need to make our initializer in a required now if we look at the nsobject interface we can see that the initializer is not required we can confirm this by subclassing it adding a different initializer and trying to use the normal one now here comes the weird thing we can extends nsobject to conform to the i protocol even though it doesn t require this initializer i honestly think this is either a bug or a requirement for objc interop to work edit it s a bug and already fixed in the latest version

dictionary	map
your intent is a dictionary which doesn t have a format method
what you want to do instead is format every value in that dictionary to map to the right query field

serializable	deserialization
this solution do not need a custom serializable and deserializer
following is an example class with jackson annotation following is an example to deserialize a json string of the api response into networkstatistics instance and an example to serialize networkstatistics instance into json string if networkrank in json is a string value the instance field after deserialization will be a string field

git-svn	svn2git
git-svn is not the right tool for one-time conversions of repositories
it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case

38333420
git-svn	svn2git
it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case
there are pleny tools called svn2git the probably best one is the kde one from

38337275
express	node.js
after that you would be able to catch it in express error handler
if user is not authenticated error is thrown and node.js stops code execution

38339781
client-side	server-side
this site only scores 97 because i haven t sized the images and analytics and fb tracking have short cache lives traditionally a client-side rendered platform like meteor was slow on first loads with an empty cache because of the big javascript payload
server-side rendering using react of the first page almost solves this except that meteor out-of-the-box does not support async javascript or inline css thus slowing down your first render and killing your google pagespeed insights score and argue as you might about that metric it affects my clients adword prices and thus i optimize for it

38343780
ssl	https
i solved my situation it is not afnetwork s issue i use a invalid ssl certification and sdwebimage when use the option sdwebimageallowinvalidsslcertificates in sdwebimage and get a http image not https image you will get this error
the protocol http or https not being recognized automaticly by sdwebimage

38345985
required	placeholder
the route parameter canincreaselimitswithinsevendays is required as it is not marked as optional
question mark added to the parameter placeholder

38346462
bufferedreader	fileinputstream
dexter s answer is already useful but some extra explanation might still help in genereal an inputstream only provides access to byte data from a source. a reader can be wrapped around a stream and adds proper text encoding so you can now read chars. a bufferedreader can be wrapped around a reader to buffer operations so instead of 1 byte per call it reads a bunch at once thereby reducing system calls and improving performance in most cases
for files a fileinputstream is the most basic way to read data from files. if you do not want to handle text encoding on your own you can wrap it into a inputstreamreader which can be wrapped into a bufferedreader. alternatively you can use a filerreader which should basically do the same thing as fileinputstream + inputstreamreader

38347170
swift	objective-c
in swift it gets better with nicer block syntax better type inference and auto-closures
objective-c is not known for it s pretty or terse syntax

38350172
inline	inlining
don t inline it if it doesn t make sense
i guess inlining ten lines of css won t kill you but inlining the equivalent of 18 kb of gzip-compressed css is just madness

38350617
google-chrome	firefox
veljko89 received your source and it cannot be done in google-chrome
i saw you implemented by an inset box shadow but this approach work with firefox only

38355819
uicollectionview	uitableview
it is not mandatory to have uicollectionview inside uicollectionviewcontroller
uicollectionview is just like uitableview and can be added anywhere

38358847
factors	mean
given the new object creation speed available survivor1 and survivor2 spaces and number of other factors it is entirely possible that 84 is full enough to start acting
eden being full doesn t really mean everything up to the last byte occupied

38360570
queue	fifo
it puts a bunch of consecutive numbers in a concurrentqueue and then uses multiple threads to move them fifo into another queue
you might expect that they would always arrive in the second queue in the same order and more often than not they do

38362436
google-chrome	firefox
if and when browsers support this new property you will be able to get behaviour that matches google-chrome s current behaviour by using transform-box fill
firefox has already implemented this but it is not enabled by default yet afaik

38363502
debian	linux
further reading the arch linux wiki about systemd is very thorough the debian wiki on systemd is good but outdated in some places notably it tells you that you need to install it which is not the case in jessie weezy you re mixing things up a little there chkconfig is a script of the redhat family of oses
making it work for debian was not easy in the past and i do not believe it is easy to do so now

38365282
sudo	passwd
it s not clear what your actual intention is but if the intention is to run the script in background then remove sudo -i line and do
the sudo manpage says -i --login run the shell specified by the target user s passwd data base entry as a login shell

38366724
imperative	declarative
racket s for loops do not look like traditional c-style for loops however because c-style for loops are extremely imperative
on the other hand scheme and therefore racket tends to favor a functional style which avoids mutation and often looks more declarative

38368711
ubuntu	linux
but we cannot use c# for building application run on ubuntu and macos. currently there is no super language as your expectation
but if you want to make a jump start for your idea which can be run on a lot of devices you can take a look at below technol electron - compatible with mac windows and linux electron apps build and run on three platforms with javascript html and css

38370873
setinterval	settimeout
setinterval - do infinite times every specified time
simply replace settimeout with setinterval or if you wanna make it really blink do this as the above one just flips it once and you need to do it twice if not twice use it nested see the timing functions and seconds for both the functions

38371166
selenium	appium
browserstack uses appium to drive your selenium tests on ios
the exception you received probably indicates a certain selenium command you executed is not supported yet by appium

38371166
selenium	appium
the exception you received probably indicates a certain selenium command you executed is not supported yet by appium
you need not download appium to run your selenium scripts on browserstack s mobile testing platform

38372135
swift	objective-c
swift s error handling doesn t catch objective-c exceptions
it is based on an errortype return mechanism which translates nserror pointer-based apis from objective-c

38372323
google-chrome	firefox
i reproduced this very odd problem in google-chrome and safari on a macbook
it doesn t appear in firefox

38372451
google-chrome	firefox
fullscreen works fine in google-chrome that way
this is not exactly what is happening with my embed fullscreen works fine in ie and firefox but the video is being pulled up and to the left in google-chrome because i have transform translate styling applied to the iframe which is affecting the video in fullscreen mode but at the same time i also have a position absolute applied to the iframe with a top of 50 which is not affecting the iframe in fullscreen mode

38377631
opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
the only browers that support this property right now are google-chrome safari and opera using the -webkit- prefix
the text-fill-color property is not available in firefox until firefox 48 comes out in august of 2016

38379339
rvm	bundler
double check your paths so its being installed in the rvm gem stash not system s
i imagine you ve messed up your permissions installing bundler into system gems by running sudo gem install bundler

38379585
vsto	add-in
this is due to how vsto security works as commented by this vsto team member
unfortunately showing the publisher name is not possible for vsto add-in

38379585
vsto	add-in
unfortunately showing the publisher name is not possible for vsto add-in
even if you sign all your clickonce files with your authenticode certificate your assembly with signtool authenticode strong name with ca-signed certificate and set all possible publisher company ...-fields for your assembly and the clickonce-manifest the publisher will not show up in the add-in dialog

38382486
profiling	debugging
i had the same problem and i couldn t debugging my apps anymore. i used the apple configurator to delete all of my profiling on the iphone
afterwards i installed another signed app again and now i can debugging again

38384887
nsurlconnection	nsurlsession
nsurlconnection s sendasynchronousrequest is not a cancelable request
but nsurlconnection is deprecated anyway and you should use nsurlsession

38387699
super	extends	super	implements
rules an anonymous class must always extends a super class or implements an interface but it cannot have an explicit extends or implements clause
an anonymous class must implements all the abstract methods in the super class or the interface

38388096
uiview	subviews
you can implement that by creating uitableviewheaderfooterview class it is subclass of uiview you also need to create an individual xib as it will not be created automatically with uitableviewheaderfooterview creation
register nib with tableview now you can access that in viewforheaderinsection note to set background color you will need to create a subviews with same frame as section header and set color for that view

38391520
prepare	execute
prepare statements are so that you can execute repetitive sql commands which may only differ in parameter values for example
they are not meant to live long as a prepare statement may they do if called from a transaction reserve an active database connection long means when they are not used

38391520
prepare	execute
they are not meant to live long as a prepare statement may they do if called from a transaction reserve an active database connection long means when they are not used
it is perfectly fine to repetitively execute a prepare statement many times even if this will take long

38391520
prepare	execute
just by creating a bunch of prepare statements and not closing them you could run out of active allowed connections and then block further communication to the db server
use a prepare statement if you want to execute the same insert update or select statement with different parameters multiple times in one http request

38391520
prepare	execute
use a prepare statement if you want to execute the same insert update or select statement with different parameters multiple times in one http request
do not use prepare statement to outlive http requests

38393380
bower	npm
you can use bower to organize your code and use third-party libraries even if you don t use node itself in any other capacity except for bundling and installing packages with npm
the module system that bower uses is the same as node so packages published to npm that were originally intended for use in node but not browsers will work just fine in the browser too

38393380
bower	npm
the module system that bower uses is the same as node so packages published to npm that were originally intended for use in node but not browsers will work just fine in the browser too
increasingly people are publishing modules to npm which are intentionally designed to work in both node and in the browser using bower and many packages on npm are intended for use in just the browser

38393738
profiling	debugging
only then if it is not running fast enough for your purpose you should put your code through a profiling to discover the bottlenecks that are taking the most time the two options you show will probably not be very different unless your files are enormous
you are wrong to consider efficiency before you have even got your program working you should write your code as clearly as possible and debugging it

38402202
persistent	transient
instances may exist in one of three states transient never persistent not associated with any session persistent associated with a unique session detached previously persistent not associated with any session transient instances may be made persistent by calling save persistent or saveorupdate
persistent instances may be made transient by calling delete

38402365
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
and the javadoc for runtimeexception runtimeexception and its subclasses are unchecked-exception
unchecked-exception do not need to be declared in a method or constructor s throws clause if they can be thrown by the execution of the method or constructor and propagate outside the method or constructor boundary

38402969
ienumerable	iqueryable
the call to getzonetask has the asenumberable which realizes the iqueryable into an ienumerable which does not have the extension method tolistasync defined
in your getappttask method the result at the return line is an iqueryable which has the extension method tolistasync defined

38403171
hive	hdfs
convertavrotojson will get the records into a format you can manipulate there currently aren t many processors that handle avro splitjson will create a flow file for each of the records rows evaluatejsonpath can extract values from the records and put them in flow file attributes updateattribute could add attributes containing type information. this is optional used if you are using prepare statements for puthiveql replacetext builds a hiveql statement insert either with parameters if you want prepare statements or hard-coded values from the attributes puthiveql execute the statement s to get the records into hive in nifi 1.0 there will be a convertavrotoorc processor this is a more efficient way to get data into hive as well as to query it from hive
that approach is to convert the results of querydatabasetable to orc files which are then placed in hdfs using puthdfs and it generates a partial hive ddl statement to create the table for you using the type information from the avro records

38405670
stateless	stateful
if your handler is stateless which is not your case as yours has the ctx member then you should annotate it as sharable and re-use it to all created pipelines
if it is stateful create a new instance for every new pipeline new client connection

38411910
factors	mean
add box-sizing border-box to #contentbox to factors in that extra space
also just because the flex rule is the same for multiple elements doesn t mean the size of each box will be the same in each row

38412040
swift	objective-c
you cannot have a selector to a pure swift method
if your class inherits from nsobject then its public methods are exposed to objective-c automatically

38412957
innodb	myisam
this requires mysql 5.7 because before then the feature works with myisam but not with innodb
rds doesn t like it at all if you try to use myisam

38415552
octal	decimal
it has an octal value of 700 which is 448 decimal
so if you were doing printf d n s_irwxu i would expect the 448 or even can not produce 442 because that decimal value is octal 672

38415552
octal	decimal
so if you were doing printf d n s_irwxu i would expect the 448 or even can not produce 442 because that decimal value is octal 672
the 672 would get masked down to 600 octal or 384 decimal

38417086
comparator	comparable
as mickmnemonic says in a comment it s considered bad practice to leave out fields that are included in equals to include lastname in the calculation use objects.hash also as stephenb said in a comment you also need to add a comparator method because you are implementing
here you use name as a parameter not object because of the generic type argument to comparable

google-chrome	firefox
note onanimationstart event attribute can be used at google-chrome chromium without jquery .one
firefox 47 did not recognize onanimationstart event attirbute

38427171
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
add another uiviewcontroller and right click drag from the uitableviewcontroller to the new uiviewcontroller and use a push segue which you can reference when you do didselectrowatindexpath
you shouldn t need to connect things because your uitableviewcontroller is the rootviewcontroller of a uinavigationcontroller

38428921
add-on	xpcom
mozilla appears to be committed to continuing to support add-on sdk based extensions as long as the extension does not use require chrome or otherwise depend on xul xpcom or xbl
most of the things that can be done in a bootstrapped extension can be done in an add-on sdk based one

38428921
add-on	xpcom
most but not all of the things that can be done in overlay xul legacy extensions can be accomplished in bootstrapped add-on
anything that can be done in the add-on sdk can be done in a bootstrapped extension add-on sdk extensions are bootstrapped add-on with some javascript based api layers . mozilla has stated that they plan to deprecate add-on that depend on xul xpcom and xbl. while not all bootstrapped add-on depend on these technologies there is a tendency for for bootstrapped add-on to operate at a lower level than add-on sdk and webextension add-on

38428921
add-on	xpcom
while there are some that are saying that all bootstrapped add-on are planned to be deprecated it is not clear that is the case
after all add-on sdk extensions are not being deprecated unless they use require chrome or otherwise depend on xul xpcom or xbl and all add-on sdk extensions are bootstrapped extensions just with an sdk wrapper

38428921
add-on	xpcom
after all add-on sdk extensions are not being deprecated unless they use require chrome or otherwise depend on xul xpcom or xbl and all add-on sdk extensions are bootstrapped extensions just with an sdk wrapper
overlay xul legacy these add-ons contain a install.rdf that describes the add-on and a chrome.manifest file to describe how the add-on s files relate to overlay the application s files

38428940
super	extends
first write a super class for your dto like busdto
second change your dto to extends the super class and change the dto s set method to put the attribute name and value to the changedattrs beacause the spring would invoke the set when the attribute has value no matter null or not null

38430332
oncreate	onstart
while coming back it resumes from the oncreate method here not only your webview but entire app is reloaded
and if your activity is in stop state and the user navigates it then it starts from onrestart where it will not touch the oncreate but goes through onstart where your app will not restart but the things you put in onstart and onresume

38433811
spaces	delimiter
the line with the value has additionally 10 trailing spaces which is the reason why the regular expression would not work but or more easily works
for removes those trailing spaces as the default delimiter are the space character and the horizontal tab character on splitting up the line to tokens

38436804
factors	mean
the each group consists of only one observation error message happens because your x aesthetic is a factors
ggplot takes that to mean that your independent variable is categorical which doesn t make sense in conjunction with geom_line

38437133
jspm	npm
for some reason moment.js installed from jspm does not include the type definition
here is how i fixed it in config.js you must use moment npm moment 2.11.2 i had issues with 2.14.1 then you need to find the type definition that works and add it to your typings.json github typed-typings npm-moment#a4075cd50e63efbedd850f654594f293ab81a385 did the trick

38437908
firefox	safari
historically internet explorer has been difficult to develop for because it has often not supported features that were supported by other browsers in current use firefox google-chrome and safari
in some cases this was due to microsoft simply not implementing a feature but the problem was exacerbated by internet explorer s slow release schedule it s only at version 11 after two decades compared to firefox and google-chrome which are much younger and the fact that users often didn t upgrade their version of ie leaving them with an old web browser

38441603
implements	extends
you can just return an array with the item method implements ps maybe you are taking the wrong approach and your custom query method could just wrap a document.queryselectorall call that returns what you are looking for
here are my two cents document is a native object and extends it may not be a good idea

38441763
jar	war
there is absolutely no reason to package the servlets in your jar
ensure they are not present in your war lib folder

38442139
google-chrome	safari
on android you should be able to just use the javascript sdk as google-chrome on android supports webrtc
on ios you don t have so much luck as safari doesn t support it

38442295
hive	hdfs
my suggestion create a managed table add explicitly partitions for some days in the future but with ad hoc locations -- the directories your external process expects to use let the external process dump its file directly at hdfs level -- they are automagically exposed in hive queries managed or not the metastore does not track individual files and blocks they are detected on each query
as a side note you can run backup restore operations at hdfs level if you wish as long as you don t mess with the directory structure when a partition is cold and you are pretty sure there will never be another file dumped there you can run a hive command to archive the partition move small files in a single har + flag the partition as archived in the metastore bonus it s easy to unarchive your partition within hive whereas there is no hadoop unarchive command afaik

38446372
memcpy	malloc
the standard does not define behavior for the case where the source pointer points to a function therefore such a memcpy call produces undefined behavior
additionally the pointer returned by malloc is an object pointer

38447909
super	extends
but be aware that when using an extends clause you must either initialize this before using it by calling super or don t use this and return an object at the end
in this case you can t initialize this using super because function.prototype is not a constructor

38447955
cpython	pypy
if you want comparable speed from python you could either annotate the source with types and compile with cpython or try running with pypy for some jit performance
it s cpython the implementation that s slow in this case not python necessarily

38453299
super	self
mixinb.m immediately calls super mixinb self .m which is mixina.m when called with
super uses the mro of the self object hence we need to look at top not at the standalone mixinb

38453299
super	self
super uses the mro of the self object hence we need to look at top not at the standalone mixinb
mixina.m calls super mixina self .m which is base.m

38456791
mediacodec	mediarecorder
probably your best bet is to take preview frames from the camera feed them to an affdex framedetector for processing and also save them to a video file via a mediacodec and mediamuxer although i haven t tried that
the affdex sdk s cameradetector needs access to the camera to get its preview frames and process them so that s not going to work if the mediarecorder has control of the camera

38459313
keystore	jks
note this answer bases on assumptions as you do not provide any details on the used keystore format jks bks jceks ...
i assume that every time you need the key you load the java keystore from file jks format

38460883
des	aes
the answer is do not use des
des is insecure and has been superceeded by aes advanced encryption standard aes was specifically designed to replace des

38467621
ssl	https
setting up ssl is not hard and there or completely free ways too like free valid ssl certs or self-sign methods
as telegram bot documentation says all queries to the telegram bot api must be served over https and need to be presented in this form

38468783
flask	django
i think you need a listener for the script for example a service or a web service for this reason i think flask can be an really easy solution . be careful about calling the script a web service can be reachable from the frontend but this can not be done from a standard script. my suggestion is take a look at flask is more light that you think
i completly agree with you about django but i think you can give a chance to flask it is really light and i can be used for many porpouses

38471073
hex	binary
however in the actual implementation the op code area of the instructions are not two hex digits in size so you have to take the hex value and shift the value left by 2 bits
so an op code for a load of 0x30 0011 0000 is left shifted resulting in 0xc0 1100 0000 in binary or the op code for a store of 0x32 0011 0010 is left shifted resulting in 0xc8 1100 1000 and the register number of zero to three is inserted into the lower two bits of the two hex digits

38473932
jar	war
but it should not exactly as like windows or executable jar behaves
firstly the war file should be invoked via java command in cli and then access the application via web browser or any http client

38474713
passenger	thin
instead of this you should use a different webserver and application server like nginx unicorn nginx passenger
the thin webserver is not meant to production environment

38477684
inline	inlining
this process inline all html and style s so it s not only for html templates but for styleurls as well
to remove this feature in you webpack configuration file change this to this that is remove the loader that does the inlining angular2-template-loader if you want to get deeper here is the part of the code of angular2-template-loader you can see in the comments that this is exactly the issue you have. you can also view the source code it should be noted that opting-out of inlining will result in a performance hit

38478435
vsts	tfs
if it was me i d go with vsts
if you want to install on-premise or cloud hosted vm to try it out then grab tfs 2015 update 3 this is the latest version ben day has a nice illustrated installation guide starting from scratch official docs here assuming you team doesn t run into the 100 s a single server installation will be fine for now

38478723
gson	jackson
it s because gson tries to serialize your object based on fields using reflection but the realm instance data is only accessible through the proxy getter setter methods
see related open issue because gson doesn t really care and therefore doesn t have config to use the getters setter instead this is possible with jackson or logansquare json parsers

38479635
comparator	comparable
we can also have a comparator class to compare based on car model year
car class comparator #1 based on model no comparator #2 based on model year but this is not possible with the case of comparable interface

38480562
imagemagick	libtiff
i converted your image to a regular jpeg using imagemagick in the terminal at the command line as follows
if you want to do it with pure libtiff your code might look something like this - note that i have not done much error checking so as not to confuse the reader of the code - but you should check that the image is of type float and you should check the results of memory allocations and you probably shouldn t use malloc like i do but rather the new c++ methods of memory allocation - but the concept is hopefully clear and the code generates the same answers as my cimg version.

firefox 47 does not

38481954
keystore	jks
yes the public certificates from the idps you add to the keystore will show up as trustedcertentry
i believe that the jks is used to decrypt assertion messages and not used for the https handshake

universal-webpack doesn t hook into require function - it s just a helper for transforming client-side webpack configuration to a server-side webpack configuration
it doesn t run on the server-side or something

google-chrome	firefox
reference example google-chrome doesn t require such initialization
firefox requires something that we call init here to be set in dragstart event to initialize the rest of drag events to occur

hex	binary
that method returns a binary string i couldn t find a way to get a hex string directly
if anyone knows a way please leave a comment so we have to use string#unpack to turn it into a hex string

38489195
calloc	malloc
the double char pointer in the read_lines function is a local variable to the function so storing the address returned by calloc in it will not be preserved when the function returns instead you should pass the address of the pointer and store the return value of calloc by dereferencing the pointer and assigning it to the real two star pointer defined in main somethin like this note that i replaced calloc with malloc since the line should be null terminated inside read_line
using calloc in this case can hide some bugs that would be very hard to debug

38490644
swift	objective-c
swift internal protocol abuse we may implement implicit mechanisms to objective-c objects nsnumber nsstring ... as martinr writes in his comment custom conversion methods are not present for native swift
for the technical discussion we can however ab use the internal protocol _objectivecbridgeable to allow implicit bridging from your enum to objective-c objects in this case nsstring

lisp	scheme
it used dynamic variable scoping and did not have lexical closures or tail recursion optimization and emacs lisp is the same
emacs lisp is very different from scheme

38496922
serializable	deserialization
static variable are not saved during serializable
and on the contrary during deserialization process the static variables are initiated from the class level initialization. 2

38497773
google-chrome	firefox
initial warning as of google-chrome 50 the geolocation api is disabled unless you are on an encrypted connection which means this will not work at all on an insecure localhost or any other insecure server
firefox is also pondering implementing this as well

lodash	underscore.js
here s the current state of it for posterity underscore.js _.compose is lodash _.flowright underscore.js _.contains is lodash _.includes underscore.js _.findwhere is lodash _.find underscore.js _.invoke is lodash _.invokemap underscore.js _.mapobject is lodash _.mapvalues underscore.js _.pluck is lodash _.map underscore.js _.where is lodash _.filter underscore.js _.any is lodash _.some underscore.js _.all is lodash _.every underscore.js _.each doesn t allow exiting by returning false underscore.js _.flatten is deep by default while lodash is shallow underscore.js _.isfinite doesn t align with number.isfinite _.isfinite 1 returns true in underscore.js but false in lodash underscore.js _.matches shorthand doesn t support deep comparisons underscore.js 1.7 lodash have changed their _.template syntax to _.template string option data lodash _.uniq does not accept an iteratee function like underscore.js s

38505856
division	modulo
the modulo a b returns the remainder z in the division in other words it returns y in this equation the second equation also shows why this works for fractional numbers too
thus the following examples not complete are true in your example converting seconds to minutes and seconds you probably read something like this this is the same thing the minutes are calculated as totalseconds 60 which is an integral division that rounds to the lower integer for positive numbers thus the result of 1

38506279
google-chrome	firefox
the transpilation is not from typescript to javascript but vice versa the sourcemaps files serve to the browser to rebuild the source files in typescript so that you can debug them if you open the google-chrome console you ll see the typescript files even if you have no published them
it should be a firefox problem in-browser transpilation sourcemaps do not work outside of google-chrome

38506279
google-chrome	firefox
edit. when you publish your js and js.map files js files contain this is a relative path that google-chrome is able to recognize firefox not
in fact if you manually correct the path with the absolute path you ll see that firefox finds them

38508413
prepare	execute
you didn t enable exceptions in pdo therefore it runs in the default return false on failure mode which means your code should be and this holds true for your other prepare execute blocks as well - your script is killing itself before it ever gets to the insert query because your test for database failure is wrong
this is wrong doesn t magically change into a boolean true false if the execute fails

38509880
scheme	racket
this answer is off topic as it s about simply scheme and not simplescheme
i ll leave it here as the names are rather similar racketeer and so-er danny yoo has made a racket module language to support simply scheme in the racket language suite

38513380
swift	objective-c
i wrote a parser for those in swift so that i can detect those placeholders in localizable.strings and extract which types were expected to be given when calling stringwithformat with those strings for my tool swiftgen you can see the part of the code doing the parsing there on my github
sure it s in swift and not objective-c but i guess it s easily translatable to objective-c as long as you keep the logic of the algorithm

38513789
prepare	execute
it is also not allowed to used local variables in prepare statements because local variables are in scope only during stored program execution references to them are not permitted in prepare statements created within a stored program
prepare statement scope is the current session not the stored program so the statement could be execute after the program ends at which point the variables would no longer be in scope

38515513
swift	objective-c
your class inherits from object realm swift s base class but is attempting to use rlmarray a realm objective-c type in its interface
you cannot mix realm swift and realm objective-c in this manner

38519276
opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
you can see it s clearly only supported by webkit based browsers like google-chrome opera and safari internet explorer isn t webkit based
it s meant to only work in google-chrome

38520449
vb.net	vb6
in vb.net you give the last index of the array where in c# you give the length of the array so there is a shift of 1 between the two
this comes from the fact that in vb6 you could have an array indexed in other base than 0 notably the 1 indexed collection and so that was valid it isn t in vb.net dim somearray -4 to 5 as integer declares an array of 10 integer indexed from -4 to 5 back to your code you just need to give the size as for the comment given by ashwin nair

38522264
ionic	angular
you can find the reasons in this post on the ionic forum
ionic 1.3.x uses angular 1.5.x but does not support the routing of components since it uses a old version of ui-router

38522889
touchesmoved	touchesended
but nstimer can help us in but i feel we can resolve this by adding setting replace nstimer instance while touchesmoved called and we can reset that timer on touchesended and touchescancelled
so in either case your touchesended or touchescancelled not called timer will do that job and your reset logic works as it should be expected

38528217
implements	extends
however depending on your code and how you use that interface you can make it hard for someone not to make the implementor an enum require t to implements as well to prevent passing any enum to the class declaration use additional boundaries when possible see œÜxocƒô ÏõÉ –øepe√∫pa s answer add methods that are already implements by enum such as name ordinal getdeclaringclass etc
let extends

38529684
google-chrome	firefox
responsive design mode in firefox responsive design mode in google-chrome
well getting a bigger screen is the best solution but if this is not an option using developer tools in firefox or google-chrome you have the so called responsive design mode where you can test your page in several viewports which of course means that you can set viewports bigger than your screen size as well

38534449
namenode	hdfs
client should have same copy of hadoop distribution and configuration which is present at namenode then only client will come to know on which node job tracker resourcemanager is running and ip of namenode to access hdfs data
also you need to update etc hosts of client machine with ip addresses and hostnames of namenode and datanode. note that you shouldn t start any hadoop service on client machine

38538163
queue	fifo
you need to pass it the beginning and end iterators which can t be accessed using the queue class so a good alternative would be deque
a deque functions similarly to a queue in that items can be pushed and popped off it but items are not restricted to the fifo model

38541625
comparator	comparable
this is a limitation of the standard library since this is defined for all containers not just the ordered-associative ones. so what you need is a custom comparator for sets of sets that uses the correct overload of lexicographical comparison now use the code shows why there isn t an obvious fix to the ordered associative containers that would make this just work if the containers use custom stateful predicates then it s not in general guaranteed that the members of two distinct containers can actually be compared with one another at all
all you know is that the elements within one container are comparable with that container s comparator

38543381
uicontrol	uibutton
i think using uistackview to realize a little control like it it s not a good idea you can find many project around uisegmentedcontrol that subclass uicontrol like for example bettersegmentedcontrol a code example a picture
objective create programmatically a selectionview to switch throught two uibutton as a child

38544026
vbscript	vba
i don t use vba so i m not sure but before ruby i used vbscript a lot here an example how to do this in vbscript
i have never crossed a vbscript codepiece that doesn t run in vba the other way around i did but who knows

38549374
comparator	comparable
of course you can also combine the approaches and implement default ordering in implementation of comparable interface but use also additional orderings with comparator
in addition to tim biegeleisen s answer there is one more option make pair implement comparable interface the choice between these two options depends on whether you want to modify pair comparable requires it comparator does not and whether you can have different possible orderings comparable allows to use only one ordering comparator allows to define as many orderings as you wish

38554262
concave	convex
basically the issue happens when there are concave surfaces meaning that two faces have normals that will cross
and it doesn t happen when all the surfaces are convex meaning that their normals point outwards and won t cross

38557244
dictionary	map
you don t need to create all those dictionary
you already have your coordinates just don t lock them up in strings would create a list of row column tuples instead and you then wouldn t have to map them back

38561211
inline	inlining
the consequence is that if you want to wrap the function in another helper function it has to be too inline and use reified type parameters
what s even more important is that it requires nested functions lambdas to use inlining too - which in case of onclick is not true

38561804
bash	zsh
and i guess your problem is that your default shell is not bash shell
for example if your default shell is zsh you should config the .zshrc just add or other config to .zshrc

38564830
innodb	myisam
so double-check that the table s engine is correctly set to innodb
if it s not rolling back the transaction there is one possibility that your table has myisam as the engine since myisam tables do not support rollbacks

38575033
nsstring	nsobject
many nsobject subclasses override the isequal method nsstring nsarray nsdate ... but not ciimage creates two different ciimage instances and these compare as not equal
all nsobject subclasses conform to equatable and the function calls the isequal method on the objects. the isequal method of nsobject simply compares the object pointers holds if o1 and o2 refer the same object instance

38577865
theano	keras
theano does convolution not correlation unlike caffe
hence in keras filter like 1 0 0 0 applied to matrix 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 results in matrix 7 8 9 0 2 3 4 5 not this as one would expect with correlation 1 2 3 4 6 7 8 9 in order to make things working as expected you need to rotate filters 180 deg

38578774
qtoolbutton	qpushbutton
as opposed to a normal command button a tool button usually doesn t show a text label but shows an icon instead. when i want a button in the gui simple with only an icon i use qtoolbutton
but when i want a classic button i use qpushbutton

38580502
qtoolbutton	qpushbutton
qtoolbutton is much more complex under the hood than qpushbutton
a not complete list of examples qtoolbutton is designed to be tightly integrated with qaction

38582616
vsts	tfs
if the jira issue isn t yet paired with any tfs vsts work item create a new tfs vsts work item copy values of the fields for which mappings are configured from the issue to the work item pair the issue with newly created work item
you can try with tfs4jira which support tfs vsts to-and-from jira issues synchronization

38583609
spaces	delimiter
the default separator for cut is a spaces not tabulator
you can specify it either by pressing ctrl-v tab cut -f1 -d sname or this way correction the default delimiter for cut is tab so this is not necessary

38584399
google-chrome	firefox
i m not 100 with css3 yet this doesn t work in firefox yet but in google-chrome your placeholder will pop up above the input
hmmm researching the firefox equivalent now edit found an alternative solution that might work for you or lead to a solution

38584414
aggregate-functions	sum
in a nutshell the difference most probably stems from the fact that aggregate-functions ignore null values
so the query select sum column1 + column2 + column3 from ... is equivalent to select sum column1 + column2 + column3 from ... where column1 + column2 + column3 is not null

38584533
equals	gethashcode
in addition the advice is that i f you implement equals you should also override the base class implementations of equals object and gethashcode so that their behavior is consistent with that of the iequatable.equals method
if you implement gethashcode its result should not change over the lifetime of your object

38586657
setinterval	settimeout
basically using setinterval with async code is not the best way to go
it s better to use settimeout to schedule a new request once the previous one has finished

38589104
spaces	delimiter
multiple spaces are not squeezed together with cut contrary to what awk does
to address the first problem set the delimiter with -d

38590224
dictionary	map
if not select a random word from the dictionary and assign that to the word in the hash map
the word is then removed from the dictionary to avoid the risk of having different words mapping to the same words

38594395
equals	compareto
whereas for equals public boolean equals object x compares this bigdecimal with the specified object for equality
unlike compareto this method considers two bigdecimal objects equal only if they are equal in value and scale thus 2.0 is not equal to 2.00 when compared by this method

38596567
direct3d	directx
it is not included as part of the windows sdk but instead is provided under the mit license and you are expected to just copy it into your project--it s included in the various directx 12 visual studio templates including my direct3d game templates
you can use the ddstextureloader and wictextureloader modules provided in the directx tool kit for directx 12 for some ready-to-use texture loader for direct3d 12

38604075
direct3d	directx
direct3d namespace and hlsl intrinsics in c++ amp
c++amp doesn t have support for low level operations like this because it is written on top of directx

38606850
retrofit	okhttp
first of all throw out compile com.squareup.okhttp3 okhttp 3.2.0 retrofit has okhttp3 as it s dependency so it is not needed
moreover when you check here retrofit 2.1.0 depends on okhttp 3.3.0 so there might be a conflict

38615583
ssl	https
if one multiple precondition s of ssl are broken or by using a tool like sslstrip python
note that sslstrip will try to force the socket to be send through http even if https is requested and this is not guaranteed to work

38616328
entity-relationship	diagram
i m a big fan of uml but uml diagram are not the best solution to model databases and especially entity-relationship
in fact all the best uml modeling tools support er diagram too besides many other types of diagram

38618678
qthread	qobject
however as you have reimplemented qthread run you do not have an event loop on this thread and the slot can never be invoked
check qt documentation for details threading basics threads and qobject also you have some big issues in your code missing q_object macro in thread definition but you might have removed it while copy pasting otherwise you wouldn t be able to emit the signal

38621191
viewdidload	viewwillappear
extend uiview with the following method usage considering the background view is named view which results in a view like this note the dropshadow method can not be called from viewdidload as this causes issues with the graphics context
so use this method in viewwillappear earliest for the above result

38623847
lodash	underscore.js
underscore.js also works for lodash
lodash is even more concise than the underscore.js version but only works for lodash not for underscore.js

38624826
sudo	passwd
this isn t exactly the best way to send the passwd to sudo but i don t think that is the point here
the -s to sudo will prompt for the passwd which is written to stdout and piped over to sudo

38630891
uicollectionview	uipageviewcontroller
then after if you not feel smooth effect then you should try to uncheck adjust scroll view insets under viewcontroller under attribute inspector which you got by selecting your view controller check the screenshot for that edit by person who asked the question - adding this worked for me as uicollectionview don t have adjust scroll view insets option
you should use uicollectionview with one cell or uipageviewcontroller to achieve this kind of effect

38631250
apache	nginx
one solution is to patch-up the apache source to extend that list and turn to deploying your home-grown package to your server s but that s definitely not without a long list of implications of its own
on the flip side i hear that nginx doesn t suffer from this problem

38634643
postgresql	mysql
joining tables from different databases may not be supported by your rdbms postgresql for example
but if supported mssql mysql then table names should be prefixed with database name and schema if needed

38640152
swift	objective-c
swift 3
if the above code snippets doesn t work then try this objective-c ui updates should always be executed from the main queue

38647582
mongodb	bson
mongodb uses bson format which is binary as opposed to json moreover it supports more data types
see bson documentation and specification some of query operators resemble sql functions however it does not supports sql at all thus it does not support any of sql functions

38649783
factors	matrix
it gets this factors by a scaling constant on the prior precision matrix
in the source you will note that if you do not supply a prior precision then it will generate a square k matrix and multiply it by .1

38652873
tensorflow	cudnn
for cudnn it needs to match both cuda 9.0 and also the version that tensorflow was built with
for tensorflow 1.6 be sure to install version 7.0.4 not 7.1 and the specific version that 1.6 was built with otherwise it will also break the exact version is cudnn v7.0.4.31-1 for cuda 9.0 not 9.1

38652873
tensorflow	cudnn
for tensorflow 1.6 be sure to install version 7.0.4 not 7.1 and the specific version that 1.6 was built with otherwise it will also break the exact version is cudnn v7.0.4.31-1 for cuda 9.0 not 9.1
the latest versions 7.1.2 at this time will throw errors as tensorflow 1.6 was built with 7.0.4 original post this is a bug in tensorflow that i have also encountered i m using 2x gtx 1080 in ubuntu 14.04 one option is to install cuda 8.0

38655783
swift	objective-c
even though that article is quite old it s not even using realm swift
it s using the objective-c version bridged to swift

38656012
postgresql	mysql
postgresql doesn t know float but float4 and float8 which are synonyms for real and double respectively
mysql technically knows float but that doesn t mean the db-migrate abstraction will accept is as input when run .

38657191
build.gradle	gradlew
hard to tell without the build.gradle .
edit the gradlew vaadin plugin seems not to be able to handle this addon properly

38662486
rational-numbers	base
a finite-length representation of a rational-numbers exists only in certain base
it happens that the rational-numbers 525 1000 does not have finite-length representation in base 2

38662486
rational-numbers	base
it happens that the rational-numbers 525 1000 does not have finite-length representation in base 2
the representation in that base is 0.100001 1001

38671550
implements	extends
it allows you to use trylock method including the variant that allows to wait for some time if the resource is already locked java 1.4 unfortunately has no java.util.concurrency package and i think the best choice you have is to implements the same logic by means of synchronized and double checks it will not work as fast as reentrantlock that uses cas loop backed by processor instructions in modern jvms but it will do the job
this implementation is also not reentrant you can extends it to track the locking thread and locks count if you need reentrance

38672568
bower	npm
the correct package is nginfinitescroll for bower or ng-infinite-scroll for npm
the ng-infinite-scroll package on bower is not the one you re expecting - it s actually this package that was last updated in 2014

38673486
swift	objective-c
if you have a swift only class that doesn t inherit from nsobject then you can add objective-c to make the class and methods visible to the objective-c runtime
this happened because swift 3 has changed the way it handles the first parameter name

38675261
ienumerable	icollection
ienumerable is a forward-only iterator
icollection does not have indexed access

38677222
multiplying	multiplication
somehow when i multiplying five must be getting coerced into a number and that number must be the one used for the multiplication
it s the results of that multiplication that gets printed to the console not the value of five itself

38678009
keras	tensorflow
i had this exact same error with some keras code which utilised the tensorflow backend
it s not 100 clear where the problem lies but it doesn t appear when running any tensorflow code directly nor with skflow

38678071
multiplying	addition	multiplying	multiplication
yes but they include most of the time some rules about how to add and multiplying matrices
not all matrices out there actually use these addition multiplication rules - for example image data is often held in matrices in opencv even though there s no sense using matrix multiplication for images

38678555
factors	matrix
a factors is internally an integer where the number gives the position of levels inside the vector
for example a common use of such positions is to perform as.character x in the most efficient way your misunderstanding of what a model matrix looks like it seems to me that you thought a model matrix is obtained by which is not true

38684109
gif	ico
just in case anyone knows more about this mad microsoft format and if it is maybe some sort of multi-page tif or gif in disguise that just needs to be renamed the following would be one way of making a recipe in graphicsmagick for the moment i have created a multi-page tif as the output file and it contains the four sizes you need - but as i said graphicsmagick will not write a ico file
afaik graphicsmagick doesn t support writing ico format files - see here

38686448
scheme	racket
when using standard scheme avoid imperative loops and prefer recursion using helper procedures or a named let or use iterations and comprehensions in racket
also break is not a standard scheme construct

38686925
wildfly	glassfish
after a whole day solving this problem on my own because nobody s answer was usefull for me on internet i found following don t try to use different web server i tried wildfly it wont help
give glassfish folder permission to write i mean the folder with version in name restart pc to shut down all or the running server after my restart i got still the same error during developing build-impl.xml 1045 the module has not been deployed

38687686
strncmp	memcmp
in contrast to that the function strncmp will stop at a byte with value 0 even though the passed number of bytes to compare is not yet reached
in c and c++ the end of a string is indicated by a byte with value 0. the function memcmp does not care about the end of a strig but will in any case compare exactly the number of bytes specified

38687717
strncmp	memcmp
strncmp differs in that it will also stop comparing after the specified number of bytes if it does not encounter a terminator before then
memcmp on the other hand is for comparing blocks of random memory

38688794
implements	extends
if you really intended to use implements and not extends then using a constructor won t solve your issue but doing this will
this seems like a bug as it does not work even when extends is used instead of implements but this works just fine and both compile into the same js except that in your code it s _super.apply this arguments

38690809
apache	nginx
in the readme file apache is not listed as installed
instead of apache it uses nginx as web server

38698225
base	fractions
this condition is unfortunately sufficient but not necessary for example there are some base 10 numbers like 0.5 that can be represented exactly as base 2 although 2 does not have the prime factor 5
when you write the number as fractions and reduce it to lowest terms it can be represented exactly without a periodic part in base x if and only if the denominator has only prime factors that also appear in x ignoring exponents of primes

38699789
jspm	npm
first jspm install querystring will not install the library that you have mentioned
the command that you should run is this jspm install npm qs then you can import and use it like this import querystring from qs

38700073
ubuntu	linux
it probably asked you for a default root password ubuntu like systems usually do
if you have forgotten it have no fear the password can be reset try doing this as linux root sudo -i if that doesn t work try sudo -i sudo mysql and give it a shot

38701761
swift	objective-c
considerations imho we swift developers should progressively stop relying on objective-c bridging and use the second solution
swift 3 first of all a string in swift is a struct and does not conform to anyobject

38704236
wildfly	jboss
you consider migrating to wildfly 10 as it requires java 8
jboss 7.1.1.final does not work with java 8

38705143
implements	extends
can be integrated con fosuser so the backend can be secured but the kind of things like show different menus depending of roles isn t already native implements
depending of the customization can be easy to extends

38708627
queue	fifo
if you use a fifo queue the cells are visited in order of distance to the starting cell so you cannot find a shorter path to an already visited cell
the fifo queue will contain every cell at a certain distance then gradually transition to distance + 1 and so on

38715043
onclick	onchange
your code has some errors does not have a onclick attribute
an alternative may be onchange attribute simply refering a component by widgetvar attribute value from js does not work

signing your app with trusted certificate also eliminates suspicion in most of antivirus progs
but this will not work for some antivirus like norton internet security etc

38720801
stateless	stateful
and in most cases must be stateless their result should not depend on any state that might change during execution of the stream pipeline
and stream pipeline results may be nondeterministic or incorrect if the behavioral parameters to the stream operations are stateful

38723291
google-chrome	firefox
this is google-chrome handler issue
i do not know how it happens but my firefox works correctly and ie can process it in good way

38724637
hex	binary
that means you re not really parsing hex you re trying to take a string containing the bit pattern of an ieee-754 floating-point number expressed as hex and get the equivalent ieee-754 floating-point number
that s very different from parsing hex. the calculator you referred to works with ieee-754 single -precision binary floating point values

38725185
sudo	passwd
if you only want particular users to run this program you can use sudo instead of making the program setuid root
a root user would need to update the etc sudoers file and add an entry for the user and program in question and include an option to not require a passwd

38728740
factors	mean
there are plenty of optimizers which learn on their own variable specific scaling factors like adam or adagrad
specyfing per-variable learning rate constant one would mean that you do not follow the gradient anymore and while it makes sense for well formulated mathematically methods simply setting them to a pre-defined values is just a heuristic which i believe is a reason for not implementing this in core tf

38734699
build.gradle	gradlew
none of the solutions i found for this error helped me and then somehow i realized that if i added the testing dependencies in both of the build.gradle files the tests magically started working
it doesn t matter if your tests live in only 1 of the modules both gradlew files must include the dependencies and the testinstrumentationrunner value

38735632
phpstorm	atom-editor
for example if you look at the below image this is without enabling the word wrap option you see how lines look cut on the right side of the image and there s a horizontal scroll-bar on the bottom referring to long lines then enable the word wrap option from the top menu select view word wrap check it on -it should have before it in order to be enabled- like in this image thus it will break the long lines and make it easy to read you see there s no scroll-bar on the bottom anymore also no cut lines only in text editor like shown below for some other editors microsoft visual studio how to manage word wrap in the editor jedit wrapping long lines phpstorm word wrapping in phpstorm ultraedit configure word wrap
you should not break those long lines using enter key instead you need to check the word wrap option in your text editor its location might be different in some text editors but for sublime text and brackets same thing for atom-editor i think

38738546
listview	gridview
for more complex requirements there is a good thread you can reference windows 10 scrollintoview is not scrolling to the items in the middle of a listview
i have replied your same question in msdn you need to have something more to distinguish items for example give every image a name since items you bind to gridview are same scrollintoview default find the first one

vsto	add-in
it is not possible vsto have to be deployed via an exe installation package
only apps for office also call office add-in can be published into the office store

38744633
client-side	server-side
javascript client-side isn t allowed that kind of access because of security
you would only be able to check server-side processes where php is running

38747381
orientdb	neo4j
if yes then you should be looking at titandb orientdb or dse graph because neo4j at the time of writing does not scale horizontally so it is limited by the size of the server
if yes then maybe you should be looking more at tinkerpop vendors such as titandb orientdb dse graph and others

build.gradle	gradlew
project build.gradle app build.gradle
i m not able to find com.android.tools.build gradlew 2.1.4 in jcenter bintray

38752404
uilabel	uibutton
i would recommend you to create a uiview instead and add separately a uiimageview with the settings image and a uilabel with the settings after that you can add tapgesturrecognizer for informing you when tap has made to your view button
you are trying to use both the image and the label on the same view uibutton view and position them this is not the best way to perform this kind of task

38759169
viewdidload	viewdidappear
viewdidload is called after your view controller is loaded into memory not necessarily when its view is in the view hierarchy
therefore call makealert in viewdidappear _ this ensures that your view controller is already displayed and is able to present your alertcontroller

38760942
implements	extends
please note that this answer proposes different approach i wonder why you should do this in the first place my point is that directly coupling two react components is not a right way to implements re-usability in react
if you are trying to have multiple child components which extends one parent what i would do is to have child components and a higher-order component and then implements common functionality with composition

38763375
noexcept	throw
the type of f will be deduced to since the function-to-pointer conversion applied to asdf will preserve the noexcept property
a call to a noexcept function pointer certainly cannot throw an exception unless one of its subexpressions does

38765127
equals	gethashcode
if gethashcode returns the same hash code for two objects equals must be called to decide if they are really equals
but if gethashcode returns different values you already know that these objects cannot be equals and don t have to call the - normally much more expensive - equals method

38765127
equals	gethashcode
but if gethashcode returns different values you already know that these objects cannot be equals and don t have to call the - normally much more expensive - equals method
conclusion in your code you seem to expect two option s to be equals if their optionentry is equals

38772450
des	aes
des has a 8-byte 56-bit key the lsb is not used as part of the key it is for parity so you can t use a 16-byte key parity is generally ignored
don t use des it is not secure and has been replaced with aes

38777828
innodb	myisam
since innodb does not lose data in a crash and since you are talking about backing up a lot of data and you are in the early stages the only real answer to your question is to switch to innodb
when the server crashes myisam almost always leaves some indexes in need of repair table

38779104

if you attempt to use a browser other than google-chrome or firefox an error will be thrown
according to the documentation you cannot use safari with directconnect protractor can test directly against google-chrome and firefox without using a selenium server

38779784
fgets	fgetc	fgetc	getline
further if your lines are more than a few characters long the buffered read provided by getline and fgets is quite a bit faster than character oriented input fgetc
don t get me wrong there is nothing wrong with fgetc and if your files are small and your lines short you are not going to notice any difference

38783404
super	extends
you want to override a super class method from a class that doesn t inherit from that super class this doesn t make sense
if you need to use encodewithcoder method you ll have to extends nsobject class or any other class that conforms to nscoding protocol

38784776
git-svn	svn2git
from your question i conclude that you are not using that one but the one that is based on git-svn
i strongly recommend using that svn2git tool

38792030
dictionary	map
old answer use a dictionary
it can map strings to other objects like so your second way doesn t even work even though you say it works

38793054
icmp	tcp	icmp	udp
however you have some alternatives 1- ask your it team to open icmp for you from firewall assume routing exist. 2- recode the application to test connectivity using http requests instead of ping. 3- add whatever host the application is testing the connectivity with to the windows hosts file and map it to 127.0.0.1 127.0.0.1 www.somehost.com this will make the application thinking connectivity exist
unfortunately this is not possible web proxies understand specific set of protocols http https tcp some streaming protocols whatever they support would be either tcp or udp based

38797145
associativity	operator-precedence
there are languages where new operators can be added at runtime with the compiled program specifying associativity and precedence of those operators something that couldn t be handled with a recursive decent parser
for parsing expressions have a look at operator-precedence parsing for example

the fact is that my website is expected to be used on https with ssl and not http
i give the tool an address with clearly https everywhere all urls on the page are https and the one i paste in the sharing debugger is also https

this answer assumes a minimal understanding of linux fedora and a basic understanding of using the windows run command dialog opened via the win-r key combination my starting point was this article by seth jennings however i ran into some challenges that were related to symlinks and started playing around

centos	linux	ubuntu	linux
if you re on ubuntu checkout etc rsyslog.d 50-default.conf rsyslogd if you re on centos which uses syslogd checkout etc syslog.conf
this feature isn t available in odoo at the moment even if you set timezone to something like africa lagos odoo will use utc time for the logs if you re on linux a workaround to start the odoo server with --syslog which would uses the machine s timezone just like it does for other system logs

38806869
super	self
i can clearly see where the issue is and the solution is super simple
change remove toast to this basically the problem is that you are capturing self in the animation blocks not toastview

38807543
realloc	malloc
it s probably nothing to do with the realloc
your code already has undefined behaviour when you do this near the start has never been initialized since malloc returns uninitialized memory -- it cannot know what type you intend to use it for and so could not possibly initialize it even if it wanted to

38808343
notepad++	sublimetext
currently the ability to select all similar text and edit like the ctrl+d functionality in sublimetext as mentioned by george is not built in to notepad++ version 6.9.2
it does sound like it will work when notepad++ updates the version of scintilla it uses as the functionality is built in to the newer version of that

38808672
bower	npm
check the instructions here npm install -g bower
that error message indicates that bower cannot be found

38809693
super	implements
a simple example though not super optimized because i don t know what else your program needs to do follows
please note that i again didn t fully flesh out any of the classes since i didn t know what you needed exactly but if you followed something like this i d recommend you implements the things that make sense equals hashcode etc for the classes

38810058
oncreate	setcontentview
that is why people use activity s or fragment s you can encapsulate your oncreate codes and call them when you recall setcontentview
calling setcontentview does not create your app so all the code you put in your oncreate wont be called the second time

38812412
move	drag
in ax if you are not using any source control when you have a private project and you drag drop it on shared it will move the project
when you will drag drop one from shared to private it will copy the project

38812834
super	self
you can then pass it on via the super .__init__ call class bj_player bj_hand a blackjack player def __init__ self name number_chips super bj_player self .__init__ name note how the name parameter from the method is now passed on in the chain
you defined an __init__ method that only takes one argument plus self class bj_player bj_hand a blackjack player def __init__ self number_chips # there is no parameter for name but you are trying to pass that in python doesn t look to all base __init__ methods for you

38818264
daemons	systemd
note this warning the bsd daemons function should not be used as it implements only a subset of these steps
a daemons that needs to provide compatibility with sysv systemd should implement the scheme pointed out above

38818746
noexcept	throw
for example in the situation of your post this means if member somethingelse_type is not noexcept but you know from conditions outside the code snipped in your post that no exception will be throw for the particular argument provided in this circumstance you may declare something somethingelse noexcept
in general it s not okay but in certain circumstances it may be noexcept is a promise similar to the const qualifier of member functions but unlike const it s not enforced at compile time the compiler will not issue an error and perhaps not even a warning if a noexcept function may actually throw but see below

38818746
noexcept	throw
in general it s not okay but in certain circumstances it may be noexcept is a promise similar to the const qualifier of member functions but unlike const it s not enforced at compile time the compiler will not issue an error and perhaps not even a warning if a noexcept function may actually throw but see below
thus you can declare a function noexcept even if a compiler-generated check would find that this function may throw and the code will compile otherwise your question would be impossible

38822096
swift	objective-c
for example and then in classes which actually are uiview s just implement it like this for completeness sake you can also kind of force the requirement to implement methods in subclassess by throwing an exception when their base implementation is called this pattern to make objective-c swift classess abstract can be foound in some of external libraries
note that this is harder to achieve in swift as there is no dynamic dispatch in it - this means that if you cast your subclass to base class and call a method the base implementation will be called. i d advise against it though as the protocol approach is safer because it doesn t create a path where you crash your app

38824309
stateless	stateful
see the article stateless vs stateful jsf view parameters for more details
for the f viewaction i m not sure if it is really stateful but in the source code of uiviewaction we can see that many properties are stored in the state helper

38830209

38836829
client-side	server-side
you cannot validate a credit-card on the client-side using javascript
you must implement server-side credit card validation as fake credit cards that pass client-side validation can be generated by abusing the luhn algorithm

38841797
listview	gridview
so each line item in the listview will be a textview
i think that you have an issue with the linearlayout who wraps the gridview your linearlayout is a vertical linear layout so if you use weight the height of the gridview should be 0dp and in your code the height is wrap_content and the width is 0dp so please change the height to 0dp and the width to wrap_content or match_parent update according to your mock i think this is what i would do please notice if your textviews are not fixed can be 3 or more ... then you will need to use listview with adapter

trie	tree
if this answer isn t useful to you please update your question to include a small self-contained runnable example program showing how you re using tree trie and we can show you how to modify it so that the trie only gets built once
if you look again at the synopsis in the tree trie documentation that you linked to you will see that the trie is only created once - although this should be written as rather than using indirect object notation and data is only added to it once and then the trie is used for multiple lookups and

innodb	myisam
innodb can do an auto-increment that allows for concurrent inserts only because it tracks one max value per table and it only increments it doesn t move backwards or undo incrementation
myisam supports a feature of increment-per-distinct-value when using a compound primary key

from the code analogous lines for mul rmul has a flag my assumption is that the reversed flag is important for non commutative operations like subtraction and division
it isn t necessary for multiplication hence the comment

38857777
memcpy	malloc
it would become impossible to copy such struct objects - a raw memcpy call would copy the array pointers without copying the actual data
one wouldn t be able to malloc struct objects since malloc can only allocate raw memory and does not trigger any non-trivial initializations

punctuation	words
should be or even just most pyparsing classes will auto-promote a string argument arg to literal arg . when i have parsers with many punctuation marks rather than have a big ugly chunk of statements like this i ll collapse them down to something like the problem you are seeing is that keyword looks at the immediately-surrounding characters to make sure that the current string is not being accidentally matched when it is really embedded in a larger identifier-like string
in this will only work if there is no adjoining character that could be confused as part of a larger words

38869473
strcpy	strncpy
note that in the above example i used the strcpy function for the sake of simplicity
however should your input string come from a non-static source ie i o of any kind like user-input file input ... not be null-termined or your software be constructed in a way that may allow to modify the intended purpose you d want to guard against buffer overflow overrun errors by using explicit copy actions for instance strncpy or strlcpy lstrcpy depending on target environments

super	extends
just make sure you call super in both methods as i do here in order to retain the help button
next to create a reusable navigation bar usually called an app bar in android all you have to do is create a layout file that will be included in the layout file for each activity then you can include this layout in any other activity by using the tag and finally add this as the actionbar action bar is the old term for app bar in any activity that extends the baseactivity the reason this cannot be done in the baseactivity is because unless every activity uses the same layout each activity must define its own layout with setcontentview

opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox
here are the results using the browsers i have access to google-chrome firefox safari ie just to make sure - you need to have jquery included more information regarding the browsers support and the removal of the custom message google-chrome removed support for custom message in ver 51 opera removed support for custom message in ver 38 firefox removed support for custom message in ver 44.0 still looking for source for this information safari removed support for custom message in ver 9.1
in order to set a confirmation message before the user is closing the window you can use jquery javascript it s important to notice that you can t put confirm alert inside beforeunload a few more notes not all browsers support this more info in the browser compatibility section on mdn in firefox you must do some real interaction with the page in order for this message to appear to the user

factors	mean
what you can do is change the interface of foo to accept an array of arguments can call it with if you cannot change the function definitions and you have many of them with the same signature what you can do is use function pointers to factors out the call but you will need a different wrapper for each distinct signature number and type of arguments and type of return value

super	extends
the super scope is created when one coldfusion component extends another one
it is available to the extends component and gives access from the extends component up into the extended component sometimes referred to as the base component or super component. the super scope not only allows us to get access to values in the super component which isn t necessary since those values are also available in the extends component but more importantly it allows us to execute functions in the super component even when those functions are being overridden by the extends coldfusion component as they will be in our demo

your file would look like this note that this is intel syntax not at t like in your example off my head you compile with nasm file.asm -f bin -o output and then you open output with a hex editor
-f bin tells nasm to do a flat binary which is a binary that is just raw machine code. nasm is just one of many

pycharm	spyder
from the comment discussion i suspect your issue is that pycharm is trying to handle the sys.exit internally and it doesn t like the fact you are using a custom error message
there are similar issues in other ides like python logging not working properly in spyder may or may not have been resolved by now

sudo apt-get install mysql-server mysql-client libmysqlclient-dev postgresql currently some bug prevents you from installing postgresql correctly so i recommend you mysql for now
the postgresql installation doesn t setup a user for you so you ll need to follow these steps to create a user with permission to create databases

google-chrome	firefox
i am not sure why google-chrome behaves this way really and the issue persists even if i put the code in a standalone html page
edit it seems as owen pointed out a non-defined behavior between different browsers even though jquery states clearly that all options are considered hidden regardless of display property as we can see from the behavior of firefox

multiplying	division
on a device with no fpu rather then multiplying by 0.1 which in any case make this a floating not fixed point implementation you should divide by 10 however division on an 8 bit processor is often expensive although probably dwarfed by the execution time of serial.println in the loop - but that is a different issue
instead it is more efficient to select a power of two so that the division can be performed with a right-shift

dictionary	map
this works with a dictionary for the name value pairing and the dictionary unlike the namevaluecollection does not incorrectly map characters such as to an unhelpful escaping u00a3 in your case
instead the formurlencodedcontent can take a dictionary in its constructor

38929159
inline	inlining
that s because bounds check removal only works when the method gets inline and compiled
so simply trying to remove bounds at the global scope isn t going to work since it can t inline the function call into the interactive repl there s no compilation or inlining occurring here at global scope so julia is unable to remove these bounds

38929517
google-chrome	firefox
all of this is still not stabilized though and will only be available in latest version of browsers probably with some flags set in user s preferences e.g google-chrome needs the experimental web platforms one
and since you asked for a way to add audio to this video note that you can use before calling new mediarecorder cstream but this will currently only work in google-chrome firefox seems to have a bug in mediarecorder which makes it record only the stream with the tracks it was defined to.

scipy will not perform analytical integration for you since it is made for solving numerical problems
sympy on the other hand can handle simple symbolic problems exactly compare you could also define your original piecewise function first then multiply it with the symbolic x then integrate this new function analytically

38941124
swift	objective-c
as an improvement to appzyourlife s solution you could do this with a native swift set as a counted set isn t necessarily needed in this case
this will save having to map _ over the characters of each name and bridging them to objective-c

38946248
wildfly	undertow
if you are using wildfly as you are saying above what you should look at is undertow servlet extension overwriting handledeployment method allow you to write your own identitymanager if you need one and register your custom authenticationmechanism
to implement your own authenticationmechanism you should look at this project custom spnego auth for wildfly my solution was based on mentioned above project - you don t have to implement every class - in my case writing my own class implementing authenticationmechanism was sufficient to get custom authentication working in kie-wb not for server though

38946550
prepare	execute
if you are using this function to build sql statements you are strongly recommended to use pdo prepare to prepare sql statements with bound parameters instead of using pdo quote to interpolate user input into an sql statement
prepared statements with bound parameters are not only more portable more convenient immune to sql injection but are often much faster to execute than interpolated queries as both the server and client side can cache a compiled form of the query

38947755
puma	webrick
there is not reason to include source or in gemfile_development or gemfile_production file. in gemfile_development include only test development gem s in gemfile_production include only production gem s 2. replace all the line in the gemfile to 3. deploy to production server 4. add gemfile to .gitignore file #bundle puma in development mode bad wordaround gemfile 5. untrack gemfile from source control git rm --cached gemfile 6. change the commit line in of gemfile in production server from to
it s not a real solution but a nice work around for people that using there server for production mode with puma and want to work on local machine development mode with webrick

38950058
xctest	kif
however if specta supports or is based off xctest xctest ui or kif and if all the dependencies can be bundled in the test package as per our instructions i have no strong reason right now to believe on why it would not run on device farm
having said that our instructions for packaging for xctest xctest ui and kif based tests are different and i would make sure that the appropriate instructions were followed depending on what specta is based on and then run it against the corresponding test on device farm

38950077
swift	objective-c
having said that there are advantages and disadvantages advantages modern language superior to objective-c full commitment by apple can easily be mixed with objective-c with 3rd party libraries disadvantages bigger app as all apps need to be bundled with swift runtime libraries
it s not possible yet to create binary libraries in swift

38950239
implements	extends
there could also be non-case classes which implements productarity and productelement manually but i don t think there are any in spark
treenode is not a case class but every non-abstract class extends treenode is

38957305
spaces	delimiter
in your case you told csv.reader that your columns are delimiter by a spaces
since there aren t any spaces in any of the lines each row of the csv.reader object has only one item

38958859
haskell	agda
the equation-solving that happens along the way is just the same equation-solving that agda does at the meta-level when checking a definition by pattern matching or that haskell does
don t be fooled by programs like in kernel haskell that elaborates to some sort of but it s not in your face

38959870
viewdidload	viewwillappear	viewdidload	viewdidappear
as viewdidload is only called once in the view lifecycle this would then not be called when the segue is unwound
updating your tableview in viewwillappear or viewdidappear would cause this to be called whenever this view is displayed

38960552
ssl	https
just as a follow up for anyone still running into this i had added the servicepointmanager.securityprofile options as noted in the solution and yet i continued to get the same the request was aborted could not create ssl tls secure channel error
i was attempting to connect to some older voice servers with https soap api interfaces voice mail ip phone systems etc installed years ago

38960895
swift	objective-c
this is easy enough but it s important to note you cannot use a c macro in swift directly
you will need an objective-c wrapper

38964437
profiling	benchmarking
if you profiling your application and find that code is not running optimially you can try optimising the code yourself however
meaningful micro benchmarking are difficult to write

38964626
rspec	capybara
you can scope your tests by using the fact that matchers finders can be called on nodes and that scopes to the used node - so something like update after taking a quick look the within you re actually calling is probably the rspec be_within matcher which for some reason is aliased as within - - not sure why since i can t think of how that would ever read well in an expectation - and basically all your statement is doing is creating a matcher that is never called and just ignoring the block passed to it
by default only capybara rspecmatchers should be included into view specs - - not capybara dsl so capybaras within shouldn t be available try using byebug and stepping into the within call to see what library is providing it

38965192
sudo	passwd
become_method should be set to sudo
since you aren t using password-less sudo you need to tell ansible that you will be supplying a passwd

38965771
vsts	tfs
fyi - the new agent on vsts and in tfs 15 rc1 passes overwrite to tf get so you won t need to do a clean build every time
since you are on tfs 2015 build not xaml build you can check clean on the repo tab of the definition

38965962
ionic	angular
as far as i can tell it is up to the developers of the plugins to maintain them and not the ionic team so any problems that you have with pluugins will follow you right through with any cordova variants phonegap ionic etc.
i won t call myself an expert however ionic framework is basically just cordova + angular

38968820
mongodb	bson
anyway you can construct the json representation of the mongodb objectid as follows
i don t know why the reactivemongo team decided to have an objectid in bson but not in json

38970249
express	node.js
express is a javascript library that runs in node.js and offers advanced features for configuring and running a web server
so you can have a web server in node.js without express the built-in http module offers a simple web server but you cannot use express without node.js since express runs on top of node.js

38970249
express	node.js
so you can have a web server in node.js without express the built-in http module offers a simple web server but you cannot use express without node.js since express runs on top of node.js
express adds many more features such as routing and middleware and tons of compatible add-ons over the built-in web server

38970967
google-chrome	firefox
microsoft s ie used to have probably still does a global event object and google-chrome decided to throw web sites written for ie a bone and replicate that
firefox did not

38971095
build.gradle	gradlew
you should add the following repository address to your build.gradle file
this library is not in the standard maven repository that gradlew uses to resolve dependencies

38972761
set	bag
finally don t forget other data structures such as the set - this is similar to a dictionary except that each name doesn t have a value attached to it
if you simply need a bag of objects this can be a great choice

38974152
g++	gcc
assuming c++ code such as then you would compile and link with g++ hello.cpp -o hello -i usr include opencv2 -l usr lib -lopencv_core -lopencv_imgproc
if your development environment does not have pkg-config and because of this the accepted answer by karlphilip is not practical or you need to know the minimal set of libraries required to link your application then assuming code such as you can add library arguments from the following list sequentially from the top until you find the minimal set of arguments that you need -lopencv_core -lopencv_imgproc -lopencv_highgui -lopencv_ml -lopencv_video -lopencv_features2d -lopencv_calib3d -lopencv_objdetect -lopencv_contrib -lopencv_legacy -lopencv_flann for example the c source code listed at the top of this post compiles and links cleanly with only gcc hello.c -o hello -i usr include opencv -l usr lib -lopencv_core -lopencv_imgproc on my old x86_64 ubuntu 12.04 box

38979186
serializable	deserialization
if done correctly it should loke like this this can be achieved by using the versionconverter like so deserialization also has to use this converter working example note that you can also annotate the de serializable class with a jsonconverterattribute to achieve the same automatically if you don t have access to the serializable code i m afraid you will have to fix the json string by hand or write your own versionconverter that can handle -1 values
the version has not been serializable in the right way

38980204
factors	mean
the way your example mydata is written type is a factors which makes the solution more difficult
let s suppose you did not mean that and that type is not supposed to be a factors then you could use your conditional to index the variable in the data frame and replace the value

38980204
factors	mean
let s suppose you did not mean that and that type is not supposed to be a factors then you could use your conditional to index the variable in the data frame and replace the value
now if you did intend for type to be a factors then you have the problem that lt pr is not one of your factors levels at least not the way your example is written

38980955
qthread	qobject
i assume your zeromqresponderthread is a qthread object the qthread-object itself should not be moved to itself via movetothread
the qthread is an object that should remain in the context of it s creating qobject your mainwindow in this case

38981203
dataframe	multi-index
to have multi-index columns the dataframe should have two or more rows to be converted into headers like columns for multi-index rows
if you have this kind of dataframe creating multi-index header is not so difficult

38984049
super	extends
not super elegant but at least helps
you could file a bug against package js to support extends

38984107
udp	tcp
additionally since udp has no handshake every new packet from the client side can equally initiate a new state
so a problem like you are describing would really stem from conflicting existing state and not a lack of state as it could for a tcp connection that remained idle past its dynamic nat entry

38987280
dictionary	map
in particular the chainmap will not behave like a regular map when it comes to some things like deleting keys still allow you to modify values in place will alter the list in d however if you are merely wishing to take your embedded dictionary and pop some new keys and values on it then chainmap may be appropriate
depending on your use case one approach to avoid making changes to an existing dictionary is to wrap it in a collections.chainmap now we can add new keys and values to c without corresponding changes happening in d whether this solution is appropriate depends on your use case .

38987604
cloudant	couchdb
quite a few cloudant employees are also on the couchdb pmc
cloudant vs couchdb 1.6 cloudant is horizontally scalable with respect to data size couchdb isn t cloudant offers full text search couchdb doesn t cloudant has a different authentication system cloudant has cloudant query which allows you do declaratively set indices and query the db

38987604
cloudant	couchdb
cloudant vs couchdb 1.6 cloudant is horizontally scalable with respect to data size couchdb isn t cloudant offers full text search couchdb doesn t cloudant has a different authentication system cloudant has cloudant query which allows you do declaratively set indices and query the db
with couchdb you have to use views

38987604
cloudant	couchdb
cloudant vs couchdb 2.0 cloudant offers full text search couchdb doesn t though you can get it if you re willing to do a custom compilation cloudant has a different authentication system apart from these differences there s the obvious one where with cloudant you don t have to worry about provisioning and managing the servers in exchange for a payment
as to how cloudant is related to couchdb couchdb is obviously core to cloudant s offerings

38989490
ecto	elixir
ecto doesn t include any such functions
there are several libraries for elixir available which can do this

38991640
punctuation	words
to account for non-word chars in-between words you may use see the regex demo the point is that you added words boundaries but did not account for spaces punctuation etc
all the other non-word chars between words

39000164
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
for example in html element names are case-insensitive but in xml they are case-sensitive
css selectors like tags classes and ids are generally not case-sensitive

39000164
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
css selectors like tags classes and ids are generally not case-sensitive
see the spec all selectors syntax is case-insensitive within the ascii range a-z and a-z are equivalent except for parts that are not under the control of selectors

39001645
ssl	https
if so replace with https so that your block looks as follows next the ssl offloading needs to happen in the server block from which you re serving
in your case you re offloading ssl for server name localhost and not for primeraraiz.com which is what i assume you re trying to do

39002429
ng-include	ng-app
also ng-include evaluate the expression passed so you need to pass a string goodbye.html not goodbye.html
you are missing ng-app to bootstrap angularjs

39004643
scipy	pyfftw
you can use fftw with python using the pyfftw package and you can even monkey-patch scipy to use fftw under-the-hood for its fft calculations although even then it may not give numerically-identical results since the fftw library may be called in different ways
scipy and matlab use different fft libraries

39005663
super	extends
the key point is that the createb class creates a class b that extends a but does not invoke the super constructor
note that an implicit super constructor invocation would normally be added by the compiler

39007995
udp	tcp
a bitmap would have some blank pixels like a broken image throttle your sending speed down so the packets wont jam up and get lost the smaller your packets the more likely they ll live option 1 all this resend requesting is just pseudo-tcp so you might just consider abandoning udp and go tcp
the problem with udp is that your sender your server does not know you your android device missed some

39009033
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
arrow function is es6 feature firefox and google-chrome both are already supported
but safari old version doesn t

39021030
hex	binary
hexadecimal hex is generally used to represent binary data some or most 8-bit values depending on the character encoding can not be represented as printable characters
as an example the byte with the bits 00000111 is represented as 07 in hex it is the bell character so it can t print

39022302
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
documentation uiviewcontroller class reference title property
for those looking for a swift solution the title needs to be set on the uiviewcontroller and not on the uinavigationcontroller embedding the view controller

39023122
sum	coalesce
but unfortunately you have to do this for each item in the select list select --must manually reference each column. coalesce to_char mort_30_ami no data mort_30_ami coalesce to_char mort_30_hf no data mort_30_hf coalesce to_char mort_30_pn no data mort_30_pn prov_no data_year data_month from select prov_no data_year data_month measure_id cases from pivot_test_2 pivot sum cases for measure_id in --use aliases to make the columns easier to use. mort_30_ami mort_30_ami mort_30_hf mort_30_hf mort_30_pn mort_30_pn order by prov_no data_year data_month
a simpler version that doesn t work ideally you would be able to replace this part of the code sum cases with this coalesce to_char sum cases no data then you wouldn t need to handle each column separately

39023791
recvfrom	datagram
the fact that recvfrom returns the buffer size implies that your buffer size is not big enough try increasing it to say 65535 bytes - the maximum theoretical udp datagram size
recvfrom truncates datagram to the size of your buffer when the buffer is not large enough

39023985
hex	binary
at the end lines 210 and 212 you will see it converts the binary value to a hex string and then to lower case which does not matter unless you opt for a string comparison at the end
end result your javascript library returns a representation using the type string formatted as hex

39024865
realloc	malloc
the way you check for end of file while not technically wrong is error prone and not recommended you should instead write this the reallocation scheme is redundant if you invoke realloc with the same size as your initial malloc call
you could just initialize store to null and only rely on realloc for allocation

39025449
implements	extends
you should create a job that is queueable in that it implements the shouldqueue interface now when it comes to dispatching your job to the queue you can run or if you would rather dispatch the job immediately and not have it queued you can run alternatively you could always create both queueable and non-queueable versions of your job if you wanted to go down that route
you can easily do that without repeating yourself by extends the non-queueable job and implementing the shouldqueue interface

39026890
.htaccess	httpd.conf
the configuration that did not work httpd.conf virtual host directory directives and the addition of the following line to .htaccess options -indexes directory indexes were still showing up
.htaccess settings weren t working

39027051
clang	llvm
i found this problem while trying to install a new clang compiler
turns out that both the debian and the llvm maintainers agree that the alternatives system should be used for alternatives not for versioning

39031537
rodbc	rjdbc
don t use rodbc since it does not implement the dbi methods - and i am guessing you need dbi based on your question
to create a connection to teradata using rjdbc you need to follow a few steps

39034151
swift	objective-c
the new swiftvalue box for conversion from swift values to objective-c objects for additional details see discussion in the comments below thanks martinr it seems as if swift values that are not explicitly implemented to be bridgeable to objective-c objects via conformance to _objectivecbridgeable see the following q a for details regarding _objectivecbridgeable will instead automatically make use of the new swiftvalue box to allow conversion to objective-c objects
the initial commit message for swift stdlib public runtime swiftvalue.mm reads runtime implement an opaque swiftvalue objective-c class to hold bridged values if there s no better mapping for a swift value into an objective-c object for bridging purposes we can fall back to boxing the value in a class

39038859
implements	extends
difference is that in v2 you can implements iuser in v3 core you need to extends identityuser if you want to use the default stores
if you want to use the absolute defult then you do not have to implements anything

39039846
swift	objective-c
just as custom conversion methods __conversion function implicit typecasting is a concept that is not entirely agreeable with a statically typed and safe language such as swift
to somewhat base this answer on official sources we may take a look at swift evolution proposal se-0072 se-0072 fully eliminate implicit bridging conversions from swift this proposal relates to the implicit bridging between swift native and objective-c types but the swift team s position w.r.t

39041066
division	multiplication
in general most often you ll use division on signed integers bitwise operators on unsigned ones
integer division by constants is routinely optimized to bit shifts if by powers of two multiplication by the integral reciprocal and all kind of tricks so performance should not be a concern

39041901
serializable	deserialization
as with all things there are tradeoffs to the various approaches approach #1 pros relatively straight-forward works with almost any programming language each subsystem is fully isolated from the other each system can be debugged in a language idiomatic manner cons must define shared protocol can result in redundant duplicated code protocols must be kept in sync changes must be backwards-compatible or it will break note protocol buffers can help with this serializable deserialization overhead channel can add other overhead if communicating between processes over the internet as opposed to on the same machine via a unix domain socket must consider security of communication mechanism encryption of data between subsystems access control of the endpoints approach #2 pros no serializable deserialization overhead can debug final system using idioms for target language cons not all languages can transpile from one to the other even if a transpiler supports the two languages often supports only a subset of the language may need to fix modify code to allow it to transpile may need to fix modify the transpiler slightly different semantics in transpilation can lead to subtle surprising bugs no isolation between the subsystems approach #3 pros no serializable deserialization overhead more support than approach #2 no need to rewrite original code in either language cons must become an expert in esoteric tools like swig result is very difficult to debug stacktraces for nodejs code suddenly contain c jvm java code debugging tools don t easily span languages may end up stepping through jvm code interpreting java rather than stepping through the actual java code ownership of objects garbage collection across languages can lead to surprising difficult to handle bugs if ownership semantics not correctly encoded different threading models between languages or other semantic mismatches between languages can make entire system buggy difficult to debug having used systems with approach #1 and approach #3 as well as hearing of systems using approach #2 i would strongly recommend using approach #1 wherever possible
only if you find the serializable overhead to be untenable and you are not able to optimize the communication protocol mechanism to handle that problem would i venture into the other waters

39041999
textview	imageview
the second textview should only wrap_content but it should fill the rest of the parent layout when the row doesn t
the imageview is set to wrap_content

39042343
gam	mgcv
a big change was made to gam package in feb 2018 could not find function plot.gam
this means a gam fitted by gam package now have gam class and even if mgcv package is loaded plot will not choose mgcv plot.gam to plot it

39043850
realloc	malloc
the realloc scheme is simple
you do not need a separate call to malloc

39044217
debian	centos	debian	linux
etc environment is deprecated since debian lenny 5.0
for centos or amazon ami linux add these lines to etc environment create it if it doesn t exist to edit this file via ssh console try sudo nano etc environment edit for debian-related distributions ubuntu etc. you should check that etc default locale is empty

39044217
ubuntu	debian
for centos or amazon ami linux add these lines to etc environment create it if it doesn t exist to edit this file via ssh console try sudo nano etc environment edit for debian-related distributions ubuntu etc. you should check that etc default locale is empty
that s the outcome of choosing none in dpkg-reconfigure locales which is suggested if users access via ssh see debian wiki

39044225
swift	objective-c
the key is to test a runtime -protocol type passed in as a parameter -- that s rather meta and not possible in swift which is using compile-time conformance checking for efficiency safety
so first of all you need to ground everything in the objective-c runtime and the key here is the conformstoprotocol method

39044361
google-chrome	safari
currently the skype web sdk doesn t support audio calling to or from google-chrome
if you try the same scenario using your web app in one of the supported browsers ie 11+ microsoft edge or safari it should work

39047612
swift	objective-c
the removal of the implicit bridging mechanisms was accepted in the following swift evolution proposal to be implemented for swift 3 se-0072 fully eliminate implicit bridging conversions from swift previously implicit conversions were available from some swift native types to associated objective-c types swift types conforming to private protocol _objectivecbridgeable natively int string for this reason we decided to make a compromise
we would require explicit bridging casts when converting from a bridged objective-c type to its associated swift value type e.g. nsstring - string but not the other way around

39048503
bower	npm
eg but again it is strongly recommended to pull in bower or so
this is not really a typescript problem if you want to use npm packages it is strongly recommended to use a dependency manager like bower or webpack to them

39048503
bower	npm
this is not really a typescript problem if you want to use npm packages it is strongly recommended to use a dependency manager like bower or webpack to them
i would recommend bower if you re only looking for something to handle your modules

39049175
dictionary	map
wherever you generated your transitions dictionary you should have used a list comprehension instead of map to create lists instead of iterators for the values instead of map lambda x whatever thing
iterating over a dictionary doesn t empty it

39049175
dictionary	map
iterating over a dictionary doesn t empty it
iterating over a map iterator empties it

39051765
ionic	angular
at runtime ionic seems to do some duplication of everything to do with the ion-side-menu maybe for animation purposes i m not sure
of all the duplicated elements one is never visible or populated angular templates not populated

39051851
daemons	systemd
create the following drop-in inside the systemd unit directory and then reload the daemons with systemctl daemon-reload it should fix your issue with flannel etc systemd systemd flannel.service.d proxy.conf a similar example is available in the coreos documentation customizing docker
the variables you re exporting are valid only in your current shell session they are not available to your flannel systemd unit

39052447
flyway	liquibase
the assumption liquibase seems to have everything flyway has isn t correct
flyway shines when it comes to parsing sql

39052447
flyway	liquibase
you can take your existing sql files start using flyway with minimal investment and moved away later if it doesn t suit your needs anymore
not so with liquibase

39053366
portrait	landscape
in terms of the one layout portion that may not be practical in all cases different orientations portrait vs
landscape may require different layouts to get forms to fit without scrolling substantially different screen sizes phones versus tablets may require different layouts substantially different ui approaches watches vs

39055436
scheme	racket
note that this can give history features to all programs not just a scheme interpreter
there are other implementations that come with readline support included racket chez scheme and guile

39059861
ssl	https
ssl is not supported for the shared web app service plan. if ssl is required you will need to scale-up to the basic tier which supports custom domains and also ssl. scaling-up existing web app
the service plans are correct azure web apps allows for custom domains at the shared tier or higher since the error you are seeing is associated with ssl make sure there is no ssl bindings and you are not using https

39063065
bower	npm
global installation of bower or other packages are not required npm start and other npm scripts automatically adds executable of local packages to path
with then npm start open it in chrome i reproduced same error with following commands in git bash beefy spawns command line bower without shell this works on linux since node_modules .bin bower is a valid executable

39063114
swift	objective-c
that should be translated to false in swift not true path.addarc center arccenter radius arcradius startangle startangle endangle endangle clockwise false
your swift code is based on the objective-c code from where the arc path is created as cgpathaddarc path null arccenter.x arccenter.y arcradius startangle endangle 0

39065998
build.gradle	gradlew
the classpath com.android.tools.build gradlew 2.1.3 is not for gradlew itself but the gradlew android build plugin that you apply with the apply plugin com.android.application or apply plugin com.android.library in your module s build.gradle file
if you want to use another version of gradlew in your project reconfigure your gradlew wrapper

39066804
comparator	comparable
equals method is there in comparator interface but it is not present in comparable interface
comparator.equals ... is for testing if an object is equal to this comparator

39066804
comparator	comparable
comparator.equals ... is for testing if an object is equal to this comparator
it s not for testing whether two comparable objects are equals

39066804
comparator	comparable
that s why it takes a single object not two t -s. so just because comparator declares it doesn t mean there s any reason for comparable to declare it
that said it s still worth asking why comparator declares it since comparator like every type is already a subtype of object

39069279
bash	zsh
sh is often dash not bash see man sh . dash doesn t do process substitution only posix stuff
you ll need to do ksh zsh can do process substitution too

39070407
seaborn	colormap
also if you are going to use alpha and maybe even if you aren t the grayish color you chose is probably not a good idea because it is similar to the gray background seaborn provides making it difficult to distinguish the gray dots from the gray background
you can set the alpha as part of the colors in your colormap here i gave the second color alpha of 0.5

39070407
seaborn	colormap
note that seaborn is not really involved here
the colors of the plot are determined by the colors you passed in the colormap

39072709
build.gradle	gradlew
there two cases that need to consider on first consider to remove gson if you have declared it in app build.gradle dependencies compile com.google.code.gson gson 2.4 second if you have not declare it in your app build.gradle you may need to investigate which libraries that has duplicate declare gson dependency
then you can exclude the gson from that library. you may want to check this excluding transitive dependencies here i will provide an example of exclude appcompat-v7 from a library run this command to see the dependencies chart tree . gradlew app dependencies it will display the dependencies tree like the sample below after you found library declared duplicate dependency

39079530
punctuation	words
an optional opening quotes - a words with punctuation followed by
the words regex demo assumptions and notes the dot may not appear in the middle of a words or at the start of one

39080068
implements	extends
another totally different thing is that streamwriter might internally use unmanaged resources or own an idisposable object that in turn might use an unmanaged resource or simply extends a class that implements idisposable
the latter two are the reasons why streamwriter implements idisposable but beware implementing idisposable does not necessarily mean that the class uses directly or indirectly unmanaged resources

39080354
realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
your approach is correct except for the size length in the inner loop it should or the cause for the unsettling error is the subarrays are allocated too small and you probably modify them in some other part of the program causing some corruption of the malloc internal data that is detected at some later call to one of the allocation functions malloc free calloc realloc .
note also that you do not check the return values of these malloc calls

39083134
shadowing	named
make sure that your parser is not shadowing a built-in or third-party package module library
i am not 100 sure about the specifics of how this named conflict would be resolved but it seems like you can potentially a

39083190
fgets	atoi
your arrays need to be of the same size as of that what you pass to fgets
that said atoi does not convert the supplied string itself to int it returns the converted value

39085647
bash	subshell
one possibility for a program in java python bash ... to do nothing with clearcase command is if said cleartool command is run within a dynamic view which has been set cleartool setview
as i explained before the cleartool setview command opens a subshell in which commands are supposed to be run which is not the case here the java program runs in the main shell the other possible cause is that you are reading stdout not stderr and somehow this commands returns an error maybe its execution path is not correct

39090307
gruntjs	package.json
you need to run commands using npm as gruntjs isn t used as a task runner for the project
you can see a list of the commands in the scripts property of package.json

39092808
swift	objective-c
in objective-c which the firebase storage client is built in it totally shouldn t as they re two totally different characters in actuality the length of str1 is 2 while the length of str2 is 1 in objective-c while in swift i assume the answer is 1 for both
apple must be normalizing strings before comparison in swift probably a reasonable thing to do since otherwise it leads to bugs like this where strings are the same but compare differently

39092808
swift	objective-c
so when you provide two different characters in swift they re being propagated to objective-c as different characters and thus are encoded differently
not a bug just one of the many differences between swift s string type and objective-c s nsstring type

39092879
persistent	transient
and the explain was here persistent makes a transient instances persistent
however it does not guarantee that the identifier value will be assigned to the persistent instances immediately the assignment might happen at flush time

39093121
httpclient	okhttp
httpclient is not supported any more in sdk 23
you have to use urlconnection or downgrade to sdk 22 compile com.android.support appcompat-v7 22.2.0 if you need sdk 23 add this to your gradle you also may try to use okhttp instead and also if you want to use this dependecy

39098246
vbscript	vba
however it is possible to find the wsh wscript cscript process for your vbscript by matching the commandline column from win32_process with the specific script name
i don t think that is possible as far as i know vba in excel is not executed as a separate process in the windows operating system

39103505
tensorflow	cudnn
i managed to build tensorflow and it seems to be working correctly
as hinted in other answers the lowest versions that work correctly with gtx 10xx are cudnn 5 and cuda 8.0 but not the video driver that comes with cuda 8.0

39103505
tensorflow	cudnn
22 8 2016 edit tensorflow third_party gpus crosstool crosstol and add cxx_builtin_include_directory usr local cuda-8.0 note symlink did not work use actual path link bazel fails to open the cuda includes . configure bazel build -c opt --config cuda tensorflow tools pip_package build_pip_package cd bazel-bin tensorflow tools pip-package build_pip_package outfilename pip or pip3 install outfilename testing tensorflow export ld_library_path usr local cuda-8.0 lib64 ld_library_path python or python3 python-libs-path tensorflow models image mnist convolutional.py test error 0.7
if the test error is huge it may mean that you need to upgrade cudnn

39106941
division	modulo
the division result is then 10190150730169267 we re doing integer division not true division so the fractions part is discarded and the remainder modulo 10 is 7
this is oversimplifying a bit the format that bc is using internally is somewhat closer to python s decimal type than to an arbitrary-precision integer type but in this case the effect is the same. in python 3 we re working with arbitrary-precision integers and true division

39110206
odoo	openerp
also i checked the definition of this method of odoo and it does not match your definition
on openerp tools amount_to_text.py around line 170 you will find the definition of this method

39110638
sudo	passwd
then when you want to kill the process all you have to is spawnprocess.sendcontrol c explanation running sudo kill from os.system is a dirty hack and requires the user to type in the passwd again or requires you to store the root passwd just to allow you to kill a subprocess
in my case it s even worse because the process is not started with sudo it s setuid root executable so the target user really doesn t have sudo access

39111459
antialiasing	transparent
but those slanted lines are heavily antialiasing fading from the pure white of the background to the pure color of the center of the lines
this can be seen when zooming in just a teeny bit you can lower the threshold of when to make a pixel entirely transparent but no matter how much you do this you will always end up with either visibly lighter pixels around the lines or when only matching the center line color exactly with disconnected pixels not resembling the original lines anymore

39115641
jspm	npm
it s supposed to be created by jspm if you had installed angular-translate from npm it would have contained which is just a redirect from symbolic package name the name of that .js file to that package main file as specified in package.json main dist angular-translate.js but angular-translate is from github there is no dist there
that s why jspm did not create the redirect file - there is nothing to redirect to

39115641
jspm	npm
that s why jspm did not create the redirect file - there is nothing to redirect to
no problem just build it from the source we got from github cd jspm_packages github angular-translate angular-translate 2.11.1 npm install npm run-script build cd .. .. .. .. and fix mapping in config.js open index.html in the browser again system.src.js 122 uncaught in promise error systemjs angular is not defined no problem angular is already installed as angular-translate dependency just tell systemjs when and how to load it

39116128
translation	localization
it most of the time offered me site translation to my local language through a part of the address with locale sometimes accompanied by original english version next to it
if i click on the original language link it does not translate anything so it is not automatic translation based on my localization

39118416
hive	hdfs
but the replication of hive data again happens based on your replication factor
in total you will end up with 3 hdfs + 1 hive copy 3 3copies on hdfs and 3 copies of data stored by hive this is not 6 copies as hive doesn t store data in the same file format

39118416
hive	hdfs
in total you will end up with 3 hdfs + 1 hive copy 3 3copies on hdfs and 3 copies of data stored by hive this is not 6 copies as hive doesn t store data in the same file format
or if you do a load data inpath into an internal table the old copy is lost and only the newer hive copy exists

39123285
git-svn	svn2git
git-svn is not the right tool for one-time conversions of repositories
it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case

39123285
git-svn	svn2git
it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case
there are pleny tools called svn2git the probably best one is the kde one from

39123990
queue	fifo
when the queue is empty and a handler is posted to the strand then the strand will post an internal handle to the io_service
within the internal handler a handler will be dequeued from the strand s fifo queue executed and then if the queue is not empty the internal handler posts itself back to the io_service

39124556
swift	objective-c
further apple says an objective-c class can adopt a swift protocol in its implementation .m file by importing the xcode generated header for swift code.
basically you cannot mark an objective-c class as conforming to a swift protocol in the .h

39124556
swift	objective-c
basically you cannot mark an objective-c class as conforming to a swift protocol in the .h
so you must do it in the .m and then have the class pass itself to any object that is expecting a reference the objective-c object as the swift protocol type

39128555
swift	objective-c
please see the following question and questions referenced there for examples of how to do that objective c opencv wrapper for swift project does not see stl headers
the interface of your objective-c objects usable in swift and thus visible in the bridging header cannot reference any c++ types

39130809
backgrounding	multitasking
your app will get rejected with the reason as 2.16 multitasking apps may only use backgrounding services for their intended purposes voip audio playback location task completion local notifications etc
we found that your app uses a backgrounding mode but does not include functionality that requires that mode to run persistently

39131012
g++	gcc
i also tried your code with gnu s g++ changing the type of bar from to int
the captured value was wrong in the second and successive calls even in this case finally i tried modifying a bit the code and passing by value and object so the copy constructor must be called my current version of g++ g++ gcc 6.1.0 is not able to compile this code

39132327
swift	objective-c
the objective-c declaration is a tip for the new documentation is that the swift declaration does not always list variable names ex
for tuples but the objective-c declaration does

39132745
serializable	deserialization
also looks like there is the opposite for serializable as well writing single element arrays to non-json array unwrap_single_value_arrays default false since 2.4 allows auto-conversion from single-element arrays to non-json-array values this is similar to the accept_single_value_as_array feature but works in the opposite manner if you have a bound property that is not an array or collection a single value array in json would be acceptable to bind to that property
if the json value contains more than one element in the array deserialization will still fail

39134967
single-quotes	double-quotes
inside single-quotes variables are not expanded
since you need variable expansion use double-quotes putting the above in your original command note that quotes and command substitutions can nest the fact that there are double quotes inside the command substitution has no effect on the double quotes outside of the command substitution

39135873
uicollectionview	uitableview
this means you can t make a uicollectionview behave similarly to a uitableview with a prefetchdatasource
or in other words you can not have a uicollectionview prefetch data only

39135984
exponent	modulo
rsacryptoserviceprovider has some assumptions on the data lengths which are modulo any even size let s call the length n exponent bytes
though rsacng allows any size let s call the length e d n p n 2 q n 2 dp n 2 dq n 2 inverseq n 2 so assuming that your second key is actually modulo 128 bytes because a 64-byte p times a 64-byte q isn t a 256 byte number you just need to left-pad the d array with a zero to bring it up to the proper length

39140426
persistent	transient
the argument may be an instances associated with the receiving session or a transient instances with an identifier associated with existing persistent state
so it s not an error to pass in a transient entity as you do

39142840
backgrounding	multitasking
more about that in documentation . but the idea is that you can download small chunks of data in backgrounding while your app is not active
in ios7 apple exposed api for multitasking in backgrounding

39146651
allocator	stl
those heap allocator would not be in the union
most stl containers including the std map type cannot be in a union since it has non-trivial member functions

39147644
multiplying	subtract
once you sign extend then sure you can feed the same multiplying logic because there is no difference there
i guess one could argue that is how add and subtract works too what you feed the same adder logic varies depending add vs subtract likewise what you pull out at the end may vary if you invert the carry bit to call it a borrow now per your question yes if you take a 3 bit by 3 bit in and only look at the 3 lower bits of the output which is almost always the wrong answer but anyway same elementary school math the lower 3 bits for a 3x3 bit input are strictly determined by the original 3 bit inputs the sign extension which is what varies between umull and smull do not come into play

39147729
icmp	tcp
so even if the router could detect packet corruption say if the corrupted bit was in the ip header it would still not send an icmp message
the router repairs the mistake based on the header checksum and then forward the datagram no the checksumming performed in ipv4 and tcp only allows error detection not correction

39148848
strdup	strncpy
using it the lines can be replaced with note that strdup is a function from c and it uses malloc internally so you must use free not to free the memory allocated via strdup
your arguments to strncpy make the function misunderstand that there is no space for terminating null-character so it isn t written

39151922
division	subtract
anyway the easy one first so the result is 0x22 but for the signed division to get the right answer we need to do unsigned which is how you would do it by hand in grade school then apply the sign later so we are not dividing 0b101 into 0b10101010 we are instead dividing 0b11 into 0b1010110 so the answer is 0x1c remainder 0x2 because both were negative the result is positive
similar to add subtract and signed and unsigned multiply you negate or not going in and negate or not something coming out

39151922
multiplying	division	multiplying	subtract
similar to add subtract and signed and unsigned multiplying you negate or not going in and negate or not something coming out
division is not like multiplying where it is just the same number added over and over again after being shifted

39151922
multiplying	division
i am not going to attempt to divide the bit variables abc into def unlike addition subtract and multiplying it doesnt work like that which is why some percentage of processors dont have multiplying or divide or some have multiplying but not divide you can make the multiplying faster by using a lot of logic the divide perhaps as well that or a lot of clocks
maybe look at hackers delight to see division shortcuts and from that maybe a pattern will emerge that makes some percentage of the bits the same but i doubt it

39152161
r-tree	quadtree
windows queries in r-tree tend to work better with larger result sets but that may depend on the actual dataset
quadtree should be okay for your sparse dataset they are also simple to implement but require a lot of memory and are not ideal for on-disk usage

39153042
implements	extends
so when you are extends the vectorobject with the rectange class you must implements a draw method with the same parameters
looking at the header of the function you provided in vectorobject now lets look at the header of the function provided in rectange public void draw these are not the same so it is not considered an override and there is an error because you have not implemented the method the correct way to implements in rectange would be when we add the override annotation we are telling the compiler that we are overriding a parent classes method

39155095
swift	objective-c
edit based on the objective-c code you posted i m going to take a guess at converting your code to swift by the way coffeemugdirectlink does not look like a valid string to convert to an nsurl
that one line ...is objective-c code in the middle of your swift program

39156435
quicksort	mergesort
my benchmarks on fairly modern processor shows the following when comparison function is a callback function like in quicksort libc implementation quicksort is slower than mergesort by 15 on random input and 30 for already sorted array for 64 bit integers
on the other hand if comparison is not a callback my experience is that quicksort outperforms mergesort by up to 25

39156435
quicksort	mergesort
on the other hand if comparison is not a callback my experience is that quicksort outperforms mergesort by up to 25
however if your large array has a very few unique values merge sort starts gaining over quicksort in any case

39156626
mongodb	bson
believe it or not it s possible to store a live javascript function in a mongodb collection a function with closure or more simply a closure is a function which refers to variables which exist outside the function like incrementx in the following snippet these functions can be stored in a mongodb collection as well
they will bind to the scope of the mongo session when they re executed for some unknowable reason the bson designers decided to use a different data type for javascript functions depending on whether they were closed over any variables or not

39163240
ubuntu	linux
in fact windows 10 is currently having a linux environment being built in meaning you could use it like ubuntu which will provide the right shell for touch
touch is not a command in the windows shell it is in the shells of unix-like operating systems mac linux etc which provide derivatives of the original sh shell

39163645
uilabel	uibutton
update if you can t remove the uilabel for any reason then put a uibutton under the uilabel with same frame and eventually nsconstraints and move buynowclicked method at touchupinside event on the button and then you win easily
my suggestion is to rework your design and change the uilabel to an uibutton because uibutton simply handles tap recognition and also you do not have any issue of tap forwarded also to the uicollectionview didselectitematindexpath will be called indeed

39168423
elasticsearch	kibana
reloading records into elasticsearch can be done at the rate of thousands per second so unless you have sale records for the entire world it s not going to take you more than a few hours to re-index your data
elasticsearch kibana really don t support joins in a relational sense

39169889
daemons	systemd
docker is designed for process isolation not for os virtualization so there are no other os processes and daemons running inside the container like systemd cron syslog etc only your entrypoint or command you run
if they included systemd commands you d find a lot of things not working since your entrypoint replaces init

39172226
erlang	elixir
so i downgraded erlang to 18 and elixir to 1.2.6 and now it compiled fine
well it turns out ejabberd is not ready for erlang 19 yet

39173300
helpers	actioncontroller
you can see here that abstractcontroller helpers is not included in the modules collection
in rails 4 which the article is based the method was included in actioncontroller helpers

39174057
division	multiplication
for the uint8 case the numpy cannot replace the division by 2 through multiplication with 0.5 because it is an integer division
integer division is slower than float-multiplication for a lot of architectures - this is the slowest vectorized operation

39174057
division	multiplication
integer division is slower than float-multiplication for a lot of architectures - this is the slowest vectorized operation
ps i would not dwell too much about costs multiplication vs

39175108
uiview	subviews
for example the above view controller and uiview subclass does something similar to what you re looking for but it s not possible to tell from your question
notice that pinning a stack view to the edges of its super view like stackview causes it to stretch subviews to fill all the available space while allowing the stack view to dynamically size based on the intrinsic size of its subviews like otherstackview does not

39176260
uiview	subviews
the uiview sits on top of an uiimageview sit on top of is not enough
make the red view the uiview a subviews of the map view the uiimageview

39179394
bower	npm
while i don t have volume declared in my dockerfile i do have volumes in my docker-compose.yml so i suspect this note is affecting me because both npm install bower install build steps do touch data within the volume
i removed those build steps from the dockerfile and did them manually after build is complete however i encountered problem with permissions when running those commands above since my newly created user did not have permissions to write to host and i didn t want to run as root inside container bower for example will not like it without --allow-root the solution is to create user with the same uid and gid as the host

39180349
wordpress	joomla
if you simply want to render the restricted area in wordpress like my account developed in php and not to integrate another framework joomla in your case with wordpress you can simply achieve that by first create a wordpress template that includes the restricted area logic
ref second create a wordpress page using the created template and set link for this page in your menu

39180588
portrait	landscape
while there isn t an api for this it appears that the behavior is constrained to portrait mode
if you run apple s touchcanvas example you ll see that the gesture doesn t actually work because the app runs in landscape mode

39185270
matplotlib	colormap
i asked a similar question not so long ago change color for first level of contourf and i took the answer from here python matplotlib change default color for values exceeding colorbar range if you use contours in your plot for example you should do something like this
i don t think you should change the colormap but rather the object using the colormap

39187518
tokudb	myisam
most of other options listed in your screenshot are either special-purpose storage engines which are not suitable for general use memory example federated archive csv and blackhole or are not available in standard builds of mysql most of the rest inifinidb brighthouse and tokudb
the lone exception is myisam which is an older mysql storage engine which does not support transactions is more prone to corruption and generally tends to perform worse than innodb

39189350
dictionary	map
the direct translation of your code into a list comprehension is the is informative but not needed you could just loop over directly and use each resulting dictionary now you have a list of strings however as each location is still the long lat formatted string you printed before
split that string and convert the result into a sequence of floats now you have a list of lists with floating point values if you must have tuples rather than lists add a tuple call the latter also makes sure the expression works in python 3 where map returns an iterator not a list

39191116
ionic	angular
however for a quick prototype or an app that you might want to reuse as a pwa progressive web app ionic is a good choice in that regard
you can of course get code reuse with them all using angular and react in react native but the ui is different since its not shared with the web dom

39191232
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the -webkit- prefix is required with both keyframes and in these browsers lets take for example this code this code will work in ie 11 and firefox 37 but will not work in google-chrome 40 and not in safari 7
if you will change the code to this code will work in latest versions of google-chrome firefox safari but will be ignored in ie 10

39192743
ssl	https
if not enable it by running a2enmod ssl
then check if apache is listening on port 443 for https

39193086
mathml	mathjax
it is not clear if you are asking how to write mathml that includes or if you are asking how to get mathjax to process elements
for the former see the mathml specification examples

39193200
hex	binary
you can use int or bit 16 and still insert values like 0xff just not as 0xff without further casting and you still can display them with hex 0xff in the way you want
if you want to use binary values or need large values 8 byte you can use lpad to fill them with leading zeros select hex lpad 0xff 2 0x0 you have to know or query the size of your column and you will probably run into a lot of issues with this starting with the simple task of adding two binary values

39195123
swift	objective-c
apparently that does not work correctly but the result is identical in swift 3 there is only one initializer taking an nscalendar.identifier parameter or the new value type which takes an enumeration parameter
that seems to be a bug in the swift 2 import of the objective-c interface. in objective-c there are at it is usual with foundation classes both a instance method and a class factory method and the following two statements are almost equivalent in swift there are only initializers and both should be mapped to the same swift initializer as it is the case with other foundation classes

39198812
dictionary	map
what you are going to need to add is the handling of the lists since you are not presenting simply a key value structure and that can be addressed by this question here how to check if a variable is a dictionary in python which will show you how to check for a type and modify behavior based on the data type
the easiest way to accomplish this is to set up two dummy data types one defined as an empty list and the other as an empty map and perform isinstance checks of the elements against the dummy types to decide on what logic you will want to execute

39204690
implements	extends
you will indeed need to implements your own dom-like library for the jvm side
if you do not want to reimplement it on the client side you could reuse the org.scalajs.dom namespace for your classes and give them exactly the same structure and types as in scalajs-dom except they won t extends js.any obviously

39204945
prepare	execute
in your case you can use query instead of prepare
prepare function just only prepares query and does not execute it

39205901
ubuntu	linux
in order to use mysqli you should then install the package for ubuntu apt-get install php-mysql check if it is already enabled with phpinfo for example if not enabled enable the module - check in etc php mods-available folder if there is a mysqli.ini containing then check for cli fpm apache other if there is the symbolic link pointing to this file for example for cli in etc php cli conf.d restart php apache nginx depending what you are using
if you are on linux you shouldn t have dll files but so files

39207520
swift	objective-c
if an nsdictionary object does not specify parameterized types it is bridged to a swift dictionary of type nsobject anyobject
the bridged type for nsdictionary in swift so the objective-c bridging method expects as from doc when you bridge from an nsdictionary object with parameterized types to a swift dictionary the resulting dictionary is of type objecttype

39209049
multiplying	multiplication
it turns out that it is easy to implement but for various reasons discussed in this answer tensorflow doesn t include op registrations for tf.int32 on gpu devices. assuming you are actually interested in multiplying much larger floating-point matrices you can change your program to ...and the multiplication will execute on your gpu
integer multiplication is currently not implemented for the gpu in tensorflow and your matrices matrix1 and matrix2 have type tf.int32

39211909
swift	objective-c
if you re trying to use nscopying in a generic context in pure swift consider defining your own copyable protocol and extending types to conform to that
since it isn t objective-c you should be fine

39213256
prng	random
it s important to note that the implementation of mt_rand is a prng pseudo random number generator and not a csprng cryptographically secure pseudo random number generator
meaning it s not well suited for cryptographic purposes but works fine for other prng needs

39213369
textview	imageview
you would obviously want to make a similar change for the other settingsmood textview as well
you cannot align the textview to the right of the imageview and to the left of the switch

39213639
ssl	https
just install ssl certificate by following the instructions of apache http server it s transparent to gce as it works at layer 3 in your case
if you are going to provide https service through a 3rd party software apache http server gcloud compute ssl-certificates is not for your use case

39216914
sudo	passwd
what i dont understand is why is it asking for a sudo passwd
we can t say for certain without seeing your playbook but it s almost certainly because a your playbook asks ansible to run a particular command with sudo via the sudo or become directives and b the test user does not have password-less sudo enabled

39216914
sudo	passwd
when you invoke a command with sudo you re asking sudo to elevate your privileges beyond what the account normally gets
this is an entirely different system with rules defined in etc sudoers which you should edit using sudo visudo that control which users are allowed to use sudo what commands they should be able to run whether they need to re-enter their passwd or not when using the command and a variety of other configuration options

39216914

this is an entirely different system with rules defined in etc sudoers which you should edit using sudo visudo that control which users are allowed to use sudo what commands they should be able to run whether they need to re-enter their passwd or not when using the command and a variety of other configuration options
when you run the playbook normally ansible is presented with a sudo prompt and doesn t know how to continue - it doesn t know the account passwd

39216914
sudo	passwd
when you run the playbook normally ansible is presented with a sudo prompt and doesn t know how to continue - it doesn t know the account passwd
that s why --ask-sudo-pass exists you re giving the passwd to ansible so that it can pass it on to sudo when prompted

namenode	hdfs
in order to avoid formatting namenode after every restart change hdfs default directory to some other location
first check whether namenode is running or not by jps command

39224199
spaces	delimiter
the browser displays and copies the tab character according to html standard as single spaces character
the most outer for processes each line read from xml file and splits each non empty line up into two strings the element name is assigned to loop variable a because of which is file shortname path and also file whereby the last one should be ignored which is the reason why is not specified in list of delimiter

39233229
innodb	myisam
you can reset the counter with alter table tablename auto_increment 1 for innodb you cannot set the auto_increment value lower or equal to the highest current index. quote from viralpatel note that you cannot reset the counter to a value less than or equal to any that have already been used
for myisam if the value is less than or equal to the maximum value currently in the auto_increment column the value is reset to the current maximum plus one

udp	tcp
udp 123
again that s udp not tcp

39234812
bower	npm
beginners can quickly get lost in choice of build tools and workflows but what s most up to date in 2016 is not using bower grunt or gulp at all
with help of webpack you can do everything directly in npm

39239562
rpm	yum
in te case you may be able to build an rpm by running rpmbuild -tb thetarballpackage.tar.gz or similar however you also then run the risk of creatings and then installing a rpm that may cause conflicts when attempting to install or update other rpms
yum and dnf keeps a list of installed rpm packages not installed execuables or tarballs

39239562
rpm	yum
yum and dnf keeps a list of installed rpm packages not installed execuables or tarballs
pkg-config doesnt care if the .pc files cames from an installed rpm package or from compiling a tarball - as long as the .pc files are in correct search path

ssl	https
to investigate this possibility you can download microsoft message analyzer and use it to run a trace on the ssl negotiation that occurs when you try and fail to establish an https connection to the server in your c# app
if you are able to make a successful https connection from another environment the windows xp machine that you mentioned -- or possibly by hitting the https url in a non-microsoft browser that doesn t use the os s cipher suite settings such as chrome or firefox run another message analyzer trace in that environment to capture what happens when the ssl negotiation succeeds

if you are able to make a successful https connection from another environment the windows xp machine that you mentioned -- or possibly by hitting the https url in a non-microsoft browser that doesn t use the os s cipher suite settings such as google-chrome or firefox run another message analyzer trace in that environment to capture what happens when the ssl negotiation succeeds
hopefully you ll see some difference between the two client hello messages that will allow you to pinpoint exactly what about the failing ssl negotiation is causing it to fail

noexcept	throw
it should be obvious now -- there is no point declaring inlined functions noexcept keep in mind that not every inline function is gonna get inlined
lets have a look at different categories of functions which don t throw you just know they don t non-inlined compiler can prove it doesn t throw -- noexcept won t hurt function body compiler will simply ignore specification and call sites will benefit from this promise non-inlined compiler can t prove it doesn t throw -- noexcept will hurt function body but benefit call sites hard to tell what is more beneficial inlined compiler can prove it doesn t throw -- noexcept serves no purpose inlined compiler can t prove it doesn t throw -- noexcept will hurt call site as you see nothrow is simply badly designed language feature

google-chrome	firefox
i can see it in firefox but google-chrome and ie11 are fine for me win 7
i think this might actually be a case where firefox is doing the correct thing and other renderers may not be see note at the end of this answer

mvp	presenter
mvp model view presenter now let s look at the mvp pattern
it looks very similar to mvc except for some key distinctions the input begins with the view not the presenter

swift	objective-c
but now swift introduced a new enum type string.encoding which is not originated as an objective-c enum
and unfortunately now any swift types can be contained in an nsdictionary with intermediate hidden reference type _swiftvalue which definitely is not an nsnumber

39259749
jar	war
if you declare thedependency as provided you are telling maven that the dependnecy will be available in runtime but that jar will not be packaged in your project
you likely want a compile scope which will be included in your classpath for instance packaged into a war

39260537
punctuation	words
example with punctuation because words boundaries treat punctuation as not words characters this approach is not confused by punctuation
let s define your a string and reformat your b string into a regex this tests to see if the words in b appear in the same order in a caveat if speed is important a non-regex approach may be faster

39264818
nsmutablestring	nsstring
instead you probably should use the nsmutablestring and append the second string to it
you cannot truly append one nsstring to another because the class nsstring is not mutable

39265346
punctuation	words
as stated in comments problem of this is not lack of effort by user either documentation but problem of the search engines like google because remove punctuation symbols like when searching
for people like me non english native speakers is a real problem sometimes to find the correct words

39266754
pandas	dask
not included in this set are datetime-formats datetime64 for which additional information can be found in the pandas and numpy documentation
the meta-argument for dask dataframes usually expects an empty pandas dataframe holding definitions for columns indices and dtypes

39266754
pandas	dask
the meta-argument for dask dataframes usually expects an empty pandas dataframe holding definitions for columns indices and dtypes
one way to construct such a dataframe is there is also a way to provide a dtype to the constructor of the pandas dataframe however i am not sure how to provide them for individual columns each

39267923
setinterval	settimeout
another way is to use setinterval method along with clearinterval
multiply the delay with the i since for loop does not wait for executing the settimeout callback

39275644
comparator	comparable
see comparator t interface constraints on type parameters c# programming guide
you must tell c# that t is comparable otherwise you can only do system.object things with t and that s not much excluding creating a new instance since c# does not even know whether t has a default constructor note that standard types like int string datetime etc

39279999
swift	objective-c
this reveals that you re using the realm objective-c framework from swift import realm rather than realm swift import realmswift
i am literally copying and pasting code from the official realm documentation for swift - and it doesn t compile the code snippet shown in your screenshot is missing the parentheses needed to call the initializer of the realm type

39282539
firefox	safari
according to mdn this uses the promise-version of the method as supported in recent implementations firefox 47 for example. if you want to support older versions you might have to use the older callback version which looks like this here s the sample code they gave to support safari notifications this is what i ended up with
you have to use a callback function for safari since it doesn t return a promise

39283552
bash	subshell
there are some very specific cases where some shells including bash can avoid creating a subshell for instance prog | while read .
does not create a separate subshell for the while loop in bash provided you set lastpipe shopt -s lastpipe and job control is not active

39283552
bash	subshell
does not create a separate subshell for the while loop in bash provided you set lastpipe shopt -s lastpipe and job control is not active
it always does create a subshell in some other shells

swift	objective-c
objective-c swift alternet solution same result can be achieved using following function as well
objective-c swift note keep stretchable image as small as possible otherwise it will not stretch properly with smaller image container imageview button etc.

39285351
jar	war
even though josh long s mantra is make jar not war
you linked to a question about a war vs a jar while spring boot s jar is indeed a jar it contains more than what you usually put inside a jar

39288755
google-chrome	firefox
luckily google search in google-chrome browser uses message event so here s our content script this method relies on an undocumented site feature which doesn t work in firefox for example
a more reliable crossbrowser method available to google-chrome extensions and webextensions is to monitor page url changes because google search results page always updates its url hash part

39288798
udp	tcp	sctp	tcp
sctp works just fine for example but udp doesn t because there is no way to guarantee your large publish packet made up of multiple udp packets will arrive in order and complete
with regards tcp reliability in theory what you are saying is true but in practice when an application calls write and receives a successful return it can t guarantee when the data has actually made it out of the computer to the remote host

39290291
swift	objective-c
inspired by the objective-c answer by arndt-bieberstein i have written a solution in swift 3 probably very similar - if not same - in earlier versions of swift
you can find it on github i am trying to make a pod of it but i am having issues getting pob lib lint to work with the swift 3 code cli xcodebuild or xcode 8 related problem probably. anyhow the class method can extract the name and types of any swift class that inherits from nsobject

39291092
ubuntu	debian
long version not sure on the ubuntu way of doing it.
it seems the normal way doesn t work on ubuntu eg just for modules not what you want or for a whole kernel like you want also doesn t work for me ubuntu 16.04 note that make bindeb-pkg is not the pure ubuntu debian way to build.

39295413
build.gradle	gradlew
also note if you just need to add your task to another build.gradle you could use to call groovy from inside a build.gradle file apply from test.groovy
if i m understanding correctly your file is not named build.gradle if this is the case then gradlew won t know what the task groovy is since it didn t read that file

39295413
build.gradle	gradlew
if i m understanding correctly your file is not named build.gradle if this is the case then gradlew won t know what the task groovy is since it didn t read that file
if you want to specify a file other than build.gradle for evaluation by gradlew then you need to give gradlew the file name

39297956
subtraction	addition
the carry flag can be considered the unsigned overflow flag for addition it is also the borrow flag or not borrow flag for subtraction depending on your architecture
the v flag is the signed overflow flag for addition subtraction

39297956
subtraction	addition
the v flag is the signed overflow flag for addition subtraction
you are the only one who knows or cares whether or not the addition is signed or unsigned as for addition subtraction it doesnt matter

39299284
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome considers the key to be the meta key while firefox considers it to be the os key
thus firefox does not set the metakey property to true because from firefox s point of view the meta key is not being pressed

39299877
google-chrome	firefox
i had a similar issue using the google-chrome driver v2.23 running the tests thru teamcity
i was able to fix the issue by adding the no-sandbox flag to the google-chrome options i m not sure if there is a similar option for the firefox driver

39301125
google-chrome	firefox
this will not cause any visual differences and will take care of the problem on google-chrome
to get the blur on firefox just add filter blur 5px

39301125
google-chrome	firefox
along with the -webkit-filter and blur will work of ff35+ as well. as for the unblurring that appears there is actually a bug which happens on google-chrome and probably every other webkit browser
this doesn t happen on firefox though

39303494
lemmatization	stemming
use snowballstemmer note lemmatization is closely related to stemming
the difference is that a stemming operates on a single word without knowledge of the context and therefore cannot discriminate between words which have different meanings depending on part of speech

39303904
theano	keras
if you take the steps to have a working installation of theano there shouldn t be any problem installing keras with pip
there are some non-python dependencies for keras so pip won t install them and fails if they are not found

39304905
factors	matrix
there are two errors with your code you did not use pivoting index to revert the pivoting done to the cholesky factors
note pivoted cholesky factorization for a semi-positive definite matrix a is doing where p is a column pivoting matrix and r is an upper triangular matrix

39306174
realloc	malloc
realloc 0 is implementation dependent and not equivalent to free
that said you might be lucky so the second malloc after realloc 0 sees a free block where before was a

39308765
swift	objective-c
swift generates nsarray containing nsnumber s
although nsnumber can contain int64 long long int in c objective-c swift does not convert int64 to nsnumber automatically thus cannot be automatically converted to anyobject

39309015
google-chrome	safari
source but if i check it says that google-chrome does support arrow functions
so you might check whether the features you re looking for are supported or not for ios safari not for google-chrome

39309015
google-chrome	safari
so you might check whether the features you re looking for are supported or not for ios safari not for google-chrome
google-chrome in ios is not using the same rendering engine as it is in desktop machines

39310224
persistent	transient
if you persistent a new entity by calling entitymanager persistent then the behaviour you describe will not happen and transient fields will be visible in the prepersist method
however if you persistent a new entity with entitymanager merge then the merging mechanism will ignore transient fields which is expected behaviour - only the properties that hibernate is aware of are merged

39311448
daemons	systemd
you can try disabling it with sudo launchctl unload -w systemd library launchdaemons org.apache.httpd.plist if that doesn t do it it ll say something like could not find specified service you can check to see if it s some other launchd daemons item by looking for the pid of the master process the one running as root not _www that won t necessarily tell you exactly what s going on but might point you in the right direction
this is just a guess but it might be the built-in version of apache being launchd restarted by launchd os x s daemons manager

39313247
client-side	server-side
you will need to use this on the the client-side javascript like ajax or angularjs to make async request and bind your data
web browsers will prevent the server-side from reading anything after the # fragment for security reason in-short the browser does not not include the fragment in the request

39313304
profiling	debugging
i even left application running on my local machine with a profiling attached but still didn t find anything suspicious
memory footprint problems became irritating as i had to monitor application and restart it every 1-2 days and due to heroku nature i could not simply ssh to the server and debugging or attach profiling to running process

39317841
udp	tcp
for sip this will be an rtp stream which is set up on a different udp port
i can t speak for how skype does it but this should be a starting point streaming audio video is usually transported over udp sockets not tcp

39317841
udp	tcp
i can t speak for how skype does it but this should be a starting point streaming audio video is usually transported over udp sockets not tcp
tcp guarantees delivery whereas udp is best effort

39318220
multiplying	multiplication
old answers this is one way using gallery to get a circulant matrix and indexing the relevant part of the resulting matrix before multiplying the elements more memory efficient alternative in case there are no zeros in the input
update inspired by the nicely thought answer of dev-il comes this handy solution which does not require matlab r2016a or above the basic idea is to transform the multiplication to a sum and a moving average can be used which in turn can be realised by conv olution

39318554
boxlayout	miglayout
this was because managers like boxlayout were so simplistic that we needed them
with formlayout and miglayout this is not necessary

39321841
client-side	server-side
client-side javascript form validation is merely for the benefit of improving user experience ux
it is not a substitution for server-side php validation

39322440
vb6	vba
furthermore as idtextensibility2 was introduced with vb6 and office 2000 s vba 6.x there are also versions of vbide for vb5 and i assume for office 97 s vba 5.x that expose the original idtextensibility
contrary to hans passant s answer the add-in is not an office add-in but is in fact a vbe add-in so it works in any host that supports vba 6 7 office autocad coreldraw solidworks etc. and it can absolutely work in vb6 too.

39323678
trie	tree
the referenced article is not comparing a trie with an abstract set datastructure
it is comparing the trie with the c++ standard library std set which is a search tree usually a red-black tree which allows you to iterate the contents in sorted order

39323901
udp	tcp
udp doesn t have error recovery if there s an obstacle it will just collide with it then continue
while tcp makes sure that all packets are sent received perfectly no errors so the car just passes obstacles without colliding

39323928
udp	tcp
the developers carrying on this thus developed some reliability on udp called rudp to make it somewhat imitate tcp
still it doesn t implement tcp functionalities completely in totality

39327715
comparator	comparable
this means that the type provided to the list would need to implement comparator object o and implement comparable notice the missing generic type to comparable which i assume is not intended
that means that you will then expect a type that is comparable to object since java infers generic types to be object when not provided

39331617
lisp	racket
how it does that turns out to involve hairy questions of language semantics which i as an old-fashioned lisp hacker don t really understand a starting point is perhaps here
i think it is slightly confusing to talk about stack overflow because it may be that the implementation doesn t actually use a stack or stores the stack on the heap or something else and i think racket does at least one if not both of these

39332385
clang	llvm
i will type my answer since i ve just looked for the same solution and foun it at another place the xcode compiler is clang llvm but ruby mri 1.9 only supports gcc another older but widely used compiler . while it s true that mri 1.9.3 is unofficially compatible with clang there are some known issues and some modules do not compile correctly fibers
full clang support has been added with mri 2.0.0

39333039
mongodb	bson
however keep in mind limitation of mongodb mapreduce and maximum size of bson document
i m not sure if mongodb do support such kind of operations out of box but you can achieve so with help of mapreduce

39338305
swift	objective-c
you cannot subclass a swift class in objective-c
taken from using swift with cocoa and objective-c

39339385
dictionary	map
also give you variables better names row is not a very good name for a dictionary
if the sublists can contain more than one dictionary you can flatten the sublists with itertools.chain but you seem to have a list of dicts so you can remove the chain from collections import counter print counter map itemgetter strid excel_data never use if is when comparing strings is checks the identity of and object use i.e but it would make a lot more sense to just do a lookup i.e

39339609
spaces	delimiter
to get what you need you can try to set the sep as a regular expression is a negative look behind syntax which means separate on spaces only when it is not preceded by a comma and it should work for your case
because you have spaces between words and if you specify spaces as delimiter it will naturally separate them

39343949
g++	gcc
not quite a dupe question but here is an example of g++ calling memmove or memcpy as part of the implementation of std copy
in short no using std copy does not in general prevent gcc from using libc

39347018
google-chrome	firefox
then it s fine in both google-chrome and ie11
i haven t tested firefox but i d expect it to be fine. -0800 is a valid utc offset in basic format of iso-8601 but that doesn t have colons

39352216
http	spdy
if this is not practical it is possible to use other ciphers but you need to ensure that the services you intend to call also support these ciphers forbidden by the http 2 rfc and have evaluated the security risks of doing so
enabling alpn or npn the sslcontextbuilder has a setter for an applicationprotocolconfig which is used to configure alpn or npn. see the http 2 examples for alpn and spdy examples for npn usage

39354520
daemons	systemd
the issue with your command+strace combination is that docker has a client server model and your docker run represents the client side of a rest api transaction to ask the docker daemons to run the apache container on your behalf
depending on how your client is configured that container may not even run on the same systemd on which you type your docker run command

39354520
daemons	systemd
however to take the simplest case where the docker client and daemons are on the same systemd you can use ps find the pid of the running apache server and use strace to join and trace the already-started process as long as that is sufficient for your tracing needs
given i had to debug several early-start issues with runc the executor for containers in docker version 1.11 and above i also created a small wrapper for docker-runc which strace s the container process from the start from the outside systemd so strace is not required in the container filesystem

39355803
seaborn	matplotlib
maybe the best approach for you is one of following choices 1 try plotly if data is not sensitive 2 use excel and integrate python with the chart in excel which may save you a lot of time because people can be familiar with excel chart templates easily. 3 diy by yourself currently bokeh matplotlib seaborn are under your consideration if you just want to do something simple
panda also integrates with matplotlib which is somewhat ugly but very convient. some complicated examples hierarchic pie donut chart from pandas dataframe using bokeh or matplotlib my experience is that you have to do a lot of configuration if you want to have a basic diy chart with python

39356571
swift	objective-c
it s a little tricky in that this is a purely objective-c feature of cocoa so it doesn t work with the swift overlay class locale
you will have to cast currentlocale to objective-c nslocale

39359263
gunicorn	uwsgi
nginx can cache static content and keep a request backlog gunicorn provides application caching and multiple threads worker management not to mention awesome administration and statistic tools django embeds best practices for database migrations auth request routing as well as off-the-shelf plugins for providing semantic rest endpoints and documentation all sorts of goodness
if you really insist on building it from scratch yourself you should study uwsgi a great wsgi implementation that can be interfaced with gunicorn to provide application caching

39361391
equals	gethashcode
you will notice that the equals method of your doubleequalitycomparer class is not getting hit
linq extension methods rely on gethashcode for equality comparisons

39361391
equals	gethashcode
since the gethashcode method is not returning equivalent hashes for the doubles in your list the equals method is not getting called
each gethashcode method should be atomic in execution and should return the same int value for any two equal comparisons

39361484
equals	gethashcode
your gethashcode method should return the same value for numbers that should be equals
equalitycomparer works in two steps checked gethashcode if the value with this hash code was not processed yet then this value gets into new single group if value with this hash code was obtained - then checkinq result of equals method

39361484
equals	gethashcode
in your case every double returns the different hash codes so method equals does not called
so if you do not care about processing time you can simple return constant value in gethashcode method as firstcall suggested

39367102
uiview	subviews
i m not sure if you re overriding drawrect in your uitableviewcell subclass or if it s in a custom uiview class
my suggestion would be to do your drawing in a custom uiview class and then add that view as a subviews of your cell - just in case uitableviewcell is doing something in drawrect that you re accidentally overriding

39368467
ssl	https
see eg how to redirect https to http without any ssl certificate for why this is necessary
i think the problem is that one of your port 443 virtualhosts does not have ssl on

39369648
kerberos	ntlm
this is because kerberos is necessary to do it kerberos tg ticket that was generated when logging in to the machine but azure ad doesn t know kerberos hence the need for adfs
azure ad domain services preview this makes legacy features ntlm kerberos etc available

39374601
wildfly	jboss
below is how to enable the old native jmx interface removed from wildfly 8 default configuration which is backwards compatible with jmx tools
this is required when the new http interface is not an option to integrate with legacy tools like bamboo s jboss 7 add-on

39376081
super	implements
super b b # resolves to the scope of b s parent a # and applies that scope to b as if b was an instance of a super c c # resolves to the scope of c s parent b # and applies that scope to c super b c # resolves to the scope of b s parent a # and applies that scope to c using super with a staticmethod using super from within the __new__ method explanation 1- even though it s usual for __new__ to take as its first param a reference to the calling class it is not implements in python as a classmethod but rather a staticmethod
that is a reference to a class has to be passed explicitly as the first argument when calling __new__ directly # if you defined this class a object def __new__ cls pass # calling this would raise a typeerror due to the missing argument a.__new__ # whereas this would be fine a.__new__ a 2- when calling super to get to the parent class we pass the child class a as its first argument then we pass a reference to the object of interest in this case it s the class reference that was passed when a.__new__ cls was called

39377704
swift	objective-c
metatypes exist in swift because swift has types that are not classes
this is most similar to the metaclass concept in objective-c

39377704
swift	objective-c
lexicon.rst in the swift open source repo has a pretty good explanation metatype the type of a value representing a type
greg parker has a good explanation of objective-c s metaclasses because swift has types that are not classes a more general term is used

39379897
postgresql	mysql
if you are absolutely sure that network connectivity is not an issue you can forego sqlite as intermediate storage and log directly into postgresql - this will make your solution a lot simpler at the price of losing some reliability
sqlite works great as high performance local engine for data collection. however sqlite was not designed to be able to serve your data over the network - you need server-based sql engine for that for example mysql or postgresql

39379901
subtraction	modulo
12345 48 32 this will quickly make p too large for repeated conditional subtraction of i until the condition mask is all false even for fairly large i values
there are tricks for modulo by known integer constants see but afaik working out the multiplicative modular inverse for a nearby divisor even with a power-of-two stride like 16 isn t any easier than for a totally separate number

39379913
serializable	deserialization
this seems more like a serializable deserialization task
the simplest approach is to mark the class with serializable then use the binaryformatter like this however this is not very efficient memory-wise--this example generates a 524-byte serialized startpacket probably due to the fact that the will have a capacity of more than 3 double s

39380190
ubuntu	linux
‡§∏ ‡§§ ‡§¨‡§∞ 07 2016 ‡§∏ ‡§§ ‡§¨‡§∞ ‡•¶‡•≠ ‡•®‡•¶‡•ß‡•¨ while i do not fully understand this behavior it seems we can draw two conclusions based on the android behavior of zax the ubuntu linux experience of dac saunders and my experience on macos android implementation of legacy date-time classes differs from that of linux macos
in android arabic-style digits while on linux macos we get hindu-style

39381805
profiling	benchmarking
a profiling result might be a table of time taken per function or even per instruction with a sampling profiling
you can tell it s a profiling not a benchmarking because it makes no sense to say that function took the least time so we ll keep that one and stop using the rest

39381805
profiling	benchmarking
you can tell it s a profiling not a benchmarking because it makes no sense to say that function took the least time so we ll keep that one and stop using the rest
read the wikipedia article to learn more about it you use a profiling to figure out where to optimize

39382494
decimal	ieee
to prevent the exception ensure that the denominator in a division operation with integer or decimal values is non-zero. dividing a floating-point value by zero doesn t throw an exception
it results in positive infinity negative infinity or not a number nan according to the rules of ieee 754 arithmetic

39383063
persistent	transient
firstly you need to understand the three states of the hibernate object i.e transient persistent detached
transient state an object is in transient state if it just has been instantiated using the new operator and there is no reference of it in the database i.e it does not represent any row in the database

39385028
aggregate-functions	sum
you are right aggregate-functions handles null values in a different way than non aggregate-functions select 2 + null + 5 returns null because null on this context it means an unknown value so the result will be null unknown as well
this will return 7 instead select sum n from select 2 as n union all select null union all select 5 s because on this context a null value even if it is unknown can be seen as a not specified value

39387483
keystore	jks
i fixed it the issue was that my cert was not imported in the default keystore wsacarbon used from saml2 validator on the configuration
the solution there is to either configure is to use your own jks which be default has your certs

39388794
uiview	cagradientlayer
you can achieve that by subclassing uiview then set the colors it s less code than adding and maintaining a sublayer but might not suit all use cases
as an alternative to the accepted answer you could also change the views layer class to be cagradientlayer

39391665
express	node.js
you might be better off using express node.js based server-side
other than as a build pipeline for client-side javascript code i m not aware of any way to use node.js in ruby on rails at runtime

39395973
super	self
the best practice for calling the implementation from the superclass is to use super class mixin object def save self super mixin self .save # do stuff b here or before super call as you wish what is important is that you call super in each class so that it propagates all the way but not the topmost base class because its superclass does not have save
note that when you call super mixin self .save you don t really know what the super class would be once it is executed

39396608
serializable	deserialization
even your superclass does not implement serializable you could give a default value to msc.a in a noarg constructor
in the documentation just above the paragraph you ve excerpted it says that the classes that require special handling during the serialization and deserialization process must implement special methods

postgresql	mysql
the linked question is about mysql so it does not apply to postgresql the var_max_val syntax is specific to mysql
to accomplish the same thing in postgresql you can use a lateral subquery

super	self
for example using super on python 2 super classname self .whatever people often try to replace this with super self.__class__ self .whatever and they are dead wrong to do so
the first argument must be the actual class the super call occurs in not self.__class__ or the lookup will find the wrong method

memcpy	memmove
for example if it can determine that the destination target of memcpy contains the same constant bit pattern as the source it will treat the memcpy as a no-op even if the source held the type that would next be used to read the destination storage and the destination held a different type the compiler had decided couldn t alias the next read
experimentally gcc 6.2 behaves in ways which would only be justifiable by regarding memmove as transferring the effective type of the source to the destination

bower	npm
if you do not want to use the npm distribution it is likely that the separation of the .d.ts and .js files is what s causing the problem with the bower distribution too
as mentioned in a comment made above using the npm distribution of oidc-client would be the preferred option

prepare	execute
wikipedia lists two reasons for using prepare statements the overhead of compiling and optimizing the statement is incurred only once although the statement is execute multiple times
... prepare statements are resilient against sql injection because parameter values which are transmitted later using a different protocol need not be correctly escaped

vsts	tfs
seems release artifacts is not support for tfs2015 update3 only work with vsts for now
update you just need to specify build.artifactstagingdirectory in publish build artifacts or copy and publish build artifacts step tfs will do the thing for you

oncreate	setcontentview
yeh after marshmallow come android make security level more stick but for system_alert_window you can show floating action and anything you can force user to give permission for it by following codes in your oncreate method put this code after setcontentview the action action_manage_overlay_permission directly launches the draw over other apps permission screen
edit my above code works 100 correct but i just found that many guys are still searching that how can allow action_manage_overlay_permission permanently like if user has allow permission once then don t ask it every time he open application so hear solution for you- check if device has api 23+ if 23+ api then check if user has permit or not if had permit once don t drive him to settings.action_manage_overlay_permission and if has not permit yet then ask for runtime permission check put below line in your oncreate method

aggregate-functions	sum
we re using select sum delivered is not null because we need numeric results in the aggregate-functions for every row
delivered is not null gives back either 1 or 0 so the sum should work nicely

division	multiplication
here is another solution which uses the fractions module to by reducing to lowest terms do the division as it goes along
it also uses the fact that so as to not do unneeded multiplication for example which can be verified with a computer algebra system

odoo	qweb
_s is later evaluated as your current url with the appropriate port depending on where you re running odoo from when a new session is being created from the source code located here qweb has a dictionary called default_dict which it uses to store some parameters so ._s is set to origin which is your current url when you initially started the odoo server edit for anyone reading this this solution doesn t work for icons in list views odoo s tree view
i ve submitted a pr to odoo 8 to fix this

39415502
unixodbc	iodbc
to check that the driver manager is configured properly use iodbctest or unixodbc s isql that caused the conflict above in the first place
we already do this in our debian ubuntu packaging by calling see i don t see the error you get from line 941 but two things concerning odbc connections 1 your must point to a copy of iodbc not to virtuoso you can get it from or your distribution probably has a package libiodbc2-dev on debian ubuntu 2 virtuoso s isql tests a direct connection to virtuoso

39416386
swift	objective-c
dr you need to prefix the function declaration with its objective-c declaration i was tipped off to this being a solution thanks to the swift 3 migration guide which states if you implement an optional objective-c protocol requirement in a subclass of a class that declares conformance you ll see a warning instance method nearly matches optional requirement of protocol workaround add an objective-c objectivec name attribute before the implementation of the optional requirement with the original objective-c selector inside
i m fairly certain this is a bug it appears that the the runtime dynamism that allows checking for selector capability does not get properly bridged in the grand swift renaming when the protocol method is in the subclass

fold	combinators
since this stream is not productive enough fold continues to add values without stopping
the simplest way to fix this is to use a combinators that emits the partial results from the fold

39417315
division	multiplication
but this operation inherently involves division which is expensive whereas computing an address from an array index involves a multiplication and is faster
this operation requires a division only when the size of the element is not a power of two when it is not a pointer or some standard type on most systems

ionic	angular
most of the problems you will face today when dealing with ionic angular 2 will be already solved here in stackoverflow 12 months from now
currently i would say it does not matter that much if you pick ionic 1 or ionic 2

39421762
division	modulo
in math and in some programming languages if the modulo is not zero then it has the same sign as the divisor treating integer division as truncating towards negative infinity
in other programming languages if the modulo is not zero it has the same sign as the dividend treating integer division as truncating towards zero

39421762
division	modulo
in other programming languages if the modulo is not zero it has the same sign as the dividend treating integer division as truncating towards zero
some programming languages include both a modulo sign same as divisor and remainder operator sign same as dividend

sml	prolog
the sml list construction syntax isn t completely straightforward
since we use to construct literal lists it is tempting to think we could also use that notation to destructure lists and cons elements onto the head of lists as we can for instance in prolog

ssl	https
if you are just using 1and1 s webspace domains not server it s pretty straight forwards it doesn t change files it doesn t automatically make the site ssl
it will continue to run as a http server until you start editing your .htaccess files to redirect to https

39433261
ssl	https
the geotrust ssl cert will handle both foo.com www.foo.com . the starter ssl will only handle one of them not both
if that checks out setup your geotrust ssl certificate to handle both www.foo.com and foo.com once you ve got your cert just add the below to a .htaccess file it assumes that foo.com traffic is also www.foo.com traffic this can be used instead of mod_rewrite in apache 2.4 request_scheme is used since the server isn t using a full strict method where the server itself is set to run in https

39433261
ssl	https
until the server timeouts from recursion while it is possible to reduce this so you have less redirects if you intend to further tighten your ssl if you use cloudflare you ll likely end up using http strict transport security hsts and it s strict in how http is escalated to https
the pseudocode below shows the elevation it requires having to do it this way due to limited links being allowed here http domain 301 https domain 301 https sub+domain i m not entire sure how the hsts protocol would handle how i initially intended the failure of a file directory not being found creating a 404 message that breaks it s strict redirects

bazaar	git	bazaar	cvs
edit seems this still isn t clear here s a sample scenario of how it goes wrong using the following dockerfile from debian latest run apt-get update run apt-get install -y bazaar cvs git mercurial subversion when i run docker built -t my-app latest
it outputs a long list that ends with now if i change this file to add unzip to the package list and assume it s months later so the apt-get update now contains stale data from debian latest run apt-get update run apt-get install -y bazaar cvs git mercurial subversion unzip if i run that right now it will work but if you look at the above output the apt-get update shows which means it didn t run the update it just reused an old layer that ran that step before

google-chrome	firefox
this issue occurs because sockjs internally trying to load the url using xmlhttprequest but google-chrome does not allow accessing cross origin content unless the protocol is one of the aforementioned protocols in this case it is ws

express	node.js
i ve filed a report on rdar do not hesitate to express your mind as well xcode is a primary tool for the development on all apple platforms. people can either love or hate it the fact is it s still the most powerful development tool around
lots of its power and usefulness has been achieved by 3rd-party plugins later covered by the alcatraz project which is the number one extension management system for xcode as vital and needed as for example npm is needed for node.js

39463783
jruby	mri
once you are using jruby + bundler gem install bundler you can bundle install from the project root and your dependency issues should be resolved
it looks like you might need to switch to jruby instead of mri which is experimental for logstash and not currently supported

39463783

client-side	server-side
p.s date and time information can also be fetched using pure javascript code on the client-side but for some applications the date and time information on the client-side is not reliable enough since it relies on the date and time settings that are set by the client browser
assuming that you need to get the update from the server noted the php code in your original post there are two things you need to implement a server-side script in this case written in php to be requested by the client for fresh data

in this case you should also be able to sudo apt-get install libxml-simple-perl to install it from ubuntu
if that s not the correct package name i use debian rather than ubuntu so it s possible ubuntu may have renamed it you can use apt-cache search xml simple to get a list of matching packages then check their details with to determine which is the one you want

39480951
innodb	myisam
as rickjames answers this feature exists in the myisam storage engine but it doesn t work in innodb
the reason is related to innodb s row-level locking in order to prevent a race condition with another concurrent client inserting to the same class per your example innodb would have to create a gap lock on all the rows for the given class

innodb	myisam
the reason is related to innodb s row-level locking in order to prevent a race condition with another concurrent client inserting to the same class per your example innodb would have to create a gap lock on all the rows for the given class
this doesn t affect myisam which does table-level locking anyway but for innodb it would greatly harm throughput during concurrent workloads

seaborn	matplotlib
update i have recently used pairgrid object from seaborn to generate a plot similar to the one in this example . in this case since gridplot is not a plot object like for example sns.swarmplot it has no get_figure function. it is possible to directly access the matplotlib figure by like previously suggested in other posts in this thread
the suggested solutions are incompatible with seaborn 0.8.1 giving the following errors because the seaborn interface has changed attributeerror axessubplot object has no attribute fig when trying to access the figure attributeerror axessubplot object has no attribute savefig when trying to use the savefig directly as a function the following calls allow you to access the figure seaborn 0.8.1 compatible as seen previously in this answer

swift	objective-c
items inside an nsarray are assumed to be nsobject and its subclasses while swift has no clue what t is since the array is empty and hence type inference doesn t work

iclientmessageinspector is not the right place the manipulate the channel you should use iendpointbehavior instead from msdn implements methods that can be used to extends run-time behavior for an endpoint in either a service or client application

39496862
firefox	safari
this is completely dependent on the browser and most do not support abr streams natively except for example safari via hls your short answer given this background information is that because you are using an older version of firefox that does not support mse you need to install either flash or silverlight to play back your adaptive bitrate streams
a few mitigations for you customers 1 install flash silverlight 2 download an up-to-date version of firefox we recommend this for sure because mse is supported in v42 but in v47+ google widevine protected content is supported which means you can playback drm encrypted content without silverlight see azure media player s compatibility matrix for more info on what s supported on which browsers

ssl	https
also as per the https goes either you add a ssl certificate to the ec2 instance or the elb
but that ssl certificate will be for the domain you are going to use for your application and you do not own the domain amazonaws.com so your load balancer url will never work for https

swift	objective-c
in conclusion some converting rules that may affect you callback code closure parameters are optional if in objective-c are not specified nullability attributes all ns prefixes is removed for objective-c classes in swift if objective-c function had id parameter in swift 3.0 it will have type any instead of anyobject

n-gram	words
see a discussion here elegant n-gram generation in python we can then apply this to every address we have to obtain one grand mapping from any words to the full address this yields something like this all you have to do then is join this with the actual city list you have this will automatically discard any entry in word_to_address_mapping which is not a known city and provide a mapping between university address and their city
i think one simple idea would be to create a mapping from any words or sequence of words of any address to the full address the words is part of with the assumption that one of those address words is the cites

39517877
sum	coalesce
one simple improvement is to drop loop - filter - union and perform a single aggregation df.groupby hour time col animal .agg mean weights sum is_male if that s not enough then most likely the issue here is configuration the good place to start could be adjusting spark.sql.shuffle.partitions if you don t do that already
both coalesce 1 and collect are pretty bad in general but with expected output size around 1mb it doesn t really matter

39520288
implements	extends
using implements realmmodel gives you no additional benefit
considering that extends any non- realmobject classes is not possible even if you re implementing realmmodel and adding realmclass in my opinion you just get additional complexity by forcing yourself to use for example realmobject.isvalid realmobject instead of realmobject.isvalid that you get naturally for free using extends realmobject

39521727
punctuation	words
my best guess is that it s because perl doesn t use any built-in array punctuation variables except for - and + added in 5.6 2000
the code in s_scan_const only interprets as the start of an array if the following character is a words character x _ 1 or a foo or a foo this is the old syntax for or a or a or a + or - the arrays + and - but not in regexes

rdf	owl
in turtle if you wan t to make it compatible with owl dl you must not use rdf containers but you can make your own class of containers
you can t express this with an rdfs ontology that is as an rdf graph interpreted according to the rdfs entailment regime

39521971
division	subtract
mod gives you the remainder from a division so 2 3 remainder 1 2016 - 2013 gives you 3 so remainder of 3 3 is 0 the lower case year which is not a function without brackets defines an interval type you could use day year month etc
another example is in case 2 when comparing what i do is make both dates essentially year 0001 by subtract the year integer out of the date and then compare which will tell me which date is later in the year to understand if the anniversary has already passed or is still coming up this year

39523168
ssl	https
to find out which protocols are supported and which are not i checked the curl version using command curl --version it provided information as follows curl 7.50.3 x86_64-apple-darwin15.6.0 libcurl 7.50.3 securetransport zlib 1.2.5 protocols dict file ftp ftps gopher http imap imaps ldap ldaps pop3 pop3s rtsp smb smbs smtp smtps telnet tftp features ipv6 largefile ntlm ntlm_wb ssl libz unixsockets where https protocol happens to be not supported

use a bash while-loop loops can be done over a command or an input file
with an example i have a sample file with contents as i have modified the script to echo the line as it reads through the file produces an o p when run as . script.sh my name is not relevant here the same can also be done over a bash-command where we adopt process-substitution to run the command on the subshell

git-svn	svn2git
but besides that git-svn is not the right tool for one-time conversions of repositories or repository parts
it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case

cifs	smb
if you mount the folder using cifs it should runs a lot faster
on the guest side you should do this i don t use mac so i m not sure how to do it on the host side but i guess that you only need to share the folder to the network using smb samba protocol

39537789
onresume	onpause
edit since you updated the code use openfileoutput latlngpoints.txt context.mode_append instead of context.mode_private you should read markers from file also in onmapready or in onconnected bundle connectionhint exactly like you do in onresume method because when you run the app the map won t be ready yet and you won t execute anything but the if statement in your onresume also notice that your file will likely containt duplicates
notice that the getlastlocation method might return a null value if no previous location is available getlastlocation documentation the last know location isn t necessarily your current location super.onstart super.onpause and super.onstop should be the first instructions in your onstart onpause and onstop methods

one approach is to make your classes implements interfaces instead of extends other classes
in java a class cannot extends multiple classes but it can implements multiple interfaces

39540804

in java a class cannot extends multiple classes but it can implements multiple interfaces
unfortunately this does not save you from much work because when a class implements an interface you still have to write all the implementation code

factors	matrix
maybe this example will be clear enough to illustrate the problem of regarding the other answer apply definitely does not work because the function you apply is as.factor or factors
apply always works on a matrix if you feed it a data frame it will convert it into a matrix first and returns a matrix while you can t have factors data class in matrix

if you were implemented sock_dgram which is udp you wouldn t need to be using sock.accept
seems like you haven t implemented tcp in java before

translation	localization
cakemanager cakephp-users doesn t follow the conventions all that being said cakemanager cakephp-users is a special case it doesn t follow the conventions of using domain translation methods like __d and supplying a domain name that is the lowercased underscored variant of the plugin name like __d users message text
instead it uses domain less translation calls ie __ message text see for example therefore cakephps message file loader will never try to load any localization files from the plugins locale folder in the first place and it also won t look up proper separate localization files in your apps locale folder

implements	extends
finally let me add that it s usually not a good idea to implements a collection from scratch
instead you might want to extends abstractcollection or abstractlist

39549116
profiling	debugging
in short choose product - profiling and choose the leaks tool which will grab the essential allocations tool as well exercise the app and then look at precisely what was allocated and not released
also xcode 8 s debugging object graph tool is incredibly useful too and is even easier to use

super	self
remarks the answer assumes that this is python 3 because of the super syntax getattr super value lambda 0 returns the bound value method of the parent class if such exists or defaults to a function which returns 0
this is the interesting part class val10 object def value self return 10 class val5 object def value self return 5 to get the sum of parents values you have to call each of them class val15 val10 val5 def value self return val10.value self + val5.value self alternative solution another approach is to define that value always returns the sum of all inherited values whatever they may be without knowing which parent classes value to call this solution does not make any assumptions about the way inheritance is going to be configured

bash	subshell
when the inherit_errexit option is not enabled bash clears the -e option in such subshell
as long as bash is invoked as bash you re mostly correct except that it s the not the eval that suppresses -e

39555051
bash	subshell
as long as bash is invoked as bash you re mostly correct except that it s the not the eval that suppresses -e
beware though if it may be called as sh or bash --posix this is item #40 on the list of changes between posix and non-posix mode enabling posix mode has the effect of setting the inherit_errexit option so subshell spawned to execute command substitutions inherit the value of the -e option from the parent shell

39557523
uialertview	uialertcontroller
do not use uialertcontroller use uialertview
like that alert.show however uialertview is deprecated so it s not quite safe to rely on it

39557551
swift	objective-c
a lot of library classes including uicolor are actually objective-c classes usable from swift so when you extend them the default settings make your extensions available in objective-c as well
the compiler generates objective-c headers for your framework declaring your extensions as objective-c methods and in this case and + are not valid method names in objective-c so it causes a compile error

39560369
hive	hdfs
yarn applications in general hive mapreduce spark etc... require to create temporal folders to store the partial data and or current process configuration
normally this temporal data is being written inside the hdfs user home in your case user mnemosyne your problem is that your home folder was created by the user hdfs and your user mnemosyne doesn t have privileges to write on it

39561261
multiplying	multiplication
for example take the following line of code without type declarations php first has to do an internal type check on and before it can actually multiplying them
php needs to make sure they re both number types convert them if they re not and then perform the appropriate type of multiplication int int float int etc.

39561818
imperative	declarative
all above answers and other online post mention following with declarative programming you write code that describes what you want but not necessarily how to get it you should prefer declarative programming over the imperative programming what they have not told us is how to achieve it
for part of the program to be more declarative other parts must provide the abstraction to hide the implementation details which are the imperative codes

39562813
realloc	malloc
look at these results increasing lossful malloc took 777 ms decreasing lossful malloc took 729 ms decreasing realloc took 19 ms these results were too close so i run several tests and averaged them. definitely decreasing the memory size is more efficient when using realloc
that s probably because realloc doesn t need to search for a new memory block it just uses the previous one and shrinks it

39563643
ionic	angular
android studio graddle 2.1.3 issue and ionic build android failed with 403 http respose from gradle java_home not valid and you seem to have installed ionic 2.0 which uses angular 2.0
this issue appears if you meant to use ionic 1.0 but have ionic cli for 2.0

39565435
required	placeholder
a pointer to a member function as a predicate isn t suitable since it required an object to be called on so you ll need a wrapper to bind the member function to an object and make it callable with just the two values to compare
in c++11 you can bind a member function to an object you can use placeholder in bind

39569252
punctuation	words
not using regular expressions test output long sentence with spaces and punctuation too
and supercalifragilisticexpialidocious words

39573472
prepare	execute
you can avoid this by using prepare statements
given the limited amount of data my best guess would be that they do both execute but that they re not doing what you think they should be doing

39577646
bottle	flask
you won t have access to bottle syntax or the parameters passed to templates etc but you won t have to actually run a separate server either
bottle doesn t have some of the testing niceties that flask has see here

39577646
bottle	flask
bottle doesn t have some of the testing niceties that flask has see here
but bottle recommends using a wsgi testing tools along with a regular unit testing framework

39580750
intersect	contains
if you re just wanting to know if the lines intersect you check if given the basic intuition just being that since you have the equations for point where the segments intersect as you can t divide by 0
if the lines that contains the line segments do intersect somewhere not contains in the range of the line segments you check something like so the condition should look something like if you want a crude way of deriving the above equations for x and y you start with the equations of the 2 line segments and solve the system

39582041
swift	objective-c
second if you want to use imported objective-c method from swift you d better check the generated header of the method
press the four square icon and choose generated interface while editor is showing the .h file. tested with a small sample project your method is imported as the corresponding type to int in swift is int32 not int . so you may need to pass a mutable pointer to tuple int32 int32 to do that you need to declare a swift array of element type int32 int32 and pass it as an inout argument using

39582554
swift	objective-c
working with swift 2.3 in xcode 8 would force you a bunch of efforts xcode 8 may suggest swift 3 version of method templates apple does not provide swift 2 version of references.
to implement delegate method in swift 2.3 you need check the objective-c version of the method and think how swift 2 imports it by yourself

39583529
floating-point	fractions
c has no floating-point type smaller than float
there are several integer types that are likely but not guaranteed to be smaller than float signed char unsigned char signed short unsigned short of course the unsigned types can t hold negative values and none of then can hold fractions values

39583813
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
until then your simplest or maybe i should say least-confusing method for dealing with this issue is to use or borrow a case-sensitive system such as a linux machine deal with the colliding branches there in all the usual ways and update them from there to the server
if that s not available there is a relatively simple way to fix this particular problem on a case-insensitive mac or windows client

39588911
profiling	debugging
then you install this third framework in the codesigning phase xcode will search the non-existing codesign identity or privisioning profiling for this framework then it failed
older answer is wrong i got the same problem here i have five project and the four of them can not debugging on device and only one can debugging on device

39589499
division	subtract
let s write a011 to denote a number that ends with bits 011 and has a set of prefixed bits that would represent the value a a001 adding one would give a010 after which a division should occur a01 2 steps taken
we would not want to subtract one now because that would lead to a00 which we could have arrived at in two steps from the start subtract 1 and divide

39589499
subtraction	addition
so addition is at least as good as subtraction
there is however one case not to overlook if a is 0 then the subtraction path reaches the solution half-way in 2 steps while the addition path takes 3 steps

39589499
subtraction	addition
there is however one case not to overlook if a is 0 then the subtraction path reaches the solution half-way in 2 steps while the addition path takes 3 steps
so addition is always leading to the solution except when n is 3 then subtraction should be chosen

39595273
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome web store doesn t have any comparable policy
firefox extensions are usually not limited in what they can do only extensions based on the webextensions framework are sandboxed - currently the majority of firefox extensions is still either classic xul-based extensions or based on the add-on sdk these don t have inherent restrictions

implements	extends
at work we used the lifecycle hooks to register unregister event that are not implements in ember
we used the didinsertelement and willdestroyelement lifecycle hooks to bind unbind jquery events to a specific namespace often the components id code example an alternative way could be a service which extends ember.evented

strdup	malloc	strcpy	strdup
additionally if you have strdup then it is much more convenient than strlen + malloc + strcpy with identical result including the same obligation to free the allocated storage when you no longer need it
if you do not have strdup and you need to make dynamically-allocated copies of strings then you should consider writing it

ubuntu	linux
so your code may works on this distro and does not work on others or even in ubuntu server which requires the mounting progress should be done manually
i can suggest you research tutorial like this to understand how to work with usb flash drive on linux first

swift	objective-c
protocol extensions and objective-c first this question answer can swift method defined on extensions on protocols accessed in objective-c seems to suggest that because of the way protocol extensions are dispatched under the hood methods declared in protocol extensions are not visible to the objc_msgsend function and therefore are not visible to objective-c code
since the method you are trying to define in your extension needs to be visible to objective-c so uikit can use it it yells at you for not including objective-c but once you do include it it yells at you because objective-c is not allowed in protocol extensions

39604189
swift	objective-c
if you choose to go this route please take this question swift 3 objective-c optional protocol method not called in subclass into account
it appears that another current issue in swift 3 is that subclasses do not automatically inherited the optional protocol requirement implementations of their superclass

39604189
swift	objective-c
it appears that another current issue in swift 3 is that subclassing do not automatically inherited the optional protocol requirement implementations of their superclass
the answer to that questions uses a special adaption of objective-c to get around it

39604189
swift	objective-c
since your protocol is in the same module as your extension however you may be able to do this in a future version of swift
update 2 in february 2017 this issue was officially closed as won t do by one of the swift core team members with the following message this is intentional protocol extensions cannot introduce objective-c entry points due to limitations of the objective-c runtime

39605815
dictionary	map
slightly nicer for mass-conversions than repeated dictionary lookup is using operator.itemgetter from future_builtins import map # only on py2 to get lazy generator based map from operator import itemgetter for name phone_number in map itemgetter name phone_number j print name phone_number if you needed to look up individual things as needed so you didn t always need name or phone_number then regular dictionary lookups would make sense this just optimizes the case where you re always retrieving the same set of items by pushing work to builtin functions which on the cpython reference interpreter are implemented in c so they run a bit faster than hand-rolled code
using a generator based map isn t strictly necessary but it avoids making potentially large temporary list s when you re just going to iterate the result anyway

39608201
persistent	transient
if you have an attribute in your class that you did not intend to have persistent
you must mark any such non-persistent fields using the transient annotation or element

union	distinct
union isn t going to get you what you want
it s purpose it to join the results of 2 or more queries together keeping the distinct values

profiling	instrumentation
2.this will not work for applications that are signed with a distribution cert 3.if you have created the app with a developer provisioning profiling and built yourself
or downloaded it using testflight and is signed with a development provisioning profiling 4.this is because apple s instrumentation will not allow you to interact with those applications which is live

39614092
swift	objective-c
in swift there is no need to create the backing storage and you can use the property observer didset to change the background color or you could use a computed property and not have storage for active at all you can read more about property observers and computed properties here
your code looks like objective-c

39616652
activemq	rabbitmq
they are two completely different protocols and only the latter is a iso iec standard supported by the main open sources products like activemq and artemis brokers qpid proton clients and qpid dispatch router
products like rabbitmq support amqp 0.x only with a plugin the version 1.0 . the big difference is that the amqp 0.x defines the way a broker should be developed and have concepts like exchanges queues and bindings. no information about it in the amqp 1.0 which is an application protocol on top of tcp ip providing more abstraction and not specifying the way a broker should be developed. the first big difference with mqtt is that amqp 1.0 is a peer-to-peer protocol you can use it between two peers no need for a broker in the middle

39621806
spaces	delimiter
well you can split only at the first spaces but then you ll run into trouble with names like john steven murphy where the last name is just murphy. then there are names like gerard van der sanden or angelina de la vega and such where there is not just one spaces but two in the family name
bottom-line it s always going to be wrong for certain inputs if you don t have a clear delimiter

39634362
git-svn	svn2git
from you question i see that you are not using this svn2git but the ruby one that is based on git-svn which is not the right tool for one-time conversions of repositories or repository parts
it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn

39634362
git-svn	svn2git
even though git-svn is easier to start with here are some further reasons why using the kde svn2git instead of git-svn is superior besides its flexibility the history is rebuilt much better and cleaner by svn2git if the correct one is used this is especially the case for more complex histories with branches and merges and so on the tags are real tags and not branches in git with git-svn the tags contain an extra empty commit which also makes them not part of the branches so a normal fetch will not get them until you give --tags to the command as by default only tags pointing to fetched branches are fetched also
with the proper svn2git tags are where they belong if you changed layout in svn you can easily configure this with svn2git with git-svn you will loose history eventually with svn2git you can also split one svn repository into multiple git repositories easily or combine multiple svn repositories in the same svn root into one git repository easily the conversion is a gazillion times faster with the correct svn2git than with git-svn there are many reasons why git-svn is worse and the kde svn2git is superior

hex	binary
or better use ... think of it like a number - the number sixteen is the same number whether you represent it in binary as 10000 decimal as 16 or hex as 0x10
an int value doesn t have any concept of i m a binary integer or i m a hex integer - it s only when you convert it to a string that you need to care about formatting

39641592
super	extends
so when jackson code try to get the method field from my connection instance super instance of javax.net.ssl.httpsurlconnection here we get a nosuchfieldexception stating that a field named method doesn t exist since getdeclaredfields brings all the fields regardless of their accessibility but only for the current class not any base classes that the current class might be inheriting from
so i looked into java s httpurlconnection code and saw that the allowed methods are specified by an private static string the solution was to change this methods array using reflection since methods field is static changing its value works for any concrete instance that is extends httpurlconnection including httpsurlconnection

uiview	calayer
a uiview is not a calayer you cannot add an avplayerlayer to the storyboard
instead after your view has loaded programmatically add your avplayer s playerlayer to the uiview s layer

39643307
translation	localization
default messages like this field is required etc are appearing in spanish now i want to translation the above message to spanish but i cannot find where and how to define the translation text
including the spanish localization file simply tells the plugin to replace the default messages as defined by the spanish localization file

39643326
jsonb	hstore
if you still wonder whether mongodb will be better choice for you needs check jsonb support introduced in 9.4 version of postgres which is real data type with binary storage and indexing a structured format for storing json according to my interpretation of the above source you should use json or jsonb if you already using postgresql 9.4+ or no inhibiting factor to change to 9.4+
although it directly does not answer your question how to persist hashes in rails application with postgresql stated about hstore json and jsonb although it may not be a common case to store other types than string in a dictionary it is still worth to have in mind that hstore supports only string data

39643554
bellman-ford	dijkstra
an efficient alternative for bellman-ford is directed acyclic graph dag which uses topological sorting
the only difference is that dijkstra s algorithm cannot handle negative edge weights which bellman-ford handles.and bellman-ford also tells us whether the graph contains negative cycle. if graph doesn t contain negative edges then dijkstra s is always better

39645319
shadowing	named
shadowing is when you create a new binding that uses the same named as a previous binding
this shadows the original named which hides it but doesn t change or replace it

39645429
shadowing	named
however you cannot use in the second case the initialization does not use the function argument to initialize the shadowing variable
it is as bad as avoid all these hassles by using different named for the variable and the argument

viewdidload	viewdidappear
xcode8 therefor when is called in viewdidload the frame size of calculatebutton might not be correct and you might end up with a too big a corner radius which ends up in an invisible image after viewdidappear
try adding self.view.layoutifneeded before setting the cornerradius or calling the code in viewdidappear

39661255
super	extends
alternatively you can override the boolean ondependentviewchanged method from your custom behavior copy the isbottomsheet static method present in the floatingactionbutton.behavior class and only call return the value of the super method if it s not a bottom sheet
you can further customize the default behavior this way or by extends the vanilla coordinatorlayout.behavior class directly and you can cherry pick code to copy paste from the floatingactionbutton.behavior class if needed

39662751
keras	tensorflow
luckily it seems that this issue is fixed in the master branch of keras
this is a problem with keras not tensorflow and a known issue . a workaround is mentioned here but that would mean that you have to modify keras code keras backend tensorflow_backend.py

39672161
swift	objective-c
sadly it s an nsexception which swift cannot handle directly see references below
you need to first write a wrapper to handle objective-c exceptions in objective-c and bridge it over to swift inspired by this answer now you can catch the exception in swift references using objectivec with swift adopting cocoa design patterns although swift error handling resembles exception handling in objective-c it is entirely separate functionality

39675116
realloc	malloc
realloc has additional logic to deal with situations when the size need to shrink but in your situation this does not apply
if you are not allowed to use realloc but malloc and free are allowed you can replace the call with the following less efficient sequence internally realloc does the same thing but it does so more efficiently

39675116
realloc	malloc
if you are not allowed to use realloc but malloc and free are allowed you can replace the call with the following less efficient sequence internally realloc does the same thing but it does so more efficiently
unlike user program realloc knows the actual size of the dynamic memory chunk so it checks if to avoid reallocation

39675429
inline	inlining
for example inlining every function call may loop the compiler if the function being inline is not constrained somehow. without digging into the theory in order to be always sure that our compiler won t loop we can only allow primitive bounded recursion
what you probably means by recursion is general recursion that cannot be achieved by inlining we can show that we need an infinite amount of memory for gr and that is the demarcation between pr and gr not having a stack

39677131
punctuation	words
you can take a naive approach using preg_split to split your string on any separator punctuation or control character
preg_split example output this works fine for your given string but does not necessarily split words in a way that is locale-aware

39681157
ionic	angular
edit i said it was an angular thing but it s a ui-router thing but i think ionic uses ui-router by default
the best way to do this is probably an ui-router thing not an ionic thing put it in a run block that will run when your app instantiates

39681646
tvos	ios
my observation is that ios 10 tvos 10 is not laying out auto layout based views before calling awakefromnib but is laying out views using autoresizing masks before calling the same method
i have faced the same issue on moving to tvos 10

direct3d	directx
the information in the article directx - using xaml with directx and c++ in windows store apps all applies to mixing direct3d 11 or direct3d 12 with xaml
it s not clear why you d want to write your level editor with directx 12

39686726
bash	subshell
command substitution does not inherit errexit except on bash 4.4 with inherit_errexit but it does inherit a err trap with errtrace
so you can use the trap to exit the subshell on error and use local or some other means to avoid exiting the parent shell

39688370
postgresql	mysql
since you ve indicated that you are free to choose the rdbms but it must run under linux i m going to throw postgresql out there as a suggestion since it has this feature and is freely available
this choice is of course very subjective and there are advantages and disadvantages of each but a few other contenders i d be tempted to rule out are mysql since it doesn t currently support ctes mariadb since it doesn t currently support recursive ctes sql server since it doesn t currently support linux

39688913
division	subtraction
the modulo has the same precedence as multiplication and division
in this case - is the unary negation operator not subtraction and it binds tightly to the 8 literal as it has a very high precedence

39690709
punctuation	words
and also do not return punctuation
although cumbersome in formulas this can be handling by - replacing all of the punctuation with space - adding a space at the beginning and end of the sentence - adding a space at the beginning and end of each words in list - adjusting the formula to not return the extra space

punctuation	words
although cumbersome in formulas this can be handling by - replacing all of the punctuation with space - adding a space at the beginning and end of the sentence - adding a space at the beginning and end of each words in list - adjusting the formula to not return the extra space
the above can be done most simply by modifying the defined name list and also by using a defined name for a formula to do the punctuation replacement and space prefix and suffix

39692697
fgets	getline
instead you should read an entire line using fgets or posix getline if available and then parse that line if necessary with sscanf
note that fgets can leave a newline at the end of the string so you must strip that off. perhaps beating a dead horse your usage of scanf is also unsafe because you do not limit the amount of data that it can write to charstudent1firstname and consequently a user could easily overflow the destination buffer

fgets	getline
note that fgets can leave a newline at the end of the string so you must strip that off. perhaps beating a dead horse your usage of scanf is also unsafe because you do not limit the amount of data that it can write to charstudent1firstname and consequently a user could easily overflow the destination buffer
while it s possible to jump through some hoops to use scanf safely when reading strings using fgets getline would avoid these problems

39693535
super	implements
otherwise you re a little off for cases where you need to do further initialization class pendingemail templates def __init__ self super pendingemail self .__init__ # name your own class not the superclass
if you don t need to add anything to the __init__ for the subclassing just don t implements it and they ll inherit it automatically

39696162
profiling	debugging
may be here what causes it and possible solution may be it s because you are either using your ad hoc or distribution provisioning profiling when debugging your iphone application on your device or you specified a code signing entitlements property list in your build settings which does not include a get-task-allow or can be debugged property
so use development profiling rather than your distribution profiling when debugging your iphone application on the device

39696977
bower	npm
firstly bower does not treat symlinks as it should
instead of treating a symlinked npm module as being in its symlinked position it takes its actual position in the filesystem and hence can t find its dependencies under the flat file-tree of npm3

it doesn t support to use a build outside vsts
it only supports to choose a tfs build

39700150
implements	extends
casting is almost trivial in that it only verifies that the given object extends some class or implements an interface - it does not change the object itself
in your case if func stands for a lambda expression or a method reference the lambdametafactory guarantees that the generated lambda object really implements runnable and serializable and the cast might even get optimized away

39702726
onresume	onpause
for example if you are using this a fragment register it in the onresume and unregister in the ondestroy
also if you are directing user to the settings to enable the location switch unregistering in the onstop will not function since your activity goes to onpause and fragment is stopped

daemons	systemd
what constitutes a well-behaved unix daemons is better explained elsewhere but to summarize close open file descriptors typically all of them but some applications may need to protect some descriptors from closure change the working directory for the process to a suitable location to prevent directory busy errors change the file access creation mask os.umask in the python world move the application into the background and make it dissociate itself from the initiating process completely divorce from the terminal including redirecting stdin stdout and stderr to different streams often devnull and prevent reacquisition of a controlling terminal handle signals in particular sigterm
the reality of the situation is that windows as an operating systemd really doesn t support the notion of a daemons applications that start from a terminal or in any other interactive context including launchd from explorer etc will continue to run with a visible window unless the controlling application in this example python has included a windowless gui

long story short i set out to try and find something that allows me to run the exact same application code on both unix and windows while fulfilling the expectations for a well-behaved unix daemons which is better explained elsewhere as best as possible on both platforms close open file descriptors typically all of them but some applications may need to protect some descriptors from closure change the working directory for the process to a suitable location to prevent directory busy errors change the file access creation mask os.umask in the python world move the application into the background and make it dissociate itself from the initiating process completely divorce from the terminal including redirecting stdin stdout and stderr to different streams often devnull and prevent reacquisition of a controlling terminal handle signals in particular sigterm
the fundamental problem with cross-platform daemonization is that windows as an operating systemd really doesn t support the notion of a daemons applications that start from a terminal or in any other interactive context including launchd from explorer etc will continue to run with a visible window unless the controlling application in this example python has included a windowless gui

39716260
google-chrome	firefox
when you turn on caps lock google-chrome handles the turn on as a keypress and when you turn off it handles it as a keyup
but firefox handles everything as keydown which doesn t make sense to me when compared to how google-chrome handles the same

39721728
vmware	virtualbox
so you can change to vmware but you have some additional fees you do not use nfs you can setup another network interface for bridge and use this network interface if you need to connect to the remote machine you should be able to ping ping -i ethx mylocalmachine but i am not sure how to work to get connection in
you need to change your public_network to private_network for nfs to work if you are using the virtualbox provider you will also need to make sure you have a private network set up

39722149
google-chrome	safari
you can stop google-chrome from displaying it like this unfortunately this doesn t work throughout all webkit browsers
safari will show the ligature anyway

39723250
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
runtimeexception and errors are unchecked-exception quote unchecked-exception do not need to be declared in a method or constructor s throws clause .
they propagate outside the method or constructor boundary runtimeexception are caused by bad programming and should be fixed by adequate check for null or array size etc

39724819
equals	gethashcode
calling gethashcode for two instances that are equals should always produce the same result
hence if the result of calling gethashcode is not the same for both instances then they cannot be equals and so it s unnecessary to do a more-detailed and more expensive comparison

39724819
equals	gethashcode
hence if the result of calling gethashcode is not the same for both instances then they cannot be equals and so it s unnecessary to do a more-detailed and more expensive comparison
on the other hand if both instances have the same hash code then a more detailed comparison is necessary to determine whether they are in fact equal. so unless you re re-defining what equals means for your class you probably don t need to worry about gethashcode

39728162
set	bag
think of a set as a bag full of items
the items are not in any particular order in the bag and when you stick your hand in and grab an item you never know which one you get first

39730517
ionic	angular
the latest beta of ionic uses rc4 of angular 2 but rumors say the rc version of ionic is just around the corner with angularconnect event
since ionic 2 builds upon angular 2 it seems viable to suggest to just wait for ionic 2 to integrate the final version of angular 2 if youre not working on a production app right now

39734093
google-chrome	safari
the string is built to google-chrome 53.0.2785.116 mobile in getshelluseragent then in builduseragentfromproduct product is not used and passed on to builduseragentfromosandproduct which is supposed to format a string as such
mozilla 5.0 s applewebkit d. d khtml like gecko s safari d. d the product string is inserted into token four where the fourth replacement token is before safari

39736036
google-chrome	firefox
here is the manifest.json file i used to test this as both a google-chrome extension and as a firefox webextension note this manifest.json uses the same options.html as both an options_ui page and a browser_action popup
if your code is using only non-chrome api basic html + javascript which yours is and it does not work in a regular browser page environment then it is not going to work in a google-chrome extension options page or popup

39736931
ssl	https
you have to have an ssl certificate installed in your hosting account for the domain skydental.in in order to correctly use the https protocol
the http protocol is not secure and doesn t need the security authentication of an ssl certificate

39736951
hive	hdfs
this is the sort of low-key way of ingesting data from restful to hdfs and then you use hive analytics to implement the business logic.i hope you are familiar with core java map reduce if not you might look into hortonworks data flow hdf which is a product of hortonworks
step 1 your data ingestion workflow should not be tied to your hive workflow that contains business logic

39737745
rvm	bundler
after that try rvm use ruby-2.2 or whatever and if you don t get rvm is not a function error then you should be good to go
note that under rvm you ll probably have to do gem install bundler manually for each distinct ruby version and gemset because ruby and gemsets under rvm live in their own worlds and system bundler tends to be old

39737745
rvm	bundler
note that under rvm you ll probably have to do gem install bundler manually for each distinct ruby version and gemset because ruby and gemsets under rvm live in their own worlds and system bundler tends to be old
if you re reusing ruby installations and either not using or sharing gemsets bundler may already be up to date

39745871
daemons	systemd
the point is when u use gradle wrapper it will start a new daemons for every project even if they are with the same version you can stop using gradle wrapper by one change in android studio so it uses systemd gradle daemons not using wrapper and running a new daemons for each project you need to go to settings - build execution deployment - build tools - gradle then check the radio button use local gradle distribution and address the gradle home field to the systemd gradle_home installation
though you need to have already gradle installed on your systemd

39748222
profiling	benchmarking
benchmarking mode cnt score error units varargs.inlinenonstatic avgt 20 9 606 0 076 ns op varargs.inlinestatic avgt 20 9 604 0 040 ns op varargs.loopnonstatic avgt 20 14 188 0 154 ns op varargs.loopstatic avgt 20 14 147 0 059 ns op however gc profiling indicates that vararg array is allocated for methods but not for methods

39756996
spaces	delimiter
note the python white spaces delimiter are not going to spaces correctly in this stackoverflow comment editor the library file or fa√ßade file containing classes methods or functions you want to import
to import code from another file in the same directory spaces you add a reference to it

39757317
oncreate	setcontentview
the next step is to implement the oncreate method mentioned in the docs
given that you are not going to interact with the user interface you can simply call setcontentview using an empty layout

39758839
google-chrome	firefox
if you replace selector .roundb hover to .p1 hover .roundb this will works the same like now on google-chrome
firefox is only accept hover on button not see elements inside button tag

39759455
draggable	droppable
so draggable by itself would not accomplish what you needed
you need droppable to be able to action things when the dragged item is dropped

39763757
noexcept	throw
according to cppreference note that a noexcept specification on a function is not a compile-time check
it is merely a method for a programmer to inform the compiler whether or not a function should throw exceptions

39764654
tvos	ios
but watchos tvos and xcode are not included in apple s public betas
the public xcode 8 release does not support ios 10.1 beta

39766945
stateless	stateful
stateless components are simple reusable components which do not need to maintain state
here is a short demo showing you how you can create them and how they can access props passed from the parent stateful component

39771199
boost	eigen
while you re at it you should also try the intel compiler which might provide a decent performance boost by itself if you set the correct flags -o3 -xhost -ipo
since tensorflow uses eigen try to use an mkl enabled version of eigen as described here define the eigen_use_mkl_all macro before including any eigen s header link your program to mkl libraries see the mkl linking advisor on a 64bits system you must use the lp64 interface not the ilp64 one so one way to do it is to follow the above steps to modify the source of tensorflow recompile and install on your machine

39771930
union	distinct
if the union is a standard-layout union the address of the union itself is the same as the address of its first non-static member and therefore all of them
if not it is interconvertible with static_cast . if a type has_unique_object_representations it is trivially-copyable and no two distinct values share the same object representation

39773229
google-chrome	safari
the g global regex flag is useless while the i case insensitive can be useful no need for capture parenthesis we are just testing the string i m just using this since getting true for mobile google-chrome is ok for me same behavior iphone|ipad|ipod i.test navigator.useragent i just want to detect if the device is a target for an ios app
seeing all the answers here are some tips about the proposed regexes applewebkit matches desktop safari too not only mobile no need to call .match more than once for such simple regexes and prefer the lighter .test method

39777515
rsa	aes
however you are using rsa
usually rsa is not used for encrypting multiple blocks it is used for encrypting one block for encrypting one aes key

39777515
rsa	aes
usually rsa is not used for encrypting multiple blocks it is used for encrypting one block for encrypting one aes key
afair rsa even refuses to encrypt more than one block

39786471
apache	nginx
obviously apache is transforming es to es before applying the rewrite
nginx will not do that unless the directory actually exists

39786483
vb6	vba
the explorer shell doesn t really expose this capability in any other manner though at least not before windows vista and then not in any fashion easily used from vb6 programs or vba macros
your best bet is a 3rd party activex library but be careful about 64-bit vba hosts where you ll need a 64-bit version of such a library

39786484
ffmpeg	libav
an ffmpeg build with threads and a later version than libavcodec_version_major 55 libavcodec_version_minor 38 and libavcodec_version_micro 100 - roughly about october 2013 see ffmpeg commit adding default lockmgr will have a default lock manager that you can just use
if you need to be compatible with libav then at the time of writing september 2016 this does not yet have a default lock manager and you need to provide your own

39787334
implements	extends
now in your second example you have a class webdriver not an interface and that class doesn t implements takesscreenshot so you can t cast it to that type
in your first example webdriver is an interface - and interface that doesn t extends takesscreenshot

39790208
google-chrome	firefox
the google-chrome execute indefinitely instead of one time because your function always return the focus to the input text and always you change the focus your function will be call
in firefox works well because the input text does not receive the focus in the end of the javascript function. if you remove input_text.focus

39791451
sudo	passwd
hence you don t need to supply your privileged user with a sudo passwd
turns out that for almost all vagrant boxes the vagrant user is listed in etc sudoers with permissions which instructs linux to not ask that user for a sudo passwd ever

39793634
spaces	delimiter
you re splitting on bbb when you should be splitting on the spaces character
your delimiter string will not show up on your result array

39797334
union	distinct
this may be a case where this re-write gives you the performance that you want select id from words where words.text like word1 union select id from words where words.text like another union select id from words where words.text like third
notes the distinct is not needed because of the union

39801964
awt	swing
in other words if you paint-from-outside you ll need to write not only the code that does the painting but also re-implement heaps of code already implemented by the awt swing which deals with the circumstances when the component needs to be re painted
disable somehow the awt swing native handling of painting

39805012
scheme	prolog
a good indexing scheme may prevent the creation of choice points that other systems introduce
a notion that depends on particular idiosyncrasies of a specific prolog system and may break from one version to the next with the introduction of better argument indexing etc. is not very robust and not of much value

39805864
punctuation	words
you can instead use string.punctuation to check for any punctuation in your words
str objects do not have a punctuation attribute

39809959
super	self
unfortunately we can t do this for constants before super is called so those we would need to set up in each method
the reason being is that self does not fully exist yet

39810679
lisp	scheme
you tried cond ... which would work in scheme but not in common lisp
in common lisp you need to do

39811745
rsa	aes
in general you would not use rsa for bulk encryption as it s quite slow but would instead combine it with a symmetric encryption like aes
you would then encrypt the data with a random aes key and then encrypt the aes key with the rsa key

39811908
hive	hdfs
try below it is assumed that your hive table is created as a external table and your data is located at myhivetable data fields are terminated by | and lines are terminated by n
in you rdbms table the 20 columns which are not going to be populated from hive hdfs should have default values or allow null values

39811908
hive	hdfs
in you rdbms table the 20 columns which are not going to be populated from hive hdfs should have default values or allow null values
let us suppose your database columns are dc1 dc2 d4 dc5 ....d20 and hive columns are c1 c2 c3 c3 ......c10 and your mapping is as below

39815988
hive	hdfs
in that case you could create a new hive table titles and specify the location of the data using something like this this way you wouldn t need to re-import the whole data again since it s already in hdfs
as amit has pointed out since you already created the hdfs directory in your first command sqoop refuses to overwrite the folder titles since it already contains data

39815988
hive	hdfs
in your second command you are telling sqoop to import once again the whole table which was already imported in the first command into hive
since you are not specifying the --target-dir with the hdfs destination sqoop will try to create the folder titles under user root

39815988
hive	hdfs
when you tell hive to show the tables titles doesn t appear because the second command with hive-import was not successful and hive doesn t know anything about the data
when you add the flag --hive-import what sqoop does under the hood is update the hive metastore which is a database that has the metadata of the hive tables partitions and hdfs location

39817093
scheme	racket
these redirect stdio stdout stderr from to file or pipe to another program and not scheme source code to be run
this works with both racket and ikarus note that there are lots of other scheme implementations conforming to r5rs r6rs and even r7rs that does this as well

39817921
inline	inlining
these include functions with reified types since the inlining creates the availability of type information and functions with lambdas as parameters since they can affect the control flow of the method they are inline in
i don t believe it is possible to turn off inlining since some functions may not make any sense if they are not inline

39819210
uicontrol	uibutton
and the method for action target can take only three forms uicontrol listing 1 action method definitions ibaction func dosomething ibaction func dosomething _ sender uibutton ibaction func dosomething _ sender uibutton forevent event uievent i added _ before sender but it is not mandatory just you need to create a consistent selector
uibutton can be any appropriate uicontrol subclass or just any if you do not think of what it should be

39821372
nunit	mstest
if you try to use an mstest assert in your tests and your test fails nunit will not recognize the exception thrown as an assertion exception so it will report it as an error as opposed to a test failure
you likely ended up with both test frameworks because you created a unit test project in visual studio then added nunit to it

39822398
innodb	myisam
more with innodb i suggest to cut back significantly on the i o caused by 1000 separate inserts per second
use innodb not myisam

39825582
bower	npm
consequently bower isn t as much a module loader as a module bundler bower is entirely a build-time tool producing a bundle of code which can then be loaded client-side
start with a build machine that has node npm installed and get the package npm install -g save-dev bower write your modules in commonjs format and when happy issue the command to bundle bower entry-point.js -o bundle-name.js bower recursively finds all dependencies of entry-point and assembles them into a single file webpack it bundles all of your static assets including javascript images css and more into a single file

39832653
realloc	malloc
the solution in the original question suffers from a fundamental problem when you pass a pointer to a section of memory to a function and the pointer reallocates that memory using malloc or calloc or realloc the new memory has a new address
this is true even with realloc because there might not be enough contiguous bytes at the old location to allocate the requested memory

39833904
shadowing	named
if i include using namespace std in x.h however the shadowing doesn t occur and the program compiles just fine
this much i can answer from 7.3.4 2-3 first a using-directive specifies that the named in the nominated namespace can be used in the scope in which the using-directive appears after the using-directive

39837248
scrypt	md5
bcrypt and scrypt are suseptible to attacks with longer passwords i don t know about argon2
so there can be a virtue in using a pre-hash although not necessarily md5

39839952
vsts	tfs
there you can select and copy all test cases including steps expected results and other test case fields and paste them into the equivalent view in the vsts project
create a powershell script that gets all the test cases from your on-premises tfs and copies them into vsts. below you can find a snippet. caveat i have not tested it extensively so usual disclaimers apply

39841764
hex	binary
longer answer actually that is not the correct way to convert hex to base64
hexadecimal and base64 are just different ways of representing a binary value

39842607
git-svn	svn2git
git-svn is not the right tool for one-time conversions of repositories or repository parts
it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case

39842607
git-svn	svn2git
it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case
there are pleny tools called svn2git the probably best one is the kde one from

39842607
git-svn	svn2git
even though git-svn is easier to start with here are some further reasons why using the kde svn2git instead of git-svn is superior besides its flexibility the history is rebuilt much better and cleaner by svn2git if the correct one is used this is especially the case for more complex histories with branches and merges and so on the tags are real tags and not branches in git with git-svn the tags contain an extra empty commit which also makes them not part of the branches so a normal fetch will not get them until you give --tags to the command as by default only tags pointing to fetched branches are fetched also
with the proper svn2git tags are where they belong if you changed layout in svn you can easily configure this with svn2git with git-svn you will loose history eventually with svn2git you can also split one svn repository into multiple git repositories easily or combine multiple svn repositories in the same svn root into one git repository easily the conversion is a gazillion times faster with the correct svn2git than with git-svn there are many reasons why git-svn is worse and the kde svn2git is superior

39849930
google-chrome	firefox
so my google-chrome s output is the error is in the possition the file s js code was going to be executed
but firefox some times outputs this so the first error is the 404 error that the file was not found but because firefox tried to run the file in the right order a while later the same message was printed for debugging propuses i suppose

39855433
daemons	systemd
when starting mongodb with sudo port load mongodb the daemons will run as a dedicated systemd user
the daemons process has no connection to your personal user account and will therefore not be shut down when you log out

39856490
swift	objective-c
you get this error since upgrading to swift 3 because slacktextviewcontroller is written in objective-c
since swift 3 the objective-c type id is now imported as any not anyobject

39856490
swift	objective-c
since swift 3 the objective-c type id is now imported as any not anyobject
so when you are calling super.didpressrightbutton sender with a sender of type anyobject swift compiler can t find the method you are referring to

39857283
calloc	malloc
the function that allocates memory and initializes it to zero is calloc
it s the same for c++ and c malloc does not zero-out the memory but calloc does

39857976
division	modulo	division	multiplication
example 333333336 being the multiplicative inverse of 3 modulo 1000000007 the raison d etre for this topic was that integer division is potentially lossy since it drops the remainder if any and so the result of the pyramidal square calculation would be wrong if the wrong factor were divided by 3
modular division - multiplication with the multiplicative inverse - is not lossy and so it doesn t matter which of the factors gets multiplied with the inverse

39857976
division	modulo	division	multiplication	multiplication	modulo
hence the crux of the matter is that the final product be evenly divisible by the divisor but it doesn t matter when and where the division multiplication with the inverse occurs
the resulting code is slightly less efficient than v1 and roughly on par with v2 because it requires an additional reduction modulo m after the multiplication with the inverse

39858308
cvs	svn
you will not have database constraints but similar functionality can be implemented through git svn cvs triggers
you will not have strong transactions but similar functionality can be implemented through git svn cvs triggers

39862393
libstdc++	libc++
op s comment makes it clear that this is clang and libc++ that they are using not gcc libstdc++
a quick look at libc++ s random_shuffle implementation shows that it uses an object of type __rs_default as its source of randomness and inspecting the implementation of __rs_default shows that it simply uses a default-constructed std mt19937 object in other words in this implementation srand has no effect whatsoever on the source of randomness used by the two-parameter version of random_shuffle

39864690
build.gradle	gradlew
check your build.gradle file
the error messages seems gradlew cannot find androidmanifest.xml file in which it should be placed

39868228
ssl	https
the other thing is when you don t want to use ssl but i d say it s rather a special case when you are worried about request integrity but not about confidentiality
anyway if you are in a situation where you do in fact need to maintain integrity in another way besides or instead of https you could give your client a secret and sign requests with that secret like for example using hmac or another message authentication protocol

39869576
gridview	repeater
then you forgot to mention that the target of drag is the rectangle drag.target parent here is the code after correcting then you shouldn t use a gridview because you want elements to be move
if you use a repeater it works and you just have to set x and y in the rectangle to place the elements at the beginning

39871143
floating-point	fractions
js does not distinguish between numbers with and without a fractions part they all have the same floating-point type
there is only one grammar for decimal number literals with fractions digits and exponents being optional

39874402
ssl	https
ok - found it out dokku runs internally nginx 1.8 without ssl support
proxy_pass to https therefore cannot work

39878299
nunit	mstest
it is possible with nunit to achieve this using testcasesource there is also a nuget package to extend mstest to include this functionality i have also read they are going to be adding this feature to mstest it is currently in preview and possibly only supports uwp and desktop apps
i m pretty sure this isn t possible with mstest you can currently only hook up datasource with a connection string to a datasource eg

39880290
rsa	aes
before api23 additional steps are required first generate an rsa key in the androidkeystore then generate an random aes key outside of the androidkeystore as aes inside is not supported
then encrypt the generated aes key with the rsa key you have generated in the androidkeystore and save the encrypted aes key into the private app data directory

39880517
tiff	png
then in an openlayers map using v3.18.2 i used the following function to successfully add a png as an ol.layer.image but it failed without notice for the tiff
i agree with chrki that it is not currently possible to display a tiff or geotiff in an openlayers map as stated here

39881169
multiplying	addition	multiplying	modulo	addition	modulo
in your particular case we can simplify it to only use the operations that you have which are multiplying modulo addition
technically modulo isn t really standardized in where it is ordered but i think most languages have modulo as the same as multiplying divide so a safe bet is to order it that way

39884901
scrollable	panels
apart from the appearance panels is scrollable whereas groupbox isn t and groupbox has a caption whereas a panels doesn t
panels is scrollable groupbox is not

39884901
scrollable	panels
panels is scrollable groupbox is not
panels allows drop groupbox don t

39904186
bash	zsh
some shells support similar features bash supports most but not bare subscripts
strings may be ordered in zsh in a similar manner but the math-context brackets and would have to be replaced with normal test brackets and and the array might have to be defined with special typeset options to make the strings compare in the desired manner

39908852
equals	gethashcode
also notice that the equals function is incorrect
you are comparing on reference not on the actual values you use in the gethashcode

39918826
swift	objective-c
hello swift developer i m not sure what you mean with swift - objective-c
you can still build apps with objective-c in the xcode 8 version and you can also open old objective-c code with xcode 8

39923025
prng	random
random by default uses a pseudo random number generator prng called mersenne twister mt which although suitable for applications such as simulations and minor things like picking from a list of paths shouldn t be used in areas where security is a concern due to the fact that it is deterministic
this is why python 3.6 also introduces secrets.py with pep 506 which uses systemrandom urandom by default and is capable of producing cryptographically secure pseudo random numbers

39923116
textview	imageview
just change the order first textview then imageview in the xml p.s. is unnecessary because thats not your project
because in the first one this line android layout_above id textview refers to an element textview that has not been read yet from the xml parser

39926048
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
currently we have 3 4 major js engines in the field v8 in google-chrome opera chakra in edge spidermonkey in firefox and i m not entirely sure what apple s using whether they migrated to v8 or still use nitro
anyway in my experience safari s performance differs to google-chrome

39926128
implements	extends
implements an extension class for the inventoryitem dac and declare an unbound thumbnailurl field to store urls for attached images in the soorderentry blc extension subscribe to rowselecting handler and populate unbound thumbnailurl field with valid urls to display attached images set type property for the thumbnailurl column to icon
pxgridcolumn with the type property set to icon is used to show images inside pxgrid containers such column is capable of showing images from 2 sources sprites urls to add a column of the icon type in the inventory id selector lookup one should declare an extension class for the soline dac and extends the list of columns for inventory id selector for the new column set type property value to icon however this doesn t seem enough to show images attached to inventory items in selector lookup

39929397
floating-point	fractions
floating-point is not acceptable for financial transactions
nor is floating point acceptable in any other situation that expects correct fractions

39929861
memcpy	strncpy
try memcpy not strncpy
strncpy will stop copying at the first byte that has a value of zero

39931786
udp	tcp
you are using tcp sock_stream which is a reliable protocol which contrary to udp does not loose any messages even if the recipient is not reading the data fast enough
instead tcp will reduce the sending speed

39932317
ubuntu	linux
gradle test --info if you would like to see the overall test results you can open the report in the browser for example open it using google chrome in ubuntu google-chrome build reports tests index.html ant way once you set up your ant build file build.xml you can run your junit test cases from the command line as below you can follow the link below to read more about how to configure junit tests in the ant build file normal way if you do not use maven or gradle or ant you can follow the following way first of all you need to compile your test cases
for example in linux javac -d absolute path for compiled classes -cp absolute path to junit-4.12.jar absolute path to testclassname.java then run your test cases

39933233

fish has different syntax than zsh and bash not this in fish ... is the command substitution syntax like zsh bash backticks or
do this because fish aliases are just syntactic sugar for functions in bash ... runs the contents in a subshell

postgresql	mysql
the query doesn t fail uid just jumps to 5 +-----+-------+ | uid | col_b | +-----+-------+ | 1 | 1 | | 2 | 2 | | 4 | 4 | | 5 | 3 | +-----+-------+ testing was performed on mysql 5.6.33 for linux x86_64 and postgresql 9.4.9
whilst it looks like sequences are the equivalent to mysql auto_increment there are some subtle but important differences 1

39937407
postgresql	mysql
for example run the following queries on your postgresql database you should get the following output uid | col_b -----+------- 1 | 1 3 | 2 2 rows notice how uid goes from 1 to 3 instead of 1 to 2
this still occurs if you were to manually create your own sequence with if you wish to test how mysql is different run the following on a mysql database create table table1 uid int unsigned not null auto_increment primary key col_b int unsigned not null

bazaar	git	bazaar	svn	bazaar	perforce	perforce	svn
i would especially welcome somebody showing me that this is unnecessary that perforce actually does have the equivalent of svn git hg bazaar status
---+ a git hg bazaar svn status p4 opened + p4 status in perforce at least two separate commands seem to be required to approximate what other vcs tools do with a single command to provide a quick summary of the status of the workspace wrt the depot p4 opened - for a list of files that you have opened in the workspace p4 status - for a list of files not checked in to perforce

swift	objective-c
and swift 3 is not yet so refined as to generate appropriate diagnostics... worked
in swift 3 objective-c generics are imported as swift generics

39944102
swift	objective-c
i believe it is fair to say though that most swift programmers have taken hints from apple and swift language features as signs to avoid introducing nsobject based types when the above-mentioned need is not there
that is as a general rule only introduce nsobject based types when you actually need the objective-c dynamism most commonly when you need to interface with cocoa apis especially common when your code is ui related view controllers views

39944102
swift	objective-c
although methods in swift classes are also virtual the compiler is able to use faster means of dispatching methods when you don t explicitly mark the methods with the objective-c attribute especially when whole module optimization is toggled on and even more so in swift 3 where classes are not by default open for subclassing beyond the module that defines the type
beyond avoiding nsobject you can also avoid class based reference types altogether in many cases when writing swift

implements	extends
to cover the times the iterator is not fully consumed i also needed a close method. initially i simply extended iterator and closable interfaces but digging a little deeper the try-with-resources statement introduced in java 1.7 i thought provided a tidy way of implements it
you extends iterator and autocloseable interfaces implement the close method and use the iterator in a try-with-resources. the runtime will call close for you once the iterator is out of scope

in terms of the css tricks documentation they are just showing how you can target both portrait landscape or just one of the other
orientation is an additional condition depending on whether or not you wish to apply those styles for a view port currently in a portrait landscape display

serializable	deserialization
most common serializable don t track references and so cannot restore these on deserialization
the same object may be referenced multiple places in the original object graph but after deserialization you now have multiple instances of the original spread throughout the rehydrated graph

39959502
scheme	racket
note that according to some scheme is a dialect of algol so this is not a rigorous notion
i suggest that you start with the wiki which says in the lisp world most languages that use basic s-expression syntax and lisp-like semantics are considered lisp dialects although they vary wildly as do say racket and clojure

39959970
implements	extends
i decided to implements my on version which keeps track of the position of the sublists in the aggregated list and when elements in the sublists change apply the same changes in the aggregated list
there is still room for improvement not using a delegate list but extends a observablelist directly or firing the events from sublists up to the aggregated list and overriding the getters and iterators - help with that would be appreciated but i thought i post my version here as it is maybe it helps someone

lisp	scheme
sassy is intel assembly with better lisp syntax
it can perhaps expand macros and use the features of scheme so it s a lisp but its restricted so not all would see it as a lisp dialect

jlist	jtable
then when an item in the jlist is selected you ve got a full home object not a string and creating your jtable row should be trivial
fill your jlist with home objects not a concatenated string use a custom list cell renderer to display a concatenated string derived from the home objects in the list

bash	tcsh
when you use the makepsockcluster renice option it uses a form of the nice command that doesn t work with bash but i believe works with csh tcsh
you can see the generated command by using the manual true option if you try to execute this from bash you will get the same error message that you reported

firefox	safari
for instance you probably not need to support firefox 15 if that is the case you should not use width -moz-calc 100 - 100px
at least you need to support safari 6 chrome 25 or firefox 15 you just need to write width calc 100 - 100px firefox 4 to 15 width -moz-calc 100 - 100px

39972019
inline	inlining
and whether a function is inline or not can drastically affect the performance profile for worse or better
so by reducing the scope and thereby limiting the usage you are encouraging the compiler to consider your function for inlining unless your mark it cold

39973445
lisp	scheme
to understand this you really need to know something about how lisp typically represent objects
the following is not specific to mit scheme and may not even be correct for it or any specific implementation but is meant to give you some idea of what the considerations are in general

39973445
lisp	scheme
lisp would traditionally also do this for nil which might traditionally be a special nil tag with the rest of the word being zeros
this might make less sense for scheme i am not sure

this code works in ide s in jar files and in a jar inside a war on tomcat 7
but note that it does not work in a jar inside a war on jboss 7 it gives filesystemnotfoundexception provider vfs not installed see also this post

super	extends
the problem is that when you delete that line the compiler tries to create the super object using default constructor and since in your case your super class doesnt have any default constructor this wont work
you are extends an object while you are not going to let it to be created

opera	google-chrome
in case anyone finds this in the future and is confused about why the mouse-over function works inconsistently with google-chrome opera or internet explorer here is why the code i have above is correct
the problem is that for whatever reason mouse over with google-chrome opera and ie doesn t work if the mouse cursor is on the browser window while the test is running this may be an issue within the driver for each of these browsers

ionic	angular
as of today there are a few limitations though the library depends on the latest versions of angular2 2.0.2 as of today so it s probably better to be up-to-date in your project too angular2-token uses the new angular 2 router which is not supported by frameworks such as ionic 2 yet
however if you re using ionic 2 you should soon be able to give it a try according to this post

debian	linux
what you are looking for is ilasm - for assembling monodis - for disassembling these are found in the package mono-utils on debian 8 i did the following sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp keyserver.ubuntu.com 80 --recv-keys 3fa7e0328081bff6a14da29aa6a19b38d3d831ef echo deb jessie | sudo tee etc apt sources.list.d mono-xamarin.list sudo apt-get update apt-get install mono-devel mono-utils however fyi for those trying to create exports mono does not appear to handle the x64 export syntax
it does not appear there is a native microsoft tool that serves these functions on linux and it is not currently built into the dot-net-core

vsto	add-in
the add-in was not starting due to this other excel application running i was migrating an msaccess application to vsto so access had an automation app open hidden
in short if your add-in is not starting up quick check for is to just make sure there s no other excel applications running

mayavi	seaborn	mayavi	matplotlib
the alternative that tacaswell who is a co-lead on matplotlib dev recommends is to handle 3d plotting using mayavi which is relatively unique amongst python plotting libraries in that it does not use matplotlib as a backend like many other projects do pandas seaborn ggplot
i was able to install mayavi on osx with a minimum of fuss using homebrew and pip

g++	gcc
you should thus use a c++ compiler g++
gcc is a c compiler and doesn t know about c++

libstdc++	libc++
__is_referenceable is a non-standard internal libstdc++ routine
that doesn t mean it s bad just that i wouldn t expect libc++ to use it

cloudant	couchdb
cloudant is database-as-a-service owned and operated by ibm
it is actually apache couchdb but with some minor differences a different authentication api the option of geospatial indexes built-in lucene-based free-text search indexes - this technology has been open-sourced but does not feature in the apache couchdb out of the box couchdb 2.0 effectively is the same codebase as cloudant s service so there is no difference in terms of scalability or performance - the only difference is the couchdb requires that you have to install it yourself where-as cloudant is provided as-a-service at a cost

39989168
recvfrom	datagram
i guess this means i should separate the creation of the socket from the recvfrom function because the short period where the new socket is created it does not exist that is correct
if you open and close the socket every time in your listenonsocket socket a you will lose any datagram that got queued that you didn t read and b sends while the socket is closed will fail .

39991470
union	distinct
for example however typedefs cannot be forward-declared even if you know for sure that the type is a class union or enum
for example this will not work the reason is that forward-declaring foo implicitly declares it to be the same type that would be defined by a later definition therefore it is distinct from all previously defined types so when you later say typedef bar foo

39993956
profiling	debugging
as written in the apple documentation beta-reports-active is a new entitlements added to app store profiling in september 2014 to allow app store code signed builds to be tested using itunes connect so it should not be set in the other builds
i had set entitlements with beta-reports-active for debugging and release configuration

39994013
comparator	comparable
so especially with sortedset and sortedmap if the comparator method returns 0 it assumes it as equals and doesn t add that element second time even the the equals method returns false and causes confusion as specified in the sortedset javadoc note that the ordering maintained by a sortedset whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if the sortedset is to correctly implement the set interface
see the comparable interface or comparator interface for a precise definition of consistent with equals. this is so because the set interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a sortedset performs all element comparisons using its comparator or compare method so two elements that are deemed equals by this method are from the standpoint of the sortedset equals

39997791
vsto	add-in
you need to keep in mind that these interfaces are still under development and not completely in par with the .com object model you used to know from vba and or vsto but they are working hard to get this done -and- making it available on the various other platforms such as mac ipad etc
as mentioned in the comments nothing is future proof but the way to go today is by using the new officejs add-in

implements	extends
it is always like that you need to implements the drawing method and the gui framework will call this method when neccessary it is not the opposite that the gui framework displays your painting it is just calling your painting method when needed
you should implements your drawing logic in ondraw by extends some view class as stated in it is because android redraws the component when it needs to
