6000378
cdr	cons
cdr returns the tail of the list which is a list assuming the input is a list and not a cons cell
you probably want to use cadr instead short-hand for car cdr foo

6003784
comm	grep
comm -3 file1-sorted.txt file2-sorted.txt | sed s t the sed command is needed to remove a leading tab inserted by comm
if the files are huge but must also be sorted comm may be preferable to the more general grep solution proposed by ivan since it operates line by line and thus would not need to load the entirety of file2.txt into memory or search it for each line

6007920
google-chrome	firefox
the buttons are both not working for me in google-chrome while on firefox the first link is working and the second not.
the thing is that the home page on firefox is sending the cpu load to 100 and i see you have loads of javascripts on the home

6008297
cassini	iis
you are probably using the default visual studio web developer server cassini which doesn t allow one to access the site from anywhere else than the localhost
the easiest way around this is to change from the web developer server to iis express

6008350
cassini	iis
microsoft strongly suggest that we developers stop using cassini as our web server for debugging
iis express lets you not only take the full advantages of iss such as ssl but enable full access for any machine on your local network acting on port 80 or any other you would like

6009203
union	distinct
intersect requires the same column output and is used like union or except not in the where clause just join onto the udf if you need to split m.productname if you can t fix the design use cross apply however join and intersect give different results if parameter has duplicated values
add a distinct to the udf for example to get around this

6012285
uiview	calayer
never-the-less it is evident that uiview is somehow overriding the implicit animation mechanism of its calayer property
so if you want implicit animations you must use calayer s directly not just suppose that because uiview has a calayer property that it will behave the same

6013131
gridview	repeater	gridview	datalist
when pressed a nested gridview repeater or datalist is used in place of a custom row
i find that jamming extra rows into a gridview in the above fashion is hard to maintain whereas nested gridviews or datalist are not too bad once you ve done it once

6020183
collabnet	svn
you can also use the collabnet one choose collabnet subversion command-line client from the link it is great that you want to try out with command line as well since eventhough gui clients like tortoise make your life much simpler it is good to have the basic command line knowledge to understand what is happening and also for that situation where you cannot do something without the command line believe me these situations do occur
like others have said tortoisesvn does not come with the standard svn client and here is the reason it doesn t - so you need to install a svn command line client for you to be running svn commands

6022991
innodb	myisam
the innodb storage engine
generally i go with innodb if my table will have more updates inserts delete statements then select statements or i want relational database with foreign keys if not i stick with myisam

6022991
innodb	myisam
generally i go with innodb if my table will have more updates inserts delete statements then select statements or i want relational database with foreign keys if not i stick with myisam
if you go with innodb you will give up select statement performance and the ability to do full text search indexes

6023360
spaces	delimiter
you also need a spaces before the closing square-bracket which isn t a command but is a delimiter
despite what it might look like is actually a command called test so should be note the spaces between the and the next bit of code

6025198
build.gradle	gradlew
it becomes this way you do not have to specify the testcompile dependency in each subproject s build.gradle file
however when i gradlew build the actual classpath used for javac only includes the direct dependencies of projectb and the jar generated by building projecta

6027659
haskell	ocaml
haskell implicitly creates selector functions for field names
ocaml doesn t do this

6027806
viewdidload	viewwillappear
check to make sure that your viewdidload method isn t making any assumptions about the availability of data and that your viewdidunload method isn t accidentally deleting data that the newly re-called viewdidload will need
similarly ensure that your viewwillappear method isn t being thwarted by something in your viewdidunload method

6030521
google-chrome	firefox
run google-chrome with the --plugin-startup-dialog flag and when your plugin process starts google-chrome will give you the process id of the plugin process and then pause the plugin process and wait for a debugger to attach
google-chrome and also firefox runs plugins out of process so you aren t actually attaching to the process that has your plugin code

6031871
mayavi	matplotlib
as a quick example modified from one of the mayavi gallery examples
just to elaborate on my comment above matplotlib s 3d plotting really isn t intended for something as complex as isosurfaces

6033099
punctuation	words
here s a short algorithm when a comment is posted convert the string to lowercase and split it into words split on spaces and optionally dashes punctuation
in a words table store each words with an id if it s not already in the table

6034182
serializable	deserialization
it has already solved the serializable problem for c# developers and there s fairly few reasons not to use it
the only problem i had with it related to its inflexibility with using interface objects in deserialization from json but unless you are doing unit testing on this class that shouldn t be an issue and it doesn t look like you are

6034305
email	dkim
1 start with an spf record and a dkim if you can that lets mail servers know to expect email from your servers 2 first you need to put the recipients in the bcc field so that it not each user has the email addresses of 49 other users on your system
one step further is to do each email separately putting only the recipient in the to field

6035844
client-side	server-side
since an ajax request to the server typically returns xml or json to a response and not html which is then parsed by client-side javascript there is no point at which spring can bind to the request form and add error messages to the content
you can t since tags like are evaluated server-side and embed error messages elements in the html content of the http response

6037518
notepad++	scite
the best of these is probably notepad++ which has way more than 4000 lines of code
it comes with a general public licence which is not compatible with the project i m currently working on so i ended up using the scite editor instead

6038368
mp3	ogg
loading the mp3 with audio doesn t work in opera of course anyway since opera doesn t support that format
is served as audio ogg which is good

6039100
visualvm	yourkit
if method a just calls other methods but very little time is actually spent in it it doesn t show up much in visualvm even if the methods a calls spend lots of time
yourkit offers early access ea builds which do not require a purchase

6039295
vsto	add-in
vsto doesn t actually care which template you are writing for only that your add-in is a vsto 3.0 add-in
2 reasons that i can see f5 debugging support and to make sure you do not access a new api if you do go down the only 2010 add-in road i suggest you do a compile of the solution against the microsoft.office.interop.outlook v12 pia which will show you any new api s that you are accessing

6039578
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in firefox tim down s solution worked for me but not in google-chrome as contentwindow in not available
my revised code below which iterates though any frames on the page is working in gmail for me in firefox google-chrome and safari

6039774
n-gram	words
as you suggested you could use a jsgf to test out how it does for recognition if it doesn t use the n-gram models but instead does a simple grammar give it like twenty words including spaghetti and pencil
this way you can see if it is perhaps the language model which makes it difficult to recognize these words and it can do okay if it considers all the words to have equal probability

6040006
postgresql	mysql
i m no postgresql expert but i ve noticed the same behaviour
my understanding is that postgresql doesn t have a default order per se whereas mysql is reliable - as far as i know - in ordering by the primary key

6040006
postgresql	mysql
my understanding is that postgresql doesn t have a default order per se whereas mysql is reliable - as far as i know - in ordering by the primary key
postgresql s data format maybe means that modified records are shifted to the end

6040214
jboss	glassfish
you will need a different implementation though like jboss
the actual ee installation consists of a bunch of .jars in the libs folder i m not sure about the exact name as i don t have glassfish installed

6042027
profiling	debugging
in eclipse debugging configuration create maven build debugging config goals -dmaven.surefire.debug test profiling myconfigprofile weblogic or for a specific testsuite goals -dmaven.surefire.debug -dtest com.myorg.mypkg mytestsuite.java test profiling myconfigprofile weblogic n.b
don t put the props in jre jvm arguments as this doesn t seem to pause create additional remote java application config host localhost port 5005 running debugging your mvn build will stop and listen on 5005 by default

6045260
lxml	beautifulsoup
lxml s awesome for parsing well formed xml but s not so good if you ve got non-xhtml html
if that s the case then go for beautifulsoup as suggested by systemizer

6047005
innodb	myisam
one of the main performance advantages of innodb is row-level locking as opposed to table-level locking of myisam which means that multiple insert update queries against the same table won t block each other unless really necessary
however innodb does not perform well at all out of the box you really need to fine-tune your mysql configuration for your specific site

6051438
kde	gnome
the other thing if you re particular about your desktop is that kde s konsole might not fit all too well within gnome
the gnome terminal doesn t have such features but if you re open to change you could try konsole it has some nice save session options you could find helpful though nothing about re-opening accidentally closed tabs as far as i know

6052769
jsf	seam
how to run seam 2 with jsf 2 - till seam 2.3 comes out
we re using seam 2.2.2 and we simply cannot stomach the thought of using jsf1 any more now that jsf2 is available and provides some decent composite comp functionality

6055748
onfocus	onblur
i had assumed that these onblur events would run before the onfocus onfocusin but it seems that this is not the case
the onblur events then seem to close the dropdownlist when applying the class change

6056344
implements	extends
see mdc for reference but if you look at the source of jquery see src manipulation.js you ll see that this method is very small so you can just implements it directly
in the next example i will use extends instead but it s not a must

6056424
super	self
now still i was not able to detect any shake motion so all i had to do was to make my viewcontroller the first responder and for that here s the code that i used - void viewdidappear bool animated super viewdidappear animated
self becomefirstresponder

6057934
inline	inlining
the reason is that you may have a teammate that sees approach b and decides that when you need to add more javascript to the render doing it inline is the correct approach
inlining javascript can according to what i ve read be used for very simple one one-liners but even then it s not recommended

6058187
cocos2d-x	corona
cocos2d-x is an awesome framework and the best one to use if you need the flexibility of a native library and or absolutely need features not supported in corona
it is not a case of objective-c or cocos2d-x

6060260
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and ie indeed act like you mentioned but google-chrome do not and i d guess other webkit browsers would do the same. in google-chrome clicking the back button will land you where you want to go the previous url of the parent frame
google-chrome to not add iframe url changes in the back button history

6060260
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome to not add iframe url changes in the back button history
sadly i ve found no way to force ie and firefox to replicate this so i used the ajax post approach suggested above by arun

6061653
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
safari 4.0.5 opera 10
on windows 7 native machine i had internet explorer 9 google-chrome 11 safari 5 opera 11 and for firefox i install the following app natively too personally i would not go back further than 5 years with compatibility other than ie for government networks unless you have a specific requirement i split google-chrome opera across years as i decided there were just to many releases

6062780
comparator	comparable
basically every class that implements comparable gets a comparator ... -method
a.compareto b will return for the cases where you can t implement comparable or do not want to there is a class comparator which can be given to the sort methods sparately

6064649
super	self
this is essential because without it the super invocation wouldn t be possible the self value is used by the compiler to send the invocation becomes objc_msgsendsuper self selector init
yes self already has a value when your initializer starts

6066263
vb6	vba
vb6 applications and vba applications which are heavily com based with massive potential for com interference com settings overwriting each other and becoming inconsistent have been known to trigger several mysterious self-repair problems most of which have not been properly explained
this can also happen on launch of visual basic 6 vb6 or visual studio and many other applications

6066686
spaces	delimiter
you ve got as less than and for templates and as shift remember not long ago when we had to put a spaces in between nested template declarations
so it turns out that the guy at nvidia who came up with this syntax was not a language expert and happened to choose the worst possible delimiter then tripled it well you re going to have trouble

6068112
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu for example uses .deb files to manage installation of software
.deb files are not specific to debian though and can be used on any compatible nix platform

6069408
inline	inlining
factors you say you re designing application level code not libraries so you don t currently have to worry about other teams getting dependent on your code nor minimise their need to recompile versus just relink by keeping implementation out of line but if you re writing good code that has any potential to become useful to other teams then you might find yourself wishing you d kept implementation private inline versus out-of-line typically represents about an order-of-magnitude overhead for trivial data get set functions.
if you have functions that are called repeatedly from performance critical code then you ve reason to prefer inlining in-header implementation especially if intermingled with the declarations can often obfuscate the api but sometimes actually makes the code more self-documenting localisation and removed redundancy of combining declaration definitions definitely removes potential for typos errors and can often improve productivity bottom line if you re finding yourself doing it more and more then it s obviously working for you and there s no particular reason to think you re about to get burnt

6071351
multiplying	multiplication
the same goes for the following lines but here you should be aware that you multiplying al with al which i assume is not the desired operation
as a solution you could rename every occurence of bh or bl to dh dl or ch cl and change the factor in the multiplication accordingly

6072388
opera	firefox
to sum up i have tried 2 approaches listed here in user javascript programming opera 11.01 this one didn t work creating multiline strings in javascript this worked fairly well i have also figured out how to make it look good in notepad++ source view creating multiline strings in javascript so i recommend the working approach for opera user js users
unlike what the author was saying it doesn t work on firefox or opera

6072388
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari
unlike what the author was saying it doesn t work on firefox or opera
only on ie google-chrome and safari

6075773
super	self
super is for accessing stuff from base classes but instance variables are as the name says part of an instance not part of that instance s class
after the base class s __init__ ran the derived object has the attributes set there some_var as it s the very same object as the self in the derived class __init__

6077458
innodb	myisam
on innodb this is not a problem
if you create a view on myisam tables selects and updates are mutually exclusive so a select update on the table would block any update select on the view

6078471
inline	inlining
the problem is that that particular copy can only be elided if the code is actually inline not only if it is marked as inline but actually inline if a function call is required then the copy cannot be elided
if the standard allowed that copy to be elided when the code is inline it would imply that the behavior of a program would differ due to the compiler and not user code --the inline keyword does not force inlining it only means that multiple definitions of the same function do not represent a violation of the odr

6079323
vim	emacs
emacs+vimpulse is awesome but i think its right workflow is to liberally use emacs commands in combination to vim shortcuts
for example emacs s macro shortcut f3 and f4 is easier than vim s qq and q . also emacs commands are accessed through alt+x not commands

6079323
vim	emacs
for example emacs s macro shortcut f3 and f4 is easier than vim s qq and q . also emacs commands are accessed through alt+x not commands
though vimpulse support a few important vim commands they are there just for compatibility

6082342
coalesce	isnull
strangely this is one place where you can t use the more standards compliant coalesce v3 resembles v1
you can force it back to being not null by wrapping it in an isnull v1 s value column is marked as nullable v2 s isn t

6082776
subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication
addition and subtraction work just the same
multiplication is slightly different because i 2 isn t -1 but +5 here

6084436
nhibernate	queryover
it s not complete and i didn t test it nhibernate and the missing operatorprojection part 1
using queryover this is a bit of a problem because we need to use projections when using sql functions

6084528
exponent	modulo
leading zero byte required because modulo is 2 511 02 03 01 00 01 public exponent 0x10001 leading zero byte not required because exponent is 2 23 02 41 00 b5 87 .
65 data bytes private exponent 0xb587.

6089902
super	extends	super	implements
as no no-arg constructor exists in thread you would need to explicitly call one of the public constructors in a super cal
when you would implements runnable instead of extends thread you wouldn t have thos problem

6090084
org.json	gson
i ve never seen org.json mixed with gson
usually gson replaces org.json it s not meant to be used together

6090202
oncreate	setcontentview	oncreate	findviewbyid
so expanding mbyd s answer in your oncreate method first call setcontentview then findviewbyid
you have to call it from your activity s oncreate method as the resources will not have been made available before that point

6090478
udp	tcp
as of version 10.3 the flash player browser plugin still only supports tcp sockets not udp so networking will be slower than it would be on a pc game like battlefield or call of duty
that said in our tests it s totally normal to get a 30ms ping with tcp sockets in flash i ve seen as low as 2ms to japan and that is plenty fast enough to do real-time twitch games

6090636
expression-blend	silverlight
there is a learning curve - xaml - but with the right tools visual studio 2010 and expression-blend you can learn a lot from what is provided out of the box
silverlight is not just for mobile development

6091601
vsto	add-in
vsto is actually a set of managed .net extensions which make writing add-in for office far easier
for external interaction vsto is not used at all though you can still reference vsto libraries and use some of the helpers if you wanted to

6091614
vsto	add-in
there is also a useful powershell script which will do this sort of stuff for you and is handy when figuring out when vsto not working at get started by running vstotroubleshooter.ps1 setdbg which will setup the vsto_suppressdisplayalerts env variable for you
actually it is quite easy set the environmental variable vsto_suppressdisplayalerts to 0 before running the office application then office will display exceptions and not kill your add-in during startup when there are issues

6093362
gitolite	gitosis
if you want ssh access control while only using a single system user like gitosis offers then you should use gitolite which can be combined with the git-http-backend cgi script
gitosis and webdav do not work together in any way

6093489
ssl	https
first ssl session is established then all http data are wrapped into secured ssl packets before sending and after receiving
https runs over ssl as it s name suggests http-over-ssl not ssl over http

6096688
floating-point	fractions
not being able to represent decimal fractions accurately is something that surprises most people and which they consequently consider a great disadvantage of floating-point formats when in reality it s a disadvantage of binary formats and they are not at all suprised at not being able to represent numbers like 1 3 accurately
from the floating-point guide why floating-point numbers are needed since computer memory is limited you cannot store numbers with infinite precision no matter whether you use binary fractions or decimal ones at some point you have to cut off

6098108
implements	extends
you db tables will implements this interface
your new class will also implements this interface but not extends zend_db_table

6101070
cassini	iis
ok that explains it - visual studio by default uses the built-in cassini web server unless you ve already switched to using iis express - and that server doesn t support anything but plain http
cassini doesn t support net.tcp and anything like that

6102059
highcharts	fusioncharts
i can also assist you in implementing the older highcharts.js by particularly detecting android based browsers and doing selective loading of older highcharts js files
there is also a small extension of fusioncharts that gracefully handles this replacement of older highcharts for devices that does not support svg or vml but supports canvas

6104047
implements	extends
then implements onclick like this
your onitemclicklistener should not extends activity

6105707
udp	tcp
note also that this does not apply to udp - without some kind of application layer preventative udp is at significant risk from blind spoofing
if the attacker can see the replies coming back say because he is sniffing the uplink or the local network of your server then this also doesn t apply - spoofing tcp connections in this case is not just possible but trivial

6106528
phpunit	simpletest
unfortunately cakephp isn t designed to work together with phpunit
cakephp has switched to using simpletest and you ll have one of two choices refactor your tests to work with simpletest or modify the core to use phpunit

6108723
inline	inlining
for example most compilers will automatically inline member functions that are fully defined in the header if the code is isn t long and or too complex
however this don t happen for example in debug mode for visual studio in debug the debug informations still need to map the binary code of the functions so it avoid inlining but will still inline functions marked inline because the user required it

6108723
inline	inlining
if you mark something inline you just tell the compiler that if it find it hard but not impossible to inline it should inline it
as inlining depends on both contexts of the caller and the callee there is no rule . what s often advised is to simply ignore explicitly mark function inline but in two cases if you need to put a function definition in a header it just have to be inlined

6112438
uiview	subviews
now add your subviews on the uiview
your subviews will not take the alpha property anymore

6112544
implements	extends
if you re talking about some skin specific graphics which is not represented as declaration in a host component then you can implements two strategies your hide reveal logic is just a part of view but no the component functionality
in this case you should extends your skin and place hide reveal logic there

6113727
google-chrome	firefox
for instance this persepctive demo will draw without such white lines in google-chrome but will have the ugly white lines in firefox because the two browsers decided to do anti-aliasing differently
because of this some things look nice in google-chrome and not firefox and vice versa

6113952
memcached	apc
using sessions apc memcached cookies etc does not guarantee that you will be able to hold the limit
if you use apc or memcached or any other system designed for caching your memory limit might run out and the key you stored will vanish thus allowing the user 25 new searches

6114626
ssl	https
so i will not need a ssl cert for the nettcpbinding as that is handled by windows security and is inheriently secure when using transport security
when using a wshttpbinding i will still need to secure the transport with a ssl certificate which i had done as mentioned previously and exposed the binding via https

6115849
client-side	server-side
the fix is simply to make sure it is enabled server-side the default then disable it see blow or enable it see above using client-side code
i have also found that if you disable the listbox server-side then use client side code to enable the list box using code like the following then you cannot get the selected items server side

6116030
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
no the fact that you are handling an exception does not make it a checked exception if it is a runtimeexception
yes checked exceptions are subclasses of java.lang.exception unchecked-exception are subclasses of java.lang.runtimeexception calls throwing checked exceptions need to be enclosed in a try block or handled in a level above in the caller of the method

6118047
.htaccess	httpd.conf
do a config check and then restart gracefully which doesn t take the server offline and reloads configuration alternatively this code can go into an .htaccess which is less preferable
using apache to create a reverse proxy using mod_rewrite in the main httpd.conf under the relevant if applicable first line checks for www.mydomain.com or mydomain.com second line identifies the id portion of the url if the first two conditions are met the request is made by apache to www.proxydomain.com newurl and then returned to the client

6119232
rar	zip
rar not so much
zip is easy

6121614
pascal	delphi
note that this directive is specific to the free pascal compiler delphi does not support it
to ensure that the record packing alignment padding is as gcc expects add packrecords c to your pascal source

6122775
bash	subshell
an excerpt from man bash each command in a pipeline is executed as a separate process in a subshell
and subshell cannot change the variable in parent

6123519
implements	extends
these lines are never going to work because neither of them implements the interfaces ihttprequest or ihttpresponse
to make an inbuilt class implements your own interfaces you will have to extends it derive a new class from it i m not sure exactly why you are trying to do this with these two classes but typically you would only pass them around as an interface if you wanted to change how they are implemented

6126127
udp	tcp
udp is not reliable
for a reliable transport layer tcp ip suite protocol see the tcp packet

6126360
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
opera supports the file api from 11.1 but doesn t support the dnd
so you can use drag and drop file upload in firefox 3.6+ safari 6.0+ google-chrome 9.0+

6126445
spaces	linefeed
non-breaking spaces is not included.
add s as another choice to your regex to allow whitespace characters #x20 t n r that is regular spaces tab linefeed carriage return

6129698
email	dkim
when you are setting up your own email service to send large amount of email you should probably keep these in mind make sure your spf records are accurate and they stay that way incorporate dkim to complement your spf records
they aren t widely recognized yet but isps like aol will bounce you away if you don t have dkim validate the html you use in your email so that you aren t flagged as looking spammy warm up your ip by sending out solid transactional email over time and not have people report it as spam use external services to check out the status of your ip

6129698
email	dkim
they aren t widely recognized yet but isps like aol will bounce you away if you don t have dkim validate the html you use in your email so that you aren t flagged as looking spammy warm up your ip by sending out solid transactional email over time and not have people report it as spam use external services to check out the status of your ip
i always advise people to go for third party email providers because it will save you headaches going forward - you can just expect the email to be sent and arrive at the inbox and you won t have to worry about anything

6129823
lxml	elementtree
having played with linq to xml in .net as well i much prefer working python and lxml another remark lxml has some good support for html even ill-formed as well including facilities for filling out html forms i m not sure if that is what you meant with put results on html form however
look at lxml more specifically the combination of the elementtree interface an easier xml model api than dom much like the xdocument and xelement classes attributes and text are even simpler because they are not separate nodes which may look strange at first if you re working with mixed content models a lot and you re used to dom interfaces the e-factory of lxml.builder like functional construction in linq to xml but even better

6130277
uilabel	nsstring
you can easily change the uilabel to an nsstring and change the property to so you can set new text to it with
you are not initializing the uilabel well as far as i can see

6130654
viewdidload	viewwillappear	viewdidload	viewdidappear
i just moved my code that needed the dimensions of the frame bounds from viewdidload to viewwillappear and it worked properly
i ve been stumbling over the same problem and with some diagnostic work i discovered that the view s bounds and frame do not accurately reflect the landscape orientation in viewdidload when the device is held in landscape when the view controller is pushed onto the stack but do so correctly in viewwillappear and viewdidappear

6130967
daemons	systemd
if your daemons is a pure native application for example started through the systemd s inittab not something running within the context of an apk then android will never kill it
at least in my situation which is exactly this the only time my daemons has ever terminated is just prior to my fixing a sigsegv

6131885
skip-lists	tree
i would consider a skip-lists as a better alternative data structure
sortedlist and sorteddictionary are implemented internally as binary search tree and could ideally give you o log n performance for a min requires walking the tree but not enumerating the whole list

6132481
google-chrome	firefox
if you press any key in google-chrome the popup will open because it allows popups from keydown handlers
in ie and firefox the popup will be blocked becuase those browsers do not allow popups from keyboard events

6133331
backgrounding	multitasking
multitasking where is the new backgrounding agents come into play
backgrounding agents are a separate assembly distributed with your app that can be set to run while your app is not running

6135485
.htaccess	httpd.conf
.htaccess will not require a server restart but php.ini and the other apache conf files will
there are 2 different places you can set it php.ini .htaccess httpd.conf virtualhost include php_value post_max_size 20m php_value upload_max_filesize 20m which one to use depends on what you have access to

6135960
octal	decimal
octal numbers a numbers which go from 0 to 7
what you have to do and is best practice is to say you have decimal numbers not octal

6137103
requestfactory	gwt-rpc
the best documentation is the code but you ll find an overview of the request format in these slides requestfactory contrary to gwt-rpc uses a symmetric json-based protocol based on autobean s json serialization where client and server can communicate even when not compiled from the same code well depending on the changes you made between versions of course because they pass around class and property names
edit brian slesinsky just documented the protocol by reverse-engineering the code first gwt-rpc protocol is asymmetric so that it s always optimized for the client-side fast to deserialize something coming from the server and fast to serialize something to send to it

6137418
freemarker	velocity
see also 16.4 velocity freemarker
you jsp code can be rewritten in freemarker as follows note that spring library for freemarker doesn t have specifal element for form so you need to use ordinary html form and prepend model attribute name to paths of individual fields

6138628
equals	icomparable
the former is needed for sorting because just knowing which objects are of equals value doesn t help you putting them in a specific order
because icomparable allows to determine if an object is smaller or bigger than another object whereas iequatable helps finding out whether two objects are equals

6139051
prepare	execute
when you use the setters in prepare statement it encloses the parameters in single quotes
i am not sure why the executequery works. you will see a similar exception if you directly execute the following query

6139683
dictionary	map
and std map shouldn t be compared to dictionary
std map maintains keys in sorted order because it is a balanced tree dictionary solves a different problem

6140187
fgets	strcpy
so here is what happens when reading the last line fgets returns read_in_buffer not null pointer because there are characters read and no read error occurs
then the check feof fin returns true because eof already reached that makes this code never executed strcpy retreivedstring read_in_buffer

6141370
equals	compareto
you need to override equals and hashcode - hashmap doesn t use compareto which is meant for sorting
note that your compareto implementation is already broken as it s really only testing for equality

6145629
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox
notice that content-type is text plain instead of video ogg http 1.1 200 ok date thu 26 may 2011 21 55 25 gmt server litespeed accept-ranges bytes connection close etag fa8cc4-4dde175c-0 last-modified thu 26 may 2011 09 03 24 gmt content-type text plain content-length 16420036 the html5 video plays for me in safari google-chrome and ie 9 but not firefox or ie 7-8
if you fix the mime-type issue it will play in firefox

6148332
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i did this in the head of my document updated does not work in safari or firefox but does work in ie8 and google-chrome
curious to know why because it s usually firefox or ie that don t play nice on their own and safari is webkit based like google-chrome

6149393
required	placeholder
i also took out all the tostring because they are not required
you must supply at least the same number of parameters or an array with at least the same number of elements as the highest placeholder value plus one placeholder values are zero indexed max placeholder value 3 you must supply at least four additional parameters

6150060
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
if you want to select all the content of an element contenteditable or not in google-chrome here s how
this will also work in firefox safari 3+ opera 9+ possibly earlier versions too and ie 9

6150399
implements	extends
the idea behind an interface is that the classes implements it must include the functionality of the interface
this doesn t mean they have to be limited to what is in the interface you can extends on it as much as you like it s perfectly reasonable to have methods that aren t part of the interface

6151359
plone	buildout
see for an example of a flat namespace plone package
works for me with buildout obviously this is not the result you expect though paster created a triple nested namespace package called myapp.plone.myapp - further note this app will not appear in add-ons in plone unless you add a genericsetup profile in myapp plone myapp configure.zcml like so then you should see finally there is nothing wrong with non-namespace packages they are just convention with pros cons over flat namespace packages and vice versa

6151458
google-chrome	firefox
if i inspect the html in google-chrome it looks like google-chrome is adding css to hide the image the images are displayed in firefox and also in google-chrome on mac
google-chrome on windows 7 is not displaying dynamic images

6152760
google-chrome	firefox
firebug was touching a service in firefox s google-chrome js privileged code space that was causing the worker to fail intermittently you can see the patch for it here as long as you do everything in accordance with the worker spec you shouldn t see this problem
as for the fix to firebug fx it should arrive in firefox 5 in late june

6152936
mvp	presenter
the main goal with mvp is decoupling of different aspects in the code
normally in javascript there are 3 major such aspects event handling dom manipulation server communication ajax calls for each of these concerns there s a corresponding term from mvp eventhandling presenter dom manipulation view ajax calls model since indeed it is not always simple to implement the 3 aspects an event bus may come in handy

6155805
lisp	prolog
it s structured like lisp lots of parens but it s designed for building expert systems
i haven t seen a problem that prolog solves that clips couldn t

6155879
backtracking	greedy
you re probably getting catastrophic backtracking
namely but not only because of your greedy sequences

6159829
swt	swing
currently the simplest way i can find to open this dialog is through swt not swing
swt s filedialog javadoc brings up this dialog

6162016
rtp	rtcp
in case you re also using mpeg4 the axis firmware is buggy and the absolute timestamps in rtcp sr are not reliable - in this case you have to synchronize the relative rtp timestamps to your clients wall clock
as ralf already said - the rtp timestamps are relative to a random clock - they are only useful for computing the difference between two frames or rtp-packets in general

6163496
svg	vml
you say you ve tried the svg approach and given up on it because it doesn t work in ie8
it s worth pointing out that while ie doesn t support svg it does support vml which is a competing vector graphics format

6163496
svg	vml
it s worth pointing out that while ie doesn t support svg it does support vml which is a competing vector graphics format
svg is now standardised so vml will fade away but older ies will continue to support it

6164301
rational-numbers	fractions
if your aspect ratio was 4 3 you could fill it with 4x3 squares of length width 4 height 3 or 8x6 squares of half that size or 12x9 squares of a third that size... if it is not a rational-numbers your task is impossible
you convert a fractions to lowest terms by factoring the numerator and denominator and removing all duplicate factor pairs

6164638
subtraction	addition
in your code the address of subtraction is first stored as local variable of the compatible type and then that variable is passed as argument to operation function
in case of addition it s address is not stored as local variable instead its passed as such to operation

6165124
thunk	trampolines
though technically to avoid a stack blowout you can 1 increase the stack size limit in languages which allow it or 2 eat a constant factor of extra work to virtualize your stack ick or 3 program in continuation-passing style which in effect also virtualizes your stack not sure the complexity of this but basically you will effectively take the deferred call chain from the stack of size n and de-facto stick it in n successively nested thunk functions.
though in some languages without tail-call optimization you may have to trampolines things to avoid a stack blowout

6165256
super	implements
i found out that the scrolling behavior is set in - void viewwillappear bool animated of the super instance
so be sure to implements like this and it doesn t matter if you use uiviewcontroller or uitableviewcontroller

6166137
haskell	ocaml
both are types with an essentially infinite number of distinct values though and against the grain of haskell s specifying arguments and results with finite types
i m more familiar with ocaml than haskell so type constructor may not be the right term

6168698
jar	war
an executabele jar requires a class with a main method but a web application normally doesn t have any since that s the responsibility of the servlet container not the web application
normally a war is to be distributed as-is it s the serveradmin s responsibility to deploy it to a servlet container

6175240
uiview	subviews
now add your uiview as the subviews in your main view
create an uiview object set the frame property as much you require not the full size now create button add this as sunview to your newly created uiview

6176211
interpolation	splines
you will need to approximate the curve using an interpolation fitting scheme that depends on the problem and the curve shape and the known functional form
a splines might be appropriate or perhaps not

6176428
comparator	comparable
edit i just saw you have an has comparator logic instead of pure is comparable
that should be fixed remove the reference to the comparator from within data items - if not you re right - the tree might get broken.

6178737
shadowing	named
yes they happen to also be the named of actual concrete types but in this case you re shadowing that meaning
if you use your original named of m a and b the error becomes clearer m really does not take a type parameter.

6178768
charat	indexof
length will give you the length of a string charat someindex will give you the character at a given position so you can iterate the first string
indexof achar will give you the poisition a char in a string or -1 if it s not there

6180519
innodb	myisam
innodb extra lookup required to get to table data in innodb an extra lookup needs to be done because all secondary indexes refer to the pk and not to the rows themselves
myisam wasted space in myisam the penalty is not that great but you re still dragging along a 4 byte unused field that doesn t get used

6181566
google-chrome	firefox
see html 5 geo location prompt in google-chrome
works perfectly for me - with both google-chrome 11 and firefox 4.0.1 on win 7 make sure you ve not disabled location tracking in google-chrome because of security restrictions resources loaded with the file scheme are not allowed access to location

6185252
portrait	landscape
this happens only when i rotate the ipad simulator from portrait to landscape when theuipopover is already open
if i manually close it in portrait mode by clicking outside the popover or clicking the popover barbuttonitem on the left of the toolbar and then rotate the screen to landscape i do not face this issue.the left view of the splitviewcontroller is perfectly positioned

6190136
floating-point	fractions
it s because floating-point values are represented in the machine with binary exponents and 10 is not an even power of 2
thus some base-10 fractions turn into repeating fractions when converted

6191572
comparator	comparable
first of all ordering is akin to comparator not comparable
the scala equivalent to comparable is ordered

6191572
super	extends
the latter is equivalent to super -- which is not what you want
so with both these fixes in your code should look like this however this won t work for for instance since int does not extends ordered -- just like java s int does not extends comparable or anything else since it is not a class

6193550
irc	xmpp
couple of irc protocol s problems are that 1 the network has quite some trust on the tree of servers and 2 that changes to the network state require splits joins of clients
for rfcs and other technicalities see this comparison also includes psyc protocol for synchronous conferencing i ve never heard about it that supposedly has fixed some of the problems with irc protocol there is also xmpp but that does not do multicasting and may be more suitable to msn google talk type one-to-one chatting although the fb chat written in erlang uses it in addition to google talk

6199043
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
as no doubt you have noticed the old viewdidappear methods are not fired when the uimodalpresentationformsheet controller is dismissed
one can emulate the viewwillappear call by simply calling that method when you dismiss the controller but that isn t what you need

6199807
arp	icmp
try use arp for detect is host exists
actually berkeley sockets have not timeout for connect so you can not set it. icmp ping is not helpful i don t know why but if host not exists you spend around 1 second with ping

6200198
onresume	onpause
annoyingly i can t post a comment yet but i think you mean onresume not onrestart
your activity can be paused without being stopped which would cause onpause but not onrestart

6202826
udp	tcp
generally udp is a good idea for sending video stream data as losing video data usually can be tolerated
if you must not lose data consider using tcp as suggested

6203363
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
do not use multiple uiviewcontroller objects to control parts of a single view
the view controller is designed and intended to be used full-screen or as part of a uinavigationcontroller uitabbarcontroller etc

6208996
firefox	safari
except it is fine with firefox and explorer. i have spent most of my afternoon first with mac - safari and then with ms excel group
their conclusion is that it is a known bug between xl and mac and they are still working on it. i uploaded a .pdf to my web site link is and i was able to view the image with firefox but not with safari - i got the characters with safari

6209885
haskell	ocaml
the thing is that languages like haskell or ml tend to have some problems with that
i once did something similar to ocaml abused camlp4 and wrote some function that translates the p4 ast into some sexpr-like representation and the fun begins when you run into similar kinds of ast nodes that have different types because they re not really the same.

6210202
implements	extends
the first one gives me an empty string since this is the first page load there hasn t been yet any postback triggered with the __dopostback function. the second one gives me the uniqueid of the button that was pushed inside the user control this is the original and expected asp.net behavior. the third one gives me exactly what i passed as the first argument when i coded the method ie the clientid of the updatepanel. here s how i succeeded to implements my updatepanel use case assuming i m using the partial rendering mode. this is not perfect but it works as intended
if you don t want to extends the original updatepanel class you can also use this workaround thus you can examine the resulting id and add some conditional clauses to determine which code should execute

6210332
hex	binary
normaly you use hex notatition not binary because keeping track of so many digits is difficult
you can also use decimal but the charts that tell you which instructions have which codes are typically in hex notation

6211738
multiplying	multiplication
re-interprete the float input as an integer apply the hash function to produce an integer approximately uniformly distributed in 0 2 32 then multiplying this integer by 2 -32 to convert the resulting integer back to a float roughly uniformly distributed in 0 1
one suitable hash function which does not require multiplication is bob jenkin s mix which can be found here

6214493
client-side	server-side
this means doesn t work properly since variables that are included in will be treated as server-side variables and thus your client-side variable test is either considered as an undefined constant or a string without quotes
due to my knowledge server-side variables can not interact directly with client-sider variables without anything in between

6216396
firefox	safari
in firefox the images display and the inline css is not added
what i noticed was when i turned off all extensions in safari that the problem resolved

6216870
cocos2d-x	corona
a quick google search showed me that corona has costs associated with it for distribution - cocos2d-x does not
i can t speak for corona but cocos2d-x is just an obj-c library so you ll still have to know a bit of obj-c to get it going

6218120
d3.js	protovis
i m repeatedly annoyed that basic utilities like pv.sum or pv.mean don t have d3.js equivalents though some like .nest are shared across the two libraries
edit 10 1 12 d3.js has filled out its data utilities but there are still a few that protovis includes and d3.js doesn t pv.dict pv.numerate and pv.repeat

6218120
d3.js	protovis
finally i haven t done much with animation but i think you re entirely correct - d3.js provides more animation support than protovis especially in terms of animated transitions
protovis can re-render some or all of the visualization on demand but doesn t have any support for stepping through a limited-duration animation - you d have to code it all by hand with setinterval

6219337
tabcontrol	tabitem
an example template might look like this i would then be able to use your codepage class like this chances are you ll want a custom tabcontrol that overrides its container generation to return instances of your codepage instead of tabitem but that s another story
first of all your custom tabitem needs to override metadata so that the correct style is picked up based on your new type rather than your base class apologies - i ve used c# because i m not proficient enough in vb this will allow you to define a default style in your theme generic.xaml as such in this style you can define a template

6220980
trie	tree
see so question trie prefix tree in python for more info about implementations
there are a couple of trie implementations on python package index but they are not very good

6221977
oncreate	onstart
so you cannot change the image in oncreate
the activity is not visible until onstart runs

6223637
nhibernate	queryover
for any relationship that is not one-to-one nhibernate makes the assumption that the relationship could have 0 to many results thus uses a left join
i don t know about linq2nhibernate but in nh3 using queryover api you can specify the join types

6223658
dictionary	map
your python code actually translates to c++ pretty much directly python s dictionary is similar to c++ s map
they re both associative containers mapping a value from one type to a value of another in our case string to function . in c++ functions aren t quite first-class citizens so you can t store a function in a map but you can store a pointer to a function

6225183
portrait	landscape
2 modifying the image data after capture this is a tedious thing already mentioned in many blogposts stackoverflow uiimagepickercontroller camera preview is portrait in landscape app now rotate your image by 90 degrees or 270 deg based on orientation to make it look portrait
there are different things to consider here 1 you want the camera button not to change for landscape orientation to indicate portrait orientation only .you can achieve this by having custom controls and having your own camera control bar

6225186
profiling	debugging
another approach to testing slower but always valid it to fire data with very specific values into a ga profiling dedicated to development and check a few hours later that your data has came in
sometimes you need to figure if the debugging tools you use aren t giving wrong indications either because they are not appropriate either buggy or either too smart to give you the raw data for example

6225339
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
you are opening a fileoutputstream to alicea.txt this outputstream is never closed in your code but in the error-line you open a fileinputstream on the same file imho while you have an open fileoutputstream on a file you can not open a file inputstream on the same file
that may be the reason why your fileinputstream is null and the exception is thrown

6226621
equals	compareto
equals requires invoking instanceof operator while compareto requires not
my colleague has noted large performance drop-down caused by excessive numbers of instanceof calls in equals method however my test has proved compareto to be only slightly faster

6227293
innodb	myisam
innodb does not work in an optimized way when run with default options you will have to configure and tune according to your needs . 3
innodb does not have compressed indexes like myisam so its going to take more space 4

6227293
innodb	myisam
innodb does not have compressed indexes like myisam so its going to take more space 4
innodb automatically appends primary key columns to secondary keys

6227558
ubuntu	centos
i have not been able to get it running in my ubuntu environment as of yet but i assume this is a bug in my server software
as my code is working fine with centos i conclude that the problem is not programming specific

6227961
hex	binary
variable length character strings are preceded by a 2 byte binary field giving the length of the string. in your case that would be 01 try viewing the output with hex on
since the length is a binary integer value it does not display as you were expecting

6228138
profiling	debugging
in general it s a good idea to profiling with debugging info make it fast and then remove the debugging info
i m glad you got it figured out but the next time you do profiling you might want to consider a few points the vs profiler in sampling mode does not sample during i o or any other time your program is blocked so it s only really useful for cpu-bound profiling

6231080
prepare	execute
you can use phps very own ssh2_exec after connecting to a prepare remote server
if that extension is not available you can of course just do execute ssh user server.name . myshell.sh

6233902
punctuation	words
n.b this will also match non-alphabetic characters such as punctuation digits etc
i means case-insensitive that is you ll get words like bacterious but not pancreaticoduodenostomy which also features all of the vowels in the right order

6235118
multiplying	multiplication
the important part is that the exponent is a constant -- you re multiplying n by itself some number of that s fixed -- not dependent on n itself
a factorial-complexity algorithm means the number of multiplication is not fixed -- the number of multiplication itself grows with n

6235395
erd	diagram
the inclusion of field names muddies this a bit - an erd shouldn t really express this information afaik
yes this is an entity relationship diagram using chen s notation

6235498
udp	tcp
if you lose some information it will not affect anything you can use udp for health status transfers
when using tcp you don t need to maintain proxy session opened just to keep opened the connection

6236467
listview	gridview
i found out that the overrides isenabled and areallitemsenabled from baseadapter will only be called if the adapter is attached to a listview but not to a gridview correct
while those methods are implemented on adapter they are a feature of listview not of adapterview

6236467
listview	gridview
while those methods are implemented on adapter they are a feature of listview not of adapterview
there is no enabled-state of my gridview items afaik

6237459
serializable	deserialization
a good reference for this is version tolerant serializable on msdn
in short changes to shared static in c# methods do not affect the deserialization of an object never remove a serialized field

6237554
implements	extends
using array#filter for this particular case the code would look like array#filter is not implements in some older browsers so see the linked article for a backward compatibility shim or better yet get a full-fledged es5 shim
for the more general case it s just a matter of extends this idea again i am using ecmascript 5 methods object.keys and array#every so use an es5 shim

6238531
interpolation	splines
you can try inverse distance weighted interpolation see inverse distance weighted idw interpolation with python . this should produce reasonably smooth results and scale better than rbf to larger data sets
smooth splines interpolation in dim 2 is difficult to implement and so there are not many freely available libraries able to do that in fact i don t know any

6240349
octal	decimal	octal	hex
i m not sure what the simplest way would be to encode it -- you could use eg xab xcf... the same with octal or you could use an array initializer something like don t quote me on this you could even use decimal values for the initializer. obviously whatever you do you ll have to pre-process the encrypted text into a hex representation -- an easy job for a toy program
encode it as hex octal

6241453
postgresql	mysql
for postgresql and sqlite under rails you d want t for true not just t
of course for mysql you d want 1

6243765
svg	vml
ie9+ support svg mainly because the rest of the world was moving on with svg and no one had interest in supporting vml
i m not familiar with dojo charting but it could be using vml

6243852
recvfrom	datagram
recvfrom will read the entire message that was originally sent but if the buffer isn t big enough it will throw an exception socket.error errno 10040 a message sent on a datagram socket was larger than the internal message buffer or some other network limit or the buffer used to receive a datagram into was smaller than the datagram itself so i am not sure why you would hang on the 2nd recvfrom if a 6-byte message was originally sent
you should throw an exception on the first recvfrom

6247259
ssl	https
basically anything sent over the internet with ssl is secure but ssl doesn t really have anything to do with encrypting usernames or passwords once your server has received them
basically if you want to ensure that your connection between the server and browser is secure you first test whether ssl https is being used and if not redirect to the same page but starting with instead of the standard put this code at the top of your page it will redirect the user s browser to use a secure connection

6247259
ssl	https
basically if you want to ensure that your connection between the server and browser is secure you first test whether ssl https is being used and if not redirect to the same page but starting with instead of the standard put this code at the top of your page it will redirect the user s browser to use a secure connection
using exit will ensure that your script doesn t send anything to the browser unless _server https on

6248325
floating-point	fixed-point
this is because ieee floating-point is stored essentially as scientific notation so range is favored over uniform precision
if it was uniform precision it would be fixed-point not floating-point. in other words numbers are stored in the form significand 2 exponent so if the exponent gets large a small change in the significand produces a large change in the number and vice-versa

6250027
client-side	server-side
to get the correct client-side element you ll have to use the following code alternatively you can change the asp.net markup to this and pass the div s id and the dropdownlist s current selection to the javascript function
i guess your problem is that the client-side id of the rendered select element is not the same as the server-side id of the asp dropdownlist have a look at the html source code rendered in the browser to confirm this

6255047
rspec	capybara
however you can use steak instead of rolling your own rspec support
capybara does not have built in support for rspec 1.x

6255089
apache	nginx
apache can be made to run fast but it s not the fastest horse out there
you ll do better with something like nginx or cringe cherokee

6256385
google-chrome	firefox
if you really need to use this dll as an npapi plugin things get more complicated because you need a window to load the plugin into and firefox unlike google-chrome doesn t have a dedicated background window for that
but i guess that you only turned your dll into a plugin to be able to use it in google-chrome

6256427
udp	tcp
packet it not a precise term tcp has segments udp and ip have datagrams and ethernet has frames
neither of these have anything to do with how many times you call send on the socket two calls to send does not necessarily mean two tcp segments are sent

6256841
mef	prism
most applications pick one from both categories alternatives to prism + mef for modular mvvm apps
prism is an application composition framework with mvvm features but is not in my opinion a fully-featured mvvm framework

6256890
jar	war
primefaces is just a taglib isn t it with the components backing it in the jar
so you should be able to use the same war and same facesservlet irrespective of whether you are serving mobile pages or desktop pages primefaces mobile and primefaces should be able to co-exist in the same war afaik

6256966
ienumerable	ilist
since it does implement non-generic ienumerable and non-generic ilist you can use to convert the collection into a form suitable for use with linq
however this approach isn t that helpful because the ienumerable that returns is an internal data structure with type

6260739
mvp	presenter
if you re overriding the built in methods you re not using the mvp framework as it s intended
you shouldn t need to override the onload method you should be attaching to the load event in the presenter

6261290
boost	allocator
for example use whereever possible instead of use smart pointers like boost smart pointers my personal favorite make sure you have understood the concept of ownership of a pointer and make sure that everywhere where you use pointers you know which code entity is the owner learn which constructors assignment operators are automatically created by the c++ compiler and what that means if you have class that owns a pointer or what that means if you have a class that contains a pointer to an object it does not own
there are some well-known programming techniques that will help you to minimize the risk of getting memory leaks at first hand if you have to do your own dynamic memory allocator write new and delete always pairwise and make sure the allocator deallocation code is called pairwise avoid dynamic memory allocator if you can

6264687
implements	extends
if the innereveniterator class does not extends any class or implements any interface i think it is nonsense because no other class can access any instance of it
however if it extends or implements any other non private class or interface it makes sense

6265858
interpolation	splines
one of the problems you face is that a splines doesn t usually go through its control points as a kind of interpolation function
minor detail your splines is a bit warped and that s because of your choice of splinedegree

6266557
primefaces	richfaces
if upgrading to jsf 2.x is indeed not an option then you ll have to look for a 3rd party jsf 1.x component library with builtin ajax functionality such as richfaces 3.x not 4.x since it requires jsf 2.x or primefaces 1.x not 2.x or newer since it requires jsf 2.x
richfaces 3.x ships with ajax4jsf tag library which supports the basic ajax functionality starting with tag

6273079
rpm	yum
if not try which java -- on centos it should be in usr bin java if are using the rpm installed version
if it doesn t show up use yum install java-1.6.0-openjdk which should install the jdk and any other required java libs do this with sudo or as root user

6274296
tabcontrol	tabitem
for example take a look at the following tabcontrol tab a will not display its blue background until you select a different tab
if you truly want the background to remain the same regardless of whether it is selected or not you will need to override the control template of the tabitem

6275275
gridview	sqldatasource
here are further informations on sorting some considerations why and when paging might not be working automatically if the data source does not support paging directly and does not implement the icollection interface the gridview control cannot page
for example if you are using a sqldatasource control and have set its datasourcemode property to datareader the gridview control cannot implement paging

6275275
gridview	sqldatasource
for example if you are using a sqldatasource control and have set its datasourcemode property to datareader the gridview control cannot implement paging
here are more informations on why the gridview might not support paging directly edit remember to check for

6277339
hive	hdfs
in the same time i would consider usage of hive - if your sql transformations are not that complicated - it might be practical to create csv files and make initial preaggregation with hive therof reducing data volumes before going to perhaps single node database
i do not expect loading to the hdfs to be a bottlneck since the load is distributed among datanodes - so the network interface will be only bottleneck

6277666
mvp	presenter
in mvp the view is not allowed to think
the presenter contains all the logic

6278623
ienumerable	icollection
it will only work if the object is an arraylist already for example if the object is not an arraylist but some other object that implements ienumerable the cast will fail
you can create an arraylist from an icollection for example this will loop through the collection and copy the items to the arraylist so it s an o n operation

6284908
postgresql	mysql
oracle and postgresql will not both raise errors and i don t believe the sql standard allows it but haven t checked so could be wrong there
let s see how it handles it so mysql deletes the row from the referencing table

6287488
innodb	myisam
i dont know if you have realiased but counting the rows on a large database with innodb is slow even without the distinct keyword
innodb does not cache the rowcount in the table metadata myisam does

6292502
junit	testng
i do not know about testng but junit has ability to plugin your own test executor
i am sure that testng has appropriate functionality

6294265
cassini	iis
i m not sure if cassini has the level of authentication built into it but i m a bit doubtful
i m pretty sure you should be able to use iis express which will be replacing cassini

6295580
equals	gethashcode
if none is specified it uses which calls the object s gethashcode and method or equals if the type doesn t implement
it compares objects for equality using equals

6295775
spaces	delimiter
if not add a everywhere spaces are legal also you can drop all instances of and replace each with
at a first glance everything looks ok but you need to make the regex case-insensitive by adding an i after the closing delimiter and so on

6296502
serializable	deserialization
with the example json corrected as ...then the following deserializes and serializable simply and as expected
in response to a few things in the original question note the following three things gson does not require deserialization to static inner classes

6296948
lwjgl	jogl
maybe you would be better of using lwjgl
latest sources seem to be here jogl doesn t seem to have much activity

6297297
equals	gethashcode
in addition to that equals should be symmetrical and yours isn t
looking into your gethashcode function it is clearly wrong

6297312
hex	binary
the print is turning it in to hex because you re asking it to print the whole tuple and print sees your string as arbitrary binary data
so as to not totally mess up some folks terminals it encodes potentially unprintable characters as hex

6298394
postgresql	mysql
your query would work in postgresql
best i m aware not in mysql

6299421
profiling	debugging
while using ants profiling is awesome it doesn t help if your problem is only seen in production
tess ferrandez has a series of labs that demonstrate how to debugging production problems including memory leaks

6299994
inline	inlining
there are many cases where inlining is not worth it from performance perspective and so the compiler doesn t inline them primarily when the method is longer than just few instructions
there are some cases when inlining is not possible like recursive or virtual methods

6300151
bash	subshell
the pipe is forking another bash process so when you do the increment filcount is getting incremented in the subshell that s been forked after the pipe
this value isn t passed back to the calling shell as the subshell has it s own independent environment environment variables are inherited in called processes but called process cannot modify the environment of the calling process

6302109
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
from the page entitled unchecked-exception the controversy runtimeexception represent problems that are the result of a programming problem and as such the api client code cannot reasonably be expected to recover from them or to handle them in any way
i think you should take a step back and learn the theory behind why to throw a checked exception vs an unchecked-exception

6305380
equals	gethashcode
if the objects are not equals they can go into the same bucket if they are equals then it is already in the hashtable and does not need to be added
gethashcode gets you an integral value that you can use for hashtables

6307137
ati	nvidia
i am not sure about ati chips but i think it is amd_gpu_association
since you are using nvidia quadro cards you can use the wgl_nv_gpu_affinity extension to select the gpu

6310904
uiview	calayer
uiview and nsview are osx ios equivalents but not identical
thus your portability will be better if you use core graphics and calayer

6312854
inline	inlining
note that it is not appropriate for implementations to provide inline definitions of standard library functions in the standard headers because this can break some legacy code that redeclares standard library functions after including their headers
the inline keyword is intended only to provide users with a portable way to suggest inlining of functions

6313438
ienumerable	icollection	ienumerable	ilist	icollection	iqueryable	ilist	iqueryable
you ll find the answer to this question the results view only works for collections which meet the following conditions implement ienumerable or ienumerable vb.net only works for ienumerable do not implement ilist ilist icollection or icollection c# restriction only do not have a debuggertypeproxy attribute system.core.dll is loaded in the debugee process in particular #2 entityset t implement s ilist t therefore the debugger won t show a results view option
using the asqueryable extension method returns an object which only implements iqueryable and ienumerable and therefore will show the results view option

6313569
xna	spritebatch
edit also overriding the spritebatch vertex shader is very difficult xna before 4.0
the correct solution here is to not use spritebatch for 3d drawing

6314656
d3.js	protovis
an outline of how might it look could be as simple as pseudo html then on the server example is gae-compatible microframework flask pseudocode but not that pseudo if none of this overlaps enough with your application space you will at least get something out of this answer by looking at d3.js which is a bit lower level
with your third requirement in mind take a look at something like this protovis interactive graph visualization or this infovis graph example code

6314981
innodb	myisam
i ve never used the innodb plugin as i ve always found the standard innodb engine to be perfectly perfomant especially for reads
not sure why people think myisam is more performant than innodb - it s a conundrum wrapped in an enigma

6315053
ssl	https
this answer goes into more detail about sending passwords over ssl sending passwords over the web you can use php s crypt for hashing
if you mean sending from browser to your server then you need to use https ssl to encrypt the connection not the password itself

6315974
onresume	onpause
activity is start onresume is which you declare in your xml by default
and as i found from question answer on stack overflow is orientation change onsaveinstancestate onpause onstop oncreate onstart onrestoreinstancestate onresume switch to activity 2 onsaveinstancestate onpause orientation change while in activity 2 onstop oncreate onstart switchback back from activity2 onresume i m guessing that because activity 1 is hidden at the time of rotation onrestoreinstancestate isn t called because there is no view it can t be seen viewed

6318299
portrait	landscape
choosing whether to do height or width depends on your image and container dimensions if your image and container are both portrait shaped or both landscape shaped taller than they are wide or wider than they are tall respectively then it doesn t matter which of height or width are 100
if your image is portrait and your container is landscape you must set on the image

6319132
icmp	tcp
the os might keep letting you add data to its internal buffers too but at some point the writes will block. if the peer breaks the connection with a rst or icmp unreachable message a future call to send will return an error value for connection reset or broken pipe
update 2 i m not talking at the tcp level i m talking at the winsock api level this might be the source of confusion

6319667
apache	lighttpd
out of the box lighttpd wipes the floor with apache
but not as many people know lighttpd so getting it to work is harder

6319667
apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd
under heavy load if configured correctly lighttpd will out preform apache i did some tests a while back and you might see a 200-300 performance increase in requests per second
pros fast out of the box uses very little memory cons not as much support as apache sometimes just does not work nginx if you were running a static website then you would use nginx

6319667
apache	nginx
pros fast out of the box uses very little memory cons not as much support as apache sometimes just does not work nginx if you were running a static website then you would use nginx
you are correct in saying nginx s mod_wsgi isn t suitable

6319726
apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd
so use of apache isn t good as front end proxy for long polling application
if that is the criteria though would actually suggest you use nginx rather than lighttpd

6320317
innodb	myisam
but those stipulations apply to a transactional engine innodb
myisam doesn t support innodb style transactions

6320317
innodb	myisam
myisam doesn t support innodb style transactions
myisam has read locks which will prevent writes from any sessions and write locks which prevent reads and writes from other sessions

6320969
serializable	deserialization
serializable not serializable properties that s haven t setters because if serializable serializable such property it will not able deserialize it back
so if you want serializable name property then just add fake setter into icommand need to add it also 2.if you don t want use bsonknowntypes attribute there is another way to notify serializable about know types it might encounter during deserialization

6321544
nfa	dfa
the advantage of nfa s over dfa s is the property to always choose the right path
since you cannot say in an algorithm to choose the right path usually a conversion from nfa to dfa works creating dfa states that symbolize multiple nfa states

6321544
nfa	dfa
since you cannot say in an algorithm to choose the right path usually a conversion from nfa to dfa works creating dfa states that symbolize multiple nfa states
thus when your nfa is in state a and has the choice to go to a b or c then the next state in your dfa would be a b c

6323110
implements	extends
this is the interface definition of arrayaccess you can extends from that in php by implements the interface
that s not extends but implements

6323820
actionscript	mxml
so if you have main.mxml main is a class name for that class and its package is determined by that mxml file path relative to the source folder as in actionscript classes
that s why you should name your mxml classes from the capital letter main.mxml but not main.mxml

6325735
rspec	capybara
since rspec doesn t have a scenario method i m guessing that you re using capybara or steak and that it s really just an alias for it
in that case rspec internally refers to this block of code as an example and you can access the meta data like this you can also put the metadata on the example group the describe block that encloses the various examples

6327361
serializable	deserialization
added note in order not to store an object variable mark the field with a transient .e.g related resources discover the secrets of the java serializable api
i m speaking in terms of java s serializable while int is a primitive type which stores only the value of the variable in binary the integer object using objectoutputstream will store some metadata that when deserialization occurs it will see the integer object

6327361
serializable	deserialization
i m speaking in terms of java s serializable while int is a primitive type which stores only the value of the variable in binary the integer object using objectoutputstream will store some metadata that when deserialization occurs it will see the integer object
yes serializable not only stores the object but also the states of the object so if you store the value is wrapped lack of better word inside integer and the whole object is stored

6331431
prepare	execute
last but not least i would suggest you use a preparedstatement to make prevent your code form sql-injections this amuses you re using the mysqli-class create a prearedstatement with the prepare -method
bind your parameters execute the statement bind the results fetch them

6334083
firefox	safari
you may use ogg vorbis for firefox
it probably doesn t work in safari

6334315
client-side	server-side
you should be able to edit the client-side properties of the control if that control translates to a simple html element
sometimes a server-side property doesn t have a client-side analog however

6334778
onresume	onpause
onresume refresh your data because your app is about to take foreground again
onpause save your data and stop anything that doesn t need to be running while your app doesn t have the foreground

6335372
factors	mean
i don t know why you would expect it to be the same since sift relies on a number of internal twiddle factors which can vary between implementations
finally i am not sure what you mean by convert from scale-space to image-space

6336256
express	node.js
for example my model looked more like this then in my application code i m using express when i get a transaction i want all of the notebooks with author last name s this seems wildly inefficient and hacky but i could not figure out another way to accomplish this
lastly i am new to node.js mongoose and stackoverflow so forgive me if this is not the most appropriate place to extend this discussion

6337784
union	distinct
union not only combines the two queries but also goes through and removes duplicates
it s the same as using a distinct statement

6338747
django	web2py
summary django s is better web2py s appadmin is for administrators only. web2py s are better
web2py has something called admin which is not equivalent to django s admin

6338747
django	web2py
web2py has something called admin which is not equivalent to django s admin
the web2py admin is a fully web based ide

6339968
udp	tcp
the connect on udp socket merely sets the default peer address and you can call connect on udp socket as many times as you want and the connect on udp socket of course does not perform any handshake for connection. hope this helps
it is important to understand that tcp is connection-oriented while udp is a connectionless protocol

6343708
implements	extends
you are implements sendsms as an activity but i don t think that it needs to be and it is not being correctly initialised as an activity so you are seeing this failure
take out the extends activity from your sendsms class and change your sendsms method to start as follows now you ll need to call it as sendsms this 15555215556 message

6344144
queue	fifo
a queue should definitely be fifo that is its nature
the priority queue changes the queue aspect slightly in that it lets higher priority items through in preference to lower ones but that shouldn t change the basic nature of the queue

6344144
queue	fifo
the priority queue changes the queue aspect slightly in that it lets higher priority items through in preference to lower ones but that shouldn t change the basic nature of the queue
i ve seen implementations that profess to be queues but do not follow the fifo rules

6344602
trie	tree
a more efficient though not necessarily space-wise solution would possibly involve using a hashtable and a hash function that acts on the answer choices to create its hash but i think a trie is the best way to go given your requirements and the don t-cares
oh right depending on how the answer choices are laid out it s possible you may have a series of answers on particular branches where there aren t any sub-branches tree for a few levels

6345473
opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
it is not supported by nitro safari v8 google-chrome opera nor internet explorer
according to wikipedia e4x is supported by mozilla s rhino used in openoffice.org and several other projects and spidermonkey used in firefox thunderbird and other xul-based applications

6345578
google-chrome	firefox
document.queryselector #wonderful div nth-child 2 nth-child 2 the following snipped works in both browsers but i assume you know that already document.queryselector #wonderful div nth-child 2 div.blue so it looks like an implementation failure in google-chrome for me
this worked for me in google-chrome but it does not work in firefox then

6345612
implements	extends
these implements methods specified by the event listener will be called back when an ui event happens which will not cause your ui thread to hang
for example public class myactivity extends activity implements onclicklistener and then implement the method also you need to add the listener to the ui widget widget.setonclicklistener this

6347460
activemq	rabbitmq
fuse esb contains a messaging infrastructure based on the jms technology of apache activemq
activemq is not interoperable out-of-the-box with amqp systems like rabbitmq

6348942
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
my bigger beef is that google-chrome uses a 24 hour clock for local time
testing new date .tolocalestring windows 7 safari 5.0 tuesday june 14 2011 15 13 43 google-chrome 9.0.597.98 tue jun 14 2011 15 15 01 gmt-0400 eastern daylight time opera 11.01 6 14 2011 3 15 37 pm firefox 4.0.1 tuesday june 14 2011 3 16 33 pm msie 8.0 tuesday june 14 2011 3 16 06 pm msie 9.0 tuesday june 14 2011 3 17 09 pm they all return the hours minutes seconds in a group so to exclude anything after the time you could another way is to concat the locale day and time strings which surprisingly does not return the timezone on chrome- but your milage may vary

6349143
vbscript	jscript
not sure that it is a good idea but yes you can use javascript actually jscript instead of vbscript
just use activexobject class instead of createobject function that is used in vbscript to create objects

6349300
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
so to check if the current represented as self in the code bellow controller is presented in a modal way or not i have the function bellow either in a uiviewcontroller category or if your project does not need to use other uikit controllers as uitableviewcontroller for example in a base controller that my other controllers inherit of edit i added the last check to see if a uitabbarcontroller is being used and you present another uitabbarcontroller as modal
edit 2 added ios 5+ check where uiviewcontroller does not answer for parentviewcontroller anymore but to presentingviewcontroller instead

6350225
sum	coalesce
then do a sum on the values update as noted when 0 records are returned as t this result in as single result of nulls in all the values
you have three options 1 add a having clause so that you have no records returned rather than result of all nulls having sum active_count is not null 2 if you want all zeros returned than you could add coalesce to all your sums for example select coalesce sum active_count active_count coalesce sum overdue_count overdue_count coalesce sum due_today_count due_today_count 3 take advantage of the fact that as sbarro s demonstrated

6350360
move	drag
cloning the source item should be cloned and not move but using a placeholder - i couldn t find draggable with a placeholder without being removed from list i have a temporary solution with adding the source item on the end of list but that isn t what i want to achieve in order to properly clone the item i might suggest changing your interface paradigm so you have a button that instructs the user with a call to action like click to add or something like that
it would be better to have a button that drove adding instead of worrying about drag drop

6351071
client-side	server-side
there are plenty of javascript libraries and frameworks out there to handle client-side interactivity
codeigniter is a server-side framework so it cannot intermingle with a client-side framework.

6351536
super	implements
super b self .go calls the next method in the method resolution order
it calls the method that would have been called had b not implements the method at all

6351794
spaces	linefeed
according to css 2.1 if white-space is set to normal or nowrap linefeed characters are transformed for rendering purpose into one of the following characters a spaces character a zero width spaces character u+200b or no character not rendered according to ua-specific algorithms based on the content script
according to css 3 a zero width spaces before or after a white spaces sequence containing a newline causes the entire sequence of white spaces to collapse into a zero width spaces

6351794
spaces	linefeed
reality most browsers transform linefeed characters into a spaces
so what you really want is to set the white-space-collapsing property to discard not collapse or to collapse and then add a zero width spaces character before the line break

6352855
domcontentloaded	onload
you can test whether a browser supports domcontentloaded using this page
if you are not using a dom library such as jquery which has built in support for domcontentloaded you could use domcontentloaded and then fallback to onload if the browser doesn t support it

6353011
bash	zsh
and it is not bash you don t need to put quotes around variables unless you specify some option don t remember which exactly always passes exactly one argument to command no matter what is in
to ensure that some zsh option will not alter the behavior put emulate -l zsh at the top of every script

6356928
asihttprequest	cfnetwork
although you did not provide enough informations i d suggest to use asihttprequest for http and asyncsocket for tcp and udp
if an connection was established callback methods will be triggered edit i have to say that my experiences with cfnetwork are very limited but for me it seems as if you are just testing if stream objects exists

6359099
multiplying	addition	multiplying	multiplication
in addition to all the other good answers here let me point out another reason to not use shift when you mean divide or multiplying
i have never once seen someone introduce a bug by forgetting the relative precedence of multiplication and addition

6359678
google-chrome	firefox
i tried resetting the css top please see i tried your code on google-chrome the header stays on top
but when i tried it on firefox 3.6 the header doesn t stay on top

6360381
division	multiplication
my guess is that it was intended to be used in a division to show the above mentioned properties but there was a lapsus calami
in general integer div is not the same than floating point div integer div float div by making space_in_car a float then the results of the operations are calculated as floats no rounding but in this sample space_in_car is only used for multiplication .for multiplication the same goes but the value does not change 120 is the same than 120.0

6362663
opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
here is the revised fiddle tested with ie7 ie8 ie9 firefox opera safariwin and google-chrome
edit if you réally don t want the dummy column i ve managed it to get this far but that solution does not work in google-chrome or safariwin

6364889
ssl	https
in order for sinatra to correctly assemble the url used for redirects it needs to be able to determine whether the request is using ssl so that the redirect can be made using http or https as appropriate
obviously the actual call to thin isn t using ssl as this is being handled by the front end web server and the proxied request is in the clear

6367496
asterisk	ivr
honestly asterisk is not very difficult to set up and get running for something like this
get an inexpensive and unlimited inbound sip channel from callcentric or another trunk provider and write your ivr as the default extension in the dialplan

6369536
interpolation	splines
i d guess that a simple linear interpolation would suffice and the margins probably wouldn t need to be huge but you could determine that empirically
this is a pretty unsophisticated suggestion admittedly but one obvious hack would be to fit overlapping rather than distinct subsets of points and then interpolate between the resulting splines in the overlapping region

6372898
ssl	https
even if you uncheck require secure channel i believe it will still use the secure channel because you are telling it ssl is not required but that doesn t mean it can t still use ssl
for instance if you navigate from secure_page1.aspx to unsecure_page2.aspx it will navigate over https or whatever protocol the first page used by default it won t automatically switch from https to http when you click the particular page link

6372898
ssl	https
for instance don t make login.aspx non-ssl then login-post.aspx the form post action url ssl because that is not secure
i must admit i have done a project where the website was a mix of http and https and we wanted to force the user s browser to use the protocol we wanted

6375475
innodb	myisam
try changing your engine to innodb
your database is probably using engine myisam which will cause foreign keys to not be created

6377113
daemons	systemd
the primary disadvantage to purely in-memory storage is that all your session data will be wiped if when you restart the daemons
in my experience memcached is rock-solid and i ve never had to restart it because of a failure but it is a consideration if your sysadmins aren t used to working that way or if your systemd are updated frequently

6380524
multiplying	multiplication
for instance in javascript to make sure you deal with integers and not strings a common practice is to multiplying a variable by one
in python the multiplication operator repeats strings so is a no-op

6381146
gson	jackson
gson allows for one of the simplest possible solutions
compared to similar apis like jackson or svenson gson by default doesn t even need the unused json elements to have bindings available in the java structure

6381311
innodb	myisam
first i recomend use innodb engine not myisam
innodb support foreign keys in the create table stament include engine innodb

6381573
postgresql	mysql
the update-from construction is not standard sql and mysql s non-standard version is different from postgresql s non-standard version
from the problem here it looks like sql server follows postgresql

6382962
fixed-point	fractions
if this is an issue calculate in fixed-point numbers 1.23 is represented by 123 with a fixed factor of 0.01 or use decimal.decimal
note that due to floating point not being able to express all decimal fractions some results won t be able to be expressed in floating point numbers

6383245
jar	war
and to make it worse the controller beans are not located in the war but in a seperate jar
as this jar is not in the war the jsf annotation processor does not scan it

6383245
jar	war
as this jar is not in the war the jsf annotation processor does not scan it
i guess i will restructure the project and likely throw out the skinny war

6385393
wadl	wsdl
wsdl 2.0 and wadl supports description of rest services and the point is similar as with soap services - describe what you can do with the service but in the rest way
there is no point in wsdl for rest services created with wcf because wcf supports only wsdl 1.1 or 1.0 which cannot describe rest seevice

6385934
division	subtract
note that this formula assumes integer division rounds down . but that is not quite right because every 100 years is not a leap year
so we have to subtract off y 100

6390006
udp	tcp
if you re generating valid ip packets you ll also need to generate valid udp and implement a tcp session with valid tcp packets yourself in order for the application to process them otherwise they ll also be thrown away by the tcp ip stack you ll be testing the lower part of the tcp ip stack on the receiving end
tcp udp this is not that different from sending receiving invalid ip packets

6390579
ubuntu	linux
assuming that you have all the dependencies installed on ubuntu that would be bunch of things like sudo apt-get install libdb4.8-dev and various other -dev packages then this is how i build python
the only modules that don t build during make are _tkinter - i don t do gui apps and would use wxwindows if i did bsddb185 - horribly obsolete version of bdb dl - deprecated in 2.6 imageop - deprecated in 2.6 sunaudiodev - obsolete interface to some sparcstation device i think next i collect any .so files that are not already in the python install directories and copy them over and then add setuptools for good measure at this point i can make a tarball of opt python272 and run it on any 64-bit linux distro even a stripped down one that has none of the dependencies installed or a older distro that has old obsolete versions of the dependencies

6393068
uiview	calayer
set view.layer.masklayer on an appropriate view a uiview containing the scroll view should work to something suitable a calayer with contents contentsscale contentscenter set appropriately
more of a pain since calayer does not autosize itself so your wrapper view will have to do the necessary things in -setframe -setbounds -layoutsubviews

6393269
stateless	stateful
to make this work though you must not call the super pageparameters constructor so that the page doesn t have enough information to build the stateless url
in this example you can navigate to the secretpage through two different links one stateless bookmarkable and the other stateful

6394052
uiview	calayer
alternatively if you re not using a custom calayer subclass and there generally isn t a real need to create your own you can do your custom drawing inside the uiview s -drawlayer incontext method
in order to respond to user interaction the best way is to use a uiview

6396239
implements	extends
i agree with u on some point compare jquery with gi i think they are not the same level jquery which implements the css searchengine provide the plugin structure and some util tools but it is still like component
gi which is the enterprise ria solution provide the mapping utility class interface extends implements structure amp plugin structure i10n i18n etc

onfocus	onblur
if you go with solution 2 it s a naive solution - if you want multiple handlers for the onblur and or onfocus then that method doesn t attach properly and all other handlers for those events will be replaced with these - so it s not technically a safe approach though in 99.9 of cases it will work just fine
there s a few solutions to this solution 1 a return in your onblur isn t what you want with the function the way you ve written it

6397991
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome 12 works as described
i have not been able to get firefox 4.0 or 5.0 to behave this way and suspect this is a bug in their implementation or else the specification was different when they implemented it

6398107
spaces	delimiter
but given your example why don t you do something like this matches your value from 1 essentially deletes the text after your 1 value and prints the 1 value followed by a spaces your 2 value d2.... a spaces and the ending - character
edit finally i ll mention that some legacy unix sed s aix in particular seem to not accept escaping the regex delimiter char but i don t have access to a system to verify that now

6399910
google-chrome	safari
i m not kidding about the security aspect either one security expert i happen to know with a published textbook on how to do security testing has said the only good use for safari is to download firefox or google-chrome
google-chrome is webkit based and works with watir-webdriver

6401441
uigesturerecognizer	uibutton
uigesturerecognizer is recommended by apple for recent ioses
you can use it not only for uibutton but also for uiview especially uiimageview in your case etc

6401515
freemarker	velocity
i would suggest you stick to freemarker for that purpose
velocity does not natively support html-encoding

6401833
inline	inlining
in your case check this condition procedures and functions used in conditional expressions in while-do and repeat-until statements cannot be expanded inline
the delphi documentation enumerates the conditions under which inlining does or does not occur inlining will not occur on any form of late-bound method

6401833
inline	inlining
routines that take open array parameters cannot be inline
code can be inline within packages however inlining never occurs across package boundaries

6402070
robocopy	xcopy
when deploying web applications before i ve used vbscript and powershell plus good old fashioned xcopy though i d agree robocopy is probably a better copy replacement
so going through the requirements - i think this is the sort of thing you want to do this should be done form a powershell command prompt get-service iisadmin -computername targetmachine | stop-service -force xcopy source dest get-service iisadmin -computername targetmachine | start-service i wouldn t use .cab unless you wanted compression for transferring the files then i d use a .zip file

6402409
spweb	spsite
disposing context.spsite spweb objects disposing spweb.parentweb objects this is done for you see best practices using disposable windows sharepoint objects not using output cache with publishing sites not using wsp solutions to deploy custom code changes
not disposing spsite spweb objects you new up in your code

6402698
cassini	iis
however if you are using the visual studio web development server aka cassini then that does not support ssl
the endpoint address if you are iis hosting should be either left empty or a relative address

6403089
setinterval	settimeout
using this syntax is not recommended for the same reasons as using eval delay is the number of milliseconds thousandths of a second that the setinterval function should wait before each call to func
as with settimeout there is a minimum delay enforced

6403884
lisp	racket
racket is actually unique among lisp and scheme in this kind of support but even with others the situation is still far more advanced than in non-lisp languages
lisp not lisp has a number of advantages when you re facing problems that are not well-defined

6405867
awt	swing
that is old awt code which is not used in swing
in swing custom painting is done by overriding the paintcomponent method of jpanel or jcomponent

6406619
gson	jackson
if gson doesn t support definition of field order there are other libraries that do
jackson allows definining this with jsonpropertyorder for example

6407859
stateless	stateful
if your ejbs are stateless it doesn t matter you re fine
if they are session you are out of luck since last time i checked in ejb 3.0 you were not allowed to call multiple stateful ejbs methods simultaneously

6414213
wadl	wsdl
rest has a similar concept called wadl - web application description language wadl specification as pdf - but that s not nearly as well established and widely used as wsdl for soap
if you have a wsdl - it s a soap service

6414511
fiddler	charles
it s cross-platform while fiddler is windows-only
unfortunately charles isn t free well it is you can use it without paying but have to deal with the nagware popups all the time

6414722
vim	emacs
you don t need to use emacs because vim can do it for you i say this because you tagged this vim and not to start a flame war
to do this in vim open your binary in vim and type the following

6416147
dbcontext	objectcontext
because of that i think that whole idea of dbcontext api was management failure
at the moment ado.net team must maintain two apis - dbcontext is not mature to replace objectcontext and it actually can t because it is just a wrapper and because of that objectcontext cannot die

6420848
google-chrome	firefox
it s not google-chrome or safari it s jquery that does the parsing if it sees the appropriate content-type on the response
update and the content-type you ve added to the question is correct. i can t immediately see why it wouldn t be doing it on firefox

6421602
selecteditem	selectedindex
as an example if you have comboa and combob and combob is set in response to the selection in comboa then setting the selectedindex of combob from the view is fine but setting the items or the selecteditem of combob is not - those properties are both data related and should be specified via binding to the viewmodel
the selectedindex property is directly visual related and somewhat independent of the actual data and it is irrelevant to the viewmodel

6421602
selecteditem	selectedindex
things like selectedindex are specific to the way the data is shown in the ui if you change the sort order of a datagrid then the selectedindex can change even though the selecteditem is still the same
in this particular case the selecteditem can be bound to the viewmodel but the selectedindex shouldn t

6421734
dbcontext	objectcontext
you must convert dbcontext to objectcontext by using after that you can access objectcontext.metadataworkspace but the workspace itself was not designed for direct usage - api is highly unfriendly and it is read only
dbcontext itself doesn t provide access to meta model

6422823
extjs	gxt
i was doing straight extjs javascript then moved to gwt with the advent of gwt-ext and later moved to ext-gwt gxt
i would still be doing extjs javascript today if it were not for those two toolkits

6424842
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome is the only browser which supportes almost all if not all column controls
column breaks have never been supported in previous versions of safari - my guess this is still the case

6426046
serializable	deserialization
previous stackoverflow.com questions and answers some with examples on this topic deserialising a generic with unknown compile time type where a field indicates the type parse json with no specific structure for a field with gson json object serializable deserialization using google gson polymorphism with gson
gson does not currently have a simple mechanism for polymorphic deserialization other than implementing custom deserialization processing

6426612
ffmpeg	libav
ffmpeg is implemented in c and has no hooks for other languages out of the box
learning the api for the libav libraries is not for the faint of heart no straight-forward docs provided just read the source and examples and faq but as far as i can tell ffmpeg is basically how video is done in the real world

6426612
ffmpeg	libav
learning the api for the libav libraries is not for the faint of heart no straight-forward docs provided just read the source and examples and faq but as far as i can tell ffmpeg is basically how video is done in the real world
so if you can t find an out-of-the-box solution for python that meets your needs you could use swig or another interface generator to wrap the stock ffmpeg libraries as a starting point

6427843
profiling	instrumentation
if instrumentation isn t showing your slow areas you may be profiling only running threads instead of all threads
using the time profiler instrumentation click the little i next to the track header and then select all thread states

6428558
swift	objective-c
prior swift 3.0 string data yourdata encoding nsutf8stringencoding swift 3.0 string data yourdata encoding .utf8 see string#init data encoding reference
objective-c you can use see nsstring class reference example remark please notice the nsdata value must be valid for the encoding specified utf-8 in the example above otherwise nil will be returned returns nil if the initialization fails for some reason for example if data does not represent valid data for encoding

6429954
g++	gcc
try using g++ instead and edit your errors into the question so we can help better
you should be using g++ instead of gcc also vc++ code may or may not work depending on what the submission is required to do as windows has different libraries for certain things

6430527
ienumerable	icollection
in general pre-generics classes do not serve as useful abstractions for generic classes with the exception of ienumerable
probably because it s not generic and implements icollection whereas is generic and implements

6430804
gson	jackson
jackson doesn t currently have any built-in json versioning support like gson does
jackson issue 108 was logged over two years ago to address such a possible enhancement

6430842
jar	manifest.mf
instead a reference to that jar should be added to the class-path in the manifest
chadneal also if i unzip the jar file that is produced the contents look like this meta-inf meta-inf manifest.mf fecrudbreset.class sqljdbc4.jar the main jar cannot contain the sqljdbc4.jar

6433014
super	implements
if you d prefer not to write the php stuff you d better to migrate this question to super user
in the email you send instead of sending the policy as an attachment you could send a link which points to a php page you state in your question it would be trivial for you to implements this in php where you display or attach the document

6434766
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
a uiviewcontroller s view is expected to fill its window or some frame provided by one of apple s container view controller classes uinavigationcontroller uitabbarcontroller uisplitviewcontroller and so on
you should not add one uiviewcontroller s view as a subview of another uiviewcontroller s view

6435414
postgresql	mysql
even with activerecord sitting as an abstraction layer between you and your database there will be differences between mysql and sqlite and postgresql and some of them will be subtle and the correct time for them to bite you is in the development and test environments not production
a far better idea would be to figure out and fix the errors you re getting from postgresql in development test mode

6435438
postgresql	mysql
mysql will often silently truncate strings whereas postgresql will complain
mysql and sqlite will allow you to have things in your select that aren t in a group by but postgresql will complain

6435438
postgresql	mysql
mysql and sqlite will allow you to have things in your select that aren t in a group by but postgresql will complain
booleans are treated differently in all three postgresql uses literal t and f and a few others for booleans

6436275
mp4	h.264
if you have a h.264 video stream -- regardless of the container mov m4v mp4 -- and your html5 video renders in a web browser but doesn t render on the ipad there are two possible fixes the first solution is to convert the h.264 video stream to mpeg4
ffmpeg -i video_h264_not_working.mov -acodec copy -vcodec mpeg4 video_mpeg.mov alternatively you can select mpeg4 instead of h.264 in handbrake. the second solution is to re-process the h.264 video with the following parameters ffmpeg -i video_h264_not_working.mov -vcodec libx264 -r 25 -b 516k -bt 516k -crf 22 -vpre normal video_h264.mov the second solution came from i m guessing in the former case the mpeg4 codec is more relaxed on the ipad

6436974
google-chrome	firefox
pagex is non-standard and probably not implemented in google-chrome but jquery seems to provide this property in a cross-browser fashion see
mouse events in firefox have both a pagex and a clientx property see documentation at and respectively

6439134
mockito	jmock
i d say the competition is between jmockit and powermockito then mockito
i d leave plain jmock and easymock because they use only proxy cglib and do not use java 5 instrumentation like the newer frameworks

6439134
mockito	jmock
another recent mocking tool is mockito
although it does not attempt to overcome the limitations of older tools jmock easymock it does introduce a new style of behavior testing with mocks

6439306
awt	swing	swt	swing
if swt or awt is used you can get handle of ui components because these two toolkit uses native libararies
on the other hand if that java application gui is created by beans of swing you can not get any handle

6439573
udp	tcp
if you use udp you don t need to since it s a message protocol
tcp is a byte streaming protocol so it cannot send packets just bytes

6442113
ssl	https
the rule is never ever use basic http authentification if the connection isn t https ssl
if your webserver is completly in https no problem see edit on the bottom the clear text password are encrypted by ssl

6442151
webkit	gecko
it is a full webkit browser so you have a full dom bom model and all of the events available to you that you d get in a real browser
note this isn t a full solution because it won t simulate a gecko or ie or opera browser but if you re just regression testing your code rather than performing extensive cross-platform testing phantomjs looks perfect for you

6442481
draggable	droppable	move	drag
on the other hand the drag event of the draggable is raised every time the mouse move and seems appropriate for the task
there are however two problems with this strategy drag is raised whether or not the draggable actually lies over a droppable even in that case the droppable is not passed to the event handler

6442481
draggable	droppable
there are however two problems with this strategy drag is raised whether or not the draggable actually lies over a droppable even in that case the droppable is not passed to the event handler
one way to solve both problems is to associate the droppable and the draggable in the over handler using jquery s data facility and disassociate them in the out and drop handlers now that the draggable knows the droppable it s lying over we can update the element s appearance in a drag event handler the code that follows is a simple test case that demonstrates this solution it basically fills the commented gaps above and refactors common patterns into helper functions

6445380
uiview	calayer
you can only draw inside a uiview s drawrect method or by creating your own image context
you cannot draw to the screen by any means other than drawrect or implementing drawing for a calayer

6446391
super	implements
awakefromnib for appkit mac not true anymore if using os x 10.6 or higher you should call the super implementation of awakefromnib only if you know for certain that your superclass provides an implementation
because the application kit does not provide a default implementation of the awakefromnib method calling super results in an exception if the parent class does not implements it

6446391
super	implements
because the application kit does not provide a default implementation of the awakefromnib method calling super results in an exception if the parent class does not implements it
classes whose immediate parent class is nsobject or nsview do not need to call the super implementation

6446393
junit	testng
junit doesn t support test ordering
you will need to use testng for this

6449453
sudo	passwd
see since sudo su - expects a passwd it wouldn t work
there is a way around it make root logon without being prompted for a passwd

6449953
dbcontext	objectcontext
from msdn dbcontext wraps objectcontext and exposes the most commonly used features of objectcontext by using simplified and more intuitive apis
you can access the underlying objectcontext whenever you need to use features that are not supported by dbcontext

6449953
dbcontext	objectcontext
you can access the underlying objectcontext whenever you need to use features that are not supported by dbcontext
loading the related entities is supported but filtering them is not supported objectcontext.loadproperty so the answer is no for loading only a part of related entities in my opinion dbcontext offers some helper methods

6450730
boost	allocator
-- but i trust you know how to use boost bind or px bind to make it more real-life in addition to the above down to 27 loc even with the free function no more phoenix no more phoenix includes yay compile times no more phoenix expression types in debug builds ballooning the binary and slowing it down no more var ref if_ .else_ and the wretched operator which had major bug risk at some time due to the overload not being included with phoenix.hpp easily ported to c++0x lambda s - immediately removing the need for global variables
this is at least a lot shorter already down to 28 loc no more locals no more fusion vector wizardry no more inherited attributes no more grammar class no more manual iteration using expectation points see other to enhance parse error reporting this parser expressions synthesizes neatly into a if you choose to assign it with but it will cost performance besides potentially allocator a largish array

6450963
subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication
addition subtraction of such fractional numbers is exact and doesn t need any code changes
multiplication and division loses some decimal precision and needs to be scaled

6451936
innodb	myisam
mysql does support transactions but not for myisam you ll have to use innodb or likewise engine if you want transactions
there is a trick you can use and still keep myisam and have transactions kind of

6452120
daemons	systemd
this is particularly true when there are well-written off-the-shelf solutions to the problem milter-limit and before anyone points out that not everyone has access to reconfigure their mta - in most cases these people won t have access to run a daemons in php
this is really bad architecture - php is a very flexible tool which you could potentially use to implement such a systemd - but its not the right tool

6455074
octal	decimal
there s an exception for whole numbers containing the digits 8 or 9 - since those aren t legal in octal the parser will implicitly treat them as decimal even in the presence of a leading zero
javascript treats all whole numbers that start with a zero as octal so the actual value of 013 is indeed 11 decimal

6459528
opera	google-chrome
opera seems to work like that as well but it doesn t like it if you don t call event.preventdefault or return false from the event handler which is essentially the same thing
google-chrome however seems to add the timeout to the queue first and only add incoming messages after that

6460808
gtk	gdk
in the gtk documentation the little sections near the top labeled object hierarchy tell you how the classes relate together
there isn t really such thing as a gdk tutorial since one hardly ever uses it without gtk

6460943
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
note - the limit of localstorage and offline application caching varies per browser. - ie doesn t support offline application caching - in opera and safari you can store more than 5mb of localstorage. - in google-chrome you can check size of application cache by url google-chrome appcache-internals and localstorage in the map localstorage
i have tested this in google-chrome firefox opera and safari and all browser use for both technique a limit of 5 mb

6462560
serializable	deserialization
that said just in case you re doing something blatantly wrong you should post the serializable code for container container smallobject and container smallobject customdata
you should also ensure that it s actually deserialization that s taking 400ms and not a combination of deserializing + reading the data from the disk

6463183
prepare	execute
that won t always work though note that with most but not necessarily all dbms and hence most dbd drivers the statement is sent to the dbms when it is prepare
only the values are sent when the statement is execute

6463194
springlayout	grouplayout
i was looking to break from nested layouts for a name value dialog recently and looked at both grouplayout springlayout
it seemed the only advantage offered by springlayout was that it could achieve the right aligned text of the labels there may be a way to do it using gl but i couldn t figure out how

6469463
lxml	elementtree
for me returns i cannot speak to the descrepencey but i do suggest setting the argument pretty_print to true you will need to import elementtree from lxml import elementtree when outputted to an outfile the spaces and newlines will be perserved
also with print i am sure you have checked out the api but incase you haven t here is information on tostring . it is also safe to assume you have seen the tutorial on the lxml website

6470207
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari
it is not a jquery or javascript problem ie firefox and opera have no problem
but google-chrome and safari exhibit the issue you mention

6470435
ssl	https
since i apparently cannot write a comment i ll just drop my 2 cents here.. beginning with the next release r14 moznet called se7en in the op s post will have support for https ssl and the ability to accept deny certificates
edit the r15 release will have the ssl handling for sure

6475703
profiling	debugging
more details since the official examples are not so clear here is reusable example inspired by this blog post vmacquirer.java connection manager monitor.java actual monitoring required by the application being monitor informations available through jdwp tracing method call and return possibly for doing profiling or logging field value changes vm information see name and description in the example evaluate expression to execute arbitrary code
the jdk has a built-in java api for remote local debugging com.sun.jdi

6476928
postgresql	mysql
well to build this sort of application postgresql is really the best of the two
in complement to scott answer +1 i would add several things sql injections with subqueries is not possible with mysql but you can do sql injection with union queries a bit longer but in term of information disclosure union injections is a must

6478187
jar	war
clearly something has a dependency on that jar file
if it is not showing up in the dependency tree perhaps it is due to a dependency of your webapp war file on another war file that has this dependency

6478484
clang	llvm
-os isn t a valid optimization option for most clang - it s not completely flag-compatible with gcc
the clang man page is authoritative on what options your particular version accepts specifically optimizing by size is not yet a primary concern for llvm

6479305
equals	compareto
the full paragraph reads note that the ordering maintained by a set whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if it is to correctly implement the set interface
... this is so because the set interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a treeset instance performs all element comparisons using its compareto or compare method so two elements that are deemed equal by this method are from the standpoint of the set equal

6480321
setinterval	settimeout
you could also use setinterval to call your quote replacer
then you wouldn t need to manually restart the timer with the settimeout call but you would run the risk our updates fighting each other if an ajax call takes longer than n_seconds

6480762
queue	fifo
you could do something like you may have to use a different kind of queue if the speed of each download is not the same
blockingqueue is fifo i believe

6481946
shadowing	named
another safeguard you can use is to use shadowing in a good way by defining a proper undefined in a function ...some people prefer to give it a different named
if you somehow can t refrain from shadowing the global undefined or can t keep from trying to reference undeclared variables then use if you adhere to good coding practices and believe in letting broken code break use if you want a different alternative you can use ...where void always returns undefined and doesn t rely on the global property

6482384
postgresql	mysql
if you actually removed those dreaded backticks which are not even necessary in mysql most probably the second statement did not return any values because string comparison in postgresql is case-sensitive and your columns contain a captial s instead of s try
the second statement will not run in postgresql due to the invalid backticks around employees - but maybe that is a copy paste error

6486131
istream	getline
one way is to use istream ignore this will skip the maximum possible number of characters up until a newline is read
for what it s worth though you should probably not be using istream getline as it works with raw c-style strings

6486131
istream	getline
for what it s worth though you should probably not be using istream getline as it works with raw c-style strings
a better option would be to use std string and the free function std getline std string buffer

6491262
svg	vml
all other browsers support svg instead and even in ie ie9 now supports svg and only supports vml effectly as a legacy feature
of course that doesn t help you if you re trying to support ie version 8 and earlier as they only have vml and not svg

6491262
svg	vml
of course that doesn t help you if you re trying to support ie version 8 and earlier as they only have vml and not svg
however there are a number of javascript libraries which allow you to work with svg and will convert on the fly to vml for ie which means that of you use svg you can write code that works in all browsers

6493995
single-quotes	double-quotes
c# uses single-quotes to denote a char and double-quotes to denote a string
use single-quotes not double readstring.replace asc_cr

6496034
implements	extends
consider the ienumerable class which array implements but array has members that are not a part of ienumerable like its indexer
in c# and most of .net a class can inherit extends a single class and implement any number of interfaces

6496557
webkit	gecko
i ve run into these kind of seemingly-obvious bugs before with css transitions and they re a huge pain to deal with without resorting to byzantine hacks that are sure to break once the bug they re working around is fixed in this case my webkit fix
i really dug into this but couldn t come up with a clean solution that worked in the three main transitions-supporting layout engines webkit gecko and presto

6496557
webkit	gecko
my guess is that webkit doesn t have the same issue as presto or gecko but instead includes an optimization that gathers style changes applied in the same function and applies them all at once
again pure speculation from someone who s never gone near the webkit source or css3 spec

6499442
uiview	subviews
there you add and remove the tapgesturerecognizer to the uiview that should dismiss the keyboard when tapped
note you do not have to add it to all of the subviews or controls

6508788
mvp	presenter
i think you are absolutely right when you say the view stores the view state in mvp it s simply the way concerns are separated in mvp
in clean mvp view state is kept in the view and not in the presenter

6508788
mvp	presenter
in clean mvp view state is kept in the view and not in the presenter
the presenter can query the view for it s state using the methods provided by the view s interface

6509028
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
to fix that add vertical-align top a couple of times that works and is consistent between google-chrome firefox opera ie9 8
i realise that i m not really addressing the reason why opera displays differently here

6509539
memcpy	strncpy
returns 3 the memcpy function returns the value of s1
when using memcpy the source and destination buffers can overlap while in strncpy this must not happen

6513533
google-chrome	firefox
also the loading code doesn t seem to work in google-chrome but it would be something to look into as a separate issue
there are some small syntax errors that caused some errors if you are using firefox you should try taking a look into using either the built in javascript error console for firefox or firebug or if you use google-chrome the built in console and that should help you debug you re script

6513983
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
you should almost never use sortedlist which is basically an array since complexity is o n for each insert or delete assuming the data is not already sorted
if the data is sorted then you get o 1 but if the data is already sorted then you still don t need to use sortedlist because an ordinary list would have sufficed. instead of sortedlist use sorteddictionary which offers o n log n for insert delete and search

6514314
prepare	execute
after the prepare
you prepared the statement but did not execute it

6515078
rar	zip
for the love of all that s programmy do not rar them
just plain old zip is fine

6515331
serializable	deserialization
the datacontractserializer dcs always serializable the objects as xml but the xml it uses can be both the normal xml with tags or a more compact binary format depending on the xmlwriter you pass to it during serializable and xmlreader during deserialization
another option which gives you more control over the produced xml but it s not as performant is the xmlserializer class which has its own attributes for controlling the serializable

6517854
factors	matrix
construct the 4x4 rotation+translation matrix t by dividing each row of a by the corresponding scale factors
if the scaling is not uniform scale x by 2 y by 4 z by 1 2 you can tell the order of operations by looking at the inner products of the rows and columns of the upper 3x3 matrix with one another

6519881
mri	rubinius
the following ordinary ruby code will make ruby mri 1.8.7 symbol#to_proc slightly less slow than before but not as fast as an ordinary block or a pre-existing proc
however it ll make yarv rubinius and jruby slower hence the if around the monkeypatch

6519881
jruby	mri
however it ll make yarv rubinius and jruby slower hence the if around the monkeypatch
the slowness of using symbol#to_proc isn t solely due to mri 1.8.7 creating a proc each time - even if you re-use an existing one it s still slower than using a block

6520636
implements	extends
create a class extends org.hamcrest.typesafematcher and implements the methods given. add a static constructor method for your class so you can easily call it in your assertthat statement and hand over a example of the object that should not be contained. in the matchessafely method assure that your list contains no object that matches the attributes of your sample
as an alternative implements equals on your object create a sample and then do assertthat yourlist not hasitem yoursample

google-chrome	firefox
if your image width is not specifically set in the tag google-chrome will return 0
firefox and ie will figure out the width but google-chrome will not

ubuntu	linux
answer no it is not - the best way to find it out is to get the very user-friendly linux distribution ubuntu and try it on your own
you can run the system as a live cd without installing anything if you want to test things. after working a bit with linux you get quickly used to it and even developing applications shouldn t be that hard

super	self
the general practice while using super is to pass the same parameters as you get from the __init__ method
in your code you are not passing any of the parameters of __init__ to super chef self .__init__ and hence the parameters defined in __init__ are more or less meaningless

google-chrome	firefox
i tested your code in google-chrome version 12.0.742.100 and it works as intended
the firefox code doesn t work and it s because of margin 0

profiling	instrumentation
aqtime have a free version of their latest profiling it supports .net 4 but i doubt it can do a mixed profiling of native and managed
if you are really serious about it you might look into the microsoft xperf tools they have a steep learning curve but they are free and i doubt any commercial profiling can do what xperf can the instrumentation is in the os not in a separate process thus either vista win7 or win2k8 are required

lxml	elementtree
i don t have lxml installed but the built-in xml.etree library is similar but doesn t support pretty_print
wrap the root element in an elementtree and use the write method

profiling	debugging
i changed all my settings debugging not to the distribution profiling just to be sure i built it again and checked out the embedded.mob and binary as you suggested no go again
i went nuclear - deleted all my profiles downloaded only the distribution build i needed here is when it became interesting - i could not build it on debugging expected but i was having the same problem of profiling not found even when i was in ad hoc archiving mode

profiling	debugging
i went nuclear - deleted all my profiling downloaded only the distribution build i needed here is when it became interesting - i could not build it on debugging expected but i was having the same problem of profiling not found even when i was in ad hoc archiving mode
surely that means that there remains a reference to the developer mode even when i was trying to archive it given that i have already changed all my settings and deleted all my other profiling so i digged up project.pbxproj and found the offending line that was still trying to access my development profiling in ad hoc build

single-quotes	double-quotes
variables are only interpolated in double-quoted strings not single-quotes strings
change those to double-quotes like this this will interpolate the variable into the string so you re now sending call getpicturedataforsendmsg abc1 to the database

aggregate-functions	sum
from the documentation page about aggregate-functions it should be noted that except for count these functions return a null value when no rows are selected
in particular sum of no rows returns null not zero as one might expect

6530371
sum	coalesce
in particular sum of no rows returns null not zero as one might expect
the coalesce function may be used to substitute zero for null when necessary

6530371
coalesce	nvl
the coalesce function may be used to substitute zero for null when necessary
so if you want to guarantee a value returned apply coalesce to the result of sum not to its argument select coalesce sum capacity 0 as for the oracle subquestion well i couldn t find any notion of nulls at the official doc page the one for 10.2 in particular but two other sources are unambiguous oracle sql functions sum of values of n ignoring nulls sum aggregate function oracle sql if a sum is created over some numbers nulls are disregarded as the following example shows that is you needn t apply nvl to capacity

6530443
sum	coalesce
i removed the coalesce inside of sum then the query become fast
just do this select coalesce sum capacity 0 from objects where null is not null

6530443
sum	coalesce
just do this select coalesce sum capacity 0 from objects where null is not null
by the way coalesce inside of sum is redundant even if capacity is null it won t make the summary null

6530443
aggregate-functions	coalesce
and a coalesce inside an aggregate-functions is a performance killer too as your rdbms engine cannot just rip through all the rows it has to evaluate each row s column if its value is null
i ve seen a bit ocd query where all the aggregate queries has a coalesce inside i think the original dev has a symptom of cargo cult programming the query is way very sloooowww

implements	extends
java provides a built-in mechanism to implements interfaces at run-time called dynamic proxy classes
there are also good libraries like cglib or javassist that allow you not only to implements interfaces but also to extends classes and to manipulate bytecode at run-time to change the behavior of a method for example

6532115
apache	nginx
apache will only act when you use svn which will not be so often
if you don t want to put the effort on moving stuff to nginx which i can understand then just move java apps to jetty and use apache 2 as reverse proxy for play

6533269
prepare	execute
it s not the structure you use stored procedures prepare statements etc. that is decisive but whether you are at any point concatenating sql together using unchecked user input
for example you can execute dynamic sql from within a stored procedure in which case the danger is still there

6537022
serializable	deserialization
in addition take care not to have both arrays and generics in the classes from which you serializable the instances with wcf because you ll get a problem during deserialization everything will be converted either to arrayof if you don t change the configuration or to collection type
as result you will get errors during deserialization from the wcf code trying to assign an array where you wait a collection and conversely
