these numbers get painfully large very quickly
here s a solution i put together in java
you ll need to provide two runtime arguments corresponding to x and y

396
dns	spf
the spf website includes a wizard to generate the dns information for your site
check your reverse dns to make sure the ip address of your mail server points to the domain name that you use for sending mail
make sure that the ip-address that you re using is not on a blacklist make sure that the reply-to address is a valid existing address

maven	pom.xml

maven helps quite a lot with this problem when i m coding java
we commit the pom.xml to the scs and the maven repository contains all our dependencies. for me that seems like a nice way to do it

568
int	chars
meaning if you made a new integer you could call some method on i whereas with an int you cannot call any methods on it because it is simply a primitive
so would produce an error because int is not an object
int is one of the few primitives in java along with chars and some others

568
int	chars	int	chars
int is one of the few primitives in java along with chars and some others
i m not 100 sure but i m thinking that the int object more or less just has an int property and a whole bunch of methods to interact with that property like the tostring method for example
so int is a fancy way to work with an int just as perhaps string is a fancy way to work with a group of chars

put	get	versioning	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
this way an upgrade just runs the upgrade script but if we have to recreate the db we don t need to run 100 scripts to get there
depending on how i m deploying the db changes i ll also usually put a versioning table in the db that holds the versioning of the db
then rather than make any human decisions about which scripts to run whatever code i have running the create upgrade scripts uses the versioning to determine what to run

669
hash	md5
with incremental crackers the time depends on how fast you can make the password hash function run
the better you can optimize your password hash function the faster your password hash function gets the weaker your scheme is
md5 and sha1 even conventional block ciphers like des are designed to be fast

877
x86	64bit

you ll need to compile with the target cpu set to x86 to force your code to use the 32 bit version of the vfp ole db provider
microsoft has stated that there are no plans on releasing a 64bit edition of the visual foxpro ole db provider

if you get lazy and don t notify the people in charge of translations or you embed strings without going through your localization system it will be a nightmare to try and fix it later
similarly if localization is an afterthought it will be very difficult to put in place
bottom line if you don t have all visible strings stored externally in a standard place it will be very difficult to find all that need to be localized

1114
put	get
there is no single-point solution to this kind of error
you need to put a real exception handler a catch block upstream of all places where this error occurs and forward it to for example a global handler method class that will determine if it is safe to simply report and continue based on exception type and or content
edit it is possible to disable hack the error-reporting mechanism built into windows so the mandatory crash and burn dialog does not get displayed when your app goes down

1269
cvs	svn

the subversion book has an appendix that details important differences from cvs which may help you make your decision
the two approaches are more or less the same idea but svn was specifically designed to fix long standing flaws in cvs so in theory at least svn will always be the better choice

robocopy	xcopy

use robocopy robust file copy
you get note xcopy is now deprecated please use robocopy

1331
robocopy	xcopy
you get note xcopy is now deprecated please use robocopy
so start getting used to robocopy

emacs	aquamacs
aquamacs is very usable and looks pretty good
supports both traditional mac os style keyboard shortcuts command-o command-s and the control meta shortcuts for those raised on traditional emacs
it is definitely more mac-like than carbon emacs

1517
emacs	aquamacs
i can t speak to the extensiveness of the included elisp packages either
someone syncs carbon emacs with the upstream tree quarterly i think
aquamacs has a more irregular schedule but it s seen some pretty major updates over the last year

1517
emacs	aquamacs
aquamacs has a more irregular schedule but it s seen some pretty major updates over the last year
gnu emacs for osx can be found at emacsformacosx.com
in addition to the latest stable release there are also pre-release test builds and nightly builds and atom-editor feeds are provided for tracking all three release types

1718
phpunit	simpletest
the framework will run all the tests against your code and then report back success or failure of each test
phpunit is run from the linux command line by default though there are http interfaces available for it
simpletest is web-based by nature and is much easier to get up and running imo

1718
phpunit	simpletest
simpletest is web-based by nature and is much easier to get up and running imo
in combination with xdebug phpunit can give you automated statistics for code coverage which some people find very useful
some teams write hooks from their subversion repository so that unit tests are run automatically whenever you commit changes

1821
nunit	mstest
crazy good i guess
for the conservative types me nunit is still available and still more than capable
for the microsoft-types mstest is adequate but slow and clunky compared to nunit

1894
versioning	upgrade
should a client or customer call you with a problem with versioning 1.0.1 and you are using 1.0.2 bringing the database back to his versioning will not be a problem
in your database create a table called schema where you put in the current versioning of the database
then writing a program that can upgrade or downgrade your database for you is easy

mvp	presenter
mvp designs have the presenter access the model and interact with the view
having said that asp.net mvc is by these definitions an mvp framework because the controller accesses the model to populate the view which is meant to have no logic just displays the variables provided by the controller
to perhaps get an idea of the asp.net mvc distinction from mvp check out this mix presentation by scott hanselman

2068
mvp	presenter

i blogged about this a while back quoting on todd snyder s excellent post on the difference between the two here are the key differences between the patterns mvp pattern view is more loosely coupled to the model
the presenter is responsible for binding the model to the view

2069
mvp	presenter

mvp model-view-presenter mvc model-view-controller both presentation patterns
they separate the dependencies between a model think domain objects your screen web page the view and how your ui is supposed to behave presenter controller they are fairly similar in concept folks initialize the presenter controller differently depending on taste

2312
vbscript	vb6

whatever your things are need to be written outside of vbscript
in vb6 you can write a custom collection class then you ll need to compile to an activex dll and register it on your webserver to access it

2562
wmv	flv
don t let me even start ranting about that pile of .
the only other alternative of flash that i would personally consider is silverlight which allows streaming wmv videos
i found the production of wmv much better and easier than flv because all windows flv encoders i tried are not really good and stable whereas pretty much every tool can natively output wmv

post	get

i went back to michael s post did some more poking and realized that i did need to do a double conversion and eventually worked out this little nugget convert.tostring convert.tochar int32.parse encodedstring.substring intparseindex 2 system.globalization.numberstyles.hexnumber
from there i simply made a loop to go through all the characters 2 by 2 and get them hexified and then translated to a string

2862
ubuntu	linux

i bounce about between mac windows and ubuntu and while emacs used to be my editor of choice i m finding that in my old age i prefer to something gui-based using command-line for the shell is still fine by me
my preferred editor is komodo edit which the advantages of being free as in beer available for mac windows and linux syntax highlighting for a boatload of languages including c++ and php i m using it for ruby python and php myself code completion even for classes i defined myself ability to remote save via ftp sftp or scp support for organizing your files into projects tabs and other interface niceties i m not sure how lightweight it is but it certainly feels snappier than eclipse

2883
versioning	upgrade
i used the extra line in my cfg as folows it allows me to xm console hostname from dom0
i think this was from a problem with the xen setup in the versioning prior to 8.04 i m not sure which versioning that was
i m not sure if the same change is necessary in 8.04 as i m an upgrade and didn t change any of my domu configs after the upgrade

2905
vim	emacs	vim	emacs	vim	gedit
further update just fyi i am not trying to push emacs over vim it s just what i use and it s a great editor as i m sure vim is too
it is daunting at first as i m sure vim is too but the question was about text editors on linux besides vi.
emacs seems the logical choice to me but gedit is a great simple text editor with some nice features if that s all you are looking for

3580
installation	upgrade
you can skirt this to some extent by creating installers for the components however with clickonce deployment you have to create the logic to update said component installers
i ve in a previous life used wise for windows installer to create installation packages
while creating upgrade with it were not automatic like clickonce is they were more precise and less headache filled when it came to other components that needed to be registered added

3806
robocopy	xcopy

besides the already mentioned robocopy xxcopy has a free version
its syntax is backwards compatible with xcopy but has tons of additional options xxcopy help x create a 42kb file with all the options available

3869
perforce	svn	perforce	cvs
visual sourcesafe - i m not much in the microsoft world so i have no idea about this one other than people like to rag on it as they rag on everything from microsoft
sccs - for historical interest we mention this the great-grandaddy of many of the above rcs - and the grandaddy of many of the above my recommendation you re safest with either git svn or perforce since a lot of people use them they are cross platform have good guis you can buy books about them etc
dont consider cvs sccs rcs they are antique

3979
mbunit	nunit
nunit does have a litter bit better tool support though
i am using resharper to run mbunit tests
i ve had problems with testdriven.net running my setup methods for mbunit

4087
mvp	presenter

mvp the view is in charge
the view in most cases creates its presenter

4192
int	double
you can still use the double pointer because you probably want to do manipulations on the data structure not the pointer to pointers of data structures call this function with printf my int is d. n whatsmyint array 2 4
output my int is 6.

post	get

a few months back i wrote a blog post about fluent interfaces and linq which used an extension method on and another class to provide the following natural way of paginating a linq collection
you can get the code from the msdn code gallery page pipelines filters fluent api and linq to sql
