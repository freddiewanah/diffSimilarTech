versioning	upgrade

typically your script should require users to install an older versioning of python
python very rarely breaks backward compatibility like when going from 2.x to 3.x so there really is no need to specify a specific versioning of 3.x of course it s possible that the versioning your colleagues have is too old in which case they should upgrade

python very rarely breaks backward compatibility like when going from 2.x to 3.x so there really is no need to specify a specific versioning of 3.x of course it s possible that the versioning your colleagues have is too old in which case they should upgrade
your script can simply check whether a sufficiently new versioning of python is available itself just ensure that you know why you need a specific versioning
if your colleagues have a sufficiently up to date versioning installed and they install the packages from the requirements.txt the package manager will automatically install the versioning of the packages appropriate to their current versioning of python and assuming these are well-maintained packages they should also be backwards compatible

build.gradle	gradlew

after doing some research here and there and spending almost a day on the internet for this i finally found a workaround for this problem apparently i was right on point about the x64 part of the question this was happening because of x64 architecture to bypass this you need to add the following filters abifilters to your app module s build.gradle files
so when your device try to run your app your device will check gradlew file and understands that your device should not generate any folder and use existing native library resources thats your device nothing more was required atleast in my project

prometheus	metrics
you could try to build a histogram of memory usage over time using recording rules looking like a real prometheus histogram consisting of _bucket _count and _sum metrics although doing it may be tedious
something like repeat for all bucket sizes you re interested in add _count and _sum metrics
histograms can be aggregated over time or otherwise without problems so you can use a second set of recording rules that computes an increase of the histogram metrics at much lower resolution hourly or daily increase at hourly or daily resolution

int	double

how to display answer in a statement assuming you have two variables with int values there are several options to turn these into the sentence 104 celsius is 219 fahrenheit you could print each part separately using print which doesn t add a newline or you could print all parts with a single print call print celsius celsius is fahrenheit fahrenheit puts you could also build the sentence by concatenating strings using + as you already tried
but in order to work each part has to be a string so the numbers need to be converted via to_s puts celsius.to_s + celsius is + fahrenheit.to_s + fahrenheit a more idiomatic way is to interpolate the values into a string using you have to use double quotes and finally there is format which builds a string from a template using placeholders d decimal puts format d celsius is d fahrenheit celsius fahrenheit apart from the sentence i ve noticed that your c_to_f method currently does more than just converting celsius to fahrenheit i d write this as and move the output input outside the method this makes the method much more versatile when used without user input 3d means decimal value with a width of 3

this implies we can actually fit a linear model where y is the height of the whole plot and x is the number of rows

now you must take caution while working with they as they continue to push data even when the component destroys

versioning	upgrade

you are using an older versioning of the library
you must upgrade to the newest release

imagemagick	mogrify
but you have not specified any -resize
in imagemagick 7 use magick only not magick convert and not convert
for other tools use magick identify magick mogrify etc

56673509
hive	hdfs
conclusion i feel both are same
but hive is preferred considering direct query on raw data using bi tools or spark
from hdfs also we can query data using spark

56674045
maven	pom.xml
i had hundreds of jars that needed to be matched to maven coordinates
my procedure was roughly as follows look for pom.xml look for the sha1 in mavencentral try to extract artifactid and version from the file name
search that in mavencentral

56674266
multiplying	add
however this strategy doesn t usually work if the amount of work done per call varies as a function of the arguments to the call
after all we can t talk about multiplying the amount of work done by a call by the number of calls if there isn t a single value representing how much work is done
a more general strategy for determining how much work is done by a recursive call chain is to add up the amount of work done by each individual recursive call

56674433
openrowset	openquery
to keep this brief i m just going to give you psuedo-code that can be adapted to your situation as well as those of future readers openquery or openrowset you can incorporate your code above into a stored procedure instead of a function since stored procedures do allow dynamic sql unlike functions
then the select query in your app would be a select from openquery execute your stored prodedure
union all possibilities

56674481
comparator	comparable
ut first your employee class needs to implement the comparable interface
your employee class only method comparator will use the id field to order sort two employee objects


56674881
exponent	addition
compare the exponent and align accordingly the mantissa of the number with the smallest exponent while adding the hidden bit turn the numbers to two s complement
this requires an extra bit at the left of the mantissa to take into account the sign bit and another bit to deal with addition overflows
as a result negative numbers will be represented by a number gt

56674900
temp	tmp
fs path tmp c temp
tmp fs canonical tmp
will remove slash fs path dir_name tmp.filename

56674908
for-loop	loops
ince this is the accepted answer he allowed me to copy he solution so that the answers would be together dynamic iteration counters barmar mentioned in the comments below that the for loops that set a max iteration via should actually be rewritten dynamically
i ll leave it to the op to decide the best way to do this but a good example might be something like as used in the op s original for-loop


56674913
junit	mockito

i had this error when building my junit tests cases
i was having this error because mockito standalone doesn t support static calls

56674954
subtract	add

for subtract_internal ignore the sign bits subtract the magnitudes not forgetting that b must have larger or equal magnitude then set the sign of a equal to the sign of either b or c they will have the same sign anyway
for add_internal ignore the sign bits add the magnitudes then set the sign of a equal to the sign of either b or c they will have the same sign anyway

56675061
luis	bots
he dispatch tool does this by creating a single luis app to route user input to the corrrect model
the dispatch tool is available for bots builder sdk v4


56675098
printf	strcpy

it also depends on the compiler not inserting a bunch of extra padding to align esp by 16 for the call printf which modern versions of the i386 system v abi require
if that happens there will be some extra padding pointers before the real stuff that you wanted to overwrite with a strcpy buffer overflow

56675124
super	self
the values are set
you can skip super altogether
just do this class childrow row def __init__ self row metrics self.assign_rows row metrics or alternatively move the logic out of assign_rows directly into __init__ and again skip calling super

56675129
button	checkbox
certainly want code in form current event but possibly also in examcomplete checkbox afterupdate
there is only one button so vba setting property impacts all instances of button - each record will display the same
it will work in detail section but can be distracting and confusing to user with all button instances disappearing appearing

56675295
folder	directory
the first method is the most simple solution in terms of coding just change an option and open the run folder
the second method is most convenient because it makes the file available in your run directory
the example that i include below is purposefully infeasible with equations and

56675385
botframework	bots

for some reason the botframework does not work well with callbacks which is why you are getting the cannot perform get on a proxy that has been revoked error
a solution - yet complicated - to this is to create a proactive message api endpoint call a request to this from the timeout callback and then execute the rest of the bots calls from the proactive message

56675485
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome shows correct source
firefox has been updated lately so i guess that is not compatible anymore
will see if i can do a bug report

56675749
inherited	subclassing

the problem is that the pyqtslot decorator can only be used in a class that inherited from qobject
you can connect signals to any callable object so the easiest way is to just omit the decorator but if you do need it for one reason or another you could subclassing qmainwindow and define the slot in there

post	get

as alberto mentioned in the post below a rss feed can be used to create an embed code
to enable rss on your linkedin and get the rss link you can follow this guide

56675809
rss	feed
to enable rss on your linkedin and get the rss link you can follow this guide
then you can use this plugin to generate an embed code of the feed


56676134
sequence	permutation
if the order in the sequence doesn t matter either then you shouldn t be generating permutation
again choose a canonical form for the sequence
you can then easily generate only ascending forms and use the same generator once for your parts and once for the whole sequence

56676300
httpresponse	request
echnically a function based view must return a httpresponse object and render just does not do that
i ve changed the last code line to return render_to_response promotions request and a function based view worked like a charm

the following script uses the versatile image input output library imageio which relies on pillow as one of the following script back-ends the output of that script is wrote float64 read float64 if on the other hand you change the format to png in the code the output is


56676918
apache	nginx
ince with mod_php php gets loaded right into apache if apache is going to handle concurrency using apache worker mpm that is using threads and here is a trap for things like setlocale
with nginx you won t have the option to embed php into t


56676957
maven	pom.xml
to build a binary add this interim repo into main pom.xml file right after local-contrib one
then go to run configurations - maven build - dbeaver enter package goal and tick skip tests click run and go have some coffee
as you can see eclipse uses some sort of embedded maven runtime so i guess it resolves things differently

56677043
int	boolean
+ and - which you probably don t want to include
using filter_validate_int would be fine for regular int checks though keep in mind that this will return false for 0
if you want your ids to also include 0 then you ll need to explicitly check for this assuming you want to be a literal string of true false then the way you have it covered at the moment is probably the most optimal approach though it sounds like you re trying to make a boolean check here

56677166
pull	push

ie you d want to pull those vars like and pass whatever pdf.blade.php view needs from your var
this way you can easily push the actual request object into that method and pull the fields you need for the pdf view

56677248
int	boolean
r see the table here particularly the boolean far right column
a string will only evaluate to false if a string contains zero chars an empty string or the single chars 0 zero in which way it behaves like the int zero


56677349
for-loop	arrays
the output of this query is the distance nn_dist between point and its nearest neighbor and the index nn_idx of that neighbor
to compute this for all of your points we need a for-loop but given the k-d tree algorithm this is much faster than a brute-force computation see k-d tree query for more details
then to find the distances that are below some threshold you could use the built-in utility of numpy arrays when using comparison operators like this will give you the indices goodidx and points goodpoints that are within your specified distance threshold distancethres though you may have to change this code depending on the shape format of your xyz coordinate data

56677375
swt	swing
his means that unlike other java gui tool kits like swing swt does not provide swing swt own widgets but allows you to write one java ui that can use with a platform specific implementation of swt for the desired os like windows or mac
for you desired operating system you will want to select the corresponding library version from jcenter swt where the compile line from gradle.build should reflect where for example is org.eclipse.swt.cocoa.macosx.x86_64 or org.eclipse.swt.win32.win32.x86_64

dplyr	stringr	tidyr	stringr

here are few suggestions inspired from thelatemail and chinsoon12 above we are filtering using grep we can also use startswith to do the same you can incorporate both the above options in dplyr chain however another option using dplyr and tidyr would be using separate_rows which might be an overkill for this particular question
we can use str_subset from stringr which is the same as

cpu	processors

but it only gives access to each device...it configures only the device alone not configure the memory cpu speed
it does not give the instruction for that processors or controller

56679885
sse	avx
ut i hope even sse version is faster than your code even sse version handles 2 values per iteration and doesn t have conditions inside the loop
if you re unlucky avx will be slower many cpus need some time to power on you re unlucky avx avx units takes many thousands of cycles


56679900
put	get

you can think of the constructor as that moment while cutting out a cookie where you get to decorate the cookie
only after decoration is complete do you set the cookie on a platter to be eaten like readying an object to be put to work

56679900
put	get
put it in another class named something like app in its own .java file
a main method is basically a necessary evil just a non-object-oriented hack to get our object-oriented heaven launched from the cold cruel world of hardware operating-systems and command-line consoles
separating and basically ignoring the main method can help in learning java

56679967
for-loop	arrays

if you format your code nicer you ll see that the second and third for-loop are inside the first one -- you ll probably want to do them one after the other
also you are just setting value to the value of find if it s found on any of the arrays -- you won t know where it was found first

56680006
aggregate-functions	sum

since you are using group by week date then you need to use that in your select statement along with your aggregate-functions count
you can never select more than what you group by which here is week date plus aggregate functions such as count sum max and so on

look for value in network.host and change value in network.host to 0.0.0.0 this is step if you are using kibana


56680774
pull	push

you can specify your condition as a bash script what this does is prevent a bash script from running yarn build storybook when someone makes a new pull request to master
but only runs when the master branch is built by travis due to a push or whatever triggers yarn build

56681674
folder	directory

posting the solution which worked for me as asked by amey p naik . as mentioned i tried multiple modules but only extract_msg worked for the case in hand. i created two functions for importing the outlook message text and attachments as a pandas dataframe first function would create one folder each for the email message and second would import the data from message to dataframe
attachments need to be processed separately using for loop on the sub-directories in the parent directory

equals	gethashcode
however the reverse is not true equals hash codes do not imply object equality because different unequal objects can have identical hash codes
gethashcode is a virtual function and can be overridden
what you get after calling jsonconvert.serializeobject function a string

56683515
for-loop	loops
in such case you need to skip the results from more than half of the cases
this means that a for-loop that runs through all the dictionary is just hitting an if and jumping to the next iteration without performing really any job most of the time
for large datasets this additional ifs and loops add up to a relevant amount on the processing time and could be avoided if at each loops one starts one index further on the dictionary

56683566
readonly	temporary

using group by which is needed for sum makes query readonly
use temporary tables or domain functions dsum and others or such dirty ms access hack

56683608
versioning	upgrade

the current versioning of helm has a cluster-side component called tiller that keeps track of state like this and the istio documentation does have specific instructions for using tiller
since there is state kept here you can do an update like another valid option is to keep your install-time options in a yaml file tracing enabled true servicegraph enabled true grafana enabled true and then you can pass your install-time options using helm s -f flag helm template install kubernetes helm istio --name istio -f istio-config.yaml this option also works with helm install and helm upgrade and is equivalent to passing all of the --set options you specified

56683777
for-loop	loops
if you can use hsl values you can simply set your s aturation and l ight to a value you like and increment your h ue value on a loops to create a rainbow chase effect
i use this setup in a rainbow script for webpages i created where it would look something like this this means that every run the for-loop makes the counter will go up one changing the hue slightly
as your question isn t the clearest to me i m afraid that s as far as i can help

56684287
post	get
ssue with this approach is if you load this script again in jmeter these values manually edited jmx going to go away get override with your next save but if you are using any version control system to keep track of your jmx script which you must be doing it will be very easy to add this changes in your jmx script again in no time
i will post this with more details once my blog is set up


56685677
submit	submission
these requests are usually so heavy on processing anyway that lowering the amount of http requests may not change the total processing time much
if you want to speed it up you can process all your files locally with tika first tika is what s being used internally in solr as well then only submit the extracted data
that way you can multithread the extracting process add the results to a queue and let the solr submission process be performed as the queue grows - with all the content submitted to solr in several larger batches for example 1000 documents at a time

versioning	upgrade
currently the following versioning of azure devops server are supported for import azure devops server 2019 azure devops server 2019.0.1 you will note that tfs 2018 is not a supported versioning
you will have to upgrade first


56687223
children	parent
he obvious disadvantage here is that since this is happening in the constructor any state changes in the parent component are not reflected in these children components
if you don t want that then this should be moved in render and or componentdidmount update note based on other answers i need to clarify that in my understanding the question is how to pass the index the parent component ends up in after shuffling to the component itself


56687224
inherited	subclassing

exception itself actually inherited from a class called baseexception
in fact all exceptions must extend the baseexception class or one of exception itself subclassing

56688057
squash	branch
note that a force push would generally be required since this option rewrites the history of your branch
another approach would be to use an interactive rebase and choose squash for the commits you want to squash
this option would also rewrite history

56688250
for-loop	loops
solution loops through the arrays already created by var textfinder and create a row for each object
example explanation your var textfinder is already creating an arrays that looks like this so all we re doing in the new for-loop is looping through each item in this arrays the range for each occurrence of cm and inserting a row after that range using insertrowafter


56688301
put	get
here are a few reasons why the form submission is working the first time after a reload maybe the form inits the form with a value on some of the controls and you are not properly restoring to default values after the first submission this happened to me with dropdowns then since your backend is not able to get all the information your backend needs your backend s throwing the error on some property
check the server logs or if you have access to the server code put some breakpoints on your service


56688515
background-image	background-size	background-image	background-position

you can consider 3 elements and background-image
the trick is to adjust the background-size background-position to create the illusion of one continuous image

most likely it would be implemented in web server such as apache or nginx
take nginx for example the configuration would look like


56689460
post	get
t was actually inspired by a snippet in my original post
you can add an extra section to your application s composer.json that get read by the laravel application and used to decide which packages to ignore during auto-discover like this this then allows you to pick and choose aliases from the problematic package and define as many or as few of aliases from the problematic package aliases from the problematic package as you like in your config app.php for my application i was only using the field alias from styde html so that was the only one i had to add to my app config


56689669
put	get

you can put something in the url that tells you the id of the button you clicked on
like here the code to set the url and to get the button id hopefully this helps

56690510
builtin	isinstance
callables include functions defined with def builtin functions methods such as open lambda expressions callable classes and many more
obviously if you only want to allow a certain type s of callables you can still use isinstance with types.functiontype types.builtinfunctiontype types.lambdatype etc
but if this is not the case the best solution to this that i am aware of is demonstrated by the mydecoratedclass.z property using isinstance with collections.abc.callable

56690510
builtin	isinstance
the callable obj builtin is the only foolproof check function to my knowledge
the myclass.z the use property demonstrates this function but you d have to write another modify the existing decorator function in mydecoratedclass in order to support the use of check functions other than isinstance
iterables and sequences and sets the y property in the code you provided is supposed to be restricted to tuples sets and lists so the following may be of some use to you

56690510
builtin	isinstance

i don t know of any builtin alternatives to abc.sequence and abc.set but almost every sequence set object is also iterable as of python 3 if that helps
the myclass.y2 property implements iter as a demonstration however the decorator function in mydecoratedclass does not currently support functions other than isinstance

56690692
folder	directory	folder	dir
ut later you create a container from that image and a container from that image is executed with whole directory being replaced by a host dir mount volumes -  srv app so your docker image has both your files and installed vendor files but then you replace project directory with one on your host which does not have vendor files and final result looks like the building was never done
my advice would be don my advice add second command build to the dockerfile mount individual folder in your container not  srv app but  src srv app src etc


56690801
cpu	processors
with multiple processors this number will exceed 100 you need to multiply by the number of processors available to the host to find the theoretical upper limit
some tools also show system load rather than cpu utilization which are very different in linux
system load increases as processes are waiting to run so you can be at 500 load on a single cpu system if there are 5 processes that all want to run 100 of the time

56691046
superclass	subclassing

it s because of the contract that s established by the superclass
in other words when the compiler validates an overridden method the compiler guarantees that programming against the api of the supertype will be possible using an instance of the subclassing

56691123
serializable	deserialization

with current vs2019 we can simply do this this satisfies ca2227 and can be serializable deserialized
the deserialization works because list has an add method and the serializer knows how to handle a read-only collection property with an add method the property is read-only but not the elements i use json.net other serializers may behave differently

56691219
prng	random
note that there are certain issues unless id or delivery_id can cover a state space of more than 24 bits that is there are more than 2 24 possible values for id or delivery_id there are some colors that you won t be able to generate with any given prng or hash function
your existing code for seededcolorgenerator can generate a string of less than 6 base-16 digits if the random number it generates is less than 2 20 which can happen at a 1 16 chance
this is because tostring 16 does no zero-padding when converting a number to base 16

56691467
keras	tensorflow
so the code you posted is in a sense the old way of doing things in tensorflow
it s worth taking a look into tf 2.0 which actually recommends doing things the keras way
edit after comment by op no a layer is not a clojure

56691565
put	get

from documentation of map put v put k key v value returns the previous value associated with key or null if there was no mapping for key
a null return can also indicate that the map previously associated null with key if the implementation supports null values what does this mean when you add an entry to the map if the entry with that key exist then this will return the last value else this will return null as you get in your example

56691934
put	get
to compensate for this you could invert the logic of your if statement keeping the scan inside the loop with the try catch and put the newplayer into the list after the loop when you ve successfully scanned
as such i think that you could just get away with something like the following code

dplyr	tidyr

folder	dir
just copy them to your target folder under x86 and or amd64 sub directory
|--your app dir |--x86 x86 sql ce binaries |--amd64 amd64 sql ce binaries and you re good to go
looks like the system.data.sqlce.dll can automatically find and load the native binaries

56692435
libstdc++	libc++

in your case that s the gnu c++ library libstdc++
other implementations might not allocate the same amount of memory or c++ library libstdc++ might not allocate any memory at all at least not on startup the llvm c++ library libc++ for example does not do heap allocation on startup at least on my linux machine clang++ -stdlib libc++ main.cpp the heap use is the same as not linking at all against the heap use

daemon	cron
i would suggest using cron which already comes with ubuntu
it s a scheduling daemon that can execute tasks at specified intervals
secondly if you want or need to use python to achieve this for whatever reason i suggest you install a second version of python within wsl

56693279
ubuntu	linux

personally i would actually go further and say that you should ditch your windows 10 python and just go with the wsl python - it makes a lot of things much easier especially if you re already familiar with linux or are using wsl a lot for other tasks anyway
lastly if you still really need to automate this from windows 10 i suggest you use the windows task scheduler to schedule a .bat file which opens bash wsl and executes a command as per the following link how to run program on ubuntu bash windows 10 from windows task scheduler or if you don t need to schedule it you can instead just execute the command from python hope that helps

for-loop	arrays
s stated in another answer i will never be less than 0 because you are defining it as a value greater than 0 in your for-loop
give something like this a try edit the comments are correct in the sense that the arrays will be mutated so make a copy of the arrays first which i ve added using the spread operator also as far as this returning undefined -- the spread operator should return undefined unless you comment out the return statement

my problem was that brew compiled and linked with xcode and i was using a different version of g++ from macports
i just added the xcode g++ location to my variable in my .bash_profile file and unlinked the wrong g++ binary with sudo port select --set gcc none

fold	catamorphism
f your type has n constructors the fold function must take n+1 arguments one value of your type and one function for each constructor
each such function takes one argument per field that its corresponding constructor has or if its corresponding constructor has no fields its corresponding constructor takes an ordinary value which you can imagine as a 0-ary function and returns a value of whatever type the catamorphism returns

swift	objective-c

you are looking at the nscolorspace documentation in swift
applescriptobjc is an objective-c bridge so applescriptobjc makes more sense viewing the documentation in objective-c the language can be set in the page header where your snippet becomes set targetspace to current application s nscolorspace s alloc s initwithiccprofiledata iccdata where iccdata is the icc profile data you are going to use

getter	setter
it only manipulates the returned list which is a copy of the axes used in the chart
in general with qt you cannot use getter to directly manipulate properties
to do so you have to call the setter explicitely

implements	extends

a good solution won t exist unless this or this is implements so just cast it
a extends action doesn t allow a to be anything larger than action

56694074
children	parent
t is up to the parent code to listen to events from all the parent code children and then call functions or set properties attributes on other children
if you use shadowdom then the enclosing site can only change the css of your components if you make certain aspects of the css available to all its children

for-loop	loops

green cloak guy explained very well why a for-loop would be appropriate for your task
however if you do want to use a while loops you could do something like this example usage

ienumerable	idictionary
my recursive solution only checked if there was another idictionary but what ended up happening was that there was an array of expandoobject s somewhere in the tree
after adding this check for ienumerable s it worked and the method now looks like this i m happy for any critisism on this function as i don t know if i ve covered every possibility
feel free to tell me anything that catches your eye which could be improved

put	get
then when you try to download file version from sharepoint online as you do in sp on-premises you will get 403 http error

for-loop	loops
ter.remove will cause the out for-loop to fail with concurrentmodificationexception
instead of doing this you can do this with indexed for loops and a bitset to keep track of things you want to remove this is basically your code but this doesn t do the removal yet

submit	submission
he best thing a website can do on that level to protect a form from any injected javascript code is to hide a key maybe an anti-csrf key and use a key maybe an anti-csrf key when submission the form
on any other case when there is no key or when you can access and read the key you can just re-create the hole form and submit a key maybe an anti-csrf key or even just fake the request to the server

put	get
our page that will start the video will contain some placeholder element that will serve as a guiding point where to put the video we then use lifecycle hooks to get the correct url and styling to send to the player
i use a simple bus to more easily pass events around the application as a simple bus would generally be a hassle to get the data to the player component otherwise


56694538
int	double
if the important part of your result is the most-significant bits and having the low 9 int bits rounding error is ok after converting back to int then float is perfect for you
if float doesn t work double may be an option
divpd is about twice as slow as divps on many cpus and only does half as much work 2 double elements instead of 4 float

56694654
int	chars
wrapper classes for numeric primitive types like int double so if you have num + str operator + will represent concatenation and you will get string
but in case of num + chars operator + will represent addition and will return numeric value like system.out.println 1+ will be treated as 1+32 so 33 will be printed
so if you use with + you are guaranteed that it will be concatenation while meaning of + with will depend on second argument

children	parent

ok but then when you execute something like session.query models.yourmodule.yourparenttable .filter conditions .delete it actually triggers an error about a foreign key used in your children tables

deselect	multi-select
if we look at how other uis manage multi-select it is actually 2 lists side-by-side

unfortunately string s aren t indexed with int so you need to provide a string.index value output abdefg bdefg befg bfg bf f method 2 use prefix and dropfirst to construct a new string alternatively you could use prefix and dropfirst to select parts of your original string to construct a new string
both of these methods return type substring so it is necessary to call string after concatenating the parts output abcdeg abcde acde acd cd c method 3 turn str into if you re going to repeatedly add remove and change chars consider turning your string into an

put	get

you can understand how data are represented in memory when you access data through data address and the result what their address does is put 0x46c35000 into int i copy address of i into faddr which is also address that points data in memory in this case of float type print value pointed by faddr
treat their address as float type you get your 25000.0

the parseint function converts its first argument to a string parses that string then returns an int or nan
parseint if parseint encounters a chars that is not a numeral in the specified radix it ignores it and all succeeding chars and returns the int value parsed up to that point

clearinterval	settimeout
ecause settimeout returns a number corresponding to the unique id of the timeout that is what the number you re seeing is - the id of the outermost settimeout
this id is useful to have because it means you can then pass it to cleartimeout or clearinterval to clear the existing timeout or interval you d see the same sort of output with this code where the id is explicitly assigned to a variable and then evaluated again on the last line

multiplying	multiplication
e can create a function that masks all but the top k elements row wise as follows unfortunately tf.map.top_k does not let we specify the dimension but we can of course replicate this column wise by first transpose x then transpose the result with tf.transpose explanation we can get there by creating a mask of ones and zeros and then multiplying element-wise
so for example considering the case where and we have the following matrix then we can use the tf.math.top_k function to get the indices of the top 2 values in each row of the matrix now we use a little trick to first one_hot encode these then to reduce_sum these across the second to last dimension to create our mask now we can just do a hadamard element-wise multiplication to get the desired result putting this all together we can create a function that masks all but the top k elements row wise as follows

intrinsics	inlining
this is due to the generic nature of a jni call and the need to check and map arguments results between java corresponding c c++ types .

in particular the call to super.init in my subclass init was probably creating a broken instance
moreover if i create an instance using the default class method i get the value __nscfurlsessionconfiguration which indicates pretty clearly that nsurlsessionconfiguration is likely implemented as a class cluster and this is probably the reason why customsessionconfiguration wasn t inheriting property accessor

post	get

first of all in your php code you are getting input via and in your code you are sending a post request which is counter intuitive
what you can do is when certain parameters are passed either through query string or request body with a post request you can write your desired output and call die to not display the rest of it which will interfere with the response you get

filtering	grouping

your activity fragment xml will look like you adapter xml for recyclerview will look like you should use chips for your filtering tag
you can add chips dynamically to your chip grouping

margin	height

here are two potential side effects to consider margin collapsing which is a feature in a block formatting context doesn t exist in a flex formatting context
see margin collapsing in flexbox since you plan to set a percentage height height 99 on the container make sure the parent has a defined height

tostring	getter	tostring	getter
the intention of the tostring method is to provide a programmer readable representation of your class
you shouldn t include any method calls in this method including getter
in fact i would consider not autogenerating these methods smelly but assuming you are not comfortable or able to use an ide that would produce them for you i would recommend including a reference to all the fields on the object and the class name of the object as is done by the intellij tostring method

56707896
put	get
ython will do this for you quite easily put the names into a set and then just check to see whether the new name you generate is already in a set
make new choices until you get one you haven t yet used


56707897
put	get
if there is not a large likelihood of one condition occurring more frequently than the other then we can consider the evaluation itself
for example if an int comparison is faster than a string comparison then put the int comparison first
also your code doesn t need a separate line to get the sum

56707907
stdout	stderr
we can create a solution that allows for the following example usage plus providing return code where you will have the results of the executions in a list where each list element is in return a list of 3 strings indexed as 0 stdout 1 stderr and 2 return code
so in order to print for example the stderr results of the third destination apa bepa you can do mapfork.sh is shown below


56707989
swift	objective-c
now i suspect you re going to read all of this and say but i want to use protocol-oriented patterns and generics but while those are great swift features you just shouldn t fight uikit s inherently oop design
behind the scenes uikit is still objective-c and swift-only patterns will not offer the interoperability that you really want
perhaps as you shift to swiftui you can revisit this but as long as you re using uikit stick with the native oop patterns of the uikit

uninstall	downgrade
after reading this post and some other i downgrade it to sdk 2.2.1xx and the error went away
note i had to uninstall sdk 2.2.300 and restart after installing sdk 2.2.1xx


56708320
super	self

because super is a pseudo-variable pointing to the receiver of the message
super and self point to the same object and have the same identity

56708382
super	implements

let s see some examples before analyzing your case example 1 classa implements msg classb implements msg classc implements msg this means that the inherited version of msg is overridden in classb and classc
in this case i m assuming msg is not implements above classa example 2 classa implements msg classb does not implements msg classc implements msg then example 3 classa implements msg classb does not implements msg classc does not implements msg here so the semantics of super is start the lookup in my superclass

56708382
super	self	super	self	super	implements	super	implements
in this case i m assuming msg is not implements above classa example 2 classa implements msg classb does not implements msg classc implements msg then example 3 classa implements msg classb does not implements msg classc does not implements msg here so the semantics of super is start the lookup in my superclass
which is the same as sending self class because class is not implements in sub which is sub
and since sub new print_superclass sends super class from sub you get sub

56708415
mouse	trackpad
i had to do this even though i had uninstalled and reinstalled java
another weird symptom i had was that in the java control panel applet if i unplugged and plugged back in my mouse receiver usb then i could click on buttons that were in the current frame and above but not child frames
however this is not solely a usb issue because my mac built in trackpad was not working either

56708880
for-loop	loops

but it s the same thing on a smaller scale get_reverse_iterator is called on the root node of lst the root node i ll call it nodea has a .next get_reverse_iterator is called on the next node which i ll call nodeb nodeb has a .next get_reverse_iterator is called on the next node which i ll call nodec nodec does not have a .next get_reverse_iterator nodec skips the for-loop and yields nodec.data which is c get_reverse_iterator nodeb catches c inside the for-loop and yields it get_reverse_iterator nodea catches c inside the for-loop and yields it c gets assigned to x and it gets printed
the next iteration of the outer loops happens and execution returns to get_reverse_iterator nodeb the for-loop ends because get_reverse_iterator nodec has stopped yielding things get_reverse_iterator nodeb ends the for-loop exits the if block and finally yields nodeb.data which is b get_reverse_iterator nodea catches b inside the for-loop and yields the for-loop b gets assigned to x and the for-loop gets printed

56708967
dictionary	map
while you can t use a dictionary to do this since those can only store python objects you can use a map or unordered_map which should perform slightly better
unfortunately you cannot use convenient python dictionary syntax to initialize all of the values of the dictionary and instead must add items one by one
here is that approach in action

56709058
int	chars	printf	getchar
this is why you re getting negative times
which returns time in sec.usec format that should be precise enough note that you need to declare elapsedtime as double instead of int and also replace the second d in the printf with f
you also need to consider that keyboard input is buffered which means you re blocked in getchar until enter is pressed then the buffer is fed to getchar one chars at a call

56709302
inherited	properties
ot only can a function be called but a function can also have properties just like a plain object
you can think of a function like the function object inherited from the plain object


56709341
polymorphism	specialization
ou can also benefit from both approaches and provide both polymorphism and monomorphic implementations with the latter being a specialization of the former this is how maps and sets are implemented in js base core
there is a polymorphism type for a set type a comparator_witness set which is a binary tree coupled with a compare function which is reflected in the set type by the comparator_witness type so that for each comparison function a fresh new type is generated thus preventing set.union et al operations between two sets that have different compare function stored in two sets that have different compare function stored in them

stringbuilder	bufferedwriter

rewrite this block code my mistake was incorrect inclusion stringbuilder and incorrect inclusion stringbuilder broken the display of file items
after reinstall app - bufferedwriter new filewriter filename true works perfect to add new items in my file

56710542
stdout	stderr	fflush	gets

you need to fflush stdout on every write
otherwise your print gets buffered and written at once when program ends edit you can run your script by invoking python with -u flag -u force the binary i o layers of stdout and stderr to be unbuffered

56710556
stdout	fflush
basically print is buffering stdout
you need to fflush the output on each iteration


56711194
ready	each
each formgroup will have a name formcontrol and a quantity formcontrol
so what can be done is you can transform the actual data to make it form ready
and if you want the data in the previous format you can again transform the form data to the structure that you want

56711483
getter	setter

from the question description it is not needed to support updating the email address separately but just following this example here if we run because email is a property it is triggering the setter to set the value to the _email variable
going back to the details method in chepner s answer by doing self.email we are triggering the getter to return the email address which is dynamically generated in that return statement

56711656
sudo	passwd
his will ask your sudo passwd then your sudo will ask passwd for the remote share
let your sudo assume you created winshare folder inside your home folder


56711659
int	chars

this is simply msvc being behind the rule in c++03 was that any constant expression of int type and value 0 was a null pointer constant and could thus be converted to
certainly chars qualifies and means the same thing although it never overlapped with the rule

56711720
post	get
or your more post function you only need to specify an offset and can add your additional post right in your more post function
i have not tested this but this should get you closer to a working set


56711745
post	get
but since vertices are shared between faces in any model other than a single triangle things get a little complicated
or for fun do this as a post processing step
look for high ddx ddy or dfdx dfdy depending on your api values in your fragment shader

maven	pom.xml
it is one of the rule which maven follows to manage transitive dependencies
it will put commons-lang in the dependency tree according to its nearest definition in the pom.xml
you can read about all the rules here so to quote them dependency mediation - this determines what version of an artifact will be chosen when multiple versions are encountered as dependencies

subclass	inherited
subclass is the liskov substitution laws
it in essence states that every subclass of a class x must be usable in x s place and the program should still work
this is why a square and a rectangle should never stand is an inherited relation one needs only one property to be defined length while the other needs two width height

oncreate	ondestroy
oncreate is basically the lifecycle function which is called when you are initializing an activity or starting an activity
if you are getting the exception while your application goes into the background then pay close attention to the onpause and ondestroy function
i guess these two are trying to pass some intents to other activities or services which is causing the error

this adapter from my other project so you create interface in your adapter and also declare this adapter from my other project in local mclicklistener and implements this adapter from my other project in viewholder class and setonclick where you create the viewholder just note that i set this adapter from my other project on a button but you can set this adapter from my other project on itemview also on any view that have the setonclicklistener so you can use itemview.setonclicklistener this
then from your activity or fragment and wherever using the adapter just implemet the onlick interface and after initializing the adapter use the method that we created public void setclicklistener in our adapter to local interface in the adapter activity public class childreneditdialog extends dialog implements ichildren.iview childrenrvadapter.itemclicklistener and in activity oncreate or somewhere else and you have onlcick in your activity fragment dialog etc.

my thought had been that i only cared about one dimension the height in this case so the content could determine the width
setting only the height meant that nothing changed
you have to change both height and width

put	get

when you put ++ or -- after the variable name it s called postincrement or postdecrement and means that the returned value is the old one
to get the new value instead you need to preincrement or predecrement so do ++vocal and --vocal instead of vocal++ and vocal--

for-loop	arrays
f you take the values contained in that object than got yourself an iterable and you can use you take the values contained in that object in a for-loop
second_column.values is an iterable rmse of a series is not an arrays you take the values contained in that object s a single value therefore a list comprehension won t get you there

your row heights are insufficient to trigger an overflow grid-template-rows min-content minmax min-content max-content min-content but something like this would work grid-template-rows 10 80 10 unfortunately the code above only works in google-chrome
for the layout to also work in firefox and edge do this grid-template-rows 10 minmax 0 80 10 basically you need to find some way to set a fixed height limit on the overflow row for the scrollbar to function
for an explanation of the browser differences described above see these posts prevent content from expanding grid items how come minmax 0 1fr works for long elements while 1fr doesn #39

inline	inlining
there usually are compiler-specific ways to force inlining since the compiler is allowed to ignore the inline keyword
you should be profiling the code before trying to inline things
see the answer to this question

56718617
for-loop	arrays
so in this case you are creating a buffered channel using 5000 as length
as you can see i ve commented in the code after 1st iteration the for-loop gonna block until channel is empty
in this case after fetching jump it sends the arrays corresponding similar words but after that as the for-loop is blocking as zerkems explains you will not get to next iteration i 2

56718617
for-loop	loops
also you can see that i ve moved down the for-loop outer and use original one to just add words to workers
it will ask to fetch all words and will wait in the following loops to complete there tasks in a non-blocking way
latter loops waits until all workers are done

56718624

x86 has been around so long that the original calling conventions stack args with no register args were inefficient so various 32-bit conventions evolved
and microsoft chose a different 64bit convention from everyone else
so there s x86-64 system v windows x64 i386 system v for 32-bit x86 aarch64 s standard convention powerpc s standard convention etc

56719092
hive	hdfs
you may right your output to either hive external table or temp hdfs location
use fetchsftp processor to read file from temp hdfs location and continue with your further nifi operations
here you need livy setup to run spark code from nifi through executesparkinteractive

56719124
sqoop	hadoop	hive	hdfs

when you run sqoop generally sqoop first loads the data from your external database then store that as a multi-part file at the given location --target-dir goldman yahoo then from that location to hive table --hive-table topclient.mpool now you can have access denied at 2 level
1 if you see access denied at file location goldman yahoo then set filelocation access to 777 running as hdfs user - sudo -u hdfs hadoop fs -chmod 777 goldman yahoo 2 if you see access denied while creating table run sqoop command as user hive beacuse the user hive has access to hive tables

56719147
eventlet	gevent
the issue seems to be how grpc and gevent work or don t work together and the quickest fix was to use another gunicorn worker
tested that at least sync eventlet and gthread workers prevent this error from occurring
gunicorn -t 300 -b 8080 -k eventlet -w 4 app example_app

56719287
move	drag
he move finder items action doesn t appear to work with variables in this situation even though you can drag and select them - when using a variable it defaults to the desktop
as a workaround you can replace the move finder items action with a get value of variable for pdfpath to add it to the move finder items then add a run applescript action to do the moving you might also have to clean out previous results from the temporary folder to keep the rename action happy


56719308
pandas	seaborn

pandas uses matplotlib as a library for basic plots
the easiest way in your case will using the following however i would recommend to use seaborn as an alternative solution if you want have more customized plots while not going into the basic level of matplotlib

56719456
vsto	add-in
see walkthrough create your first vsto add-in for outlook to get started quickly
web add-in provide a limited capability for ui customization


56719566
uiview	uistackview	uiview	uistackview	uilabel	uistackview	uilabel	uistackview
set the uilabel.amountoflines 3 add another uiview to the uistackview beneath the label
configure auto layout to have the uilabel intrinsic content be with with higher priority than the uiview
set the uistackview height to be constrained exactly to 3 lines height

56719602
firepath	firebug

the same accounts for firepath
so you would need to download firefox 56 and firebug 2.0.19

56719678
migrate	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
check the note this release is a major versioning update and includes breaking changes. with this release libraries are migrate from the android support libraries to the jetpack androidx libraries
the updated libraries will not work unless you make the following changes in your app upgrade com.android.tools.build gradle to v3.2.1 or later
upgrade compilesdkversion to 28 or later

56719787
for-loop	loops
loops variant is trivial as the variable i will increase by the definition of the for-loop
hence loops variant can be omitted
below is an example of a function no_primes that searches the given list l for primes and returns true if none are found

56720228
spaces	linefeed

you can do this with regular expressions explanation of the regex trim leading and trailing white spaces options case sensitive
match at line breaks assert position at the beginning of a line at beginning of the string or after a line break character linefeed linefeed line separator paragraph separator match a single character that is a whitespace character ascii spaces tab linefeed carriage return vertical tab form feed between zero and unlimited times as many times as possible giving back as needed greedy match the regex below and capture the regex match into backreference number 1 match a single character that is not a whitespace character ascii spaces tab linefeed carriage return vertical tab form feed s match any single character that is not a line break character linefeed between zero and unlimited times as many times as possible giving back as needed greedy match a single character that is not a whitespace character ascii spaces tab linefeed carriage return vertical tab form feed s match a single character that is a whitespace character ascii spaces tab linefeed carriage return vertical tab form feed between zero and unlimited times as many times as possible giving back as needed greedy 1 insert the text that was last matched by capturing group number 1 created with regexbuddy on the other hand if you want to avoid regular expressions and if your only leading trailing white-space characters are spaces tab and linefeed and if the only internal white spaces characters are the spaces you could use note that the vba trim function unlike the worksheet function only removes leading and trailing spaces and leaves internal spaces unchanged

56720433
implements	extends

you can implements a bindableobject wich takes a publisher as initializer parameter
and extends publisher with a convenience function to create this bindableobject

56720590
put	get
- again put the removed element stored in the container to the set set 8 10 11 12 now shift your window - delete 12 from the set and add 4
- now you will get the new window and set
- check like the similar process

56720625
inherited	properties
this will consume more memory resources
in addition to increased memory resources defining methods inside of the constructor function eliminates the possibility of inherited
again the method will be defined as a properties on the newly created object and no other object so inherited cannot work like

56720625
inherited	properties

hence javascript provides the prototype chain as a form of inherited making javascript a prototypal language
if you have a parent and a parent shares many properties of a child then a child should inherit those properties

56720625
inherited	properties
since the prototype is a live link by changing the properties of one object in the prototype chain you d be changing same properties of another object as well
obviously changing a child s inherited method should not change the parent s method
object.create resolved this issue by using a polyfill

56720666
put	get
also note that you get the correct output if you don t use time.sleep i also happen to get the correct result if i put the process to sleep for a very short time with time.sleep .1
on an unrelated note you should probably change to or you might get problems when i is a two-digit number


56720846
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
but got interrupted and can t remember what it was. consider this test script run on firefox and google-chrome
safari and opera should give same results
microsoft edge probably gives same results

56720915
strlen	strncpy

next is strlen temp_name_input which is called twice before temp_name_input is a valid string so the result is bogus
check carefully what strncpy does - it does not generate a terminated string if your source string has more than 3 characters which is true in your case

56721099
post	get

i found a solution to my problem from a post by rdt0086
the solution to my problem is to get all the data and count my problem what this seems to do is exactly what i was looking for my problem counts a range of rows from the first row with filled data the header row to the last row with filled data

56721186
for-loop	loops
as for your error you re adding series to your linechart at the end of every iteration of your for-loop
move that code outside loops either before or after
note that linechart is also a generic type

56721208
int	double

you used d in in the strings.xml and therefore the strings.xml expects an int
however you are sending a double so the error occurs

56721429
calloc	malloc

syntex argument if you consider malloc syntax it will take only 1 argument
if you consider calloc syntax it will take 2 arguments

56721429
calloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
if you consider calloc syntax it will take 2 arguments
manner of memory allocation malloc function assigns memory of the desired size from the available heap
calloc function assigns memory that is the size of what s equal to num size

56721826
inherited	properties

javascript is a language having a form of inherited which is called prototypal inherited
the idea behind it is that given an object an object has an hidden properties called prototype which is a reference to another object which is said to be the prototype object

56721916
range	minimum
ith the minimum and maximum you d expect bands to overlap unless there is a dominating feature
the standard error of the mean is likely too tight to be useful it indicates how much the mean is expected to change if you add a data point so any cluster difference in this range is entirely random but the clusters aren t independent


56722088
versioning	upgrade

since the error message indicates that configuration with name testimplementation not found i think you re most likely running the gradle build with the wrong gradle versioning
please upgrade to the lastest gradle versioning and try again

56722166
junit	mockito
so don t use springboottest but only junit and mockito
for example with junit 5 of course the resttemplateservice should also be unitary test and unitary tests don t relieve from writing integration tests for higher level components


56722251
width	height

you can capitalize on the fact that percentage-based paddings always refer to the width of the parent element even if applied to padding-top and or padding-bottom
so you could work with a height 0

56722344
post	get
i assume that you want to post data given by a form
that would be an applicable way in my eyes views.py index.html you may want to hide the form if the user sends a get request
you can do that by wrapping the wohle form into an if-clause like if valid_data_submitted .

56722855
swift	objective-c

as of 24th of april 2019 the facebook sdk in swift repo inside this commit removed bolts from swift sdk so you will have to add bolts to your pod file
fyi if you re using swift 5 you will need to use bolts in objective-c because currently bolts for swift only support swift 4.1

56722855
swift	objective-c
fyi if you re using swift 5 you will need to use the bolts in objective-c because currently bolts for swift only support swift 4.1
for swift 5 in your pod file pod bolts to answer your question from bolts github bolts is a collection of low-level libraries designed to make developing mobile apps easier
bolts was designed by parse and facebook for our own internal use

56723020
pandas	seaborn
so if you are using pandas for basic plot you can use matplotlib for plot customization
however i propose an alternative method here using seaborn which allows more customization of the plot while not going into the basic level of matplotlib
working code

56723148
folder	directory
therefore the following applies to include your desired directory
the argument informs cmake about this particular folder to use first rather than the other cv folder
for cmake higher than v2.8 you should not use the include_directories but rather the following

56723200
put	get
you simply get a longer sequence of digits this would happen even if we limited the d pattern to only match up to 3 digits with
if you wanted to make the padding width configurable you can put everything in a nested function and use string formatting
you don t really need demo

56724472
fadein	fadeout
hat is one of the wait you could do it but also if you just want an fadeout fadein you can work with an animatedopacity
like this this is a easy way to do a fadeour fadein as i said if you need a complete animation and more control in it definitely you should use an animationcontroller


56724623
octal	binary

a leading 0 introduces an octal constant so 010 is octal which is 8 in decimal
if you want binary write 0b010 which is 2 in decimal

56724813
cashapelayer	uibezierpath
so imagine that you had a single cashapelayer called mainarclayer for the big arc
and an array of uibezierpath called smallcirclepaths for all of the small circles
you could then create a mask in layoutsubviews of your uiview subclass or viewdidlayoutsubviews in your uiviewcontroller subclass like so that yields this is a slightly more generalized solution to this problem

56724938
for-loop	loops
f you re trying to take a queryset and pass a queryset as context to a template to then iterate through in a loops such as in views.py in subscriptions.html you will get the error feed object has no attribute __name__ when changing the template to show result_list without the for-loop such as i saw a the same output as the op this is what the renderer outputted in my case the renderer outputted in my case was feed object instead of rooms object
when originally trying to loops through result_list the error arose when the template renderer thought the string feed was a column of the queryset or the instance of an object in and of renderer and then tried to determine what to call renderer in a dictionary-like data structure


56725808
post	get

edit with the correct approach sorry i just realized you are using modelserializers instead of serializers you need to change from to and check the documentation of primarykeyrelatedfield as it includes some different options that might be interesting for the design of your api most likely you will need the option so you don t need to override any method original answer with a bit of explanation you are getting the error because the post is trying to create the nested objects but your serializer does not override the .create method so your serializer does not know how to handle the nested relationships
take a look on where you can get a grasp of what you need

56726129
google-chrome	firefox

you need to add setback for different browsers for example these are the vendor-prefixed properties offered by the relevant rendering engines -webkit for google-chrome safari
-moz for firefox -o for opera -ms for internet explorer

56726129
opera	firefox
moz for firefox -o for opera -ms for internet explorer
typically opera -ms re used to implement new or proprietary css features prior to final clarification definition by the w3


56726179
migrate	upgrade

the answer that ahmed posted is a great solution once you ve migrate to androidx
in my case i didn t want to quite yet and found out that only one library in my application was using androidx from this thread in short my solution was to simply yarn upgrade react-native-device-info latest the app build as expected after rebuilding it

56726241
sorting	filtering

my desperate solution to this was to manipulate my file2 into this using some basic awk operations a 1 gene_starts a 5 gene_ends a 6 gene_starts a 20 gene_ends b 1 gene_starts b 10 gene_ends b 30 gene_starts b 60 gene_ends c 10 gene_starts c 20 gene_ends e 1 gene_starts e 6 gene_ends so that i could sort the two files 1 and 2 and grab lines between gene_starts and genes_ends but this allowed me to get only a 20 b 33 c 20 because sorting puts lines from file1 matching gene_starts before them
so to get a 1 and c 10 i had to do filtering gene_ends out of my file2 and use to get the gene_starts lines that were also in file1 and add then to my output

56726655
put	get

so to answer the initial question a further conversion could replace the call to put via square brackets as well
in that case you have to be aware of the fact that kotlin maps are immutable by default so when using mapof you get a immutable map

56726776
puts	gets
he new commit has d as the new commit parent and as the last step of git commit git writes e s hash id into feature because that s where head is attached if we now run git checkout master git puts commit d back into our work-tree and attaches head to master
if our now make another new commit the new commit s parent is d again and master gets updated this time these commits these backwards-looking chains form a graph technically a directed acyclic graph


56726843
int	chars
using read you can read a fixed number of chars using the read method static const unsigned int limit 16
using the above code you will need to place the nul terminating chars in the appropriate location using std string the preference is to use std string


56726865
subclass	superclass
when you make a variable of the same name in a subclass that s called hiding
the resulting subclass will now actually have both properties
you can access the one from the superclass with super.var or superclass this .var

56727343
post	get
that way your updatenote component will be able to get the post id from its route props
so if you re using react router dom the edit prop on the post component will be the following function


56727489
post	get
it s just a php file that accepts parameters and provides responses based on get or post data
if you made your own php class then including the class definition would be a requirement to get help with why it isn t working


56727678
for-loop	loops
o make things easier to understand put 20 images into two whatever folders mimicking classified data create a generator out of the parent folder and run a simple for-loop the first thing you should confirm that you see the message found 20 images belonging to 2 classes
and loops itself will not stop after 20 iterations but the message will just keep incrementing and printing endlessly i got mine to 10k and stopped the message manually


56727747
int	chars
ithin ifelse it coerces to the int storage mode
to prevent that we can convert to chars and it should work


56727769
put	get

just add data to an array put it in the form of string via json.stringify questionss and then parse it
then loop over it to get values

56727894
width	height
width
line-object width in pt
height

56727928
strcpy	strncpy
if you have a array object containing then that array contains a string of length 5 hello
strcpy copies strings and it simply ignores any bytes past the terminating null character that are not part of the string
strncpy is similar but it s not quite a string function and it can be dangerous if you re not very careful

56727947
typedef	struct

this is a less-common use case for the typedef keyword that allows you to define two or more type aliases in a single line
here this says make an alias named a that represents the struct itself and make an alias named b that represents a pointer to the struct

56727947
typedef	struct
he syntax here involving the works very similarly to what s going on in the typedef statement except that instead of introducing variables it s introducing types
another way to see this this is equivalent to breaking things apart into two separate statements here the first one says a now refers to this struct type and b now refers to a pointer to an a .


56728005
implements	extends

structs has a free memberwise initializer so you don t need to write this kind of init for t but for the class you have some options 1- use base class and inherited from the class instead of conforming to protocol 2- add init inside the protocol so the class forces you to implements the class with a little autocompletion help 3- define another initializer inside the protocol and make variables set able so the compiler knows that all properties are initialized
then you can extends the protocol to have the initializer

56728023
cpu	irq
f the rxne interrupt has a higher priority than the systick interrupt the rxne interrupt won t be handled while you re inside your rxne irq handler so the time will never increment and your delay end time will never be reached
depending on how your delay is implemented your delay may just put the cpu in a spinlock that can never exit


56728132
subclass	inherited

for reasons i will explain you cannot from beer create an alias to a method in a subclass for that subclass at the time the subclass is created
using the callback class#inherited however we can do something close to what you want to achieve the problem is that beer inherited is called right after is executed before the method duvel#bottle_content is defined

56728220
post	get

i can t quite remember which post i found that lead me to solving this but essentially adding a probing element to assemblybinding section in my web.config is what solved this for me
i had to add the root folder of every dll i wanted to include because i couldn t figure out how to get t to recursively traverse the directory

56728434
python-requests	beautifulsoup
you can specify user-agent string when you use requests or not but requests doesn t drive a browser inherently so you ll be presenting as a different entity from the user-agent perspective like python-requests 2.18.4
beautifulsoup is a parser and so it presents to a web service through another library like requests
it doesn t have its own native presentation

56728504
for-loop	loops
you could fix this by returning true outside the for-loop so loops goes over every character before returning true the linked solution is correct and matches yours in all but indentation
if you look at the solution indentations you can see their if else is done after loops finishes


56728595
children	parent
ow you can call that function from your child inside child component this.props.changecolour params and now your parent will change your parent state and the new colour will get changed in your parent and passed down to all the children
lastly you can try using reactcontext set your parent up in a file that s external to all your components and and import your parent to your components


56728595
children	parent
in your parent component where you pass your initial state you would use yourcontext.provider and pass your initial state
then in your children you can use yourcontext.consumer
for more details on this see

56728662
int	chars

this means that when you get the chars at index i of chars array number you re returning the printable version of that chars
for example chars 0 int 48 chars 1 int 49 you can see these values in the linked chart your check will always return false because no ascii value is 0 expect null but that s another story

56728662
int	chars
or example chars 0 int 48 chars 1 int 49 you can see these values in the linked chart your check will always return false because no ascii value is 0 expect null but that s another story
the easiest and most readable maintable way to correct the equality check is like this or to see the ascii representation of different numbers you could run something like this this is also a good time to learn about bit values as bit values relate to ascii and control chars


56728686
for-loop	loops
more info this code does not let any other code to run while the for-loop is running
in order to let other code to run you will have to make each loops async


56728733
put	get
put the scheduler in a ihostedservice and let that handle the start of the scheduler
with that out of the way now the configuration can be done cleanly at startup by adding all the types to the service collection so now the service will manage the startup and also all necessary dependencies will get injected as needed
including your typed client dependency class assuming the following

56728761
folder	directory
ecursively copies new and updated files from the source directory to the destination
only creates folder in the destination if they contain one or more files


56729058
int	chars	int	chars
therefore this is a conversion from pointer to an int type chars types are int types
there exists no conversion from pointer to int types except to such int types that can represent all pointer values
as such chars c is an ill-formed expression on any system where chars cannot represent all pointer values

56729113
try-catch	exception-handling

in the body of your method you pass to map a lambda in your example you can add a try-catch block around your code just like in any other method
the purpose of orelsethrow method of optional is just to throw an exception-handling if your optional is empty

56729145
super	self
it has an mro of c b a object
c s __init__ first calls super .__init__
this delegates to the __init__ in the next class in the mro which is b using the same self object

56729145
super	self

b s __init__ first calls super .__init__
this delegates to the __init__ in the next class in the mro of self s class c which is a

56729145
super	self
uper has two hidden arguments __class__ so it knows where to start from in the mro and self or cls for classmethod s really it s whatever the first argument is regardless of name
you had to provide these explicitly in python 2 and still can but in python 3 super actually inspects the stack frame of it caller and finds these when called from inside a method


56729852
styled-components	babel

i ran into the same issue while using styled-components
this is the solution i found to be most straight forward to me without using a hoc or babel plugins

56729967
case-sensitive	case-insensitive

remove the lower is case-sensitive
if you want to make it a case-insensitive search use lower on the textual value of the json and put all attributes to match in lowercase or may be apply lower too demo

56730377
maven	pom.xml

so i think you should try the following first of all try to work with maven directly type mvn clean install and make sure it finishes successfully
this will make sure that the maven part is ok pom.xml structures dependency versions and so forth

56730377
maven	pom.xml
his will make sure that the maven part is ok pom.xml structures dependency versions and so forth
now the intellij part intellij can open pom.xml file as a project read the intellij part intellij and based on the information found in that pom.xml intellij will build pom.xml own project model


56730855
build.gradle	gradlew

in my case i was making a mistake in build.gradle file. you can change your targetsdkversion from 28 to 27 minsdkversion to 21
then you can clean your gradlew and then run react-native run-android

56730956
listadapter	expandablelistview

for ease of understanding we can define variables like this answerslistviewadapter listadapter
expandablelistview explistview

56730993
post	get

gutenberg-styles.css.php the gutenberg-styles.css.php will later create a gutenberg-styles.css file everytime someone is visiting the post
but first we are looking into the plugin.php file add the following code this code accesses the variable we need this code to get all the gutenberg-blocks from the current visited post after that we require we own gutenberg-styles.css.php which will automatically create we stylesheet which will be enqueued in the next line now hook it up to wp_head you could probably hook it up to wordpress save action as well but you will have to do more work for enqueuing the stylesheet finally a look into we gutenberg-styles.css.php i ve added php_eol at each line to generate line breaks you don t have to do this but now you can visit a page with your custom block and will see the gutenberg-styles.css is loaded and applied to your blocks

56731204
submit	submission

you probably want to run your logic for check the status of your input fields when the user click the submit button instead of when a user is typing in each single field
you can prevent form submission by using e.preventdefault more info here

56731696
rsa	aes
details can be found in the encrypt -method of the easyrsa -class
an example is such a message can t be decrypted directly by nodersa because nodersa expects a pure rsa message
in principle the decryption is possible but would have to be done manually on the nodejs side with probably relatively high effort the main tasks would essentially include the rsa decryption of the secret the derivation of the symmetric key from that secret and finally the aes decryption

56731696
rsa	aes
in principle the decryption is possible but would have to be done manually on the nodejs side with probably relatively high effort the main tasks would essentially include the rsa decryption of the secret the derivation of the symmetric key from that secret and finally the aes decryption
since nodersa only covers the rsa part the remaining parts require additional libraries or custom code on the nodejs side
note that the easyrsa page section important warns of a possibly insufficient security

56731800
folder	directory
he s folder the s the sources directory to access this folder there is pre-defined varaible build.sourcesdirectory
so instead of using use the above variable but now you will get a zip will the sources files include the dll s so consider to append the path until this folder s you want


56731935
entity-relationship	diagram

to have a look at the primary keys of all the tables in the database navigator go to your database and then right click on public - select view diagram
this will open the entity-relationship diagram for your database and the connections between the tables

56732058
hide	show
r don t hide the control in the first place
to show t via jquery use .show .


56732577
filtering	grouping
create a table that stores the list of letters add a matrix to your report that has a column grouping grouping on the letter value from this table
this will act as your filtering bar set action on the matrix cell to go to report point to the final drill thru report and pass the value as the parameter
there s no need to set available parameters assuming this sub-report will be hidden and only called from the parent report

56732925
integer	fractions
this might cause problems multi-threading libraries etc.
bonus chatter had the question been about regular rounding to an integer i think i d tried an approach like instead
of course it is possible to write a similar function even for the general case of n fractions digits

56732925
floating-point	fractions
f course it is possible to write a similar function even for the general case of n fractions digits
but be careful to handle edge cases overflows floating-point issues etc correctly update i believe the following does the trick and is fast of course if you d use this function in production code you d also add at least 50 unit test cases that test the following correctness to be run daily


56732951
range	infinity
the value toward minus infinity if avalue is negative and the fpu rounding mode is not set to rmup note that the second parameter to the function is troundtorange which refers to exponent power of 10 rather than number of fractional digis in .net s math.round method
therefore to round to 2 decimal places you use -2 as round-to range
rmnearest 2 13 -2 13 rmdown 2 13 -2 13 rmup 2 13 -2 12 rmtruncate 2 13 -2 13

56732960
post	get	post	get
so in short no there is no post request handler.
i d argue it s not even handling get requests either just reading the url which looks like a get request
if you are trying to post between pages inside your app vuex is what you want. if you are trying to post to your app from outside having an actual server listening for requests which you can ping will be easier ie express

56733172
post	get

after hours of trying to revive my stack.yml i started from beginning read a bit more of documentation and found much helpful stackoverflow post
at the end i m actually having this now i would need to get the portainer agent working

all containers certified by jelastic are based on centos os v.7 with the exception of the image with ubuntu vps
in order to check the version linux os you need to run commands for example for containers based on centos os cat etc os-release name centos linux version 7 core id centos id_like rhel fedora version_id 7 pretty_name centos linux 7 core ansi_color 0

put	get

you should put your onclick code into a function in your javascript code by getting the button element and adding an event listener to your onclick code
in the same way you get the button in your javascript code you can get the input and your onclick code s value

56734451
versioning	upgrade
your main issue is the incompatibility between the versioning of the binaries you are using as follows you are using chromedriver 2.35 release notes of chromedriver 2.35 clearly mentions the following supports chrome v62-64 you are using chrome 75.0 release notes of chromedriver v75.0 clearly mentions the following supports chrome versioning 75 so there is a clear mismatch between chromedriver v2.35 and the chrome browser v75.0 solution upgrade chromedriver to current chromedriver v2.75 level
keep chrome versioning at chrome v75 level
as per chromedriver v2.75 release notes clean your project workspace through your ide and rebuild your project with required dependencies only

56734463
folder	directory

in my case it was just that the folder that it wanted to put the database files in didn t exist
apparently visual studio can t create a directory for you for some reason

56734503
range	minimum
pass as vmin the global minimum value and as vmax the global maximum value
this will cause all calls to scatter to scale the values in the same range producing a unified color scale
example

56734651
prepare	execute
owever if you change the code a bit like this the callback will be execute on the specified looper thread the looper object you get from handler.getlooper
when you create a new handlerthread and start a new handlerthread you re starting a new thread and handlerthread.start will call the handlerthread#run by default at where the handler thread creates a new looper and this looper is prepare tied with the handlerthread you created just now


56734692
post	get
added a button to fire the ajax call to download excel file used following js code to post ajax request in routes web.php file set the reoute for my controller route post downloadpayroll payroll process payrollcontroller downloadpayroll
here i used maatwebsite excel library to generate excel file with fromquery approach but due to library update excel create has been replaced by excel download in maatwebsite excel 3.1 i used download method in my case here is my helperclass to generate records according to my requirement payrollhelper.php finally in my controller after creating excel file return file to get as ajax response as blob that s all


56734716
azure	hdinsight
examples are azcopy cloudxplorer and the visual studio server explorer
you can also use powershell and the azure storage client libraries or the azure .net sdks to access data in azure blob storage
for more details refer manage logs for azure hdinsight cluster

56734783
strsplit	substr

strsplit doesn t know that you re only interested in a particular subset of the result and only want the string split in 2 places
use the -split operator and specify a max number of resulting substr

56735291
post	get	post	put

thus it is safe to say that the method used in app script uses indeed the post request
as a general rule anything that is creating a new object at the backend like inserting users or groups is a post request anything that is updating existing objects change personal data of a user is a put request anything that retrieves data listing users is a get request and delete is pretty self-explaining

56735324
sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping
amda has sometimes considered sorting object keys alphabetically to deal with some of these issues but a simpler output structure is quite easy to achieve where the items are filtering and then sorted according the items grouping but still kept in a flat array this is essentially the same answer customcommander gave
if you wanted further sorting of the results say by descending numbers of seats then it would make sense to switch to sortwith


56735475
versioning	upgrade

you can check the official release notes warning this release is a major versioning update and breaking change. the latest update to google play services and firebase includes the following changes migration from android support libraries to jetpack androidx libraries
libraries will not work unless you make the following changes in your app upgrade com.android.tools.build gradle to v3.2.1 or later

56735661
post	get
t the time of data post get those values by and so on
use a hidden input box in the place of span and update the values of a hidden input box with the same update function and get the values by using and so on


56735838
width	height
o to the stocks tab and setup a label size here with a height and width
again the height will be used as a minimum and the printer will exceed the printer s value when the report being printed needs to do so


56736137
datediff	difference
since weekday does not really make sense as a datediff option i would guess that this is treated like days under the hood
if you want weeks difference you need to use ww or wk
or better still use the full version week it is much more clear and is not much harder to write at all

56736357
put	get
f you have very large sstables then you have very large sstables may not get compacted for quite some time or indefinitely if there are not 4 of the same size
a manual compaction would fix that situation but that situation would put everything in a single sstable which is not recommended either


56736764
factors	matrix

the proportionality factors is f x3 or f z
letting f be 1 for the time being this leads to the following projection function as you see the projection can f be represented as a matrix multiplication since f s not a linear transformation anymore

56736935
folder	directory
the reason was that the mounted directory must be under the user s home directory
so i created a symlink under that mounts to my project folder d my_project and mounted that one


56737069
udp	tcp

after this point the machine must be rebooted in order for a listener to gain access to that udp port again
note that this only happens when a tcp listener is also registered and if udp packets are being received while the script is running

56737513
keras	tensorflow

as far as i tested there was no significant difference maybe a tiny tiny overhead for keras
the better inference time that you expect will not be obtained by switching from keras to tensorflow

56737513
keras	tensorflow
nsure that everything that the entire pipeline keras model -- tensorflow model -- layer optimization -- tensorrt is done with the same version of tensorflow
i would recommend to train the entire pipeline keras model -- via tensorflow.keras instead of simple keras


56737814
chown	sudo

for me it was a permission issue nginx has to be the owner of the directory where you put your dist i ve seen this error in the nginx log file root . . dist index.html failed 13 permission denied so i gave permissions to nginx user on the top folder containing my dist chown nginx
-r to give nginx the permissions on the current directory and everything in nginx and then you have to restart nginx sudo systemctl restart nginx and nginx should work

56737832
put	get

you just need put the dynamic data inside orders
ex server api return this orders json in your component you just use the dynamic data this way each order will get your unique data or span will not render if some_data is null

56737920
maven	pom.xml
the final fix was to have maven build a fat jar with the dependencies built in
i added the following to my pom.xml


56738014
int	double
that said i ve seen gains for sets of values under 2 53 exactly represented in ieee-754 double which surprised me
the only downside is the division by - this can be slow as the latency of int division continues to fall behind other advances in alus
the division by a constant 3 is handled by reciprocal methods on any modern optimising compiler

56738496
floating-point	integer
nfortunately the bit-pattern represented by 0x3f800000 cannot be assigned to a float by just doing the hexadecimal number will first be converted to an unsigned integer which has the value 1065353216 in base-10
the hexadecimal number will then implicitly be converted to the nearest floating-point number


56738697
versioning	upgrade

i have a general way to solve this type of problems which could be helpful too especially when cloning repositories to run cloning repositories locally but requires a little more analysis of the versioning
with the package npm-check-updates i verify the versioning of the packages according to the package.json file that are not declared in cloning repositories latest available versioning as shown in the figure with this information we can verify the update status of the different packages and make decisions as to which packages to upgrade degrade and which ones do not

56738875
ng-style	ng-class
n this case the ng-class will add a class in your div like the string you defined e.g if task.finished is true then your div will look like this note that the class added was c.finished and not the style you defined
an idea would be to create a function in your controller to set the ng-style and then call a function in your controller in your div with ng-style this should work like what you want


56739025
post	put

i think the post redirect get pattern is a good solution
submit_score.php will keep your form as is you ll have it post to a new page you ll have to create record_score.php will be a new page you and you ll put your insert queries in there after the sql insertion a new page you will redirect to point_chart.php point_chart.php you ll remove your insertion queries from here the post variables won t be there anymore to insert anyway and you ll just show the chart

56739134
punctuation	words
the following regex seems to work fine and has a simple explanation where apparently letter means strictly not punctuation
and ideographic numbers seem to be just words


56739164
swift	objective-c
he header folder contains the .h headers for objective-c and the modules folder contains the .swiftmodule equivalent files for swift
without the .swiftmodule equivalent files for swift you have no public api to consume for the framework binary so unfortunately this renders the frameworks unusable without reverse engineering


56739250
folder	directory

the issue is that it seems like you are manually dragging the issue to the folder and so the issue is not getting included into your project through yourproject.droid.csproj file
follow theses steps inside your visual studio right click on the drawable folder select add files then find your file and open your file and in the following window shown below select copy your file to the directory and press ok and now your error should go away

56739262
implements	extends
ziv has provided good information about extends the codeactivity class but i do not recommend starting there
instead read about how to develop custom workflow activities and write a workflow using the base microsoft classes so that you understand how they work once you have some experience with creating custom workflows and you understand the limitations of the base objects then go back and implements something more fancy


56739330
swift	objective-c
this is about how swift treats c and objective-c enums in an external library framework
a few swift standard library enums are affected
okay so let s consider an actual example

56739658
inherited	subclassing

the words you re looking for are inherited allowing a class to inherited and extends specialize a parent class and the template method design pattern which is possibly the most common design pattern - the one everyone discovers by itself long before reading about design patterns
expanding on your mwe this being said creating instance attributes outside the initializer the __init__ method is considered bad practice - an object should be fully initialized have all it s attributes defined when the initializer returns so it might be better to move the line to the initializer if possible or if self.y always only depends on self.x make it a computed attribute also at this point you don t necessarily need subclassing anymore at least if that s the only thing that changes - you can just pass the proper function as a callback to your model class ie

56739702
qthread	qcoreapplication	qthread	qcoreapplication
use qthread instead of std thread 2
call qcoreapplication proccesevents from time to time
the proper solution is to use qthread exec in order to create an event loop but this approach would block the gui application so in my case is no good

56739707
multiplying	subtract
multiplying the quarter by 3 to get the month number
figure out that month s last day by adding a whole month to its first day and then subtract a single day
presto you have the last day of the quarter

56739745
post	get

as your linked blog post notes in the case of libaec clang can trigger build errors
the nws climate prediction center which publishes wgrib2 has specific recommendations for if you re building wgrib2 with clang but i haven t been able to get it to work

56739985
hive	hdfs
hdfs - hadoop distributed file system map reduce - programming model for distributed processing hive - is query language which allows to read write data from hadoop distributed file system in a very popular sql like fashion
this made life easier for many non-programming background people as they don t have to write map-reduce program anymore except for very complex scenarios where hive is not supported
hbase - is columnar nosql database

56740320
int	double
if your index_ variables happen to contain say only positive int all less than 65 536 then you could use 16-bit unsigned int
these are just 2 bytes per number and so take up 4 times less space than double
you can test this with finally you can find out how much memory is available to matlab with the memory command

56740326
public	protected
another way is to make the destructor and operator new protected
public destructor is required for creating objects with static and automatic storage duration as well as for delete but not for new
example

56740460
flask	django
he dash class now checks to ensure that server is either boolean or an instance of flask
since django plotly_dash uses the dash class s own pseudoflask object the dash class fails this check and the dash class is incompatible with dash 1.0 and will need to be updated for use with the current dash version


56740870
filtering	grouping

instead of using this query as a single-value filtering in your where you could join this subquery in on both barcode and max_idx
alternatively you could modify you re major query to have this subquery grouping by whatever the relevant unique fields are and take the max stocktakedetails.seendate

56740989
x509	pkcs#1
kcs8 format usually looks like -----begin private key----- base64 encoded der key -----end private key----- if your key is in pkcs#1 format and looks like -----begin rsa rivate key----- base64 der encoded key -----end rsa private key----- you should first convert private key----- to pkcs8 format and then use the class mentioned above
because public keys which are usually part of certificates are encoded in x509 format however private keys are usually encoded in pkcs format


56741348
subtraction	multiplication
if you re going to use repeated subtraction you should at least get rid of the multiplication repeated subtraction is not optimized for speed as you will see if you call divide 1000000000 3
we could instead use repeated subtraction of squares of the divisor or squares of squares of the divisor or ... going on until the square of the square of the .
divisor exceeds the number

56741683
put	get

the probleme was that when i first put await appointment.save the probleme resulted on a server timeout
so this part of code was bugy wich explains why when i got rid of async i could get code 200 but nothing went to the database

56742218
submit	submission
dditionally because you are listening for the click rather than submit event there s no way for you to prevent the browser from also submission that form
see below for an updated implementation that listens to submit cancels the browser default behavior and makes the ajax call on submit


56742292
int	chars
fp has no business being used in a discrete math problem such as you appear to be trying to solve
if in fact holds prime or possibly-prime numbers then unsigned long long int likely has the same size as double and almost surely can exactly represent a wider range of primes
or if it just contains flags such as in a prime number sieve then anything wider than chars is wasteful

56742666
width	height
he idea is to set constraints with specific priority values so auto-layout will try to make the image view width - at 998 priority - as wide as the scroll view but allow the scroll view to shrink to a minimum width of 70 as the content below the scroll view grows
when the scroll view reaches 70 the scroll view will not get any smaller and the combined height of the image view + label + button will force the content view to expand vertically as the scroll view has a height constraint of 999


56743474
inline-functions	inlining
you ll also have to be careful about the effects of inlining
when your benchmark has many iterations the code will get optimized after running waaaay more than twice and the optimizing compiler will to some extent inline-functions which can allow subsequent optimizations specifically eliminating various things and thereby can significantly change what you re measuring
writing meaningful microbenchmarks is hard

56743474
inline	inlining

disregarding inlining a function like processpoint doesn t know or care where it s called from
once it inline caches are polymorphic its inline caches ll remain polymorphic even if later on in your benchmark in this case in the second and third loop the types stabilize

56743521
for-loop	loops	folder	directory	folder	dir
o get around this you can use robocopy to generate the list of matching files and then delete files using a for-loop depending on the number of files and subdirectories this or forfiles could still take quite a while as you only care about archive folder
so to speed this up lets only check the directory that are named archive using dir to match just those and then we loops that list to run the robocopy this is going to be much faster then forfiles or the above loops if you are just pasting this into the cmd line then you need to use this which just removed a sign from each loops variable


56743826
google-chrome	safari

i can think of three reasons that the permission is denied 1 your site is not on https including localhost that is not on https the default behaviour from google-chrome as far as i know is to block notifications on http sites
if that s the case click on the info icon near the url then click on site settings then change notifications to ask 2 if you are on safari then safari is using the deprecated interface of the request permission that is to say the value is not returned through the promise but through a callback so instead of it is 3 your browser settings are blocking the notifications request globally to ensure that this is not your problem run the following code in the console on a secured https site if you receive the alert box then the problem is something else if you don t then make sure that the browser is not blocking notifications requests

56743827
int	boolean

in python bool is subclass of int hence true false are instances of int and and will compare equal __eq__ and will also resolve to respective truthy falsy values with true 1 any int except 0 being truthy and false 0 being falsy
but you should strictly use boolean when you need such because int s are not boolean an example of this would be let s say you re checking the function is_correct to return a bool true with if is_correct is true this will fail if you return 1 from is_correct instead of true because 1 is true is false as they are different objects in memory

56743843
range	max	range	min
o the date_range turns up empty this is similar to how python s range works as well list range 5 1 prints out an empty list
the best fix to do is to either call min or max although if you specifically want the first and the end not necessarily min or max write some code to swap min or max


56743949
int	boolean
n general if you want to check some condition to use in an if statement for example you will use boolean - true and false
if you are going to do some numerical calculations and of course there can be alot more use cases.. you will probably want to use int s


56744002
apt	epel
ut i think better way is either using apt or yum according to your os i have centos so following worked for me
to get ansible for centos 7 first ensure that the centos 7 epel repository is installed sudo yum install epel-release once the repository is installed install ansible with yum sudo yum install ansible we now have all of the software required to administer we servers through ansible


56744592
build.gradle	gradlew
you can find which library is using androidx with this command gradlew app dependencies app is the name of your module project but that is usually the default one
if you can t solve this this way post your project and app build.gradle


56744595
x86	64bit
getting the x86 processor all up and running see here for a nice statement on this
the example above remains in 32-bit real mode if i state correct but you might want to proceed to protected mode 64bit instructions etc
to benefit of all its power

56745046
doc	footnotes
doc is your xwpfdocument i always start with a template document with premade styles including the required footnote styles footnotetext footnotereference
this basically creates two dummy footnotes which i think are only used for display purposes -- but word will consider the document as corrupt if they are not there
then you can proceed with adding your footnote at some point in the text

56745927
junit	powermockito
but the runner used is a junit runner
then powermockito doesn t work with beforeclass
you need to use a before

56746354
children	parent
t will then put the top level root pages as the first level of navigation and any children of that page will appear in the sub navigation below the parent assuming your theme has dropdown.enabled and the child page is set to visible
this will also do this recursively so if the children also have children the children will be included as well


56746479
qcombobox	qmodelindex	qtablewidget	qmodelindex

obtain the position of the qcombobox topleft from the viewport of the qtablewidget using mapto method
get row using the qmodelindex obtained by the indexat method

56746733
getter	setter
the get_ prefix indicates that the method is likely a getter and pythonic code usually don t use getter setter because the language supports property
what you have on here though isn t actually a getter but rather a computation method so it shouldn t be prefixed with get_
a better name might be calculate_t t or square t

56747248
children	parent
et s see what that css is again taken from the w3 schools example the parent .dropdown has the parent .dropdown positioning set to relative which allows the parent .dropdown to dynamically position the parent .dropdown with relation to both other elements and the parent .dropdown own children
the child .dropdown-content is initially set to display none which will remove the parent .dropdown from the dom the parent .dropdown will not be rendered


56747294
uitableview	uisearchcontroller	hide	show	uisearchbar	uisearchcontroller
or this case ios by default doesn t hide the uisearchbar and hide the uisearchbar show the uisearchbar based on your scroll direction in the uitableview now how to solve this
since there are nothing we can do to cancel this behavior but we can have some work around slightly better when a user tapes cancel we set the uisearchcontroller to nil to remove the uisearchcontroller from the uiviewcontroller and when the user tap on the search icon we gives the user a value again and show the user


56747343
width	height
for example if your widget s width is 100.0 and you put 0.25 as dx - it will result in moving your child to the right by 25.0 points
so setting offset to 0.0 1.0 will move the column offscreen to the bottom by it s 100 height this is how many page transitions work in flutter
4

56747445
super	abstract
that should never happen especially when the parent is abstract
this workaround isn t super pretty but it s the only method i ve gotten to work that isn t too complicated
with this workaround you get the desired results

56747672
dictionary	map
given a class
conveniently we use a simple dataclass import dataclasses as dc dc.dataclass class a id_ int status str a more simple list of dictionary a truncated list of a objects code make a lookup dictionary to reduce looping
here we map id with the status from objects in lst2 merge dictionary with the lookup value notes dataclasses have clean reprs but a normal class can substitute the dataclass

56748070
unix	bsd

unix incl
all posix systems linux bsd etc warrants that a nonblocking system call as stat 2 is is atomic in nature blocking the inode of the file while the process or thread is executing the system call

56748081
post	get
according to this post the registry entry has to be modified to instead of -command using -file and the single quotes around v should be double quotes
2.to get the full path you have to join strings separated by space using -join operator like this if the path contains spaces powershell v6 user could use the join-string cmdlet instead


56748112
treemap	treeset
treeset orders it s elements on the basis of a natural ordering or any sorting order passed to the comparable for that particular object. for map use treemap
treemap provides the sorting over keys
to add an object as a key to the treemap that class should implement comparable interface which in turn forces to implement compare to method which contains the definition of the sorting order.

56748310
versioning	upgrade
he android system uses the versioncode value to protect against downgrades by preventing users from installing an apk with a lower versioncode than the versioning currently installed on their device
the value is a positive integer so that other apps can programmatically evaluate the android system for example to check an upgrade or downgrade relationship


56748360
folder	directory

you need to share this folder with the service account
take the service account email address into google drive and share that directory with a service account

56748360
folder	directory
ake the service account email address into google drive and share that directory with the service account email address
the service account email address will then have access to the folder in question


56748605
range	min
this does give an answer if entered as an array formula using ctrl shift enter i have changed all range to a small number of rows for testing purposes
fuelprices sheet fuel sheet if you do want to find the smallest subject to the same conditions you don t need index but can use small or min or if you prefer you can use aggregate non-array formula


56748696
uiview	subviews	padding	overlapping
make as many as you need take a parent uiview
add the uiimageview s as subviews on that parent view from left to right with enough padding that suits your need
this will create the overlapping effect of the profile icons - like the ones in the image

56748948
width	height
2- make a view of width and height what you want and set corner radius of half to the width or height
3- make uiview border width of 2 to 3 and border color white
4- set spacing to -5 of stackview repeate 1-3 steps to make many view you want

56748961
mouseup	mousedown
on mousedown i change the value of the min_x and min_y variables
on mouseup i change the value of the max_x and max_y and filter the rects array to change the color of the rects in the selected range this is an example
please click and drag over the svg canvas

56749101
folder	directory
just change directory and you should be fine cd
# or cd anywhere outside your build folder picca_deltas.py should work fine


56749406
scatter	graphing
sysuse auto clear 1978 automobile data
twoway scatter price mpg
graphing export auto.svg file auto.svg written in svg format

56749607
switching	screens

php you could write statement depends on mobile devices with using mobile_detect module as a little suggestion use simple switching in php
js you just need to get screens window height and width and than use needed scripts by statement depended on screens size

56749646
qlabel	qtextbrowser
n this case you have to set the qtextbrowser openexternallinks property too in order to open the link using the default browser otherwise the default browser will be open in the text-browser widget
another option given you have a read-only text is to use a qlabel with rich format and using the qlabel linkactivated signal to open the url


56749709
folder	directory
copy your image to that folder right-click the newly created folder i called that folder res and choose add files copying the image to that folder when monodevelop asks what to do
right-click the image and select quick properties copy to output directory
this will make the buildexternalimage method work

56749738
quanteda	stringi

you could use quanteda which is not bothered by the special characters in the new stopword removal patterns the characters
tokenizing using means you are splitting on the regex pattern of whitespace and not using stringi to unpack the punctuation characters which is what happens by default

56749873
free	realloc
and you call realloc each time you add a single element
figure this scenario you have a chunk with let s say 10 nodes and you add one reallocing from 10 to 11 but as you have allocated plenty of different arrays you don t have space to fit in the hole you have your last array so the memory manager has to make a free hole with space for 10 nodes and allocate another with space or 11 elsewhere
if you have the luck of having another chunk with 9 nodes and growing to 10 then you can reuse the last hole..

56749888
put	get
and put it to your .bashrc file
run source .bashrc to get the change


56750328
calloc	malloc
always think about the algorithm
here you have much simpler and definitely more efficient of course the haystack has to be modifiable big enough to accommodate the amended string but to use the function i thought calloc is essential for my function
forget about malloc and friends when programming ucs

56750329
folder	directory
the domain name should point to the public folder inside laravel s root directory for a default configuration . this way your storage folder and all other directory stay outside and can not be reached using browser
and it might be a good idea to disable directory indexing in your web server s configuration
if using apache - you can put the following option in to your .htaccess file options -indexes

56750641
post	get

sending a post response with ajax doesn t mean that the html page will be refreshed by the html page the only way to do the html page is to use javascript and changing the html code
there are two main problems that we should fix so you can get the result that you re expecting send back the new liquor record on your json success response

implements	extends
ou can expose this list to the ui and also make this list extensible via ui extends the tag list still leaves your data objects close for modification then prepare the data object for filtering filtering can be now easily achieved by using streams or the class
to show only red vegetables when the user modifies the fiter use when you now bind your listview to the observablelist or filteredlist since it implements observablelist only the filtered items will show and excluded items will automatically disappear from display


56750843
overwrite	preserve
irst load the data and put the data in a dictionary then apply the arguments to a dictionary finally put the data back into a string and overwrite the file which should give the desired result
additionally you should keep track of order of keys in a list if you wish to preserve it

prepare	execute
his one allow laravel to prepare the database use databasemigrations
if the database use databasemigrations s still not working i suggest that you stop your server execute the current artisan command php artisan config clear and restart you stop your server


56751950
for-loop	arrays

you can get rid of all the unnecessary roundabouts and just use a for-loop and built-in parameter expansion techniques to get this done
now print the arrays to see the result ways your attempt could fail with you are storing the results in a variable and not in an arrays

56752097
daemons	systemd
nternally the way docker build works is by creating a tar file of the context directory sending docker build works by http over a unix socket to the docker daemons and then unpacking docker build works
this works even if points at a vm or a different systemd but this means that docker has declined to tell docker where the actual build context comes from


56752389
width	margin

just change width calc 100 - 20px
for subtract margin

56752610
folder	directory

in first case the reason is that you are trying to write in to a folder which is not present at all.there is no folder inside files with name process.env.timestamp
first create a directory with name as required by you and then try writing into a file in a folder which is not present at all.there do something like this

56752737
profiling	debugging

the compilation profiling matters in such cases
in debugging mode the compiler does not work hard to optimize such kind of code

56752766
tidyverse	tidyr	tidyverse	stringr

using r and tidyverse
the main trick is using tidyr separate_rows to transfer flags into one column and many rows based on space then use stringr str_extract to extract the important information before transfer back into wide format

56752835
folder	directory
use this approach _ - is allowed character for folder and files names
3 you need create directory using mkdirsync before creating files in it

uicontrol	uibutton
you should create a new one without parameters or whose parameters are uibutton or a more generic type often is any and the uievent
here s the explanation of the target-action mechanism uicontrol


56753687
uniq	grep
grep -o is for filtering the grep output
the sort | uniq is for removing duplicates


56754159
implements	extends
most commonly used way of achieving ui automation is though implementation of page object model design pattern geb supports page object model by implements all the boiler plate code in its page class
the custom pages in an automation framework are required to extends this page class in order to access ready made functions and closures. some additional points it uses jquery-ish navigator api to identify elements on the page
there is a ready made js object which lets you execute javascripts on your page

56754504
fiddler	charles
 believe similar feature exists in other http proxy tool such as fiddler too
first configure map remote and mapping to limit the path to so that the path won t impact movie 1 then as charles is trying to intercept https site you need to enable ssl proxying and add jsonplaceholder.typicode.com otherwise browser will ignore the interceptor or just throw a certificate warning the interceptor s done


56754802
theano	tensorflow
tensorflow has by default channels last setting in the configuration
the issue comes from the fact that some obsolete now frameworks such as theano had a channels-first approach
porting was a problem particularly for newbies

56754820
short	base
bserver design pattern example chain of responsibility design pattern following is a short example demonstrating the same
you can refactor observer design pattern example chain of responsibility design pattern following by having a factory create chain for you and move instanceof checks and invoking next handler in a wrapper method of base handler class

post	get
rom to embed instagram content you need to first visit the post on the web and get the embed code
go to the post url if you have the post url or you can search for the username on instagram.com visit the username on instagram.com profile and then click the post to expand it


56755438
post	get

by default the post contains the media caption
you can decide to hide the code by simply unchecking the caption option in the embed button dialog.this will open a dialog where you can get the html embed code

56755438

ou can decide to hide it by simply unchecking the caption option in the embed button dialog.this will open a dialog where you can get the html embed code
simply copy the html embed code into your website and the embedded post will automatically load


56755814
for-loop	loops

you can keep adding the promises you create in a list inside the for-loop
once you are done with your loops you can register a promise.all method

56756486
associativity	operator-precedence
it also helps clarify what is meant by precedence and associativity especially for delimited operators
a general rule of operator-precedence is that we start by giving all postfix operators the same highest precedence
this is not theoretically necessary but it almost always leads to the expected meaning

56756932
versioning	upgrade
owever the runtime environment which uses 292 bytes for that same struct was versioning 10.5
once i upgrade my development db2 instance to v10.5 my development worked like a charm


56757344
google-chrome	firefox

although this may not be what you re looking for the issue seems to be with google-chrome
if you run this in firefox which is the browser what the rule is meant for the rule works just fine

56757754
clang	llvm
upd as diagnosticreference was introduced only in 2016 previous releases are not reachable with this approach
in order to get the history of each warning the other way one must parse all include clang basic diagnostic kinds.td and search for warning declarations and track their history
llvm tablegen documentation might be of good use here

56757807
cpu	processors
he contents of memory and the current state of the processors are lost
it costs power to maintain the contents of it memory and the cpu state and the point of deep sleep is to save as much power as possible so it stops powering these things


56758103
multiplication	modulo
a common solution to that is multiplexing using consecutives additions multiplication
demultiplexing using consecutives euclidian divisions modulo
since we know that each part of a partition verifies a first implementation can be live demo this works however computed indices are quite large

56758179
filtering	grouping
the above condition filtering the documents based on the given time window. you can generate iso dates in javascript and update it to set your own limit
this grouping your documents based on the id field
note i have used an arbitrary name for the collection

56758637
implements	extends
evertheless i have found a great tutorial on medium.com written by adam winnipass which should be really helpful for solving your problem the only difference is that they are implements they websocket client with javascript instead of php
but in the end there should not be much of a difference because as soon as we have opened the websocket connection of each end both applications have to send and also wait to receive notifications - this is how both applications illustrate it seems like one possibility to create a successful websocket connection is to extends the messagecomponentinterface use ratchet messagecomponentinterface


56758640
for-loop	arrays
since is a valid input you will not enter this for-loop
the last hurdle to your return statement is completely dependent to your arrays s content and the value of target
as these values are only known at runtime and the compiler is a little bit mimimi about things it doesn t know beforehand it will expect you to provide many input that will fail this condition so the return is never reached

56758817
dplyr	rlang
first i use a function to look up team 2 s resources from your excel table you ll need to change the path to the file to wherever you have stored duckworthlewisstern.xlsx
i use dplyr functions to do the looking up
see this so question for more information and this on updates to quosures in the rlang package

56758832
folder	directory

by default vs will copy all referenced dll s into the build folder of the exe that is referencing the dll
this is because .net by default only searches the directory where the executable lives and the dll sub directory

56759152
folder	directory
i ve seen people using hklm software dotnet setup installedversions x64 .
to check a version but i believe this is not a consistent solution across .net core versions os versions 32bit and 64bit etc so try to avoid using registry you can also programmatically look up the dotnet folder in program files
if it s there go to the host fxr sub directory and find the latest version there btw hostfxr.dll library exposes an export hostfxr_get_available_sdks

56759298
serializable	deserialization

you can serializable deserialize nhibernate configuration
deserialization can be faster than configuration build

56759546
int	boolean	int	boolean
and there s a ton of them are actually boolean not int
if that is indeed true you should absolutely stick to boolean
solving integer constraints is significantly harder than solving pure boolean constraints and when you use int to model boolean like this the underlying solver simply explores the search space that s just unreachable

56759629
free	malloc	free	memcpy
you re not accessing memory you don t have permission to access nor are you accessing memory outside the bounds of the region you created with malloc
you haven t free d the memory yet
you have no uninitialized variables you re not double- free ing memory nor are you using memcpy improperly with overlapping source and destination regions

56759754
migrate	upgrade
t was looping through upgrade and downgrades so after much frustration i tried ruby 2.6 that redmine 4.2 claimed to be compatible which still had issues
i downgrade to ruby 2.3 and it worked then i migrate my database according to the redmine.org documentation and almost everything is functional and i got a feedback that the redmine.org documentation is much faster

56760308
put	get

you are going in the right direction by using if statements but when you put a return it exits out of that function
what you are doing is a pre mature return that causes you to get a half processed string

56760394
put	get

the commentcard in viewchildren commentcard should reference something so you need to put either a component directive type or a template variable
a template variable means that you add #name in a html-tag like this you also need to tell viewchildren that you want to get the dom element and not the angular component like this

56760422
public	protected

tbitmap.bitmapchanged is a virtual method that simply fires the public tbitmap.onchange event
since tbitmap.bitmapchanged is protected you can use an accessor class to reach an accessor class however this is not really needed

56760548
switching	screens

simply switching to the design view and locate the concerned widget
grab the one of the dots on the boundary of the widget and join the widget to an appropriate edge of the screens or to a dot on some other widget

56760579
put	get
this way is much similar to uploading and downloading the image file with one additional step that you have to read the text file to get the storage
brief user- upload image - put the url in text file and upload it too download the text file - read the image url from file - load the image via sdwebimage to uiimageview i was reading the docs and found another way
this way you don t need to use dynamic url

56760581
integer	unsigned

your expression is using signed integer constants and does overflow into the sign bit which takes you into undefined behavior
you could avoid the error by specifying an unsigned constant but the expression is still overly complicated and is better expressed as

56761508
mouse	keyboard
he current cell is the one with the faint outline around the current cell that would receive the keyboard focus if you started typing
the current cell can be moved with the cursor and is not necessarily a selected row datagridview.selectedrows returns you a collection of datagridviewrows that have been selected turned blue with the mouse or by holding shift and moving the current row with the cursor keys

lapply	tapply

simply use split which creates a named list of data frames from the factor s then run a named list of data frames from the factor s through your needed method with lapply
alternatively use by object-oriented wrapper to tapply to streamline the two above calls

56761935
floating-point	fractions	floating-point	fractions	floating-point	integer	floating-point	integer
so divide by 256 2 8 this will yield an array of floating-point pixel values
its data type must be explicitly cast to 8-bit integer in order to drop any fractions
equivalently and more efficiently you may also bit-shift the 16-bit values 8 bits to the right this makes the conversion faster by a factor of 2 or so on modern hardware as it skips the floating-point operations

56762307
post	get
ou can use a join to get all the data for the various relations in one query
the disadvantage of that in the context of laravel is all the data will exist in the post model even though the post model s sourced from three different tables

puts	gets

when using transformation on sourceconnector the transformation is done on the that is returned by the sourceconnector.poll in your case the filestreamsourceconnector reads the lines of the file and puts each line as a string in the sourcerecord object
therefore when the transformation gets the sourcerecord the sourcerecord only sees the sourcerecord as a string and does not know the structure of the object

websocket	pusher
the way to do it is to set up a separate server https as a dedicated websocket server
please follow this guide it looks like the setting has to be on https or the websocket server can t receive a response from the backend
also i encountered a strange problem where pusher.php in vendor pusher pusher-php-server misses about 400 lines of code several other files are also missing despite it has the same version of this package 3.0 as my local implementation

websocket	pusher
also i encountered a strange problem where pusher.php in vendor pusher pusher-php-server misses about 400 lines of code several other files are also missing despite it has the same version of this package 3.0 as my local implementation
if you get call to undefined method when the websocket server receives broadcast event this is likely the reason
if you can t connect to the websocket on chrome but you can on firefox you need to disable verify-peers please check the section on laravel velvet in the laravel-websockets document for more details even if you don t use laravel velvet

installation	upgrade
f the value you retrieve is not empty the related product was found and your installation is going to replace the related product
assuming you didn t set your major upgrade item s detect-only property note that contrary to the linked example you will need to reference ismsi_handle instead of hmsi to access the windows installer handle from onfirstuibefore as events don t receive the handle as an argument


56764663
sorting	filtering
then you have to use nested sorting to sort documents based on a nested document field
the query would be the catch above is to use the same filtering in sort as used in the main query to filtering the documents
this ensures that the correct nested document s field value is considered to sort the documents

f you want to apply your local changes on the remote that has been modified you can do the following git pull --rebase #this will bring your local commit on top of the remote
then you can resolve the conflicts and push to the remote

for-loop	arrays
however attributing the arrays length in the variable l does speed the performance compared to because there is no need to access the length property each loops turn
note that you can also use this syntax as the first part of for declaration is executed only once also i personnally prefer to declare it outside loops because people that don t know very well js could believe that the var is scoped to the for-loop which is not the case compared to let

even without the custom domain you have ssl enabled for your site
by default azure secures the .azurewebsites.net wildcard domain with a single ssl certificate so your clients can already access your app with https

s laravel is using psr-4 autoloading via composer it is expecting the services directory to be capitalised
rename the folder to include a capital s so it should go from app services subscriptionservice.php to app services subscriptionservice.php

versioning	upgrade

you can check the official release notes and com.google.android.gms play-services-maps 17.0.0 is in this release warning this release is a major versioning update and breaking change the latest update to google play services and firebase includes the following changes migration from android support libraries to jetpack androidx libraries
libraries will not work unless you make the following changes in your app upgrade com.android.tools.build gradle to v3.2.1 or later

56772485
sudo	passwd

i have solved my own problem by replacing pkexec by sudo in the docker image and by allowing passwordless sudo
given an ubuntu docker image where a user called developer was created and configured with a user statement add these lines # install sudo and make developer a passwordless sudoer run apt-get install sudo add . developersudo etc sudoers.d developersudo # replacing pkexec by sudo run rm usr bin pkexec run ln -s usr bin sudo usr bin pkexec with the file developersudo containing this replaces any call to pkexec made in a process running in the container by a call to sudo without any passwd prompt which works nicely

56772947
folder	directory
coldfusion mappings are used by coldfusion code to access files
what you are attempting to do via a request like localhost 8500 mysite test.cfm is access a folder through your web server
what you need to do for that is create a virtual directory using your web server admin

56773048
appium	espresso

in general there is no difference b w toast message and any other ui element in your app to search and manipulate self.driver.find_element_by_id your_app_package your_app_toast_id however i had several times a problem that toast is appearing disappearing way too fast for appium to catch it is invisible in android accessibility layer so you can t get page source and check page source there
luckily with new espresso driver you can invoke your test app internals including toasts and check page source

56773350
for-loop	loops

because your i variable from for-loop is of type int which is defined as signed integer and as such in twos complement its binary representation of value -1 is all bits set what means all bits are 1
on other side bitwise negation of all ones is all zeros and that is what you need loops to execute until i 0 or i

56773724
ssl	https

to prevent having further issues with ssl you should add all those to path requests caused by sslerror can #39
t connect to https url because the ssl module is not available

implements	modifiers
now implements this into your code.
if you d like to only allow one emoji in a message you can define the start and end of the string and remove the global modifiers
this will make sure that this is the only content within the message

56774280
pexpect	subprocess

a way to trick cryptsetup would be to use the pexpect -module needs to be installed separately
this runs a subprocess faking a controlling terminal

56774326
for-loop	loops

since you re adding strings specifically more complex objects would run into issues with duplicated references you could probably just use a list literal for this if you feel the need to use a for-loop in particular then you re doing it correctly - the ide you re using probably shouldn t be yelling at you
but to make it more clear that you re using the for-loop to iterate just a specific number of times you can change what you call loops control variable for _ in itemindexes statuscodes.append targetstatuscode in which case if your ide or linter gives you a warning you should look into its settings and see if you can disable that warning

56774326
for-loop	loops
ut to make it more clear that you re using the for-loop to iterate just a specific number of times you can change what you call loops control variable for _ in itemindexes statuscodes.append targetstatuscode in which case if your ide or linter gives you a warning you should look into its settings and see if you can disable that warning
that warning also seems like you have a misconception about for loops in python


56774459
entities	entitymanager
full disclosure i straight up have no idea of the impact that doing this could have in an application but the dependency was troubling while i was trying to deploy
i created a persistence.xml file where i configured the name of persistence unit and selected the package containing the entities or listed them both worked
in the camel-context.xml i declared the following before the tag i created a java class responsible for the creation of the entitymanager it is very important that the class is stateless ejb and that the connection to the persistence unit is made static

56774889
hide	show
roblem - i think the issue with your code is that by definition some of your elements lack the classes .example and .active so in the case of you activating an example it would show the modal but hide it again as it cycled through all the other list items
method one - adapts your code and makes it a little more efficient checking for the existence of an li with both classes .active.example method two - is a little quicker as it just assumes that any click on a li.example element should show the pop-up this is probably the user experience you re expecting as the pop-up is unlikely to be closed through the process of clicking on the li but rather through the li own close button or similar as mentioned by hackbyrd - you may want to place the event listeners on a parent dom element is you are dynamically loading these li elements they are not present when the page loads


56775118
int	double
real 5 number of significant decimal digits of precision in fractions part approximate
iso 32000-1 int int values such as object numbers can often be expressed within 32 bits
real numbers modern computers often represent and process real numbers using ieee standard for floating-point arithmetic ieee 754 single or double precision

56775160
post	get
for this example the reasonable candidates are get and post
technically you could consider head which is sort of a specialized case of get -- i ll ignore it here
the important distinction to understand is that get semantics include safe

56775160
post	get

on the other hand if republishing is expensive or should otherwise only be done on purpose then post is a more appropriate choice
that s ok then using get is fine -- and it even has some advantages when the requests are being sent across an unreliable network

56775691
put	get
ow to automatically test a site using cucumber you can use a ci cd tool like jenkins which you can trigger manually or you can put an scheduler who will run all your test script against your website on your website
you can also turn on the notification so when ever the test complete the notification will shoot an email to respective individuals refer you can get n number of tutorial regarding same


56776205
folder	directory
ou are currently trying to load your data files from the current working directory which is usually the directory that the .exe resides in
however your data files are in the folder that you mention


56776239
int	double

for the exponent you are passing in 2 int s which is do int division
so it is doing math.pow 24.69 0 to fix this use double like this

56776256
for-loop	arrays
ou don t need this unless lookup speed is critical because you can use a lamda to lookup a textbox in the final arrays which is slower than a dictionary lookup
you can use a simple for-loop to go over every textbox and let every textbox in a dictionary by name


56776419
apache	nginx
or the container we can do the following edit etc apache2 envvars where environment settings for apache live change ownership of aws credentials file parent directory chown -r www-data www-data root restart apache service apache2 restart note that here ownership of root s home directory was changed
this is because aws needs certain file permissions and ownership for the credentials file which means only www-data will be able to use this login from now on maybe it would be a better practice especially if you re runnning on an actual machine and not a container to copy the credentials file to a new location and follow the same steps i don t know how well this fits to the nginx config but hope this helps a bit


56776450
int	boolean

writing any int values into a bool through a pointer to a type other than bool is undefined behavior because those may not match the compiler s representation of the type
and yes writing something other than 0 or 1 will absolutely break things compilers often rely on the exact internal representation of boolean true

56776450
int	boolean
and yes writing something other than 0 or 1 will absolutely break things compilers often rely on the exact internal representation of boolean true
but is fine and just sets b to true the rule for converting from int types to bool is any nonzero value becomes true and zero becomes false

int	chars

i believe varchar requires a length specifier varchar 10 or varchar 250 create table materials id int 11 not null auto_increment type varchar 80 not null description varchar 255 .
reference excerpt the chars and varchar types are declared with a length that indicates the maximum number of chars you want to store

56777094
for-loop	loops

you can speed it up a bit by not using foreach which uses an interator and instead use a for-loop
you can also break once you locate your id assuming they are unique assuming your id s are unique you could also make a duplicate of the items list and drop those that have been located so each loops is shorter like this you could also consider creating a map where the key is your id so you do not have to loops and instead you retrieve the item by id directly

56777447
ubuntu	linux
like in use mawk instead of gawk you can check if you are using gawk or mawk implementation on linux the first one is installed with a package of the same name on ubuntu
for ubuntu you can run sudo update-alternatives --config awk source answer


56777795
client-side	server-side

but since the branch parameter might be in the query string or might be in the route and since it s the asp.net mvc framework s responsibility to manage that generating the url and putting the client-side value into the url are two separate responsibilities here
so we use the server-side code to generate the url with a placeholder can be any string replaceme was an arbitrary choice and then use the client-side code to dynamically replace that placeholder with the desired value

subtract	add
what you can do is create a datetime object from today then in a 12-iteration loop modify it to subtract one month
add the formats in each iteration then return the response

full-text search elastic search implements a lot of features such as customized splitting text into words customized stemming facetted search etc
fuzzy searching a fuzzy search is good for spelling errors
you can find what you are searching for even though you have a spelling mistake

post	get
the api to fetch documents has the following format according to the request you post you are looking for the document with the id za2jegsbsz9baorizskn in the index dmap_product_match and type dmap_product_match
your request should be something like get


56779961
google-chrome	firefox
i m not sure why it works in google-chrome
either because google-chrome remembers that you previously have given permission to share your cam mic
or maybe google-chrome already has implemented the same logic which firefox is about to change to

56779961
google-chrome	firefox
or maybe google-chrome already has implemented the same logic which firefox is about to change to
you should be able to verify that by looking at the ice candidates google-chrome hands out


56780079
folder	directory
f the image is not within the same project folder as your code then you may need to use a directory path to get to a directory path
for example if your css index javascript files are in a folder and the image is in your documents folder on your desktop you would need to do something along the lines of .. desktop penguins.jpg


56780189
int	chars
hen short int16_t then chars int8_t bool for multiple bool flags especially if read-mostly or if multiple bool flags re all modified together consider packing multiple bool flags with 1-bit bitfields for unsigned int types find the corresponding signed type in my list a multiple-of-8 byte array of narrower types can go earlier if you want it to
but if you don t know the exact sizes of types you can you don t guarantee that int i + will fill an 8-byte aligned slot between two double s


56780675
put	get

you can do gennode matches gennode and put it in captured group 1 matches literal matches upto next and put it in captured group 2 matches literal in the replacement we ve used the captured groups only dropped and
you can get rid of the first captured group by using a zero-width positive lookbehind to match the portion before example fwiw using typical non-greedy pattern instead of would work as well

56780703
many-to-many	one-to-many
your code should look like this when fully implemented attach will associate this new or existing with the new by adding a record to the pivot between product and ingredient
the reason you can t use is that this is a many-to-many which requires attach
is used for a one-to-many

56780939
pull	push

i cannot push
so i request they to perform a pull from me - which indirectly means that i am requesting they to accept my push

56780939
pull	push	pull	push
so i request them to perform a pull from me - which indirectly means that i am requesting them to accept my push
so no request for push
only for a pull

56780939
pull	push	pull	push
only for a pull
and for acceptance of a push
hence a pull request

56780939

 just created a .htaccess file in php files directory which attached with include function in admin panel folder
i wrote satisfy any in a .htaccess file in php files directory which attached and a .htaccess file in php files directory which attached solved my problem


56781179
factors	mean
this will mean that for every single frame of your screen not only single screen is drawn but in fact your program will draw as many as possible
since your logic is tied to the frames and since the amount of steps in your while loop your computer can process will depend on external factors cpu usage by other programs the amount of steps processed for every frame shown won t be consistent and results in the behavior you observe
also this is very inefficient because you are drawing many frames you won t even show

56781281
post	get

my best guess the post to your any lambda function is failing during execution and not setting the access-control-allow-origin header to or your domain
anytime i get a 5xx error and a cors error at the same time from a non- options request this is almost always the case for me

56781427
hex	binary

as of c99 you can use the a or a specifiers to print a hexadecimal representation of the floating-point value where each x is a hex digit
this is not the same thing as the value s binary representation in memory though

56781911
for-loop	arrays
f there s a dash split use a for-loop to convert the min and max to an arrays and return an arrays
using esnext i would use array.flatmap instead of jquery.map with string.inclues to detect the dash and array.from to generate the sub arrays


56781975
hadoop	ambari

editing the ha.zookeeper.quorum in hadoop configurations to be separate from zookeeper.connect in kafka configurations such that you have two individual zookeeper clusters can be acheived yes
however i don t think ambari or cloudera manager for example allow you to view or configure more than one zookeeper cluster at a time

56782066
margin	height
tart by explicitly setting all your elements margin and padding to zero sometimes called bootstrapping this overrides any default user agent styles applied by the browser
set the .screen-emulator height to 100vh and make 100vh the flexbox container


56782194
spaces	linefeed

the character with ascii code 160 is called non-breaking spaces one can read about the character with ascii code 160 in wikipedia trimws function does not include the character with ascii code 160 in the list of characters that are removed by the function one way to get rid of the character with ascii code 160 is by using str_trim function from stringr library another way by applying iconv function first update to explain why trimws does not remove the invisible character described above and stringr str_trim does
here is what we read from trimws help for portability whitespace is taken as the character class t r n spaces horizontal tab linefeed carriage return for stringr str_trim help topic itself does not specify what is considered a white spaces but if you look at the help for stri_trim_both which is called by str_trim you will see basically in this case this case is using a wider range of characters that are considered as a white spaces

put	get
 was able to get around it by adding my own itemtemplate
i think this is realistically a bug though so if you don t mind opening a bug at i will put a fix in the next couple days for a bug


56783123
put	get
there are two sheets in this macro sheet 1 contains the dates in column 1 and the values in column 2
please note you must put the dates in ascending order meaning row1 has the oldest date then follows the next closest date on the calender and at the very bottom should be the latest date
sheet2 contains the different dates you want to get the values from sheet1

56783138
qcombobox	qtreeview	qtreeview	qabstractitemmodel
in this case you could use a qabstractitemmodel to share all the qcombobox of the same row and to change what is shown you should use the setrootmodelindex method
in the following example i added a qtreeview so you can see how the model is distributed


56783202
for-loop	loops

the purpose of a parallel for-loop is to speed up a calculation by performing parts of it in parallel
the program cannot continue until all parts of loops have completed and the final result of the calculation can be computed

56783280
short	base
i could deep clone the object before making changes to the object but that doesn t work in my case because some of the base mvc objects i use like selectlistitem aren t serializable
short answer is stuff like selectlistitem don t belong mixed into entity graphs
provided the entity relatives are eager loaded a deep copy serialization would have been a good bet for tracking an initial state for a record

56783306
pull	push
to get their stuff into your git you run git fetch or git pull which starts by running git fetch
to get your stuff into their git you run git push
sometimes you don t really want to add stuff at all

56783332
for-loop	arrays
you cannot access the property of documents inside that arrays without telling javascript that where is that documents inside the arrays index of needed document
create for-loop use i start from 0 to length of results and you will be able to use that documents property


56783368
mongodb	bson
however bson has a limit of 16mb
if you are planning to store files bigger than that consider gridfs you can write files to mongodb like so in node.js

versioning	upgrade
after trying many things.
the solution was delete the xamarin.forms.x.x.xxxxxx currently installed versioning nuget file folder in mysolution packages folder
then upgrade the android project nuget project

56783373
versioning	upgrade
then upgrade the android project nuget project
i also deleted all old versioning folders of xamarin.forms from my packages folder first


56783478
unsigned	short
a valid pointer is return but not for the desired size
instead of unsigned long long bytes use size_t bytes enable all warnings and guard that the math does not overflow
read a very big picture which is 60k 60k pixels to solve op s higher problem do not allocate bytes for a 60k 60k unsigned short array

56783728
realloc	strdup
hen you realloc you always realloc using a temporary pointer so if realloc fails and returns null you don t overwrite your pointer to the currently allocated block with null thereby creating a memory leak
putting all that together at the beginning of your function may seem daunting but it is actually straight forward now you are ready to parse the wanted information from your line with sscanf and then following a successful parse of information you can allocate for each of your salesid and smmcampaignid pointers copy the parsed information to the new blocks of memory assigning the beginning address to each pointer respectively note you can use strdup to both get the length of each string parsed and allocate sufficient memory to hold the string and assign that to your pointer in one-shot but.


56783728
free	memcpy	memcpy	strdup
trdup is not required to be included in c99 or later so strdup is just as simple to get the length allocate length + 1 bytes and then memcpy your string manually to ensure portability
further since strdup allocates memory you must validate the pointer returned -- something overlooked by 99 of those using the pointer that s the pointer when fgets fails you have reached eof now simply putting the pointer altogether in a short working example that takes the filename to read as the first argument to your program or reads from stdin by default if no argument is given you could do example use output memory use error check in any code you write that dynamically allocates memory you have 2 responsibilities regarding any block of memory allocated 1 always preserve a pointer to the starting address for the block of memory so 2 it can be free when it is no longer needed


56783748
post	get

a get doesn t have to have a body but is not prevented from having one
a post usually has a body but the point i m making is that the data sent that is relevant to the request the stuff the user typed in potentially sensitive info is included somewhere in the request - either in the headers or the body - but all of it is encrypted the only real difference from a security perspective is that the browser history tends to retain the full url and hence in the case of a get request would show in the browser history to the next person reading it

56783795
express	node.js

with express you have to create a route that will handle your image urls
by default express or the built-in node.js web server does not serve any files

56783795
express	node.js
y default express or the built-in node.js web server does not serve any files
so the built-in node.js web server will only serve a file if you create a handler for that specific url and program that handler to deliver the desired file

keras	tensorflow

you cannot really get rid of these warnings these warnings are not generated from your code but from internal keras code that calls tf.nn.dropout
these warnings are not meant for you but to the keras team these warnings have to update the tensorflow backend to remove the warnings

56785032
keras	tensorflow
hese warnings are not meant for you but to the keras team these warnings have to update the tensorflow backend to remove the warnings
the only way to get rid of the warnings is to edit keras source code

range	max	range	min

that means that x can range from 0 to map.width - canvas.width and y from 0 to map.height - canvas.height inclusive
these are min and max that we feed into colton s clamp method

56785734
appdata	uninstaller
i solved this problem by uninstaller node_modules and then deleting both the npm and npm-cache folders in appdata and finally installing the complete node_moodules again
you can use these steps to remove node_modules sudo rm -rf usr local lib node_modules sudo rm -rf .npm brew uninstaller --force node brew install node i hope this will help to solve your problem


56785745
keras	tensorflow
hese functions seem to be missing and aren t in the tf2.0 keras documentation
i imagine these functions has something to do with tensorflow s switch to eager execution as direct session access is no longer required


56786065
post	get
as this is for public posting and the submitted content does not get published immediately that was an acceptable solution
the default wp rest api endpoints seem to require a logged in user for post delete requests

56786168
put	get

need to put the checking code into the compare function and use correct comparison signs
this works also you can get elements just by their id if no variables with such names so the next code is shorter but also works

56786699
versioning	upgrade

the simplest way is keeping old attributes in new versioning and not using them anymore
if you need map them to new attributes just do the mapping after lightweight db upgrade

56787431
folder	directory
it must start with which will probably give you what you re looking for although if you have multiple stages they will have different job ids
alternatively you could try which would give you a unique folder for each commit
more info here unfortunately there is currently an issue with using git_builds_dir in git_clone_path if you re using windows and powershell so you may have to do something like this as a work-around if all your runners have the same build directory you may want to take a look at the variables available to you predefined variables to find the most suitable variables for your path

56787678
put	get
ven though there was a call back since office needs the context paramater and it was not here any more because the function had been ended the client could nt do any thing with the information being returned by the server so the solution was to make a new async function where i would put the https request a new async function where i would put the https request return a promise then from the main function call the new function by adding await first before the call
then .then after the call to do all the rest tasks of the main function this way you force the main function to wait until we get the full response from the server


56787994
switching	screens

if you switching on the developer options in the settings you can at least change the minimum width in the display section which will make it call different code if you are using the minimum width as the target
read these android docs to target different minimum widths properly to support mobile and tablet versions of your screens

firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox
you can check more about that here colours are different in different browsers color rendering difference firefox vs
safari web browser color management guide how your web browser affects the way colors are rendered google-chrome needs to support colour management like it s competitors
hope this will help you to understand

56788338
post	put
just to put it more clearly with this picture you can follow this path chrome developer console - network tab - xhr
and post information by hand on the webpage and then you will see some files revealed on xhr
what you are looking for are files starting with shipment..

56788378
range	minimum
the proposal you re likely thinking of is p1236 and it says the range of representable values for a signed integer type is -2 n-1 to 2 n-1 -1 inclusive where n is called the range exponent of the type
that s both a maximum and a minimum
because the proposal requires two s complement for signed integers there s no opportunity for variation

56788566
int	double
however the expression on the right hand side of assignment is divide operation among int which will cause precision loss
you ll need to cast one of the operands on right hand side to double to preserve precision


56789047
versioning	upgrade

the problem is because android has released a new versioning and they are depreciating the 28.0.0
a new versioning is called androidx 1.0.1 beta .this happens because you must have upgrade your android studio or the gradle versioning of studio.so go to 1 click refactor from menu options in android studio

56789123
installation	upgrade
s of 2019 here is how to run smoothly pip install mysqlclient on macos brew info openssl and follow the commands at the bottom other approaches brew install upgrade reinstall mysql did not fix the issue for me but has the nice side effect to make sure your installation is clean
brew install mysql-connector-c to make that work you have to unlink mysql which ruins your setup and your installation did not fix the issue for me for me


56789285
put	get
the join might be an inner or left join depending on the nullability of the statusid column in the main table and if it s nullable on what you want to get in such cases either a row with null name or no row at all
i ve put together a little demonstration to show you exactly what i mean
create and populate sample tables please save us this step in your future questions the query results id statusid date name 1 1 null test 2 2 null new 3 null null null 4 1 null test 5 2 null new 6 null null null 7 1 null test 8 2 null new 9 null null null 10 1 null test 11 2 null new 12 null 27.06.2019 inprogress 13 1 null test 14 2 null new 15 null null null 16 1 null test 17 2 null new 18 null null null 19 1 null test 20 2 null new 21 null null null 22 1 null test 23 2 null new 24 null 27.06.2019 inprogress 25 1 null test 26 2 null new 27 null null null 28 1 null test 29 2 null new 30 null null null you can also see a live demo on rextester

56789363
next	except
then check in the next iteration check if the pattern still matches
in the next call use the groups to construct the object with the key and the values
group 1 capture 1+ times not or group 2 capture group 3 capture any char 0+ times except a newline group 4 capture regex demo

56789398
int	chars
there is information on the range of n-bit signed int
specifically that not all of those n 1 bits of the object-representation need be part of the n 2 bits of the value-representation with the exception of the narrow chars types
so the value-representation s n-bit width might be smaller

56789585
charindex	substr

you can use 3 string functions left right and charindex like this select left fullpath charindex fullpath - 1 shortpath left right fullpath len fullpath - charindex fullpath charindex right fullpath len fullpath - charindex fullpath - 1 middle from productcategories see the demo
result for the case that there is only 1 or none it s more complicated select case charindex fullpath when 0 then fullpath when 1 then else left fullpath charindex fullpath - 1 end shortpath case charindex fullpath when 0 then else case charindex fullpath charindex fullpath + 1 when 0 then substr fullpath charindex fullpath + 1 len fullpath else left right fullpath len fullpath - charindex fullpath charindex right fullpath len fullpath - charindex fullpath - 1 end end middle from productcategories see the demo

56789898
hex	binary

openssl hmac.hexdigest in ruby outputs a hex string and that s what you base64 encode
in your php code the true parameter to hash_hmac makes your php output raw binary data

56789898
hex	binary	hex	binary
in your php code the true parameter to hash_hmac makes it output raw binary data
without that it would be hex which i think would result in the same as the ruby one
so you either need to remove the true param in php code in order to encode the hex representation in php or use openssl hmac.digest in ruby in order to encode the raw binary data in ruby

56790444
kerberos	ntlm
i think it s worth noting that microsoft has recently added kerberos client support using ipv4 and ipv6
beginning with windows 10 version 1507 and windows server 2016 kerberos clients can be configured to support ipv4 and ipv6 hostnames in spns
to reduce the impact of disabling ntlm a new capability was introduced that lets administrators use ip addresses as hostnames in service principal names

56790891
versioning	upgrade

the versioning of react-select you re using isn t compatible with your versioning of react
you can downgrade react-select to use v2 by doing the following npm install react-select 2.4.4 for more details about upgrading please see the v3 upgrade guide

56791027
pop-up	dialog

in ruby on rails what makes the data-confirm display a pop-up is the jquery_ujs gem
the presence of this attribute indicates that activating a link or submitting a form should be intercepted so the user can be presented a javascript confirm dialog containing the text that is the value of the attribute

56791364
sudo	passwd
hat s how sudo works
it prompts for the current user s passwd and checks etc sudoers to see if the current user s passwd and checks etc sudoers re allowed to run the command


56792305
subtract	add

so we subtract 1 by first subtract 2
we add n so that the value doesn t go negative

56792462
subtract	add

you could just subtract one from number but there s a slight complication in that swift s remainder operator is happy to return a negative number
to make a negative number work more like a modulo operator in other languages you can add 25 instead of subtracting 1 that works because -1 mod 26 is congruent to 25 mod 26 so adding 25 and subtracting 1 are the same thing

56792593
sorting	grouping
my assumption was that the performance penalty arises from the implicit indexing within grouping by statements
creating the df as described by op sorting and creating multiindex
it may well be that for a better performance of dataframe.groupby sorting is sufficient

56792611
versioning	upgrade
but generally this versioning is more than dead
please upgrade
this is not a relational database

56792966
noexcept	throw

pretty simple examples can be constructed that involve destructors directly rather than introspection on noexcept status here the noexcept allows the initialization of a in the caller to be ignored since the destructor cannot observe the destructor
here the noexcept allows the omission of frame information needed in case the callee throw

56793344
mvp	presenter

but if you want to solve this problem by mvp architecture you have to create new method in your view interface
because presenter does not do ui logic or your architecture will be broken

56793354
pathlib	os.system

in more recent python 3 variants we have path.touch from pathlib
this will create an empty file if this doesn t exist and update the mtime if the mtime does in the same way as your example os.system touch abc but the mtime s much more portable

56793542
post	get
however all get parameters are taken into account except for the ones excluded see response above already
i strongly recommend switching to http post - mainly because the http standard requires post parameters to not be cached also not in the browser
otherwise visitor a could submit something with the form and visitor b sees the result from visitor a

56793542
submit	submission
otherwise visitor a could submit something with the form and visitor b sees the result from visitor a
post is for data submission get is actually defined as a read-only mode in http
two options for typo3 are switch to post if there is no 100 necessity for get in your use case use the chashexcludedparameters option in typo3 to disable all user-input values from the form

56793779
dygraphs	plotly
in both examples i rebase to one not zero
option 1 with dygraphs note that dyrebase value 0 does not work
option 2 with plotly using event handlers

56793839
mouse	keyboard

when you hover your mouse over the statement you will get the below popup
you just have to click on the add throws declaration link you can also press ctrl+1 for a similar popup when your keyboard cursor is on the statement line

56794182
post	get

i post an answer so to make a good recap for others stumbling upon this
main problem as stated in the accepted answer was that i was passing a localised string instead of a reference string for localisation to get values from proper localizable.string file. as my localizable.string strings have a format loc-args are also needed to be passed with the payload in order to swap placeholders for values

56794234
rpm	yum

quoting the doc for name you can also pass a url or a local path to a rpm file using state present
sample tasks - name install my remote package from uri directly yum name state present - name install my remote package from a file on server yum name path to my package.rpm state present

56794429
folder	directory
s in c c++ the compiler is searching for c c++ in the include search path which by default includes the current directory and the location of the standard library but could be extended using the -i option the same as in c c++
therefore if your module is using another module defined in a folder a you need to tell the compiler where to search for the compiler ocamlopt -i a -c x.ml the produced objective file will not contain any code from external modules


56794723
width	height

try this for setting width of all buttons choose the property you want to set max min pref or all of them
this the same for height just replace width with height

56794725
outline	font-size

the stroke-width property defines the thickness of a line text or outline of an element inside the svg tag
increasing the font-size will fix the stroke-width property

56794826
migrate	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
this release is a major versioning update and includes breaking changes. with this release libraries are migrate from the android support libraries to the jetpack androidx libraries
the updated libraries will not work unless you make the following changes in your app upgrade com.android.tools.build gradle to v3.2.1 or later
upgrade compilesdkversion to 28 or later

public	protected
ere s what you need to do to get an authorization access token from the oauth 2.0 playground select authorize apis cloud storage select the scope for the apis you would like to access or input your own oauth scopes then click the authorize apis button once you ve got the authorization code click the exchange authorization code for tokens button you will get a refresh and an access token which is required to access oauth protected resources
grab the access token to use in your curl command then configure your request to cloud storage api by constructing your http request like so upload you can have a look at this cloud storage upload example in our public docs to guide you with constructing a request and testing a request out


56795101
required	placeholder
you cite this code where the generic has a placeholder e which is required to implement hashable in order that any type that is used for e will be compatible with the element parameter declared in the collection protocol
and the also is required to implement the collection generic protocol
the line is there to bind the e parameter of the generic struct to the element associatedtype from the generic collection protocol

56795661
getter	setter
owever your existing setter and getter weren t doing anything so the kotlin conversion removed them electing to use the default setter and getter that already exist
let s suppose instead that your code looked like this here the default setter is enforcing that an api key is always in uppercase

x86	64bit

i ve got the same error when running the following cmdlet the reason was because i ran the following cmdlet using windows powershell x86 on my windows 10 x64 machine
when i tried the same but using windows powershell which is 64bit version the following cmdlet worked just fine

opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox
both answers modify change_button function in original post to clarify the correct consistent with other bootstrap tooltips behavior is load page button c has tooltip on hover click button c button c is disabled and button c tooltip goes away click button d button c is enabled and has tooltip on hover again here are results of my further testing ie 11 windows both answers a and b work google-chrome 74 windows both answers a and b work opera 60 windows both answers a and b work safari 10 mac both answers a and b work firefox 67 windows answer a fails b works
with firefox 67 button c tooltip did not go away as azeos suggested might be a problem
when i have more time i will do more testing

inotifypropertychanged	icommand	implements	extends
this property has to implements the inotifypropertychanged and must be the type of object your itemssource is holding
for recognizing the mouse double click you can extends the above xaml to something like note you therefore need a property doubleclickedcommand of the type icommand in your viewmodel
there you can check for your currentselection

strsplit	substr

start by splitting at the vertical bars to get each portion of the string strsplit
then iterate through the substr loops and iteration and check the start of each string.startswith dealing with the resulting arguments however you want

56796554
int	chars
solution cast to unsigned chars before
additionally i d prefer unsigned int too for printing hexadecimal representations so if you prefer the c++ casts like me or leave the c-style ones doesn t have an impact here.
then you have a second problem output encoding of python s print function

56797054
hide	show
 didn t love the other solutions so i made a helper class that will make it easier to hide show your tabs while retaining the order of tabs
to use a helper class that will make it easier to hide instantiate a helper class that will make it easier to hide in your form load method after initializing your components by passing in the tab control s tabpages property


56797146
integer	unsigned
there are three cases for converting a narrower integer to a wider integer if both types are signed or both are unsigned the result is the same value
if an unsigned type is converted to a wider signed type the result is the same value
if a signed type is converted to an unsigned type the result is the same if it is not negative

56797541
put	get
in your particular case you can use dataclasses to tell mypy about the kwargs the code above typechecks with latest mypy and detects wrong usage of your class and still runs on python versions without dataclasses
you can put the dataclass definition into a .pyi file to enable support for python 2
you can also get rid of your __init__ code and use dataclasses all the way if you can drop older python versions

56797810
post	get

i tried answer to this post ask for length of a file read from classpath in java but they marked it as duplicated of your question so i give my answer here
it s possible to get the size of a simple file using when file.txt is packaged in a jar the .length will return always 0

56798233
filesystems	ntfs
so demo is not the same as demo
that depends entirely on the filesystems you re using
on a case insensitive filesystems such as the ones commonly used on mac os apfs and windows ntfs demo is in fact the same file as demo

56798233
filesystems	ntfs
on a case insensitive filesystems such as the ones commonly used on mac os apfs and windows ntfs demo is in fact the same file as demo
on a case sensitive filesystems demo and demo are different
this is a property of the filesystems in question not any particular operation such as rename

put	get
or one thing put the code that checks for the correct sheet right at the top so you don t have to do a bunch of useless declarations
secondly get all of the data at one time as i did with the getvalues and the getvalues would be preferable not to use intermediatevariables for the data values and instead just used the actual data elements like data 0 1 etc.

most likely you have put the javascript block inside the section of your html document
that means the browser comes to this line of your script and tries to find the html element with the id of quiz but the browser doesn t exist yet because the browser s defined inside the body thus the browser s undefined and you get the error message cannot set property innerhtml of null to get around this move the javascript block to the end of the

hide	show
there is the way but i do not recommend this because the are still recognised by the command interpreter cmd user ben personick show how to do this in his answer though
anyway i would use 0x22 instead in order to hide the quotes from cmd like this instead of findstr you could also use find v but the easiest way is to use set p n
b. forfiles only regards the date not the time of the last modification but not the creation date time

56799098
fractions	radix
base 2 means that the maximum number you can represent with any digit is 2 1 - 1 or 1
but this has nothing to do with representing the fractions portion of a base 2 number
the fractions portion of the number is represented after the point which is actually called a radix point

56799098
base	fractions
the fractions portion of the number is represented after the point which is actually called a radix point
and this applies to all number base


56799215
inherited	properties
hen this happens the computed value of the properties is either the properties s inherited value or the properties s initial value depending on whether the properties is inherited or not respectively as if the properties s value had been specified as the unset keyword
background-color is not inherited so background-color will use background-color initial value which is transparency that s why you see no color


56799215
inherited	properties
ow if we consider the fallback cases 3 using initial means the initial value of background color so transparent using inherited means inherited the color but there is nothing to inherited so transparent again using unset we will have a mix of inherited and initial the unset css keyword resets a properties to its inherited value if its inherited from its parent and to its initial value if not
in other words it behaves like the inherited keyword in the first case and like the initial keyword in the second case ref your only chance would probably be the use of revert but the support is very low and i am not sure if the support will work


56799321
debian	linux
aveat i m unsure if dev null exists on 100 of platforms where one can run emacs but on every linux distro it should be fine if the call to elisp function shell-command is in an elisp script then you could change this shell-command cmd to this if you occasionally do want to monitor the output then you could create one wrapper function that suppresses the output via dev null and one wrapper function with no suppression and toggle between no suppression as you wish
the above advice was tested on gnu emacs 24.5.1 x86_64-pc-linux-gnu gtk+ version 3.18.9 of 2017-09-20 on lcy01-07 modified by debian

post	get
t s easier to see you want to delete an item in the below code but a post request is used to post a new item to the storage - so a post request s less clear

56800001
folder	directory
mean while i solved this
as mentioned in question i am open to add new column to specify any flag value or anything that identify path as special folder
implemented solution db fields outputfolder path of directory static path or remaining path under special folder isspecialoutputfolder flag to identify where current path has any special folder or not

56800001
folder	directory
checkbox check uncheck makes dropdown enabled and disabled
implemented proper validation where special folder path entered and static path entered
example in case of special path remaining directory path must not contain any root directory

56800108
prop	each
one approach to rendering this props would be to first replace the foreach with map allowing each item in prop to be mapped to a renderable element which will contain the cells
to obtain the elements for each row you could iterate the stationindex item in your map function and collect an array of elements into a local cells array
the resulting for this stationindex would be rendered with the contents of the cells array as shown

for-loop	loops

you need change to inside the for-loop

maven	pom.xml

i guest the jar file may has built-in import or dependencies so the three jar files isn t enough.as to how to find out java jar dependent relations that is what java maven do
you can see the official website project build setup for help. in my case i follow official java project setup use from org.apache.flink.streaming.connectors.kafka import flinkkafkaconsumer and add dependency org.apache.flink flink-clients_2.11 1.8.0 to pom.xml then i can output kafka records to stdout now with the python api

implements	extends
nterceptors are used in conjunction with java ee managed classes to allow developers to invoke interceptor methods on an associated target class in conjunction with method invocations or lifecycle events common uses of interceptors are logging auditing and profiling reference doc you are trying to use java ee annotation with spring which won t work.in spring-boot you will have to register the interceptors like the interceptor itself have to be a class which extends the handlerinterceptoradapter and implements the methods as follows from spring docs all handlermapping implementations support handler interceptors that are useful when you want to apply specific functionality to certain requests for example checking for a principal

additionally heroku s open source reverse-proxying module also explicitly states that http 2 is not supported the vegur proxy only supports http 1.0 and http 1.1 clients
http 0.9 and earlier are no longer supported
spdy and http 2.0 are not supported at this point

56801153
for-loop	loops

similar for-loop comparison with java is made here
the explanation using for loops in python and optimized python packages may be insightful

56801881
pandas	dask
it s just the amount of data that is processed per batch by dask when computing in parallel
it is not how you separate and organize data for analysis - there are many ways to do this with xarray and pandas
this should demonstrate what you are looking for those years have the appropriate leap days included and are parsed out with the groupby function

56801997
width	height
its based on the fact that the bounds object will cover the width of the map and we know the pixels of the width of the map from its container so the ratio of the two gives us a longitude to pixels ratio the above does width and height
if you only want to extend the width in both cases the variable targetwidth is the numerical width in pixels of the div containing the map

subclass	abstract-class
ou could for example define an abstract-class interface validatecontroller in the shared code module and leave each subclass extends the shared code module and defines the shared code module the generic validator class to use
here the target relationships between your modules for example in the core shared module in the application define your validator implementation and define also the stringcontroller subclass or bean as alternative to set the right validator


56802162
width	margin

since you know that you want only 4 columns in a row set the width of each li element to 25
but considering that you re applying padding and margins as well reduce the width of the li s by the amount of padding and margin you re giving

56802215
pull	push
now since you have to make some changes in pr#2 so simply make the changes in b1 push the branch and re-open the pr#2
now take the pull of branch b1 in b2
now b2 or pr#3 will also have those changes which you had to incorporate in pr#2

56802376
width	margin	width	height	box-sizing	margin
irst we reset the box-sizing property with this this ensures that the column width won t be affected by border-width and padding properties which you are using with padding 20px
by default using display flex will make the column width won t direct children equal height by removing margin css margin auto 0.5 1 auto

this means each directed path counts as one half of an undirected path

build.gradle	gradlew
ut appparantly it was not including the pom.xml file so i followed this tutorial to generate the zip file then create a new version at bintray and then manually upload the zip file using the ui upload option also do not forget to check the explode this archive option while uploading your can then publish the library and use the library with all the library transitive dependencies here s an example build.gradle code put this code outside all blocks in your app level gradlew after modifying this code as needed
now sync project and open terminal inside the android studio and execute this command  gradlew clean build generaterelease this will generate a .zip file in your app build directory which you can upload to bintray like described above

dit the example is in java because the example was just faster to put together the environment is a simple java environment having the standalone .jar deployed - no extra configs or anything except for the server port being on 5000
either way you can try the server port out yourself by sending post requests to this is my postman request and the response using the image you ve provided everything seems to be looking fine on my aws eb instance and all the numbers add up as expected

folder	directory
things to check upfront if not set the environment variables by updating your .bashrc or .bash_profile using and try again
if this doesn t solve your problem then search for folder with the name encodings listed in your machine
find -type d -name encodings which prints a list of directory having a folder named encodings

for-loop	arrays
you can create a custom foreach like or use simple for-loop
also what you can do is push all the promises to an arrays and call promise.all to process all the requests
note i have made one article that covers loops and async functions feel free to check it out

56803724
subclass	superclass

one reason for missing cells while using a custom subclass of a uitableviewcell is forgetting to call super.prepareforreuse
apple states at if you override this method you must be sure to invoke the superclass implementation

56803750
subclass	superclass

in my case this happened when i forgot to call super.prepareforreuse in my custom subclass
see if you override this method you must be sure to invoke the superclass implementation

migrate	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
it means that you are using both support libraries and androidx libraries
you can migrate to androidx as described below downgrade your firebase dependencies but it is not a real solution because you have to migrate before or after you can check the official release notes warning this release is a major versioning update and breaking change. the latest update to google play services and firebase includes the following changes migration from android support libraries to jetpack androidx libraries
libraries will not work unless you make the following changes in your app upgrade com.android.tools.build gradle to v3.2.1 or later

for-loop	arrays

a for-loop is the simplest approach - check if the item is a string and if the item is log it is to the console

2 use memoized selectors with createselector check this good post from todd motto
memoized selectors will avoid useless computation and also useless value emitted in observables. you just get notified in case of value updated only

overwrite	preserve
also note that in case if any two entries are mapped to the equal keys the value of the latter one will overwrite the value associated with the former one
this means that in case two keys are conflicting in general you can t know which one will win unless you re using a linkedhashmap which preserve insertion order
a more general approach would be to decrement all keys filter out all non-positive keys this will require 2 full iterations though unless you use sequences which are lazily evaluated

accessor	properties

attempting an answer based on the assumption that you want the __x# variables modified only during __init__ and never again but also want the accessor to follow the same code path possibly because the read is also programmatically complex in this case you can have the implementing function take an additional defaulted argument
when accessed in attribute form the implementing function will receive the defaulted argument but if the fget member of the properties is explicitly accessed the fget member of the properties can be called with the non-default argument

so in order to get it this command to work appropriately you need to change your input and output directory to point to the correct directory structure of your application

you can also forgo the call to a label entirely without needing delayed expansion by using a second loops as a matter of preference i think this is quite a bit cleaner

56810995
equals	gethashcode
one thing you might consider changing however is your implementation of gethashcode

folder	directory

it s totally possible indeed by taking advantage of the driver and driver_opts settings for such volume configuration in docker-compose 3.2+ based on your example in a linux file system a linux file system could be something like of course you gotta make sure that the target files already exist as a nice side effect of this solution you ll be able to still list your volumes the usual way with docker volume ls and at the same time you ll be able to directly access to all of the shared content from you container in the folder that you bind to such volumes in this way
update a simpler way to do it for example if you just want it for testing purposes is to simply get rid of the volumes section at the bottom of your docker-compose file and instead bind your volumes directly in the volumes section of each service definition for windows systems just replace the full path for the host s directory to match your actual folder structure like .. volumes - c mysite logs var log btw you no longer need to link the containers in your docker-compose since now the containers are linked automatically by docker so anything that runs within your web container service will always be able to find your app service by name just like if the containers were actually linked so

whereas will give java.lang.arithmeticexception by zero exception at runtime since both the operands are of datatype int and so the output is as per the integer datatype irrespective of ans variable datatype being double

you could do that either with 1. break not so elegant 2. extract your code to a method and add a return-statement or 3. adding a condition in the for-loop
i am not familiar with php but in most languages it is possible to do it like this so once gap is true the outer for-loop is left

but it is never wrong to enclose the complete file folder argument string in double quotes even on not being really necessary because of the string does not contain a space or one of these characters
so it is good practice to always enclose a complete file folder argument string in double quotes
for example running a replace on both batch files searching for tmp.txt and using as replace string temp n0.tmp would result in using instead of tmp.txt in current directory a temporary file with name of batch file as file name and file extension .tmp in directory for temporary files independent on what is the name of the batch file and what is the path of the directory for temporary files

decoder	encoder

so perhaps it would be easier to understand this metaphor for the transformer s decoder rather than for bert
to my understanding in the vaswani et al transformer model the queries and keys allow all positions of the decoder layer j-1 to attend to all positions of the encoder layer j via the attention scores

56819096
decoder	encoder
he dot product of the keys and queries would allow each position of decoder layer j-1 to attend to the position before the position in encoder layer j
so the decoder layer j-1 is referred to as the queries when together with the keys the position decides how much each position in decoder layer j-1 again but not referred to as the values will contribute

because you need to pass 2 as an argument to setinterval - currently it s not available
also note that the only reason anyone assigns the result of setinterval is to call clearinterval

dplyr	rlang

the dplyr is only so that we can use select

giving a 1 1 2 2 3 3 a 1 11 2 12 3 13 2 rlang this also works but this time we use rlang s enquos and
with tidyeval all of which is pulled in by dplyr

filtering	grouping

since you re filtering a log file i ll assume that the timestamps are chronological
then you can use itertools.groupby to grouping items with similar hour-minute keys

56822363
width	height
aximized window give unreliable values for left width actualwidth top height and actualheight
after maximizing a window maximized window can often keep the left and width values from the pre-maximized window

filtering	grouping
is a chained command that is we pass the result of the first data.table the filtering grouping calculation of people and cars to a new set of operations . grouping peoplewithlicense cars simply print the values of those variables while checks if there are more people than cars and assigns that logical value to a variable. the final prints the result to the screen
the output is grouping peoplewithlicense cars morepeoplethancars 1 1 2 2 false 2 2 1 1 false if you want the 0 1 values instead false true then just replace the last line with the data i used

multiplying	subtract
ts like multiplying the numbers with the same constant
extract exponents from a b that can be simply done by directly extract the exponent bits a s integer number and subtract bias from its to make its signed or by using log2 math function

int	double	multiplying	division
here small example in binary removing trailing zeros can be done like this the above example would change to 0000001010111b 0100011010000b the division by gcd can be done like this after removing trailing zeros at last apply sign
here c++ floating example multiplying here c++ int example shifting where dword is any unsigned 32 bit data-type for example typedef unsigned __int32 dword
the double precision will be done in the same manner only the constants changes and 64bit or 2x32bit variables are needed to store the int mantissas and results.

56822882
for-loop	arrays
see then from the comment about the var_dump you have to see that you have an arrays of arrays
so when you want to reference an item you have to put 2 indexes this will work if you keep that portion of code inside the context of the for-loop


56822954
cos	sin
i am using a fresh repl session you can notice that you could bind a value to sin although it is a standard function to 1 before sin was referenced to called in the session
on the other hand we have called cos first before trying to assign a value to cos variable
this introduced cos into global scope and as cos is a function rebinding the value assigned to cos is not allowed

post	put

it looks like you are trying to post a string as a file
when you specify a with -d this tells curl to send the data from a file called once upon a time if you are trying to put a file then you should do my_text_file.txt once upon a time curl -vx put -h content-type application json -d  my_text_file.txt

if nothing of above was applicable a new block is allocated old contents copied to new address and old block is free
otherwise a new block would become a memory leak if realloc fails to do any of the above a new block returns null

put	get
you need at least to define a service to expose your controller might be a load balancer if the provider where you put your cluster supports it you can use hostnetwork true or a nodeport
to use the latest option nodeport you could apply this yaml i suggest you read the ingress documentation page to get a clearer idea about how all this stuff works

inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
his way you will avoid having to an additional layer in between the subclassing and the superclass and your code will be more flexible and easier to maintain
this approach is advisable almost always when this approach doesn t feel natural to add some shared functionality to a superclass and obtain t via inherited

post	put
he queue you pass to handlemanywebhooks is a simple array where each element is the object from a post request
you use the queue you pass to handlemanywebhooks as a queue push each object to put the queue you pass to handlemanywebhooks into the queue and shift to remove the queue you pass to handlemanywebhooks


56824471
inherited	properties

one solution is to use composition rather than inherited as the design solution
since the person object is supposed to be singleton as well we make the person object immutable and initialise the person object in the private init method using the required init and the person object can be used like this with a name properties for instance or person could be made private and computed properties added to the singleton class and then the name properties is accessed directly

hive	hdfs
so that will create problem to use null condition in our query using hive for example lets insert null value to mysql table cities
by default sqoop will import null value as string null in hdfs
lets sqoop and see what happens sqoop import connect jdbc mysql localhost 3306 sqoop username sqoop -p table cities hive-import hive-overwrite hive-table vikas.cities -m 1

folder	dir

i have almost found a solution analysis when the helper is run from launchd or via authorizationexecutewithprivileges under macos 10.15 the helper may be running as root with no knowledge of the logged-in user hence the helper cannot determine the user s trash folder
oddly the environment variables see man env may even show the current user s name and home dir yet the real user id which one can query with getuid will return 0 root which also results in nsusername and nshomedirectory returning the root user s information

56824879
folder	dir
oddly the environment variables see man env may even show the current user s name and home dir yet the real user id which one can query with getuid will return 0 root which also results in nsusername and nshomedirectory returning the root user s information
and it appears that trashitematurl and related functions rely on nshomedirectory to determine the trash folder location
half-working solution fortunately there is a way to change the real user id with setreuid

making put back work looks like the reason for put back not working comes from a deeper issue it appears to be a long-standing bug in the macos framework see this bug report

associativity	operator-precedence
this expression will be parenthesised as as per the operator-precedence and associativity rule
one important note here is precedence and associativity has nothing to do with the order of evaluation

from the documentation in if you ever need to uninstall bettertouchtool just delete bettertouchtool app file from your applications folder or the folder you put bettertouchtool after downloading unzipping bettertouchtool

out of the box apache kafka cannot do fine-grained intra topic permissioning
you will have to write a custom kafka serializer deserializer serdes library or implement your own entitlements server in the middle to provide role based access control rbac and content based filtering
if you break the data into different topics then yes basic kafka acl can control access to the topic but that was not the original question and you aren t going to make 6 million topics in kafka

when converting a hex string to binary with xxd -r you have to use the -p to tell xxd that is a plain hex string no line breaks
when converting back to hex with xxd -p line breaks are added every 32 bytes
unfortunately xxd doesn t provide a flag to not include line breaks you could use -c to set the number of columns but it s limited to a max number

56827809
bluetooth	usb
he reason i think it didn t work when the rx and tx pins were in is that i think that the arduino s rx and tx pins have precedence over the usb cable meaning that the arduino was only kind of listening to the usb cable hence why the rx indicator flashed
so moving on the rx indicator worked when i unplugged the rx indicator from the computer because the arduino com disappeared meaning the top com was the bluetooth itself

you d also need to ensure that the post request is successful as an unsuccessful request would not persist the data in case of browser closure
after doing the above two you could disable the button only from the client side without trying the get the button last_clicked timestamp

width	height
his will hide the scrollbars but wont prevent your svg to have a bigger height than the window and overflow
so for that you want to add i put the width there instead of in the html code because the scrollbars makes more sense to me but you can also leave the scrollbars there and just add the max-height edit max-height is optional depending on the size ratio of the picture in your project


56828518

one of the problems is that you are hard-coding paths for just image 1.jpeg and therefore any other images within the folder are not moved

ake a look at this code snippet this code snippet will scan the source directory containing several images and will move several images to the destination directory

geocoding	geocode

currently google maps api doesn t have the capability to search for an address using a civic number and a postal address the closest api to this function is geocoding api as this can look up for a postal code
however the geocoding api is meant to geocode well-formatted address and not to assist a search for an address if you wish to have a function that will assist your users to find an address you may use the place autocomplete as a workaround but this also doesn t support the search for civic address

56828960
int	chars
if you have a number expressed as a string you can call string s toint32 method you can assign it to a variable with the type identifier however this only works if the string is all numbers no non-numeric non-hex chars
if you want to go the other way express an int as a string use the tostring method


56829127
int	chars
t is not practical to use a single bit to store numbers or chars
however you could say one int provided that one int is in the range 0 to 1


56829424
for-loop	loops
also note that will never only a very specific scenario where you impropperly set up your for-loop tokens so rhat they have ranges that overlap can create empty variolables
in your loops it is not possible as you just select alll token perfectly valid

int	chars	int	chars
for example a tab stop of 4 is placed at 1.0 chars units and a tab stop of 6 is placed at 1.5 average chars units
however if the list box is part of a dialog box the int are in dialog template units
the tab stops must be sorted in ascending order ... since font.tologfont doesn t return the average size of a chars in the lfwidth member of the logfont structure we can calculate it without pinvoking from pixels measures as where is the width in pixels of a string calculated using textrenderer.measuretext the can be calculated measuring the difference between m and i and represent the quarters of the average chars width as described in the docs a tabstop of 4 is equal to the width of the average chars in relation to the font currently selected

getter	setter
the difference is that variables declared with var on the top level assign to window properties and window.crypto is a property with a getter but no setter console.log object.getownpropertydescriptor window crypto
so when you assign to window.crypto with var crypto there s no setter so nothing happens
many other window properties behave the same way

each connection terminate after the request is completed or the server does not sends a response remains idle inactive
for an incoming request the server didn t send back the response in that case the connection will remain open till the specified timeout

56830341
terminate	timeout
or an incoming request the server didn t send back the response in that case the connection will remain open till the specified timeout
since each connection gets terminate after an incoming request is served so creating multiple connections may reduce the loading time.this is done by enabling the keep-alive which avoids the need to repeatedly open and close a new connection

put	get
the executioncontext that you are creating will not use a thread directly for each future but will instead schedule tasks runnable instances to be executed
in case no more threads are available in the pool these tasks will be put into a blockingqueue waiting to be executed
see threadpoolexecutor api for details if you look at the implementation of executors.newfixedthreadpool 1 you ll see that creates an executor with an unbounded queue to get the effect of thread-starvation that you were looking for you could create an executor with a limited queue yourself since the minimal capacity of arrayblockingqueue is 1 you would need three futures to reach the limit and you would also need to add some code to be executed on the result of the future to keep them from completing in the example below i do this by adding .map identity the following example fails with

56830622
free	realloc	free	calloc

you are using the trace tool to trace actual calls to malloc and free
you don t seem to be tracing calls to calloc and realloc presumably on the assumption that those functions will eventually call malloc

56830622
realloc	malloc	free	malloc	calloc	malloc

this is evidently what happened in your example since your realloc call asks for less memory than was allocated by calloc and we can see that it didn t do that here since the address of ptr when free is called is the same as the block allocated by calloc
if the existing allocation is much bigger than the request realloc may choose to copy the existing memory block into a smaller allocation possibly acquired with malloc

56830622
realloc	malloc
f the existing allocation is much bigger than the request realloc may choose to copy the block into a smaller allocation possibly acquired with malloc
but even if realloc does decide to reduce the size of the allocated memory there is no guarantee that the block the block need a new allocation


56831761
free	realloc	free	calloc	free	strdup	free	malloc
urthermore if a new block cannot be allocated null is returned and a new block is not free hence you should not store the return value directly to stringclone
if you want to use realloc here is what you should do since you do not seem to care that the contents of stringclone be preserved in the the reallocated block you should probably simply write note also that on posix compliant systems there is a memory allocation function that is very useful for your use case strdup s takes a pointer to a c string allocates strlen s + 1 bytes copies the string to the allocated block and returns it note also that casting the return value of malloc calloc and realloc is unnecessary in c and considered bad style

implements	extends
there are 2 ways to implements callbacks in swift
using protocols delegate using completion handler using protocols delegate example declare protocol your viewcontroller should extends the delegate now in your other classes you can send callback to viewcontroller through delegate object like delegate.method param your_param
using completion handler example we can call this function like

56832603
mousemove	keydown

this code only works for unity in visual studio you ll have to create an event to whatever object you want to do this for example if you want to call a void each time you press spacebar youll have to do this it is easy image below in the propieties window press the bolt icon and after double click on the event you want to create samples textchanged locationchnaged mousemove etc.
i will use keydown on the textbox object image now in your code this void should be generated image inside this void i writed your code and this is how your code looks put int n 1 before voids now each time you ll press or stay pressed spacebar the textbox will be filled with test text and the value will be 1 more each time

56832653
cpu	processors
these data structures are completely different and the main distinction here is the memory layout std vector puts its element into a contiguous location in memory while std set is a node-based container where every element is separately allocated and resides at distinct places in memory possibly far away from each other and definitely in a way that pre-fetching data for fast traversal is impossible for the processors
this is quite the opposite for std vector - as the next element is always just right next to the current one in memory a cpu will load elements into its cache and when actually processing the elements it only has to go to the cache to retrieve the values - which is very fast compared to ram access
note that it s a common need to have a sorted unique collection of data that is laid out contiguously in memory and c++2a or the version thereafter might actually ship with a flat_set have a look at p1222

56832756
subtract	add
well it means that if you add 10 -24 to 10 -9 it is just on the border of being too small to show up in the larger number 10 -9
observe since the z-score statistics stuff involves basically adding and subtract a few standard deviations from the mean or so it will definitely have problems if the difference in the exponent is 16
it s probably not a good situation if the difference is like 14 or 15

integer	unsigned

presumably using integer arithmetic
adding the line kernel kernel 12 gave more correct results for the kernel but the rounding within the convolution function seemed to screw things up again so i ve left the kernel without the 12 the relu was screwing things up again because of the rounding anything below zero that keras wasn t correctly truncating to unsigned byte was being filtered out by the activation function

after confirming that every other encoding requirement was fine python systemd locales etc it was clear that the problem was gunicorn everything else in the app works fine it s only the spreadsheet exportation that throws this

i m not sure if it s still relevant but it might be the problem with analyzer package versioning
try to upgrade your dependencies and or add dependency override

56835991
int	chars
since probably in the database this is a chars or varchar as well similar to string
or you could manipulate the int to a string with leading zeros
ofcourse you would want to optimize this last bit so that the leading zeros are correct

56836532
filtering	grouping
to get exactly same results as in tensorflow change the lines specifying weights to because your input has two input channels as you have correctly declared in tf grouping parameter you have misunderstood what is grouping parameter responsible for in pytorch
it restricts the number of channels each filtering uses in this case only one as 2 input_channels divided by 2 give us one
see here for more intuitive explanation for 2d convolution

56836794
for-loop	loops

it is a for-loop so it increments according to what you write in its header i++ here
you don t need to increment i manually in loops body by doing i++ once more

when i run this locally i m actually seeing 6 checks because put is getting checked twice though i m not sure why

56837188
int	double

the main error seems to be using int variables for floating point quantities
in the calculation these are clearly continuously varying quantities which should be represented in a c++ program by a double

56837365
for-loop	loops

if your arrays looks like this you can do a simple for-loop to return the instance in the arrays when you get a match
we create an empty variable c to host we answer we then loops through the arrays to find where the arrays object page1 matches we indexof page

56837366
for-loop	loops
if you want multiple statements to be part of a for-loop or while loops or if statement etc. then you need delimit those statements with curly braces vs
it s generally a good idea to use curly braces even if you only have a single statement you ve also created two separate variables named i this works because the for-loop creates a new scope and you can have variables in different scopes with the same name
the variable i in the for-loop hides or shadows the variable i declared at the beginning of the program

well string.split returns array - so if you are not going to add remove items just put if you want to add remove items into from the collection and that s why array is out of question try instead of obsolete arraylist finally if you insist on arraylist few more details 1le 1ge .split will return 1le 1ge please note leading space
you can get rid of 1le 1ge either by splitting on not or with a help of linq followed by materialization .toarray or .tolist or or

put	get
if it was a same origin policy issue then the browser console would display a message about cors or access-control headers in the console of the developer tools
in this case whatever method you are using and you ve said put patch update etc which is quite broad isn t supported by the server
note that by default when dealing with static files most servers only allow get post options and head requests

56838656
implements	extends
class marker details class marker extends abstract class abstractconfigurationobject has member markersymbol which simply implements interface serializable
class markersymbolurl implements interface markersymbol and seems to represent a simple getter setter wrapper class around string url
class markersymbolenum only implements a static list of enum values so not relevant

56838656
abstract-class	superclass
setattribute ... which stores the calculated vaadinicon attribute string i believe this eventually gets written out in the div tag element extends abstract-class node which implements interface serializable
next steps ultimately this seems to indicate classes marker markersymbol and icon don t share a common superclass other than object so no interoperability
for a deeper dive i d look at how the various vaadin components render the ui using the generated markup but for now it seems using markersymbolurl and a dynamically calculated url from the vaadinicon represents the only straightforward workaround

56839106
prepare	execute
in it it states ...otherwise the file is prepare when calling play which may result in a small delay
this means that if you check the .isplaying property immediately after calling play like you are doing it is not guaranteed that the file is actually playing by time your console.log player.isplaying execute
there is also the second issue that .isplaying is not a static property on the player class despite how it appears in the docs

56839510
migrate	upgrade

the problem is the latest firebase dependencies are migrate to androidx
so one fix is to migrate your project to androidx see migrate to androidx which i prefer because all the new upgrade are using androidx

56839510
migrate	downgrade	versioning	upgrade
so one fix is to migrate your project to androidx see migrate to androidx which i prefer because all the new upgrade are using androidx
or else you can downgrade the firebase-core dependency to below versioning implementation com.google.firebase firebase-core 16.0.9


56840031
put	get
a file that is opened using the with block will get closed on exiting the with block
put your reader code inside the with block like below


56840109
swift	objective-c
they need to be made in context
as a rule in swift you should avoid relying on subclassing
there is some that is required because of bridging to objective-c but swift-focused code should avoid subclasses

56840520
decoder	encoder
and during inference you use the same encoder and decoder units as in rnn units with the saved weight matrices
what differs during training and inference is mainly the you would the decoder rnn cell
while training one usually feeds the ground truth tokens to the decoder at every time step

56840684
free	malloc
your malloc calls in this case are not needed
in fact you end up with unreachable memory that you now can not free because you overwrote the pointers with the result from crypt


56841588
versioning	upgrade
until then impute was part of the preprocessing module docs and there was not a simpleimputer class
simpleimputer became part of the new sklearn.impute module only in versioning 0.20 docs so this or a newer one is the versioning you need
you can upgrade to the latest versioning 0.21.2 with pip install -u scikit-learn

56841590
put	get
i m still working though what exactly i should put as my cmd directive but i no longer get the no command specified for process type web error
since you switched to using heroku.yml you were able to get around the cmd by using run web dotnet api.dll heroku docs say if you don t include a run section heroku uses the cmd specified in the dockerfile.


56841852
put	get

with swi you can use last 2 and the definition of secondtast 2 from this question you can put a cut to avoid the solution false in the first query
this is a first solution you can get super fancy and use for instance reverse 2 and other predicates to find another solution but maybe slower

56841942
post	get
robinhood will send an sms message or email with a temporary 5 minute code. also at this point use the 400 response s body to get id from challenge inside of the json object
confirm the challenge by making a post request to where challengeid is the same id mentioned in the first failed oauth2 token post request
make the same post request to and include in the header x-robinhood-challenge-response-id with the value challengeid

56842769
folder	directory
for example on windows the temp directory is located at c users username appdata local temp
there will be a folder in there named gen_py
on my system the available constants you can use are found inside gen_py 3.7 00020813-0000-0000-c000-000000000046x0x1x7 __init__.py

56842774
int	double

now it is better to declare the variable i as an int since it is used as a row index and row indexes are int
that way we avoid inaccuracy of double floating-point arithmetic

56842774
int	double
that way we avoid inaccuracy of double floating-point arithmetic
dim i as int in the for-loop i starts at 7383 and is incremented by steps of 81
this is good

56842915
int	chars
in both x86-64 system v and windows x64 the only 16-bit int types are short and unsigned short so tells us that b is short or unsigned short
those abis also have char_bit 8 1-byte chars which is normal for machines with byte-addressable memory. the fixed-width types like uint8_t and int16_t are typedefs for unsigned chars and short and so on
i m not counting them for this

56843124
subtract	add

all it does is simply take each item and tries to subtract the value from it s corresponding category in the root set this gives us a delta or value relative to the item s category in the root set
if we add categories that include other categories the code get s more complicated but the idea is the same - to have from lowest to highest delta value of each item mapped to the item in the root set

56843156
range	max	range	min
it narrows your window by silently applying range between unbounded preceding and current row
min recorded_time over partition by rec.pat_id first_time max recorded_time over partition by rec.pat_id final_time


56843180
implements	extends

the solution for me was to implements a custom dircontextprocessor that allowed me to sort on multiple attributes with the desired direction ascending descending by making use of the overload method of the sortcontrol class that takes an array of sortkey s objects as a parameter
the implementation must extends the abstractfallbackrequestandresponsecontroldircontextprocessor and override the createrequestcontrol method

56843363
starttls	smtps
he 220 response from the server does not mean that the tls session is already established the tls session just means that the client may start negotiating the tls session after receiving a 220 response to a starttls command the client must start the tls negotiation before giving any other smtps commands
if after having issued the starttls command the client finds out that some failure prevents the tls session from actually starting a tls handshake then the tls session should abort the connection from rfc 3207 at this point a missing certificate is the most likely problem


56843417
qtimer	qobject
update from comments when you uncomment you get qobject starttimer timers cannot be started from another thread because of 2 things the qquickitem update forwards the request to the window and then to the platform adaptation
cases the implementation uses a qtimer to schedule the repaint
you call not from the gui thread

56843567
keras	tensorflow

from the error message it looks like some gradient operation has not been implemented in keras
you could try to use tensorflow operations to achieve the same result untested

56843594
for-loop	loops

one way to compare two lists is by using a nested for-loop or a for-loop inside of a for-loop
one loops would be for user input and the other for your list

56843653
spaces	linefeed
m running the command explicitly the vis command is an extended version of the vis program from brian w kernighan rob pike the unix programming environment nov 1983
it makes non-printing characters visible. if you make the script executable the kernel doesn t treat the cr as white spaces either and fails to find the command
c source code in c source code officially you can t use backslash to continue lines in c if the line ending is crlf because the character after the backslash isn t a newline nl or linefeed

56844062
comm	grep

if you want a list of lines that exist in goodruns.txt and that don t exist in idontneed.txt this is exactly what comm is for
a solution with bash sort and comm might be if you prefer to use awk or grep they will work fine if you just reverse the files

56844224
google-chrome	firefox
t least with mobile google-chrome mobile google-chrome does
i tried mobile firefox too but mobile firefox doesn t work as for huawei unfortunately mobile firefox didn t recognize mobile firefox


56844327
int	chars	int	double
it can happen in various contexts when you are going from a smaller primitive numeric type to a larger primitive numeric type
the int type is smaller than the float type
in general byte short and chars int long float double

56845013
ionic	angular

this is not an included component within ionic 4 but this s not a hard problem to solve
you can use angular material s expansion panel if you want to use an off the shelf component

56845075
aggregate-functions	sum
if expression contains an aggregate-functions that specifies a scope other than the default the scope parameter for the previous function must be a containing scope for the scope specified in the aggregate-functions call - in other words the textboxes must be in a child scope of the quarter1 scope
if so you don t need the previous function you can just calculate the aggregate over the entire dataset quarter1 in the sum function like so


56845081
migrate	upgrade
with this release libraries are migrate from the android support libraries to the jetpack androidx libraries
the updated libraries will not work unless you make the following changes in your app upgrade com.android.tools.build gradle to v3.2.1 or later
upgrade compilesdkversion to 28 or later

56845160
oncreate	recreate
his can be achieved by doing 1 of the following uninstalling the app and then rerunning or clearing the app s data and then rerunning or if the onupgrade method has been suitably coded then the database version number 4th parameter of the sqliteopenhelper super call can be increased suitably coded would require the onupgrade method to drop the table and to then create the table typically the tables are dropped and then the oncreate method is called if you cannot afford to lose data then you would need to rename the table using the alter table and then create the table and then load the data from the renamed original table
issue 2 - alternative solution an alternative to changing the column type would be to use cast to force a type affinity you could use - or using either of the above doesn t require the table to be recreate but isn t the preferable method as it s messy


56845363
cashapelayer	calayer

so i ended up taking rs7 s advice and used a cashapelayer instead
instead of using interface builder i went ahead and create a cashapelayer and added a cashapelayer in viewdidlayoutsubviews then i went ahead and updated updateprogressbar to resize a calayer instead of an nslayoutconstraint constant

56845812
post	get
this would be possible using get as rest returns the json it can by default be up to 100 items and you can get more items if needed by specifying top
as far as writing back or to the server post would be what your looking for this to my understanding would need to be one for one


56845813
put	get

you are going to use a get-request and put your request-data book-id array in the data-section of your ajax or whatever you re going to use request
see how to pass parameters in get requests with jquery

56846004
submit	submission

since you appear to send the exact same data to two different handlers you can flip the coin - and say that you just submit one form and process two different handlers both in filecreate.php
as you are sending a form you cannot send two separate forms in the same http request - so you can either do you are sending a form both through asynchronous methods or process you are sending a form both backend after the submission of one form

56846117
union-find	tree
use the well-known union-find disjoint set data structure to very efficiently track the nodes each tree detect cycles and do updates
each of those operations is for all practical purposes o 1 if union-find is implemented correctly
there s an inverse ackerman term in the actual time bound but for the number of atoms in the universe that s under 5... consequently the final algorithm will run in o m time where m is the number of edges that you attempt to insert into g2

56846204
width	border-box	width	border-box	height	border-box	height	border-box
make height to 100 to 100vh and give box-sizing border-box
this will fix your padding property 100 width and height
box-sizing border-box

56846204
height	border-box
box-sizing border-box
why i use vh a percentage of the full viewport height
10vh will resolve to 10 of the current viewport height and this will give you more responsive things

56846204
height	border-box
10vh will resolve to 10 of the current viewport height and this will give you more responsive things
but if you want use 100 this will also work fine with box-sizing border-box
here is your solution code

56846394
folder	directory
able location is directory not file
if you need to create new table and keep new table s files not mixed with other table then create separate folder


56846730
versioning	upgrade
the problem is that phpmyadmin at 4.6.6 has minor incompatibilities with php versioning 7.2.19
these are solved by updating to versioning 4.7.9 of phpmyadmin
as noted in another answer the basic steps are make a backup copy of your current installation in usr share phpmyadmin download and extract the latest versioning of phpmyadmin modify the vendor_config.php file to point at the appropriate directory for ubuntu etc phpmyadmin my answer is a copy of the same solution for ubuntu 16 as provided in phpmyadmin errors count blowfish etc. after php7.2 upgrade on ubuntu 16

56846738
flask	django
since you are a beginner start to implement the same using flask a python based based micro framework
or if your requirement is big then go with django if you only want to return serve html via python then go with cgi remember
to use all these 3 you need server like apache or wsgi. for cgi you can do the same with apache or with python server

56846739
post	get	post	put

this seems to work for login as andreilozhkin commented from chrome devtools you can see exactly what payload is passed to post request which includes authentacity_token
i got that token by first making a get request to and used exactly what payload in put request to login

56847059
superclass	subclassing
edit as holger suggested in the comments we don t have to force because t could be a subclassing of k and you could still use the identity function to map from t to k
therefore you could use this if you want to allow collecting to a map whose key type is a superclass of the type you are collecting


56847205
ubuntu	linux
the best work around for using ie on ubuntu os is to install any windows os using virtual machine
than you can try to access that windows os from your ubuntu os and try to run your tests with ie browser
there is also no selenium web driver support for ie on linux os

56847416
google-chrome	firefox
turns out that this syntax is necessary for flask external file javascript to work in google-chrome
while only worked for me in firefox
also i had a bunch of commented out horizontal html rulers in my original code

56847642
put	get
to put the name s into one json array you can use the aggregate function json_agg group this result by the country
to get the expected output you need to use the aggregate function json_object_agg which creates key pair values from city and name array documentation


56847702
implements	extends
only one instance of getsystemservice class has an implementation and that invokes an abstract method
this means the implementation for these should be provided mostly by the implements classes which include contextwrapper application activity service intentservice looking at the api documentation the hierarchy of the classes looks like this context | contextwrapper | application | contextthemewrapper | activity | service | intentservice since we know that context itself is not providing any insight we move down the tree and take a look at the contextwrapper and realize that there isn t much there either
since application extends contextwrapper there isn t much to look at over there either since it doesn t override the implementation provided by contextwrapper

56847755
for-loop	loops

you need to call you function within the for-loop
you are returning the first result of the list instead of giving it the chance to loops

56847786
selenium	appium
looking into dependencies for appium 4.1.2 it appears that you need selenium 2.53.1 other versions might not work due to jar hell
basically you need to have only appium java in your project classpath if you re using a build system like maven or gradle - the other jars will be resolved via transitive dependencies mechanism
i would also recommend upgrading to appium client 7.0.0 or whatever is the latest version released

56847789
post	get

this being said you should create another node named allposts which will hold all post of all users like in the following schema example firebase-root | --- allposts | --- postid | --- post details | --- uid enas .
tfz2 if you add a listener on post node you ll be able to get all post of all users

56847903
put	get

put it in using or just use system.security.cryptography.md5cryptoserviceprovider then no need for using
my point is hope you get it now

56848223
toolchain	bitbake
oky.conf you can retrieve poky.conf actual value by issuing the commands below then you will find the gccversion along with the rest of the toolchain configuration variables in
note that the variables inside the aforementioned file can be overwritten or reassigned in other configuration files such as conf local.conf that s why bitbake -e should be used to retrieve poky.conf real value instead


56848451
x86	64bit
i found three types of library armeabi armeabi-v7a and x86
however 64bit architecture cpu can execute 32-bit programs automatically under the adaptive function of operating system
these three libraries are found in commonly cocos2d-x game-source-project

56848702
grafana	metrics	prometheus	metrics

for monitoring with grafana i recommand prometheus with the jmx exporter in your case
you can add more exporter if you need you can expose your app s metrics to prometheus etc

56848702
grafana	metrics	prometheus	metrics
you can add more exporter if you need you can expose your app s metrics to prometheus etc
prometheus is a fully integrated monitoring solution just the graphs are limited because you cannot make dashboards but for that you have grafana


56848855
org.json	jackson

the answer to this question was that org.json and org.json.simple did not create jsonobjects that were interchangeable
i used jackson library and objectmapper jsonnode and objectnode to update the file - ultimately removing the org.json.simple library altogether

56849044
inherited	properties

i was looking to do the same thing and here is what i came up with i inherited from contentpresenter styled that control as i wanted and than placed the derived contentpresenter inside my popup i only used 2 text blocks for the simplicity but it is easy to understand how any content could be added
my custom control style for the control the use of the control i tried illustrating how some properties can be constant across all controls others can be customized per control and others could be bound to templatepart here is the final result

56849181
put	get
what you can do instead is this and now you get this output d table-top.txt d chair-leg.txt d comp-cpu.txt you can replace the write-host with your original file checking logic and you should get the behaviour you were after
note - this requires your arrays to be exactly the same length so you might need to put some error handling in before this bit of code in your script


56849205
ssl	https	ssl	https
enabling ssl tls on web server makes secure http connection https instead of plain http
by enabling https you are securing the data transferred between client and server through encryption
note that to enable ssl tls you need server certificate and how you obtain the certificate that is take care by this infrastructure

56849247
installation	upgrade
the following installation steps are required prior to running the eb cli scripts
as i m a windows user i created a clean virtualbox vm install of ubuntu 18.04.2 update ubuntu sudo apt update sudo apt upgrade sudo reboot install curl wget sudo apt install curl sudo apt install wget install zlib sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev install libffi sudo apt-get install libffi libffi5-dev install openssl sudo apt-get install libssl-dev install gcc sudo apt-get install build-essential sudo apt install libx11-dev gcc --version make -v install python 3.7 sudo apt install software-properties-common sudo add-apt-repository ppa deadsnakes ppa sudo apt install python3.7 python3.7 --version alias python python3.7 install git sudo apt install git after this run the eb cli you should see these 5 successful progress steps creating exclusive virtualenv for ebcli activating virtualenv installing ebcli creating eb wrappers finishing up success


56849464
folder	directory

you should take a look at the modules documentation page  there this example is given to access a file placed in the resources folder you also need to list the file in meta6.json so the file will be accessible once the module is installed
resources works with individual files not directory structures

56849583
pull	push

so you ll need to login the the virtual only to be able to pull from any through the virtual
but push will be limited to the default deployment target repo defined in the virtual one

56849732
versioning	upgrade
the stable channel releases patches for security issues and bug fixes for 4 months after the initial release giving users a one-month window to upgrade to the latest release while still receiving fixes
with docker ee a new versioning is released every quarter and each release is supported for a full calendar year
both bug fixes and security patches are backported to all supported versions

56849750
integer	unsigned
cython on the other hand maps all c integer types long int and so on simple onto python-integer which make sense
now when numpy is cimported no longer means using __getitem__ of the numpy-array which would return np.uint32 -object but a c-integer in this case unsigned 4byte which is converted to a python-integer because return xxx means in a def function means the result must be a python-object
which does mean that the array has a different type - the types are mapped differently when converted to python-object by cython

56850162
int	double
then retrieve the input and convert it to int or float
---edit--- code to retrieve the value from edit text and convert it to double


56850403
folder	dir

say that you have your es4x application and a package.json when you execute npm install you will get inside node_modules a few extra folder .bin .lib in the .bin directory there is a es4x-launcher.jar file you can use to start your application from eclipse
a es4x-launcher.jar file you can use to start your application from eclipse will refer to the dependencies which are unpacked to the .lib dir

56850468
int	double
as double d double.parsedouble vector1.get 1
int v int math.round d


56851017
put	get

i believe you have to register it as a typescript declaration file - so create a separate file called axios-plugin.d.ts and put in then you should have access to where you need it
would work in pure javascript but typescript forces you to declare everything but you get that sweet sweet type checking

56851334
post	get
you can find the axios reference from the documentation
according to the documentation from google when you use the post request method you need to pass body and the image you uploaded shows you used firstname param
so either change your api and use body to get the first name or you can do something like this

56851591
for-loop	loops
any code after loops won t ever be executed because the macro will have terminated
rather than using end use exit for if all you want to do is to break out of the for-loop


56851628
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
an other error would be that the file names are only case-insensitive in windows when not starting a jar
a jar zip file linux and mac all have case-sensitive file names
check the case-sensitive spelling

56851788
octal	hex
never write leading zeroes in c code
if you write something like 0879 in c it means octal format
by taking more care of types we can split your 32 bit number in two like this print uint16_t as hex by using printf prix16 first from inttypes.h

56852045
children	parent
the grid container is the parent
the grid items are the children
any descendants of the grid container beyond the children such as your img grand-children are outside the scope of grid layout and will ignore grid properties

56852409
valgrind	memcheck	valgrind	memcheck
for this include valgrind memcheck.h and define your macro as #define use x valgrind_check_value_is_defined x and be sure to always pass an lvalue
you can also run memcheck with the for heavier tracking that should show where the uninitialized data originated
see also the valgrind faq on uninitialised value errors which explains both as well as why valgrind doesn t complain on copying uninitialised values

56852469
put	get

you can merge two repos and deploy both backend and frontend as follows inside your nodejs app open a folder named client and put all the vue project inside a folder named client
if you are using vue cli change your vue.config.js as follows to create a dist folder inside the root of the nodejs project like make all the get post endpoints of nodejs application start with api to not get conflict with the path that redirects all the requests to vue client app other than api paths

56852484
versioning	upgrade

in my case upgrading everything to the latest versioning helped
here are the steps open the android project as a separate project upgrade gradle upgrade all the firebase-related dependencies migrate to androidx if needed go back to the android project upgrade all the firebase-related dependencies there search for the latest versioning at update them and run flutter --no-color packages upgrade or just click packages upgrade in the main pubspec.yaml upgrade the flutter itself by running flutter --no-color upgrade or clicking flutter upgrade

56853187
post	get
for example for cases that are effectively read-only you would like to use a safe method because that allows pre-caching optimization and automated retry of lost responses on an unreliable network
post doesn t have extra semantic constraints so you lose out
what http really wants is that you get using the uri

56853187
post	get
hat http really wants is that you get using the uri
this can be done in one of two relatively straightforward ways 1 post the ids to the server to create a new resource meaning that the server retains for the server a copy of the list of ids and receive a new resource identifier back in exchange


56853195
put	get

you almost have it done just a couple of things regarding the payload of the first request where you initiate the resumable upload and send the metadata you should put it this way to store the file in the selected folder the only change would be using the quotation marks inside the brackets for each parent folder id this is because the api is expecting an array of strings for the parents field each string for each parent folder id 1
for the second part of the resumable upload uploading the file you just have to obtain the file you want to upload and send the file as the request body with the data parameter in the request like this using the function open 2 with the file path including the filename relative or absolute and using rb as the 2nd parameter to read the file in binary mode you will get a raw binary file file object and applying the read 3 function to the file you will get the binary data which is what the request is expecting in the request body data parameter

56853406
equals	tostring

considering 2 files equals if they have the same extension and the same file size is simply a matter of creating an object that represents this equality
so you d make something like and fill in all the missing boilerplate constructor tostring equals hashcode and getters

56853518
onchange	preventdefault
your messageform should update your state using an onchange handler
then handlesubmit should preventdefault and dispatch your sendnewmessage action using the value s from state that have already been set
the react docs are very helpful on this

56853631
subtract	add

subtract for the seconds
an awk solution will be much faster but this is a great trick to add to the toolbox

56853863
build.gradle	gradlew
ource of the problem the source of the problem for most of us is the + range selector in gradlew dependencies
as shown here as an example in react-native-google-analytics-bridge for most of us us re not setting a googleplayservicesversion value in the top level android build.gradle so we ll want to specify + because theres various other google service packages available and various other google service packages available re not all at the same version number


56853899
screens	tablet

no you cannot prevent an activity from being recreated when the screens turns off or the user homes out
i recommend you start your journey through android via the official android fundamentals to understand the lifecycle of an android application in the constrained environment of a linux os running on a constrained device your phone tablet

56854052
range	max	range	min
a workaround for this is to disable the axis own generated labels and create your own using axis range
you ll also want to set your own min max values on the axis
here s a basic demo

56854375
put	get

in xcode 10 it doesn t seem possible to put a lone nstextview in some custom view hierarchy earlier answers have hinted that this was possible
this was possible is possible to get this working with the customview method in the question - however this will only have the simple nsview properties in the attributes inspector you won t be able to customise font etc

56854737
virtualenv	conda
 could then use the build system choice python + virtualenv to use that activated environment
fortunately the conda environment was still activated and i only needed to use the build system choice of conda to switch back to the conda environment


56855019
mouseover	mouseleave
handle mouseover and mouseleave events on tr as follows
html ts as you show your checkbox on mouseover i think no need of select all checkbox on table header row
find working stackblitz

56855155
integer	unsigned
then read a 2 byte unsigned integer to read command size which is 6 for screen
read command and then read four bytes unsigned length for command data
for our sample it is 36352

56855275
centos	linux
on linux use your favourite package manager and install git-gui
on redhat-based systems ex centos do yum install -y git-gui which will install the gitk dependency
done

56855312
inline	inlining
inlining only gives the compiler the chance to optimize the code away but it is not a guarantee
make it a recursive template function gives the compiler the chance to waste your memory with non inline recursive template instances which is the opposite of what you want to achieve
if you compile with -o0 you see a lot of code generated from your example

56855312
inline	constexpr
but you should move to constexpr functions instead of using more or less unreadable mtp code
so inline is only a very small part of the problem
your compiler is better as you believe

56855362
post	get
holds a pessimistic lock on all returned documents
this capability is also mentioned in the so post here
notice that on the corresponding client-side js sdk doc the argument to the get function only accepts a documentref

56855494
int	double

first in c the declaration of a variable should look like its access meaning the real value of the pointer to a pointer to an int ist the int value hence you access the pointer with
you see double pointers often in functions because the pointer allows you to allocate space for the values you return

56855691
integer	unsigned
on implementations people are most likely to use the conversion will occur the way you expect the representation of the unsigned value will be reinterpreted as a signed value
specifically gcc does the following the result of or the signal raised by converting an integer to a signed integer type when the value cannot be represented in an object of that type c90 6.2.1.2 c99 and c11 6.3.1.3
for conversion to a type of width n the value is reduced modulo 2 n to be within range of the type

56855744
mediacodec	audiorecord	mediacodec	mediarecorder
audiorecord does take longer to understand and implement though if you want to stick with a mediarecorder object then i recommend using aac_adts as the audio encoder and allowing the outputformat to be three_gpp
otherwise this may help you encode raw aac files how to generate the aac adts elementary stream with android mediacodec


56856459
implements	modifiers

as you said its implements using a singleton pattern so you need to use the instance methods instead of constructor
because of the private modifiers on constructor private gopigo3 int addr boolean detect .

56856642
int	boolean

i would try to store that data in a pair of int s long s or biginteger s depending on how many indices you have
first think about doing something like this where the boolean are true if and only if the item at the corresponding index was not added removed

56857146
bash	zsh	bash	subshell
use zsh the simplest solution is to use zsh which is a non- bash shell that supports reading null-separated values via read -d since version 4.2 released in 2004 and the only mainstream shell that can store nulls in variables
moreover the last component of the pipeline is not run in subshell in zsh so variables set there are not lost
we can simply write with zsh we can also easily avoid the problem of null separators altogether at least in the case of find

56857644
versioning	upgrade

as of cargo 1.36.0 you can now use the following command s on a nightly toolchain instead of using the cargo-update crate to update crates to their latest versioning this came from pull request #6798 add install-upgrade
instead of failing when cargo install detects a package is already installed a package will upgrade if the versions don t match or do nothing exit 0 if a package is considered up-to-date

56857889
for-loop	loops
p.s
you do not have to define the variable i for a for-loop
for loops do it all for you

56858682
width	margin
owever after looking over the code rather than doing a flexbox you could simply add a width 40 to the .tema class
this will keep the divs from expanding into the other area i personally don t think the margin is the best way to go with it at least it isn t what i would do here is the code for this if i am understanding what you want your end result to be correctly having the large text div not overflow into the right area


56858713
post	get

i know that is a very old post but i am always be questioned by some colleagues when some colleagues are building jpa queries how to do the same thing almost never you will find a perfect fit function to do what do you want
but using some logic you can get the same result in full jpa

56858779
versioning	upgrade
for example alternatively you can follow the docs to create a stateless functional component side note judging from your imports it appears that you are using an outdated versioning of expo
i would recommend to upgrade to the latest one for a new project


56858796
subtract	addition
this often occurs when you have values with large variation in magnitude
if you add a bunch of floating point numbers and then subtract the same numbers the result will often not be zero
this is because floating point addition and subtraction is not necessarily associative or distributive

56859028
integer	unsigned

in the same way for an integer if the value crossed the maximum value then it will go back to the negative range
proof output -2 147 483 648 suggestion instead of using the signed-integer go with unsigned integer

56859230
folder	dir

i have had success testing my react-native-web project s shared api calls reducers and components with the following tools jest enzyme redux-mock-store fetch-mock jest-localstorage-mock important note on file structure a react-native project cannot find symlinked folder outside of src but a react project can
for this reason i put all of my shared code including all tests in myapp native src shared and myapp web src shared is just a symlink to the shared folder in the native dir

56859272
filtering	grouping

so we can fetch 60 instead of 20 filtering for the first 20 of selected gender
if we don t reach 20 on a 0.4 chance then redraw another set of 20 to fill out our grouping

56859808
beanstalk	amazon-web-services

i think elastic beanstalk might not have read write role through which elastic beanstalk can access s3
you won t need credentials when running in amazon-web-services everything depends on roles permissions

56859860
intersect	contains
a contains b if and only if b is within a
the c++ source code says the same the crosses and intersect function have different implementation
according to this documentation page intersect return true if disjoint returns false and the disjoint predicate means that the two geometries have no point in common

56860232
let	curry
however we want to be able to specify the type parameter and then let the compiler still verify that the generic representation is an hlist to match up with frommap s signature
since dependent types don t work with other variables defined in the same parameter list and we only get one implicit parameter list we need to resort to a little bit of trickery to curry the type parameters when we run the output of the previous chunk through that we get


56860277
memset	malloc

you can allocate the array as a contiguous block the memset call is going beyond the bounds of the allocated array a the array is comprised of pointers and has rows elements
since you re allocating the sub-arrays individually you d need separate memset calls for each malloc d pointer

56860418
pbkdf2	hash
if you derive a key from a password you should use a password based key derivation function also sometimes called a password hash
in c# there is an implementation of pbkdf2 badly called rfc2898derivebytes
by now that s not very state of the art either but it should suffice - if you set a high enough iteration count anyway

56860470
swift	objective-c
so assuming your nserrorextension.swift extension looks like this you can create a nserrorextension.h file without a corresponding .m one this should make the function available on the objective-c side
the downside is that you ll need to do this for every function you want to expose from the swift side of the unit tests


56860663
folder	directory
this will create a dist folder with an index.html as well as all the javascript css etc assets that your app contains
i m not familiar with tomcat but you may be able to simple copy paste this directory somewhere and have tomcat read it which is a good starting point for seeing how the pieces fit together
getting this to work well in production usually requires a bit of work

56860738
put	get	put	get
put the tasks on a list
when you get a certain amount there say you want 10 going at once start waiting for the first one to finish look up task whenany for more info
then put more on - you can then control the size of the lits of tasks by # second using other code

56860898
micro-optimization	benchmarking
benchmarking mode cnt score error units primefactors.counter thrpt 5 1513 228 13 046 ops ms primefactors.set thrpt 5 1411 573 10 004 ops ms note that set performance did not change because jit was able to do the same optimization itself thanks to a simpler control flow graph
conclusion java performance is a really complicated thing especially when talking about micro-optimization
jit optimizations are fragile and it s hard to understand jvm s mind without specialized tools like jmh and profilers

56860933
switching	screens

from the documentation of createswitchnavigator by default it does not handle back actions and it resets routes to actions default state when you switching away
so all you really need to do is navigate to your signin screens

56860936
folder	directory

make sure you aren t indexing your dist or www folder
right click the folder - mark directory as - excluded

56861113
put	get
in order to get that number of possible configurations to 1 the final solution you would need to perform 35 divisions by 2
or otherwise put 2 35 is the first power of 2 that is greater than that 31 billion
so even if we would know how to use the classifier in the most optimal way we would still need 35 calls in the worst case

56861346
swift	objective-c
n all probability you had this correctly set already but this was working in objective-c only
if you go into the identity inspector and delete the class and hit return and then enter the class again and hit return you ll see that now the identity inspector sees that we are supposed to get the class from the swift module and things will start working in swift


56861555
versioning	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
this issue was caused by a bug in versioning 1.0.2
i upgrade to 1.2.0 and the code ran as expected
when you upgrade make sure to upgrade your javascript files as well or you ll have a versioning mismatch issue

56861748
client-side	server-side
there are numerous code examples on the internet supporting just about any language server-side
client-side is always performed in a web browser
google g suite google identity server if your goal is to only support members in your own company via a domain name use google g suite paid or google identity server free

56861967
min	max
the max_list.size keeps you from trying to access and remove out of bounds elements since removing changes the size of the list assuming list
problems not addressed in this but should not be ignored the code does not handle adding elements back if the min is relaxed in a later selection
you could reset the max list before every call to the default. if the selected max is one of the elements removed

56862060
maven	pom.xml

although i cannot seem to find a gradle plugin which can do the deployment to aws lambda directly but it is easy to do it with maven with many plugins and ways
one example - this aws article has maven archetype which generates a code base with pom.xml which does direct deployment to aws lambda using cloudformation in background

56862078
division	exponent
ince the zero mask bit found in the control word of the x87 fpu is a 1 the pre-computed exception flag becomes set once the x87 fpu detects the zero in the operand used for division
now the processor knows to do something like this 1 sign of operand 1 our -1.0 xor 0 sign of operand 2 the zero ---------- 1 response now with that response bit i know whether i have a positive or negative infinity -inf 1 11111111 00000000000000000000000 -----+-+------+-+---------------------+ | | | | | | +------+ +---------------------+ | | | | v v | exponent fraction | v sign if i had a positive 1.0 instead and divided by zero 0 sign of operand 1 xor 0 sign of operand 2 ----------- 0 now i have inf 0 11111111 00000000000000000000000 as long as the numerator is positive and you re dividing by zero you ll get the same positive infinity this is what i imagine happening when i run something like this the result is -inf which looks like this 1 11111111 00000000000000000000000 qnans quiet not a number are especially helpful for debugging and are generated through a few different ways but 0.0 0.0 will return something that looks like this qnan 0 11111111 10000000000000000000000 -----+-+------+-+---------------------+ | | +---------------------+ | v fraction now software can manipulate the bits in the fraction of a qnan for any purpose usually this seems done for diagnostic purposes to learn more i recommend watching parts 31 and 33 of this intel manual reading


56862157
postgresql	mysql
isread the column types because that column is varchar 255 when the application builds the schema in postgresql
the application s longtext in mysql which explains why i was able to get past the 190 characters


56862370
width	height
see i have write width 7vw

appdata	uninstaller
step 1 uninstaller angular cli and nodejs as administrator
step 2 delete folders from appdata npm npm-cache or use following command npm cache clean step 3 delete nodejs folder from programs and files step 4 reboot step 5 reintall lastest version node setp 6 install angular cli


56863289
ionic	angular
the variable coordinates is an array such that coordinates lng lat and this.map is just a variable under my angular class that call to the mapboxgl.map object
you have to know that i am using ionic 4 in this case
if you need more information please tell me

56863305
goto	break
please refer this link for loops in python for example of using while loop it works like goto statement
you can use break or continue statement to stop or continue execution of loop


56863484
imagemagick	mogrify
the bottom line is that it is not a proper imagemagick convert command
if you want to process all images in a folder use mogrify not convert
then your syntax will work as

56863546
inherited	properties
o if you want a plain object to inherited methods from a particular object s prototype without using the constructor to make the object you can assign the required constructor s prototype to the plain object s using object.setprototypeof
however you might be better off to construct a new instance of the class you want and copy the plain object s properties to the plain object s using object.assign something like


56863626
stdout	stderr
akes the output redirect from stdout to null as such the actual output from the ping command won t show on your command prompt
if you wanted to be super safe you could also redirect the output from stderr to null as well by adding at the end


56863705
put	get
f the user enters a string of spaces the user will still get saved
you need to put data validation rules in the front end of your application


56863779
width	margin

approach 1 you can set the width of img-group less than 100 percentage
approch 2 you are using display inline block property and on image margin right also

56863827
for-loop	arrays
then in your for-loop you set each index of the first dimension to null
you then have an arrays containing five null éléments
if for some reason you really want to work with null values i advice you to use list instead

56863926
margin	font-size

default margin between your inline element is the problem
for solving it add font-size 0 for your inline element parent

56864051
setinterval	clearinterval

you can simply write the same update code inside a setinterval block and add it below to your code later you can cancel these repetitive executions when you need it
clearinterval intervalid

56864192
for-loop	loops	for-loop	loops
the original ranges of the words start end were as follows in a test original word ranges w.start w.end 1428795 1428818 1428818 1428820 1428820 1428840 1428840 1428842 1428842 1428864 1428864 1428866 1428866 1428889 1428889 1428891 1428891 1428917 the for-loop including hyperlink addition hyperlink addition modifies the ranges 1428795 1428818 1428843 1428845 1428845 1428865 1428890 1428892 1428892 1428914 1428939 1428941 1428941 1428964 1428989 1428991 1428991 1429017 however if the for each loops is used then the ranges printed are 1428795 1428818 1428795 1428843 1428795 1428843 1428795 1428843 and is caught in an infinite loops
the range for the second iteration is clearly different from that given by the for-loop and then stays the same
the behavior of the two kind of loops therefore differs for some opaque reason. any clarifications for this are welcomed

56864600
int	double

you are missing this from the documentation only the following column types can be changed biginteger binary boolean date datetime datetimetz decimal int json longtext mediumtext smallinteger string text time unsignedbiginteger unsignedinteger and unsignedsmallinteger
so double cannot be changed

56864625
implements	extends

in order to use different naming convention for getters a custom accessornamingstrategy should be implements
the best approach would be to extends the defaultaccessornamingstrategy and override the isgettermethod

56864659
client-side	server-side
nce your html view is returned to the client your html view executes there and you js is on the client-side
if you need to call a method in your js on the browser side from a server-side controller you need to use signalr


56864842
g++	gcc
ecause the std filesystem symbols in gcc 9 are incompatible with the experimental versions of those symbols in gcc 8 it appears to link ok but crashes at runtime
it should work correctly if you make sure you link with -lstdc++fs and make sure that option comes after all your object files this should work g++ foo.o bar.o -lstdc++fs but this will not work g++ -lstdc++fs foo.o bar.o there is supposed to be an update to the ubuntu gcc-8 packages to fix this by ensuring the -lstdc++fs option comes after all the other input files


56864886
prop	each
we call inside render to dynamically create the markup for each suggested user
or as mentioned above just pass down the suggestions as a prop


56864901
floating-point	integer

you can only use with integers and pow produces floating-point numbers
you could write an integer power function or use a predefined table but it s simpler to reverse the order of construction and start with the rightmost digit

56865064
stateless	stateful
r deployment is a resource to deploy a stateless application if using a pvc all replicas will be using the same volume and none of it will have it own state
statefulsets is used for stateful applications each replica of the pod will have it own state and will be using it own volume


56865320
dictionary	map

for some reason probably because of more versions of the same package might be installed the value of the package dictionary is a list
a simple solution is to take the first element to take into the account the possibility of more versions installed use map filter below is the equivalent with json_query filter

56865807
google-chrome	firefox

google-chrome can t download a file bigger then 2mb
firefox has set this limit to 5gb i believe

56865990
client-side	server-side

jquery javascript or other client-side languages for security reasons doesn t have access to writing files think what might happen if a user run commands via the console.
. you can write files using server-side languages only

56866175
versioning	upgrade

i solved it with proper library versioning and conflicts specially with reactor. sharing what worked for me
first i upgrade my spring boot version to 2.1.6.release from 2.0.4 compile io.netty netty-all 4.1.36.final compile io.projectreactor reactor-core 3.2.10.release compile io.projectreactor reactor-net 2.0.5.release compile io.projectreactor reactor-spring-context 2.0.7.release compile io.projectreactor.netty reactor-netty 0.8.9.release had to add this as application was failing to start complaining about jms context. compile javax.jms javax.jms-api 2.0.1 reactor compile group org.springframework name spring-messaging version 5.1.8.release compile group org.springframework name spring-jms version 5.0.6.release

56866294
hide	show

changing your background color will not hide any of the elements on your page
you will most likely need an overlay which can be a simple div styled something like this you can then show the overlay before your alert and hide this afterwards here is a working jsfiddle

56866467
spaces	linefeed

the string to remove is usually in an html file on a separate line indented with tabs or spaces and the goal is to remove also those indenting whitespaces
the search expression ends with to remove additionally 0 or more horizontal tabs or normal spaces right to the string to remove trailing whitespaces on the line and one carriage return if existing at all and one linefeed if existing at all

56866824
typedef	struct
in c jnienv is a pointer type in c++ jnienv is a struct struct _jnienv
typedef _jnienv jnienv
so of course it will compile in one case and not in the other

56866841
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationitem	uinavigationbar	uinavigationitem
a uinavigationbar that was automatically added by a uinavigationcontroller doesn t show up in the hierarchy
there ll be one if there s a back button so in this case add a uinavigationitem instead
this creates a title item

56867043
maven	pom.xml

maven plugins cannot be used by gradle
given that the pom.xml extract is mostly about a custom plugin and the pom.xml extract configuration you will have to develop a matching gradle plugin to replicate the features of the maven plugin

56867340
postgresql	mysql
in the official documentation they ve used postgresql where as i was using mysql db
i got the output specific to mysql which is same as


56867556
min	max
quotes from facebook documantion are not helping unless you refernce them against an error in the code the documentation says as follows the pixel width of the plugin
min
is 180 max

56867680
post	get
curl will allow you to make a get request with one but xmlhttprequest and fetch the http apis in browsers which axios wraps will not
make a post request instead
you might need to change the server-side code to support this

56867871
versioning	upgrade
playing with cursor position focus blur and setnativeprops did not solve it
if you need a password input with hide reveal functionality your best options are add react-native-hide-show-password-input package update expo to versioning 33
you can follow this instructions you will find the exact lists of dependencies to be updated and their compatible versions . after the upgrade no extra logic will be needed just use the textinput component

56868501
inherited	properties
to enable automatic inherited of copies of the mdc to newly created threads enable the log4j system property. so set this properties to true and child threads will inhertis the context and you don t have to manage context for each thread manually
second option is to avoid using log context at all usually there is problem with the context inherited in thread pools and executors and you can differentiate the log threads via thread name
you can set the thread name like this in you runnable thread.currentthread .setname specific_name

56868799
versioning	upgrade

make sure the package versioning is equal across the solution
i just downgraded upgrade microsoft.aspnet.mvc package across the solution and the problem solved

56868960
virtualenv	conda

you don t have ipython installed in your environment so what you are running is not actually in your precom virtualenv
try pip install ipython or conda install ipython or just run python and then try to import your package

56869166
viewmodel	caliburn.micro
e can very easily use caliburn.micro actions to send we password to the viewmodel
xaml viewmodel then remember to clear the password fields so the password fields don we remain in memory


56869328
pull	push
n addition to your hook you might want to configure github with branch protection rules so that even if someone commits on master locally they will not be able to push those commits to github
you can even configure those commits to then require a pull request to get commits onto master


56869461
int	chars
however strings on different rows can have different hidden chars such as leading spaces that are hard to spot
int and numerics are usually fine but floating point numbers can look the same but be different


56869668
for-loop	arrays
i do the cast within a for-loop
however i had to use an arrays first and then give the adress of the first element to my
in the future i should consider trying std transform as is advised in the link from nico schertler

56869673
post	get
i will post some example code
to pass data from one page to another eg to get data on the destination page eg


56869685
igmp	dhcp

56869933
udp	tcp
i am connecting to the server using udp transport only
you can try commenting the tcp transport
may be your server is not accepting tcp same was with me

56870227
screens	tablet
tablet only screens and min-width 768px and max-width 991px
desktop only screens and min-width 992px and max-width 1199px
desktop-xl only screens and min-width 1200px and max-width 1350px

56870263
for-loop	arrays

when you need a structure from which you will be retrieving items randomly - use a hashmap when you will be retrieving items in order using a for-loop - use an list scalability linkedhashmap is the most memory-hungry collection in jdk
it extends hashmap by using linkedhashmap.entry as an entry in the internal arrays of entries

56870597
hive	hdfs
adoop is a set of tools for distributed storage and processing such as distributed filesystem hdfs mapreduce framework libraries yarn resource manager
other tools like hive spark pig giraph sqoop etc etc can use hadoop or hadoop s components


56870778
folder	directory
ow when i tried to hit my web service iis was pointing to the release version which had the asmx but no bin folder
opening the web properties tab in my development solution and clicking the create virtual directory remapped my web service iis back to the development version and all was good with the world again


56870801
width	font-size

you can reset the value of your size attribute or set a width to your input text
seems fine here but to avoid side effects from font-size or family i would advise to set also a max-width in your css

56871210
pickle	dill
there are two issues there s no guarantee regardless of what you are using for serialization that a pickle will work with any version of python other than the one you used 3.7 vs 3.6 vs 2.7
as you noted currently dill doesn t have an encoding argument on load so you may have to do some conversion before after you dump load the object directly on the object itself
note that i will be adding more of the serialization option arguments to dump and load in the very near future including the encoding argument

56871211
hash	salt
alt of the hash changes each time the function password_hash runs
to make the function password_hash runs idempotent either run the function password_hash runs with a specific salt or update the password on_create only - name generate all users for the environment user update_password on_create or register the return values and declare changed_when


56871918
for-loop	loops

you could use a for-loop as well
or you can use a do-a while loops a while loops should be noted that with the do-while loops you will alway enter loops even if there are no rows available the rows are 0

56871951
width	text-align

well add a class to this english word width css direction ltr
text-align right

56872090
build.gradle	gradlew
or projects being built using the buildsrc directory you need to have the build.gradle file reside in that directory instead of the root project directory where the build.gradle normally lives
i just converted the project to a normal gradlew project and the project works just fine


56872612
build.gradle	gradlew
our build.gradle is lacking the buildscript block which defines the gradlew plugin for android not sure if simply adding your build.gradle will do the trick ymmv
here are the changes i needed to make to my build.gradle diff notation drop lines starting with - and add those starting with +


56872719
for-loop	loops
there s no point in using when though because you aren t running multiple functions in parallel
the second problem is that while when won t call the done callback until everything you pass to it is done the for-loop will not wait for the when to complete
there are two approaches you can do to solve this problem remove the for-loop keep var i have first increment i call first recursively from second until i is input.files.length use async await to manage the promises returned from which will let you keep loops

submit	submission
since submit button is now pushed out of the way the mouseup event can not occur for the button click and the submission never happens therefore the rest of the form is not validated
solution would be to fix the layout so the submit button could never be pushed out from under the mouse during any part of the button click

the flex now pushed the children inside the page1 into the page-main-content

width	margin

you can set the width to 100 and then add padding of 11.5 on each side of the div resulting in the div being 77 of the page
since padding is inside the div the border will extend till the end of the page unlike if you set margin to 11.5 since margin is on the outside of the div

n fact the docs explicitly warn against tampering with mutating the request except for reading the body handlers should not modify the provided request

best way to do it is to use parent div make the width of the parent 100 and set the border for parent then set the width of #head to 100

the loop will end anyway when the return statement exits the function so there s no need to break separately
or you could put the condition of the test an unknown move in the while loop rather than in a separate if statement inside and return after the loop ends note that in python 3.8 which is in beta right now not yet fully released you will be able to avoid the duplication of the input line using the new walrus operator that does mid-expression assignments note that i changed the lower call to be done immediately after getting the input
in addition to looking nicer this actually fixes another bug you d find eventually where miscapitalized move names would be recognized by the input code as valid but would get returned to the game code in their unexpected format which would cause the other code to subtly break

width	margin

one hacky idea is to make the element span a large number of columns pay attention as this hack works only if you don t specify grid-column-gap and you keep the implicit new column to have auto width
adding gaps will break the implicit new column making the implicit column different from auto will break the implicit new column if you want to consider gaps simply consider margin and in case you want to define width define the implicit new column on the elements

this article explains how uniqueidentifiers guids are stored and ordered in sql server comparing and sorting the last grouping first rather than left-to-right as you might expect
by filtering on the last grouping you ll get a sargable expression and touch only those rows in the specified range assuming an index on id is used

n a scenario where you work with customer data i d assume you are probably using sessions already anyway so in the script that receives the post data different script than tmr capture_signature.php you put it into the session and then in your script that generates the image tmr capture_signature.php you read it back from there don t forget to pick up the session again in your script and then you embed the image on the target page using now this could lead into trouble if the user has multiple instances of this script open in multiple tabs to create signatures for multiple receipts
if that is a realistic scenario you could add a random value to the form store the json data into the session under that random key i d have to check if the js part automatically sends all form data or whether the js part might need adapting to submit this additional value as well and then you pass that same random key to the image generating script so that that in turn can fish the right value out of the session again a different approach that doesn t need an extra http request - and therefor creates a bit less hassle to get the necessary data to the image creating code - would be to output the image inline in the target page using a data uri with the base64 encoded image data

maven-jar-plugin	pom.xml

its not necessary that you use the maven-jar-plugin to build a non-executable jar
the mvn clean install command by default builds a non-executable jar if the mvn has the node in your projects pom.xml

apache	nginx
ll in all it is a very useful debugging and testing tool since you don t have to setup a whole apache or nginx server
but as mentioned above it is not suitable for production or public use since it s not a fully fletched webserver like apache


56889324
short	base
f you use the conversion in the short variable declaration randomfunction3 will have a static type of myfunc and always have the eval method also note that oftentimes you don t even have to manually convert your function values as if t is an anonymous type the conversion will happen automatically
for example if you have a function that takes a value of type myfunc you may pass the above randomfunction2 to type myfunc handle randomfunction2 this is ok the above works because the value of randomfunction2 is assignable to a variable of type myfunc they have the same base type

margin	font-size
you may have to remove a bit of margin so the label and the box are not so far apart
and of course you can give a class to your h3 and target the font-size more properly

rpm	yum	rpm	zypper
you cannot force in advance how the user will use rpm zypper or yum to install or uninstall your package
in that case i would suggest you to try building an rpm that does not need special flags to get uninstalled

versioning	upgrade
you should be using 1.3.9 with boot 1.5.x
the current boot 1.5.x versioning is 1.5.21
you should upgrade immediately

submit	submission
he solution to the problem at hand is thus to allow the user to enter only certain characters by using the regular expression -+0-9 + instead and then when the user finally submit the value to check the user against the original regular expression
the original function thus becomes and a separate validation function when submission the value salmana made a good suggestion in the comments to improve checks on the input which i will also implement


56890056
folder	directory

you may need to provide the path to your data folder if the data files are not in the same folder as your script
this should look something like os.listdir home erdal dropbox marburg la lt_corpus using all the filenames in that directory you can then open each one individually by parsing through something like os.listdir home erdal dropbox marburg with a for loop

56890398
int	chars

i don t know about this date format especially about how you use an int as a date
but let s consider that it s on purpose the year is always gonna be 4 chars so you can just get the year by taking the last 4 chars and use the rest as the month

following the readme example you need to uncomment the configurationfiles on values and put paste your own xml file conten but if you don t want to past the content insede the values.yaml you can use
file to get the content of a file in the same path template guide remember you can copy the original values.yaml from the chart and use -f to specify you own values instead of using --set every time

56891288
for-loop	arrays

if you just want to read through the whole file line by line i would suggest using a for-loop as well as readlines instead of readline
readlines unlike readline will return all the lines of the file in an arrays with each line in a separate index

multiplying	add

using your input we have x1.shape 2 5 10 x2.shape 2 5 10 10 you can use np.tensordot to multiplying along arbitrary axes - as long as they match in dimension
tensordot also allows you to multiplying and add over a number of axes

do-while	break
else break
when the user enters n or n you go which ends the outer do-while loop
thus when the user enters anything else the else path is taken

56893256
margin	height
and the part that needs to be on two lines has a variable height to avoid line breaks
next set the flex property to none setting margin enough to make a line break in the part that needs to be on one line
this will force flex items to break and keep the size of the item

56893531
for-loop	arrays

your stream code is equivalent to the following for-loop which itself is equivalent to change the value of t does not change the value of
to create an arrays of length messagecount with elements being lambda expressions use streaming

56893577
margin	height

the clue is in the code here what is actually happening is that padding is being added to the container so the way to correctly fix the height is to reset the padding to the correct amount
you can do this by adding an additional onapplywindowinsetslistener such as the following setting the bottom padding to the same as the top makes the snackbar look normal then as the snackbar will now be the correct height but appear behind a translucent nav bar you can increase the bottom margin by the value of the bottom inset this has actually been fixed in the material 1.1.0 alpha libraries the library now changes the margin rather than the padding but they are probably not ready for production use yet

56895492
dictionary	map

no it is not possible to use only partial key to search in a dictionary with o 1 performance
your options are either search through all key or have separate dictionary to map each part of the key to object make sure to keep each part of the key to object in sync

56895839
ionic	angular

i do not know how far the ionic 4 documentation improved compared to its pre-release state but your question actually touches the underlying stencil builder and its designed behaviour especially for non-angular usage as bare web components
a quick answer is attributes directly reflect properties generalizing the angular properties binding so that its works in a very similar way even outside angular

56895851
maven	pom.xml

explicitly define google-guava dependency in module b so when you run test case maven will get google-guava dependency from module b project s dependency of google-guava will be covered
if three way above not work well for your probelm i hope you can execute mvn dependency list and which dependencies you actual get when you run test case especially attention on google-guava s verion check google-guava s verion version is just right define in project s pom.xml

while i am partial to the first solution i found an implementation of the second solution on the docker forums using docker in a dockerized jenkins container i then gave the second solution on the docker forums using docker in a dockerized jenkins container a try and can confirm that docker is present for me in a dockerized jenkins container after launchd the jenkins container with the following command i am not sure but i would imagine there could be some negative security implications for the host due to mounting the host own docker socket and docker executable into a dockerized jenkins container

s-function	simulink
 level-2 m-code s-function has one input which is a block object created and passed to a level-2 m-code s-function by the simulink execution engine while a level-2 c-code s-function is comprised of a number of functions each of which is passed a simstruct c-code structure which is also created by the simulink execution engine
you would have to create a model with your s-function in a model presumably along with the appropriate inport and outport blocks then use sim to call a model


56896312
matlab	s-function
ote that the link you give open sfuntmpl.m is to the template for a level-1 m-code s-function
these can be called from matlab as these are just a regular m-code function


56896312

stdout	fflush

as python is linebuffered it will wait for a newline before printing the stdout
solution 1 add pythonunbuffered 1 to your env.var this will allow the output to be immediately dumped solution 2 as you are using python 3 you can use the fflush true

56897117
button	checkbox
the radio button is specifically meant for single select
if you want multi-select ability then that is what checkbox would be for


56897148
button	checkbox

you can give different names to the radio button then grab the tags by tag name and push the values to an array
ps the correct way is to checkbox because the tags are designed to do this functionality working demo

56897307
abc	subclassing
abc is of compile time type animalbaseclass so its setcurrentbehaviour accepts a animalbehaviourbaseclass
mammalbehaviour is one of its subclassing so everything is fine by the compiler
but obviously you don t want this

56897670
stdout	stderr

in any posix shell try also if you have gnu awk sometimes called gawk then log_pipe can be made simpler and faster example as an example let s create the command cmd now let s run our command and look at the output files the problem the above redirects stdout from cmd to log_pipe
the stdout of log_pipe is redirected to and the stderr of log_pipe is redirected to

width	height
to create a demo of this start a new project and open main.storyboard add a scroll view with constraints to leading trailing top bottom add a blank uiview now called innerview inside the scroll view and add leading trailing top bottom constraints add a height constraint to innerview to 2000 add an equal width constraint between innerview and your scroll view set bottom constraint between innerview and scroll view to 100 set a distinct color to innerview to see the effect all other constraints should be set to 0 add another uiview on the top level now called outerview pin outer view to leading trailing and bottom
also add a height constraint to 50 set a distinct color to outerview to see the effect
by now you should have a scrollable scroll view and a fixed view at the bottom if you run the app

56898380
filtering	grouping
he table has 6 records and doing a self join to the table will give 36 records all the combinations from which we can filtering out what we need below are the filtering 1 filtering based on user as we are looking only for a specific user action 2 filtering that needs to be compared arrived versus left 3 for any left time we need to look only for the arrived time before left time and it can be same also
a.time b.time 4 grouping by based on user and arrived time will give you list of all left time that are greater than or equal to arrived time for any user 5 aggregator min is used as we are looking only for the earliest left time for the given user s arrived time


56898441
post	get
for your purposes as also mentioned in prashant s linked post you might want to use something like the imp module

this should be a starting point

56898472
post	get
ut you are trying to access the value through jquery s id selector the above returns undefined and when you add the value to your ajax call it will be empty therefore when you access the value in php you will get an undefined index error as the value is missing from post request make sure to add the id to your input so the value can be accessed
also to prevent the error you can verify the value exists in post using isset

specially for byte_array it will try by default to use a dictionary encoding i.e map each distinct byte_array value to an int and then simply store the ints in the column data more info here
if the dictionary grows too big the dictionary will fallback to simply store the byte_array values


56899223
margin	height
remove the positioning from your #container and your calculated height and set a height of 100vh to prevent background bleeding entirely

inline	inlining
the syntax you are looking for is i ve split it up into clear named functions instead of inlining everything
or the version where everything is inline


56899698
int	double

to put it simply you can not reliably use negative zero int in c since the signed int representation could be either ones complement or twos complement. since twos complement has no negative zero and is the dominant and also might be the mandatory representation for future c standards int are simply not your choice in c
so i recommend to be pragmatic and just floating point types like a double which should usually have enough precision for your case

56899727
hash	md5

all you can do is check if a given token matches that hash value by running the same hash function again and either getting the same output or not
you can reverse the base64 encoding but not the md5 hashing

comparator	comparable	comparator	comparable
this is explained pretty well in the docs for comparator in general the docs are pretty good for all the java standard library so that s a good place to start. some objects have a natural ordering
for example there s a very obvious ordering for numbers numerical order and strings dictionary order . in java and kotlin that s indicated by the objects implementing the comparable interface. all the standard sorting ordering c functions know from that what order to use
in that case if you want to sort them or do anything that involves ordering you ll have to explain what order to use. you do that by providing an object implementing comparator

56900095
inherited	properties

it s not entirely clear from the question what your goal or motivation is here but here goes every single object in powershell ultimately inherited from system.object due to the nature of .net s type system so it s a bit of a silly test to attempt to employ type identity comparison for since you could simply do if you want to test that the the object in question is not a value type ie
not a struct or an integral type but a class inspect the isvaluetype properties of the type if you want a generalized solution to test whether a certain type occurs in the type hierarchy of an object there are three general approaches rely on pstypename use the -is operator resolve all base types yourself pstypename all objects in powershell have a special properties called pstypename that contains the unqualified type names of all types in the type hierarchy for the underlying object + optionally powershell-defined type extension names - this is how powershell differentiates formatting of instances of different cim classes for example

spaces	delimiter	spaces	delimiter
for would split up each non-empty line into substrings using normal spaces and horizontal tab as string delimiter and would assign just first spaces tab separated substring to specified loop variable i if not starting with default end of line character
this line splitting behavior with ignoring entire line on starting with a semicolon without or with leading spaces tabs is not wanted here
for that reason is used to define an empty list of delimiter to disable line splitting behavior and define no end of line character

56900157
spaces	delimiter
for that reason is used to define an empty list of delimiter to disable line splitting behavior and define no end of line character
it is necessary to specify these two options without using double quotes which means the equal signs and the spaces character must be escaped with to be interpreted as literal characters and not as argument separators
each line output by findstr in separate command process is searched for string error and if indeed found the loop execution is exited with a jump to command line below line with label failed

try-catch	exception-handling
they shouldn t be solved with help try-catch blocks because as a usual thing try-catch should be used to try to resolve the concrete local located problems which made an exception-handling for example modify data or try to repeat execution or to do actions to restore an application state
logging and notification about exception-handling are tasks which should be solved with a global exception-handling handler

56900727
width	margin

thus the margin appears to shrink on the right
if you re using pixel-based widths 200px s always best to declare 200px as a max-width and define a percentage-based width as a fallback like so this means a block level element will be 200px wide and centered as long as the parent element is wider than 200px

56900909
dictionary	map

i guess that the main issue here is when building the dictionary from unique numbers to names since i feel you should build it the other way around from names to unique numbers
also when this map is built you are missing the code to convert your mapping to the final mapping with unique numbers

range	min	prometheus	grafana
in combination with grafana s variable something like this should work this would force prometheus to look back which is the interval between the samples grafana queries for rather than 5 minutes
with a time range of one month and the graph size in your screenshot i d guess that would be somewhere around 1 hour so grafana would query for a sample every 1 hour with the maximum value over the previous 1 hour
if you want those samples to result in lines as in your first graph and not disjoint points then you should also set a min step of 6h in grafana

int	double

take this how this works the input int x is casted to float and then reinterpret as bits
the ieee float format stores the exponent in bits 30-23 as an int with bias 127 so by shifting it 23 bits to the right and subtracting the bias we get log2 x  for a 64-bit int input x is casted to double for which the exponent is in bits 62-52 shift 52 bits to the right and the exponent bias is 1023

if m is less than 10 -3 or greater than or equal to 10 7 then it is represented in so-called computerized scientific notation. let n be the unique integer such that 10 n m 10 n +1

udp	tcp
enote packets frames of each stream by lower case letters a b c and a sequence number let s have a look at what happens with http 2 over tcp when the following sequence is sent server --- a2 c2 b2 c1 b1 a1 --- client where the c1 means that this frame was lost the receiving end client must wait for a re-transmission of the lost c1 frame before a re-transmission of the lost c1 frame can pass later frames to the application layer namely b2 c2 a2 because the communication is over tcp and tcp guarantees in-order delivery
that is in contrast to http 3 quic where over udp these are just independent packets thus the loss of c1 would not delay the delivery of b2 c2 and a2 to the application layer


56905950
range	max	range	min
in order to get a range you need the min and max and then select those values equal or between those
if only one is checked it is both min and max
if there are three check boxes in a group not here but possible the same logic works

56905973
factors	matrix

the function confusionmatrix takes two arguments data and reference which have to be factors with the same levels
this is not the case with your code because the predict function when given an rpart -object returns a matrix with probabilities of class memberships for each sample by default

56905973
factors	matrix
his is not the case with your code because the predict function when given an rpart -object returns a matrix with probabilities of class memberships for each sample by default
you need to specify to this function that you want a vector of predicted classes and convert a vector of predicted classes to a factors with the same levels as target 0 and 1


56906289
keydown	keyup
then the keyup event is generated when the key is released
in order to understand the difference between keydown and keypress it is useful to understand the difference between a character and a key
a key is a physical button on the computer s keyboard while a character is a symbol typed by pressing a button

56906600
post	put	put	get
nd you can likely represent your http methods as some union of string literals like post | get | put | delete | .
and narrow down apispec so that post methods require body while get methods prohibit body etc


56906979
post	get	post	get
one of the interesting corners of the http specification is that 304 not modified is not one of the allowed response codes for a post request
there s no analog to conditional get
when everything is post you are taking an application protocol and turning it into a dumb message tunnel offering to generic components only the weakest possible semantic description of what is going on

56907200
min	max
in this example you can see immediately that the max value of 8 is not good because you are removing a lot of meaningful information
the min value of -15 should be fine since the tail is not even visible
you could probably write some code that based on this find some good bounds that minimize the sizes of the tails according to some tolerance

56907305
post	get
you can also get the table from script tag using requests only and then post process the content using json
however try the script below to get the tabular content using selenium
output

56907360
min	max

there is no such thing as a min speed
as for the max speed i don t think flow supports it for lanes but you can call sumo s setmaxspeed laneid speed function to set it manually doc _lane

56907424
super	implements
you could create this constructor and invoke super context attributeset or use the jvmoverload annotation
so you could implements the constructors like this or use the annotation like this


56908421
profiling	benchmarking

you can use valgrind to find memory leaks or profiling
and google benchmarking for code snippet benchmarking

56908587
versioning	upgrade

based on my own testing can t find anything official it looks like the free versioning for sendgrid email only allow sending emails through the api
in order to make any other types of call through the api you will need to upgrade your account to a paid one

56908741
goto	break
labeled statements labeledstatement identifier statement labeledstatementnoshortif identifier statementnoshortif unlike c and c++ the java programming language has no goto statement
identifier statement labels are used with break 14.15 or continue 14.16 statements appearing anywhere within the labeled statement
the scope of a label of a labeled statement is the immediately contained statement

56909081
superclass	subclassing
ahter any call that would accept an object of the type of the superclass will also take in objects objects of any of the superclass subclassing
the super .. call can be used to explicitly invoke methods or attributes of the superclass from outside the class methods as well - so if you declare the classes as you can do this output from the interactive console after pasting the snippet above so you can use dog s methods but it is not a separate instance


56909086
folder	dir
as in your original command the assumption is that neither dp0 - the batch file s folder dir
path - nor cd - the caller s working dir
path - contain spaces or other special chars

56909138
keydown	keyup

nb you only need to listen on the keydown event which fires before the other key events
keypress and keyup will fire too late for some keys and the browser or host os will have already consumed the keydown event before it gets to your handler

56909151
post	get
you should use type post
the default type is get so should be empty
the documentation can be found here

56909234
post	get
the only valid values for the method attribute are get and post corresponding to the get and post http methods
is invalid html and will be treated like send a get request
you can use ajax to send your put request to your controller you can assign a id to your form and button element and then send your model data like this

56909583
cout	cin

in a programming competition cout usually goes to a pipe or log file so it will be block buffered and n doesn t cause a fflush
however in that situation it also doesn t matter whether prompts are displayed before input is read which is the normal use case for tied cin cout

56909960
post	get

try using the following rest call examples disassociate vlan method post body json change the 11111 data for your in insidevlan id
to get the gateway insidevlans you can use the below rest call method get output associate vlan method post body json change the 22222 and 33333 data for your networkgatewayid and networkvlanid

56909960
post	get
to get the gateway insidevlans you can use the below rest call method get output associate vlan method post body json change the 22222 and 33333 data for your networkgatewayid and networkvlanid
to get the possible inside vlans networkvlanid to associate to a gateway you can use the following rest api call method get output


56910086
amd	umd
valid options are commonjs amd system and umd
if you had the following node commonjs code or the following requirejs amd code then you would write the following typescript code


56910453
pandas	fuzzywuzzy

read the csv file in pandas
then add a new column for the fuzzywuzzy percent match

56910581
profiling	benchmarking
carefully running your benchmarking with different configuration settings and recording the results
in this step i strongly recommend profiling your application in order to identify bottlenecks
the bottleneck will clarify where you should focus your tuning efforts

56910661
jobs	cron

a good starting point for what you are trying to achieve would be to look into travis ci s conditional jobs feature
for example you would be able to define different commands to execute if the build is a cron build or a push pr build take note that running different commands based on which files were modified in the commit isn t supported natively at this time but it could be implemented manually with git diff

56910773
put	get
n method fingbyjobclasscdstartswith string jobclasscd i think when you query from the database you get three records and you can merge the database into one object manually
or you can put the invisible code here by edit your question


56910848
operands	scalar
 scalar assignment gives a scalar assignment right operands scalar context
in scalar context an array evaluates to the number of elements in the array


56910928
spaces	delimiter
has the same problem
again the shell syntax favors the command interpretation so you need to avoid the temptation to add spaces
there are many places in shell syntax where spaces are important delimiter

56910928
spaces	delimiter
there are many places in shell syntax where spaces are important delimiter
another commonly-messed-up place is in tests where if you leave out any of the spaces in ...it will lead to a different meaning which might cause an error or might just silently do the wrong thing
what i m getting at is that shell syntax does not allow you to arbitrarily add or remove spaces to improve readability

56911710
for-loop	loops

since you can t import anything here are two different approaches including the for-loop you asked for
approach 1 for loops and inbuilt sorted function approach 2 dictionaries if you want two different approaches including the for-loop you asked explained in more detail here is an article

56911734
folder	directory
inally i give a minimal workable example for your reference suppose the shared folder between windows linux container is c abc log_share it will mapped to linux container as tmp folder
of course you need to allow volume share by right click the docker icon in windows tray area choose settings like described here simplify the windows application as bat file and simplfy the docker image as ubuntu you should use your own prebuilt docker image with all dependency in it win_app.bat simplify the linux binary just as echo command in linux the output things should be all write to shared directory now execute the bat file with command win_app.bat you can see the windows application already could fetch things here is helloworld which generated by linux binary from docker container


56911752
free	malloc
thus an object that has been allocated by malloc and the reference is lost without deallocating the object with free need not leak memory.
the object allocated by malloc need not be within the heap below the program break sbrk 0 on unixen.


56911878
versioning	upgrade

right now i have versioning 8
so the next step is to upgrade the versioning of angular cli 6 to angular cli 8

56912009
jar	war
t is kind of tricky though you would have to put your own main class similar to the one in the aspectj read-me into the war as main class
your own main class similar to the one in the aspectj read-me would attach the weaver and then start the jar classloader


56912083
screens	tablet	screens	tablet
this is all you will need to distinguish tablet from phones 1
helper function to get screens width 2
function to figure out if a device is a tablet 3

56913069
mp3	ogg

first of all mp3 s don t work really well in pygame your code should work perfectly fine one issue is you are doing in the main function
you should change the file extension to .ogg because ogg files work pretty well and try out your code the only thing you have to change is the pygame.mixer.music.load file.ogg line be careful is you change the file extension to something else because pygame only loads uncompressed .wav files and .ogg files

56913270
folder	directory	folder	directory
navigated to downloaded j2objc folder
fire following command by changing source path and destination path j2objc --build-closure -g -d -sourcepath find -name .java destionatpath j2objc will generate java file in this directory
sourcepath this should be a path of root folder where all java files present

56913497
leaflet	ggmap

as per the tmap documentation the basemap feature is available only in view mode this seems logical as the basemap comes not from directly tmap but from the leaflet js package
if you absolutely positively require a basemap for a static r plot you should be able to get one via ggplot ggmap workflow eg

56913796
post	put

i think you have to fill your post in the following style something like this
so first use curl_file_create and then put them in the post and then you can put that to the post fields

56913823
pbkdf2	hash
a password one megabyte in size for example will require roughly one minute of computation to check when using the pbkdf2 hasher
this allows for denial-of-service attacks through repeated submission of large passwords tying up server resources in the expensive computation of the corresponding hash
and in the proper model django.contrib.auth.base_user password field is defined with

56913834
microsoft.build	msbuild
tw what makes little sense is to attempt to read the msbuild project file again during runtime using the microsoft.build framework
for once that is a whole lot of work to begin with for little gain imho and even more important you most likely - depending on the complexity and dependencies of your properties - need to make sure you invoke the msbuild libraries with the same properties that where present during the actual build


56913992
put	get
 ve put your equations in a function which i use in a for-loop
i had to change some of your formulas to get your equations working


56914117
ubuntu	linux

this is one of the gotchas for an implementation on ubuntu
the dev team that created airflow designed my article to run on a different distribution of linux and therefore there is a small but critical change that needs to be made so that airflow will automatically run when the server is on

56914175
int	double
in this case the expression has the type double
or output the int expression 10 2 using conversion specifier d or i like printf value d 10 2
from the c standard 7.21.6.1 the fprintf function 9 if a conversion specification is invalid the behavior is undefined.275 if any argument is not the correct type for the corresponding conversion specification the behavior is undefined

56914177
post	get
by default an interceptor sends this header on all mutating requests post etc. to relative urls but not on get head requests or on requests with an absolute url
your server needs to set a token in a javascript readable session cookie called xsrf-token on either the page load or the first get request
on subsequent requests the server can verify that the cookie matches the x-xsrf-token http header and therefore be sure that only code running on your domain could have sent the request

56914367
viewdidload	viewdidappear

a possible issue with ios 12 and earlier ios 13 seems not to suffer from the same issue might come from the fact that performsegue withidentifier sender is called from the view controller viewdidload callback
you absolutely must invoke performsegue withidentifier sender from the viewdidappear _ animated bool callback in order to avoid the question-mentioned crash

56914604
sum	floor
well that sum is #x3a3
i 1 floor log n 3 i -1 - 1 so you could say that the complexity of the loop nest is o #x3a3
i 1 floor log n 3 i -1 - 1 but such an answer is unlikely to get you full marks

56914604
sum	floor
 1 floor log n 3 i -1 - 1 but such an answer is unlikely to get you full marks
we can simplify that by observing that we sum is bounded by a related one o #x3a3


56914604
sum	floor
i 1 floor log n 3 i -1
at this point if not sooner it would be useful to recognize the sum of powers pattern therein
it is often useful to know that 2 0 + 2 1 + .

56914828
int	double
coming to the point on why it is printing 0.0000 it is because the function returns an int which requires a type specifier d but you are using an f which is a type specifier for double
refer this stackoverflow post for further explaination printing int using f format specifier


56914949
versioning	upgrade

it seems that latest versioning of react-native uses androidx libraries
so you need to upgrade your dependencies in your case appcompat and multidex to androidx

56914964
pickle	dill
you can see in the dumped string pickle basically stores a string that amounts to a prefix of which serialization version to use then the name of the module __main__ then the name of the function iamfoocopied
dill on the other hand does exactly what you are doing by hand
see save_function and _create_function here

56914970
src	attr
to set an attribute on all elements in the set use attr element1.attr id imgclickandchange to set a property use prop element1.prop id imgclickandchange id happens to be the property reflecting the id attribute
src is also both an attribute and a reflected property
to add an event handler use on element1.on click changeimage

56915340
inherited	properties
this properties is not inherited however
the css below will not set the overflow properties to auto on children of div with id parent this means that when content overflows in children boxes scrollbars are automatically displayed by browsers on parent boxes
you will have to specify explicitly the properties on children nodes as needed

56915493
super	self
f you are subclassing something put the hash of the parent implementation into one of the tuple positions def __hash__ self return hash super .__hash__ self.__more_data hashing a hash value does reduce it to a 60-bit or 30-bit value on 32-bit or 64-bit platforms respectively but that s not a big problem when combined with other values in a tuple
if you are really concerned about this put none in a tuple as a placeholder and xor the parent hash so super .__hash__ hash none self.__more_data


56915820
ord	chr
for example ord a returns the int 97 and ord euro sign returns 8364
this is the inverse of chr
chr return the string representing a chars whose unicode code point is the int i

56915885
prepare	execute

your prepare statement is wrong
you need to replace the php variable with a placeholder and then pass the actual value to the execute function

56916375
imperative	declarative
but it is inaccurate to contend that swiftui is an imperative framework
it is essentially declarative


56916384
post	get

cited article imported for simplicity this is a guest post by florian detsch what it is all about with the most recent update of the avhrr gimms data collection to ndvi3g pinzon and tucker 2014 we decided to create a package from all functions we have written so far to download and process gimms binary files from the nasa ecocast server
the package is called gimms and features a collection of fundamental work steps required to get the data into r updateinventory to list all gimms files available online and rearrangefiles to sort online or local files by date downloadgimms to download selected files rasterizegimms to import the binary data as raster objects into r and monthlycomposite to aggregate the bi-monthly datasets to monthly value composites

56916851
for-loop	loops

you can alter simpledateformat as you suggested and instead of putting the date directly in the for-loop here textviewdate.settext textviewdate.gettext + listmodelarraylist.get j .getinit_date + n
you will do the following inside your loops which allows you to format the date according to the pattern you wish in this line references for patterns oracle documentation simpledateformat patterns

56916869
button	checkbox

a radio button when clicked sends to the php script an string with the content of the php property value
how to the data from a radio butom the radio like a checkbox does not send anything to the php script when none of the options is selected

56917157
int	chars

generally to use tapply you must heed the following rules regarding its arguments first argument must be or cast-able to a logical int or numeric
factors chars or other types cannot be used here

56917157
factors	matrix
factors characters or other types cannot be used here
second argument must be or cast-able to a factors which can be any basic data type with exceptions to more complex types
this includes multiple groupings if using list where tapply then returns a matrix

56917157
factors	matrix
this includes multiple groupings if using list where tapply then returns a matrix
because this argument only takes factors it is redundant to cast with as.factor which likely tapply does already under the hood
third argument must be a function that returns an atomic numeric value for each input first argument sliced by group s second argument

56917166
for-loop	loops

you didnt get expected output because your are printing row 2 in for-loop
eventually you will get evry item in list in a loops

56917737
pandas	dask

dask.dataframe.compute returns a pandas dataframe
thus the code is not passing a dask dataframe to simulate_sku_predictions

56917737
pandas	dask
hus the code is not passing a dask dataframe to simulate_sku_predictions
the argument is evaluated to a pandas dataframe before a pandas dataframe is passed as an argument to simulate_sku_predictions


56918086
sorting	filtering
the second one also becomes the new expression for the combined created_on column
the first can also be used to control sorting and then otherwise discarded
don t forget to remove the filtering on action_type_id too. this will cause the query to treat the two types of actions as distinct for purposes of aggregation

56918123
width	height
irst i would set the width constraint on the image view to be 44
note i set my row height to be 54 just like yours then i would set the aspect ratio constraint on the image view to be 1 1 assuming you want a square image


56918296
build.gradle	gradlew
pplication s build.gradle
whenever you add a dependency to your gradlew file application s will download the added libraries and add the added libraries to your project so that is available in your project


56918676
dictionary	map
you appear to want some way to map that string to an integer
a dictionary dictionary would be perfect for that and allow some other optimizations as well


56918743
submit	submission

in general it is not very cool that a third-party script allows it such freedoms such as directly invoking submit or how specific it can be
this approach leaves no choice but to decorate the point is to call out the object of the event when invoking the submission in which there is a link to the original submit which is the only way to send the form

56919004
implements	extends

the inner interface enhancedconfiguration is actually public but still the javadoc is again only in the source code marker interface to be implements by all configuration cglib subclasses
facilitates idempotent behavior for enhance through checking to see if candidate classes are already assignable to candidate classes have already been enhanced also extends beanfactoryaware as all enhanced configuration classes require access to the beanfactory that created them

56919167
hk2	guice
this module aims to do just that by booting jetty based jersey server and initializing the bridge between hk2 and guice
getting started add jerseymodule to your guice injector configure packages to scan for resources and a port to expose get instance of jerseyserver and start consuming your restful resources compile io.logz guice-jersey 1.0.8 notice you are missing guiceintohk2bridge


56919434
versioning	upgrade

updated july 2019 the following guide will help you to set up a website with ssl and forward all versioning of your site to the appropriately secured site https
1 heroku deploy the site on heroku either with cli or github integration 2 heroku upgrade to the hobby dyno comes with free ssl 3 heroku add ssl by going to settings - configure ssl

56919659
for-loop	arrays

i saw a comment but a comment went missing when i refreshed the page basically a comment said if the for-loop ran this code - poststoprocess.push reach will throw an error before this code - console.log poststoprocess prints null
check if you are passing a valid arrays package with data to the function

56919705
slackware	alpine	alpine	suse
he crontab file is often stored in unix slackware bsd redhat or suse but might be kept elsewhere depending on what un x flavor you re running
and in alpine the crontab file also in var spool cron crontabs just var spool cron crontabs is a symbol link of etc crontabs so you can also put it in etc crontabs


56920094
maven	pom.xml	ant	pom.xml
here are copies of achartengine on github and the primary seems to be this the project has both build.xml and pom.xml files so the project should be possible to build the project with either ant or maven
i haven t tried though there should be adequate instructions on how to use those tools in the ant and maven documentation


56920176
sum	coalesce

you can do conditional aggregation with sum case.. this way the sums are calculated with only one scan of the table
the function coalesce is needed only for the case that there are no rows in the table for that date

56920180
put	get
server-side approach to make it impossible to get your model you need a different approach
only put your dumb logic on the client
exclude the part of code that you want to protect

56920316
cpu	processors	cpu	affinity
t is 32-core cpu but those cores are distributed among 4 numa nodes with half of those cores not directly connected to the memory
so you may need to set processors affinity for all your processes to ensure that those cores never jump between cores ensure that processes running on the normal numa nodes only access memory directly attached to that node put less load on cores situated on crippled numa nodes


56920586
put	get
ou are not updating products but parts of it the name requestvo was misleading me  this smells like a patch-mapping to me where parts of a product get updated so i still would use products but with a patch-mapping
when a client needs to replace an existing resource entirely a client can use put


56920602
int	chars
- suppose the input is 31 12 2018 and you want to output in the form of int only and want to exclude chars then you can use c here as - scanf d c d c d day month year
so this way you will exclude two chars
in similar manner d is used to exclude one integer f to exclude one float and s to exclude one word of the string. hope it helped

56920604
free	malloc
you release memory back to the system that might not be the last free block
in function malloc is incorrect because the parentheses are misplaced you add the size to a pointer
the expression could be simplified as or simply freed + 1

56920604
free	realloc	free	malloc
the expression could be simplified as or simply free + 1
in function realloc arithmetic again use this instead because of the overflow problem you should not write return malloc align4 size
but simply return malloc size

56920607
oncreate	setcontentview	oncreate	findviewbyid
according to the docs oncreate bundle is where you initialize your activity
most importantly here you will usually call setcontentview int with a layout resource defining your ui and using findviewbyid int to retrieve the widgets in that ui that you need to interact with programmatically
also you don t need to explicitly cast the views starting with api 26

56920894
m2e	pom.xml

one way to work around that is to set the app pom.xml dependency version to a range so instead of depending on 1.0.0 you d depend on
with an open range like that 2.0.0-snapshot the m2e will happily find your workspace library project

56921028
distance	polygons
once you have that it is rather easy to pick the points on those line segments
repeat for several horizontal lines at the required vertical distance
here is a snippet that allows you to click on a canvas to define a polygons

56921308
strncpy	malloc

in general if you need to copy an unknown-length string at all use strncpy to copy into a fixed size buffer with a size limit but beware the inconvenient behaviour of not terminating the string if it s too long
or use strdup to malloc a copy

56921951
postgresql	mysql
the problem is that mysql does not support back references
postgresql does so the following does what you intend here is a dbfiddle


56922022
int	boolean
here is how findinline is implemented source java util scanner.java here is what the documentation has to say about findwithinhorizon ... the scanner treats the horizon as a transparent non-anchoring bound ...
source java.util.scanner#findwithinhorizon java.util.regex.pattern int and about anchoring bounds ... without anchoring bounds the boundaries of this matcher s region will not match anchors such as and
... source java.util.regex.matcher##useanchoringbounds boolean here is how findwithinhorizon is implemented source java util scanner.java here is how findpatterninbuffer is implemented java util scanner.java that s why the second pattern didn t match

56922552
post	get
because of this jquery s ajax method tries to interpret data as a query string which is why you only get the top-level key-value-pairs in your controller method
in order for it to work you d need to modify your ajax call to this in your controller you also have to specify that m should be taken from the post request s body by marking your endpoint as httppost and annotating your parameter with the frombody tag


56922710
fgets	strtol

for example this function reads up to bufsize -1 characters or to the next newline from the spcified stream with the fgets function
text is then converted to an integer value using strtol which is saved to tmp

56922710
int	chars
if that chars is whitespace or zero then the string is a valid int
that int value is assigned to the parameter value and the function returns 1 to indicate success
otherwise value is left unchanged and the function returns 0 to indicate failure

56922733
aggregate-functions	sum

you need to use aggregate-functions for fields which are used in select statement sql server finds all records with names tom or erik but sql server does not know what one value from multiple rows should be chosen for the fields such as department or employeeid
by using aggregrate functions you are advising sql server to get the min max sum count values of that columns

56923200
post	get

i m going to post what i did to achieve getting specflow test results to show in the azure devops builds- tests area however be forewarned that this is a giant hack
i believe specflow nunit tests are supposed to be supported just as regular nunit tests are and i do think specflow nunit tests is around test adapter configuration as andreas willich stated however i was neither able to get it to work for me nor was i able to find examples of where anyone has gotten this to work through normal pipeline configuration

56923211
virtualenv	conda
additional notes on pipenv in order to use virtualenv created with pipenv as your ide s project interpreter use path provided by pipenv --py
by default pipenv creates all venvs in the same global location like conda does but you can change that behaviour to creating .venv in a project s root by adding into your .bashrc or other rc
then pycharm would be able to automatically pick it up when you go into settings of project interpreter

56923312
addition	modulo

the maximum value of variables of uint64 type is 2 64-1 in matlab intmax uint64 and when you do an addition operation that exceeds this value overflow then the result is 2 64-1 so your code will not work
for example the result of c1 is which is 2 64-1 and not 2 64-1 + 5 and the result of c1-p1 is but c1 should have been 10 workaround you can check before the addition if there will be an overflow and if so calculate the remainder your code will perform addition modulo 2 to the power 64 between p1 and p2 thanks to cris luengo on the correction

google-chrome	safari

there can be two possible reasons for such clearing of cache either your storage gets full google-chrome localstorage so it gets clear or check for the expiring length of the data send from the server check for headers that might give you insights of time it takes to expire
and for checking if the data gets evicted from the storage try testing your website in safari or edge browser where such eviction does not occur

56923542
multiplying	multiplication

when you multiplying the string by a the number of format arguments needed is multiplied by a
you can move the multiplication to after the formatting to fix your issue

56923804
prepare	execute
he alternative is to use dynamic sql with prepare and execute
this allows you to build a query from a string expression and make mysql parse and execute this at runtime


56923833
put	get
ne pair will be displayed and you put text in one pair
second pair you create in but one pair are empty when you press button so you get empty string in function


56923898
squash	branch
and yes this is a fine workflow to use for feature branch
squash changes into a single commit is a common workflow and if the change is logically only one commit it s even the preferred workflow
if your change involves logically separate changes such as a refactor and a new feature you can split them into separate commits as git upstream does

56924020
hash-collision	key	hash-collision	key
this seems like a very bad option since if two integer pairs mapped to the same hash key that would be difficult to deal with
dealing with hash-collision is not something you have to do but something that unordered_map does for you
even if all values hashes mapped to the same integer it would correctly make sure that different values are treated as different key even though the performance would degrade

56924403
filtering	grouping
i m assuming you want to filtering get all those documents in which atleast one lang in contentlist is en
then use if you want only that object in the inner array where lang en you need to use aggregation pipeline like link the reason for using the last grouping stage is that in your object contentlist is an array so we need to wrap lang object as array otherwise not needed if you can change return type object
in spring mongotemplate code

56924433
build.gradle	gradlew
f you re using android plugin for gradlew 3.0.0 or higher your project automatically uses a default version of the build tools that the plugin specifies
to use a different version of the build tools specify your project using buildtoolsversion in your module s build.gradle as follows


56924620
put	get

alternatively the client could put to receiving 403 forbidden if the id is already taken by another user
possibly 405 method not allowed if the other user s profile would be get -able on the reading side the other user s profile would be get s not common to model the concept of my profile with an unknown id in a restful api

56924777
submit	submission

in your case i think the problem is you use e.preventdefault when you submit but you didn t replace this form with new content
so this form will stay in submission status

56924852
g++	gcc
ou want to compile c++ code g++ string_var.cpp -o string_var.out it just so happens that either gcc or g++ works insofar as compiling the actual code the compiler understand that .cpp files contain c++ code and proceeds accordingly
however when c++ code times to linking the resulting object module gcc does not provide the runtime c++ library to the linker c++ code still thinks c++ code s just a c compiler and has never heard of c++ resulting in your link failure


56924914
bufferedreader	bufferedwriter
i recommend using bufferedreader instead of scanner
you can then use then uses the .readline or .lines methods the latter can be streamed into a bufferedwriter


56924957
int	chars
the result is that the pointer is converted to an int and this int is passed to fputc
that may result in some non-ascii chars being written to the file which in turn causes the file command to diagnose the file as binary
to fix this change the string

56925059
for-loop	arrays
otherwise return an empty arrays
second based on the json you included the date can be extracted in the for-loop using what you have now would get the whole object inside instead of just the date
there s also a typo using when it should be

56925133
int	double

when storing a value in an int or a long the value stored as a whole number and the data after the decimal point is removed
and there is no way to retrieve the decimal point you should use a float or a double

56925268
int	chars	int	double
if none of the function clauses match then you get a function_clause error
in the shell in line 6 you should be aware that abc is shorthand for the list of int
in erlang a double quoted string is shorthand for a list that contains the integer codepoints of the chars in the double quoted string

56925673
for-loop	arrays
i m a bit old-fashioned so i d use the good old for-loop
my pseudo-code sketch of the solution looks like so if you need a hashtable you d create an object instead of the arrays and define the key-value-pairs like so update july 09 2019 just for the record here s my first attempt so you can understand the comments below complaining about the compiler errors


56925742
submit	submission
rails 5 automatically disables the submit button after submission a request
i had to add data disable_with false to my submit button in my view


56925836
versioning	upgrade
rior to the migration to androidx lint does complain if you use a support library versioning that does not match your compilesdkversion
you can either ignore your compilesdkversion or upgrade to 28.0.0 which was the last release prior to moving to androidx


56925888
next	except
make a new branch off x for the next task
the workflow to deal with this is the same as branching from master except you re branching from x
here s an illustration of your repository with y branched off x

56926129
httpresponse	request	httpresponse	request
to handle 1 do not map_err to sendrequesterror lists the errors that can occur when doing client request
to handle 2 make sure you use the status code from the client response .and_then |response| ok httpresponse build response.status .streaming response actix-web handles 3 i believe
complete example handling headers too which actually failed add ssl as a feature in cargo.toml to fix the connection error then try the request again

56926518
uniq	grep
filtering can be done using | sort | uniq -d
finally print all lines that do not contain any word from the list previously generated using grep -fwvf listfile inputfile
in bash all these steps can run in one single command

56926549
folder	directory
the command exists as a part of expo
to initialize a project from scratch react-native init will create android and ios folder
also ensure if you have cloned the directory to run either npm install or yarn to install the dependencies

56926718
concave	convex

using this we can describe a fully concave region by the subsections where splits would move toward the edges or the stable midpoint
note that much of the above falls when concave and convex regions are connected as the stability criteria depends on there being a border at the beginning and end that we measure from

56926755
rank	percentile
pon rank retrieval the user simply reads the most recent stats document and approximates rank retrieval percentile rank by comparing the range with rank retrieval own score
of course it is possible that a user scores higher than the greatest score or lower than the lowest score from the previous stats update but i would just consider rank retrieval belonging to the highest scoring group and the lowest scoring group respectively


56926842
width	height
they are scaled 0 to 100 like percentages but always in relation to the viewport not to the containing element
so if you do width 100vw
height 50vw

56926868
capitalize	substr

it looks like this already works as long as you capitalize every letter in the query but it doesn t if some of the letters in the query are not capitalize such as mtsi
i think capital letters are the signal to the matching algorithm that two subsequent letters are potentially the beginnings of two different segments whereas a sequence of lowercase letters like si just expects to find that substr verbatim

56926872
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream

objectoutputstream is not intended for human consumption
the only thing to do with data written with objectoutputstream is to read it back in with objectinputstream

56928175
class-method	delegation
he simplest solution relevant to your use case is to define and implement commands for your bot in additional files and let your bot file attach consume additional files 8ball.js main.js there are probably other bot class-method more suited for attaching generic event handlers listeners and also other methods of specifying your module exports but the idea is that your command files don t need to import the bot file
i have not researched the telegram bot api so the telegram bot api may have some manner of delegation the bot instance when attaching an event handler


56928234
ionic	angular

look at this page ionic native community edition - ionic documentation it explains that you need to import the plugin in a ngmodule and add it to the list of providers
for angular the import path should end with ngx

56928750
background-repeat	background-position	background-position	background-size
the other settings of background are fixed in css background-repeat no-repeat
background-position center center
background-size 100 100

56928957
config	ini
ou will notice two file name php one is application file another is config setting when you open config setting in notepad you will notice that two file name php has ini extension
so application file another is ini file


56929090
int	double

the first line creates an int variable named a and puts the value 5 in it
the second line explicitly converts the value of a to a double then stores that converted value in a

56929407
viewdidload	viewwillappear
ake sure when you write to realm you use .modified flag not .all which will override an item only if an item has changed and won t cause event if it hasn t if you sure you only need to an event once - you can always add .take 1 also you call t inittrigger but send t on viewwillappear - which can be called as many times as you getting back to the screen
if you need t once put t on viewdidload ps instead of .asobservable .bind to .. you can just write .drive .. which is cleaner way to bind drivers to ui


56929514
jar	war

so jboss throws exception when it is unable to find this jar in lib
solution 1 if you are not using jboss s resteasy implementation in your project then just exclude that module from jboss create file jboss-deployment-structure.xml within web-inf for a jboss war project this location is same as that of jboss-web.xml

56929778
post	get

because you do not post an original image i can only give you some idea in my mind first you can filter some lines by the angles some lines have the lines you want should be around 0 and 90 degrees so the lines which have degrees like 30 or 45 should be removed
second in your result it seems like the real border you want get more results from houghlines so you may choose the most intensive ones

56929985
r7rs	guile
possibly re-exporting imported bindings ... the prefix syntax is also more easy to the mind than the equivalent using use-modules
this is inspired from r6rs library form and r7rs define-library form
i do not recommend to use library form in guile since it doesn t report lines correctly

56930054
syntax-highlighting	markdown

in vsc you can change the syntax-highlighting from plain-text to another language by clicking the plain-text -button on the bottom right of the window
edit you can make vcs always do .md syntax-highligting on .txt files doing - press f1 - type in change language mode - choose configure file association for .txt - choose markdown

56930470
multiplying	multiplication
so corresponds to halving the channel values and so on
it s possible to add a rounding step just by adding a suitable bias after multiplying
the multiplication does this where the x results are not used here is a quickbench to compare various scaling methods from timo in comments

56930596
nsis	uninstaller
to make a more customizable installer with proper uninstaller icon you can use script-based tools such as nsis nullsoft scriptable install system
perform only the build step with cx_freeze python setup.py build and run the installer-generating script of nsis or any other tool you chose afterwards


56931010
width	margin
offsetting columns you can offset grid columns in two ways our responsive .offset- grid classes and our margin utilities
grid classes are sized to match columns while margins are more useful for quick layouts where the width of the offset is variable
- getbootstrap.com use .pr-0 on the map column to remove its padding-right

56932097
g++	gcc
in order to access the help text to get the supported language standards of a given compiler version you have to ask the compiler not gcc or g++
since at this point i m getting tired of typing both commands the rest of this will assume we re using gcc
despite the fact that both commands are virtually interchangeable and basically the same middleman with a different name

56932186
simpledateformat	decimalformat

simpledateformat internally uses a locale specific instance of numberformat to parse the given date
in my case it is an instance of decimalformat

56932186
simpledateformat	decimalformat
in my case it is an instance of decimalformat
debugging simpledateformat reveals that the crucial part in is this given your first example the internally set obeycount is false so numberformat.parse is always called on the whole part of text 112
the same happens with this example i would consider at least the latter example as a possible bug

56932317
folder	directory

you are trying to modify a folder which is specified as a volume in your base image but as per docker documentation on volumes changing the volume from within the dockerfile if any build steps change the data within the volume after the data has been declared those changes will be discarded
linuxserver nextcloud does declare a volume data which you are trying to change afterward the data s like doing volume data .. run mkdir -p data local_data the directory created will be discarded

56932641
prepare	execute
he fastest way is using jmeter templates feature from jmeter s main menu choose file - templates - recording and click create expand http s test script recorder and click start prepare your browser for recording
configure your browser for recording to use jmeter as the proxy localhost or 127.0.0.1 as the proxy host 8888 as the proxy port make sure that the proxy is set to all protocols and there are no exceptions if you plan to record https traffic - import apachejmetertemporaryrootca.crt certificate into your browser https traffic - import apachejmetertemporaryrootca.crt certificate is generated in bin folder of your jmeter installation when you start the http s test script recorder execute the request in browser jmeter should capture the request and store the http request sampler under thread group - recording controller


56932691
folder	directory
as this recipe demonstrates you can then perform a regex match on that variable itself to extract a substring of it or in other words discard part of the captured match
the action uses the captured string in match as the name of the folder to save into
the leading . specifies the current directory which is equal to the value of the procmail variable maildir and the trailing selects mail directory format

56933471
int	double

the correct way to do it is forcing the type introduced to be sure that the value is an int
if you don t force it it s introduced as a double

56933735
google-chrome	safari

when you visit a website or web service that is using java you now see a message that says the google-chrome browser does not support npapi plug-ins and therefore will not run all java content
switch to a different browser internet explorer or safari on mac to run the java plug-in the java plug-in for web browsers relies on the cross platform plugin architecture npapi which has been supported by all major web browsers for over a decade

56933735
google-chrome	safari
if you have problems accessing java applications using google-chrome oracle recommends using internet explorer or safari instead
developers and system administrators looking for alternative ways to support users of google-chrome should see this blog regarding launching web start applications


56933805
int	chars
in particular in many c implementations int objects should be four-byte aligned whereas chars objects may have any alignment
if the address in p is not correctly aligned for an int then the expression could cause the program to crash or could cause undesired results
even if the alignment is correct the c standard does not guarantee what the result of converting a general to an is except that converting the result back to will yield the original pointer or an equivalent pointer

56933825
versioning	upgrade
it is possible that your client network does not support some terms that pjsip has upgrade in new libraries
you should try to check with older versioning of pjsip pod
like 2.5.5

56934090
prepare	execute
he fastest and the easiest way is using jmeter templates feature from jmeter s main menu choose and click create open http s test script recorder and click start prepare postman for recording
from postman s main menu choose use 127.0.0.1 as the proxy server and 8888 as the port execute the request in postman jmeter should capture the request and store the request under thread group - recording controler see apache jmeter http s test script recorder article for more information if needed


56934591
stdout	fflush
the buffer must fill up before the its contents are fflush
this reduces the number of expensive write system calls when it is assumed that data written to stdout will be examined later log files
see also stdout buffering by evan klitzke buffering in standard streams by pádraig brady and the stdout man page

56934821
folder	directory
in the path. it will give you the parent directory location from where you are at
updated suppose you folder structure is as c my-proj java main.java c my-proj meta-inf pom.xml then if you want to find the pom.xml
you can do something like below try this

56934885
operands	scalar
he use of this operator is detailed in section 6.5.14 of the c standard 2 each of the operands shall have scalar type
3 the || operator shall yield 1 if either of this operator operands compare unequal to 0


56935009
submit	submission

because your form updates that element and then submit
in order to make that element remain you must prevent the form from submission

56935009
submit	submission
in order to make that element remain you must prevent the form from submission
please note an html form will always submit event when the action is not provided. when you submit without the action it submit to the same page more like reloading but with form data in memory
so this is how you could approach your problem

56935021
squash	merge

for original question easiest way to do this would probably be to create a new orphan branch containing the contents of the old branch git checkout commit_c #checkout latest commit on your branch git checkout --orphan new_branch_name git commit write some reasonable commit message to describe that this commit is a squash of the old branch
if this commit looks okay you can now move your original branch pointer to this commit git branch -f original_branch_name for updated question seems like what you are looking for is a squash merge git checkout master git merge --squash tai-18 this will take all the changes introduced on tai-18 branch and create a commit on master branch which contains all those changes

56935021
squash	branch
if it looks okay you can now move your original branch pointer to this commit git branch -f original_branch_name for updated question seems like what you are looking for is a squash merge git checkout master git merge --squash tai-18 this will take all the changes introduced on tai-18 branch and create a commit on master branch which contains all those changes
if the same files have been updated concurrently on master branch there may be conflicts and you will have to resolve those


56935206
nstimer	nsrunloop

one more thing c use timerwithtimeinterval method in order to avoid adding timer to runloop in defaultmode use mainrunloop so self.mytimer nstimer timerwithtimeinterval 280 target self selector selector dostuff userinfo nil repeats no
nsrunloop mainrunloop addtimer self.mytimer formode nsrunloopcommonmodes

56935415
migrate	makemigrations
create a migration that disallow null values by removing the added in step 1
as you then run python manage.py migrate it would apply all of the migrations in step 1-3 in the correct order
your data migration would look something like this you can create an empty migration file using the . manage.py makemigrations --empty yourappname command

56935795
post	put
any id value in the body of your put or patch request will be ignored
only a value set in a post request will be respected but only if not already taken


56935826
for-loop	loops
if performance is concerned you want your assembly code to be written with the if outside your for-loop
effect of an if statement inside a loops could be important even with the best branch prediction
cpu will execute 2 more instructions a cmp and a jump on each loops

56935866
throttling	throttle
his have the benefit to let you control and throttle the use of them as you see fit
with this solution you still need an api key in your mobile app to allow access to your api server but while you continue vulnerable for attackers to steal this solution you are now in direct control of throttling the access to your api server and if you identify in each access the who and the what is accessing the api server then you have a more fine grade control but attacker will continue to be able to slip between all our defenses because is very hard to know what is accessing the api server


56936297
next	except

normalfunction will finish before the next line is executed
it s just normalfunction does nothing except trigger an asynchronous function

56936333
versioning	upgrade

the problem seems like to be the ms mpi versioning program
i upgrade ms mpi sdk from 9.0 to 10.0 and the problem is solved

56936387
integer	unsigned

to set bits to 0 you can use bitwise and with a bitmask bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb and 0000111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111 -------------------------------------------------------------------- 0000bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb to set bits to 1 you can use bitwise or with a bitmask 0000bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb or 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 ------------------------------------------------------------------- 1000bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb note that int64 is a signed integer and result of modifying the most significant bit with bitwise and or has implementation defined result in practice this means that the value depends on how negative numbers are represented on the system
bitwise operations are typically performed on unsigned integers only

56936510
uniq	grep
file5 count how often each line appears sort | uniq -c and keep only lines which appeared less than five times however if some file may contain the same line multiple times than you would have to remove these duplicates first
or a bit slower but easier to edit if for some reason you want to keep duplicates from individual files and also want to retain the original order of lines then you can invert the above command to only print lines which appeared in every file and remove these lines using grep or a bit slower but easier to edit


56936511
minimum	max

you could get the local minimum or maximum first in an array and then get the profit
find local min and max

56936855
versioning	upgrade
it is fixed in 2.5.5+ and 2.6.3+
if you do not update your ruby versioning then every new release of bundler 2.x will trigger this issue
upgrade your ruby to 2.6.3 or later change the ruby versioning in your gemfile accordingly re-run bundle install locally and then redeploy

56937270
put	get
you put a variable in quotes which to python means its a plain string
correct would be then you loop through the test_str like so then get the percentage


56937384
fullcalendar	momentjs

i ve used fullcalendar in the past - never on react redux stuff though
for time related stuff have a look at momentjs

56937425
short	base
ultimately if there s some validation class that you re providing via composition it would be best to inject it into the base class then derived classes would need to provide a similar constructor protected myderivedcommandhandler myvalidationclass validationclass base validationclass that would then ensure that if some implementation of ivalidationclass isn t passed in that an exception will be raised
short of that and perhaps better than that is simple code review
there should be a build and release pipeline

56937670
public	protected

the default behaviour of newtonsoft.json is going to find the public constructors
if your default constructor is only used in containing class or the same assembly you can reduce the access level to protected or internal so that newtonsoft.json will pick your desired public constructor

56938411
folder	directory

you can specify the run folder by changing m._path
if you leave the run folder as the default temp directory then you can view the run folder with print m._path or open the temp folder with m.open_folder

56938648
int	double
ubmat i j is an int
but the dat function expects a 2-d array of double with the second dimension being 100 so even replacing the dat function with just dat n-1 submat won t be correct


56938698
for-loop	arrays

this sounds like essentially a double for-loop problem
assuming there are no gaps in your arrays and no gaps in your arrays are the same length you can do something like this with reduce and you should get the object arrays that you re looking for

56938917
swift	objective-c

i m not used to swift sorry but it seems to me the natural solution to this would be to use - orderwindow relativeto
in objective-c that would be added just after the highlight window is shown and let the window server handle all the details of hiding obscured portions

56938971
free	malloc
these functions in turn would call malloc and free
you might be able to compare and see which p is not being free


56938979
implements	extends

there are various non-public classes other than class that indirectly implements type
for example sun.reflect.generics.reflectiveobjects.typevariableimpl implements typevariable which is an interface that extends type

56939023
for-loop	loops
if you don t find a match use the else branch of the for-loop to print your error
the else branch of a loops is executed when loops never reaches a break statement


56939839
sikuli	selenium
sikuli has nothing to gain from the dom it purely based on visual content of the screen
i would attempt to handle the popup you are describing using using standard selenium functionality so something like this driver.switchto .alert .dismiss
there are additional alert handling options so you can choose what suits you most

56940087
versioning	upgrade

you can use the upgrade api calls setting to test this
however updating to the latest available versioning of the plugin and the plugin s suggested api versioning sounds like the way to go since even v2.10 will only be available until november this year

56940315
maven	pom.xml

some steps are routine for me and i dont think of some steps to start a basic dynamic web project with maven and spring i do the following in eclipse i create a new maven-project not a simple project i add maven-archetype-webapp i open project-properties go into project facets and click on convert to faceted form i ensure dynamic web module java and javascript are selected also ensure eachs version to use dont click apply and dont click apply and close
you have to click further configuration available in the following dialog i change content directory to src main webapp i stay in project properties but i go into deployment assembly and click add after i clicked add i choose java build path entries in the upcoming dialiog i select maven dependencies in the next dialog and click finish as far as all of this is done im going to change my pom.xml and add the required dependencies

56940530
super	self

to extends a method from a super class you can use super
class one ... def foo self self.a.foo self.b.bar self.c.hmm 1 2 3 class two one ... def foo self super .foo self.d.wow notice this will not preserve the order in which the methods are called

56940710
windows	wow64
additionally windows x64 has an entire compatibility layer called wow64
as a 32-bit app running on 64-bit windows you do not notice anything and you run as if the os was 32-bit
your pointer size is four bytes your pointer-sized data types such as hwnd s are four bytes so again you do not need to worry about any of that if you only consult vba7 and correctly place longptr in all places where a pointer-sized argument must appear

56940719
tidyverse	dplyr
i am using the dplyr or tidyverse package
library tidyverse dataset creating a dataset for the labels
this creates a label dataset which will pick a labeling point at midpoint y for a given x

56940821
hex	binary

that s 14 bytes of extra data surrounding your data and the data itself has been ballooned by a large factor as any non-printable character has been split out into ascii hex digits plus a backslash and x character
this is why your data can your data be reshaped your binary data was 230400 bytes long but has been reshaped to a string representation that happens to use 597048 characters so roughly 2.6 letters per input byte

56940898
filtering	grouping

you can just use a where-object clause to filtering the results
since you re piping into get-aduser you should filtering by users rather than filtering on not foreign security principal since grouping can contain any ad object like computers contacts or other grouping

56941062
fgets	getline
he reallocation scheme is broken you test the second to last byte of the array but fgets may not have set last byte of the array if the line is shorter
here is how you can fix your program either use getline if your system supports your system


56941169
post	get

none of those has to work because you have defined your route as a post
your requests are get requests

56941519
keras	tensorflow
ou need to install tensorflow in order to use keras library
if you already installed tensorflow try to uninstall and install you already installed tensorflow again


56941535
kerberos	ntlm
these other credui functions are perhaps lower-level but i think the parameter usage is the same
msdn says this about negotiate to allow negotiate to select the kerberos security provider the client application must provide a service principal name spn a user principal name upn or a netbios account name as the target name
otherwise negotiate always selects the ntlm security provider

int	chars

your switch cases should look like this case 1 ... case 2 ... case 3 ... case 4 ... not this case 1 ... case 2 ... case 3 ... case 4 ... userinput is an int so the cases should be int literals as well
the literals that you are using such as 1 are chars literals

56941691
post	get
i want to post my solution here in case someone else get s stuck with trying to communicate to a moneris payment device through what they call a semi-integrated solution
everyone s suggestions got me thinking...so after some more research and testing i was able to get the device to work
note in this example the hex being sent over is hard coded for now and i have hard coded the lrc

56941692
kerberos	ntlm
ntlm and kerberos operate completely different
first of all i would highly recommend get rid off ntlm as fast as you can
you can solve your problem in an easy fashion if you can access c interfaces

56941692
kerberos	ntlm
you can solve your problem in an easy fashion if you can access c interfaces
i also assume you mit kerberos on a unix-like os like centos or freebsd etc
ntlm will provide you the downlevel logon name

56941799
public	protected
f the method is public the method is visible to everyone and any code can call the method is public
when the method is protected in is only known to the class itself and any of the method descendants


56941814
children	parent
.children only searches amongst an element s immediate children
if you need to look further down the opposite of parent use .find
here you ll see it in action using .text to get the value seeing as there is no data-id attribute

56941906
next	except
the results of the query could be delivered to applications by pages - you can specify the fetch size although 5 is quite small fetch one page process fetch next process ... until the result set is exhausted
in your case the page size doesn t match the result set size - you have 6 results there and the next result set for has only 3 rows
i don t know a solution that works out of box except but it may timeout in case if you have a lot of data

56941906
next	except
 don t know a solution that works out of box except but it may timeout in case if you have a lot of data
in your case i would better go with bigger ranges for example whole token range and page results inside it without using limit and then handle your case when you need to switch to the next token range and you have some rows that are left from previous token range


56942334
x86	64bit

if you require the 32 bit python or just do not want to install the 64bit version for whatever reason you can replace the file at c users appdata local programs python python37-32 lib site-packages hebi lib win_x64 hebi.dll with the file at c users appdata local programs python python37-32 lib site-packages hebi lib win_x86 hebi.dll however realize that you will not be able to run the api with a 64bit python executable this way
if you are at all curious what is happening here the currently faulty logic is attempting to load hebi.dll but fails to since the currently faulty logic tries to load the x86-64 version and not the 32 bit x86 version

56942458
squash	merge	squash	branch

in general you could use any of the following git rebase -i the-other-branch # pick the first revision squash the others
that will work you could also do what i do git merge -m getting updates from main branch master # do not worry we will get rid of this revision next git reset --soft master # now all differences between your branch and master in other words all changes related to your feature branch will be in index git commit -m my feature hope it helps

56942488
put	get
i don t think you can get around the extra div because react components reduce to html elements anyway
put this in componentdidmount and it should work


56942491
atexit	main

basic.start.term 6 if there is a use of a standard library object or function not permitted within signal handlers 21.10 that does not happen before 4.7 completion of destruction of objects with static storage duration and execution of std atexit registered functions 21.5 the program has undefined behavior
per basic.start.main 5 returning from main has the effect of calling std exit which does destroy objects with static storage duration and execute std atexit registered functions

56942566
put	get
hanged over to composite from flatten and just had to find the right place to put the geometry setting
without the geometry the circular image is placed in the centre of marker.png svg so i had to apply a different setting to get a different setting to position correctly found the solution more or less on the push pins on a map forum question


56942742
bokeh	holoviews

this sounds like you have an old version of bokeh
holoviews requires at least bokeh 1.0 and works best with bokeh 1.1

56942797
for-loop	loops	for-loop	loops
you need to use a single loops
either use a list comprehension or a full for-loop not both
using a simple loops

56943262
dataframe	multi-index

make sure to reassign after you sort the dataframe perhaps you meant to call the result sorted_df
group by the state level or given that the dataframe is a multi-index of state and county then apply a lambda taking the head for the top three given that the data was sorted in descending order by population for each state and sum the result

56943299
drive	createfile
you can convert the csv and excel format to google spreadsheet using drive api
in this case i used drive api v2 at advanced google services
the reason of the error of invalid argument file.contenttype at uploadfile is that the mimetype of mimetype.google_sheets cannot be used with createfile

56943323
hash-collision	key
it does not run into an infinite loop for maps without hash-collision because the linked list we add to was already left behind by the iterator
here s an example that proves it the output is iteration 1 key 0 map size 5 iteration 2 key 1 map size 5 all the items added inside the loop end up in the same bucket - the first one - the one our iterator already consumed


56943429
for-loop	loops
the for-loop sets the individual entries to point to the rows
so neither nor should contain any particular value until the for loops sets their values to point to the various rows that it creates
let s look at the code carefully this allocates one block of memory large enough to hold one pointer for each row

56943624
post	get
for brevity s sake i ll post a minimal example of what you are trying to achieve
without hashing you will not get an answer which will run below o n 2 however you can get a o n 2 without hashing your second solution was actually logically correct but syntactically incorrect. for example why are you printing system.out.println twosum.solution
you call twosum nums 9

56943738
width	height
o solve this adjust the line height in the formatlabel function
original answer when the label width is reduced each letter is placed on the label width own line


56943841
try-catch	exception-handling
if you are using exception-handling to communicate this information within your own code you cat put a try-catch within your code and pass the exception-handling to onerror
for example this might be fair for statusexception since it is a checked exception-handling
there is the transmitstatusruntimeexceptioninterceptor which will catch exception-handling during callbacks and if it is a statusruntimeexception close the call with the exception-handling s status

56943854
google-chrome	firefox

as you already know it has to do with google-chrome and how it deals with line height
although i have written a workaround that seems to work well on linux google-chrome firefox as well as windows google-chrome firefox edge

56943963
dns	spf
this happens when you have more than 10 dns lookups in your spf record
spf imposes the 10-dns-lookup limit to mitigate ddos attacks
you can use any online spf checker to check your spf record and make sure it doesn t exceed that limit

56944060
dpkg	apt
udo apt install python3-gi gobject-introspection gir1.2-gtk-3.0 side-note packages calles xyz-dev in debian ubuntu contain c headers pkg-config files and autotools macros
these are only needed if you intend to build software using compiled languages such as c and c++ these all are installed to usr include . xyz header1.h # headers usr include . xyz header2.h .. usr lib x86_64-linux-gnu pkgconfig libxyz.pc # pkgconfig files .. usr share aclocal xyz.m4 # autotools macros use dpkg -l libgtk-3-dev to see all the files installed by this package on your system


56944254
wildfly	weblogic
see open apache netbeans bug report 2476 netbeans 11 ee support weblogic server i don t know for sure but i suspect that this is a legal problem is related to licensing issues rather than any technical obstacles
the absence of licensing on apache netbeans 11.0 also impacts other important products such as hibernate netbeans-2719 resolve hibernate support and wildfly netbeans-2415 bring back support for wildfly server
there are licensing issues because apache assumed ownership of netbeans releases from oracle last year

56944254
glassfish	weblogic
tick with apache netbeans 11.0 and instead of weblogic use one of the four application servers which weblogic use formally supports out of the box payara glassfish apache tomcat and apache tomee
install your weblogic server outside of apache netbeans 11.0 and deploy your netbeans web applications to your weblogic server


56944485
realloc	malloc

use realloc to change the size of an existing allocation
if you use malloc as you did you lose the original contents of the array and also lose the pointer to it so you can t free the memory

56944621
for-loop	loops
f for example the user inputs 11 15 then on the first run-through middlerows will be 14 and the for-loop will count from 0 up to up to 9 height-2 decrementing middlerows each time
at the end of this loops to 9 height-2 decrementing middlerows is now 5


56944629
children	parent

i don t know why you want to put a function in element s children i think that place is only for string or other elements
you can just assign the label in its render method like this or if you really want to define a template in its parent element do its in the props instead of its children

56944895
build.gradle	gradlew

i could resolve it with the following config on build.gradle
see also sourcesetoutput - gradlew dsl version 5.5

56945037
ready	each
ow we can keep track of the inputs in a controlled manner when we re ready to place the bet the value is stored in the individual component state
we pass down two properties to each team component the team_id and betonteam function


56945098
mouse	keyboard
but for keyboard s listener uses separated method for press and release
both mouse s events are used to drag move elements on screen


56945197
division	multiplication
but in percentage terms it is a change of 0.5 0.9 difference original 100 where i have omitted the multiplication by 100 to make things simpler aka 55.555 or 0.5555
the main thing to realise at this step is that we need to do this division against the original values for all differences to get percent changes. however dates array has one column too many
so we do a simple slice

56945240
ionic	angular
hen ionic angular crashes ionic angular crashes will dump the message out to the console
you can see this by using the browser developer tools using google-chrome devtools - android development - ionic documentation or if you are on mac using safari web inspector - ios development - ionic documentation


56945351
multiplying	add

in python it s perfectly legal to multiplying an int by a list so you would end up with y_step being
so y_step was of type list when you went to add it

56945467
puts	fflush

this may have been caused by puts buffering
so either fflush the output set this to sync or unroll the loop so that the joins appear on different lines and the backtrace tells you the correct one

56945479
sorting	grouping
the code below does all of the sorting at once using data.table s setkey function
this should speed up the grouping and avoiding the call to sort persondatetime for each grouping


56945541
prng	random
either does it support setting random states using the python standard library
it does however seem you can set numba s internal prng within a jitted function by passing a seed parameter into the function and then calling the random.seed seed method from python s standard library therein


56945586
range	max	range	min
partition key range are just collections of partition keys grouped by physical partitions they are mapped to. so in this example you would get 5 pkranges with min max partition key value for each
notice that pkranges might change because in future as your collection grows physical partitions will get split causing some partition keys to be moved to new physical partition causing part of the previous range to be moved to new location


56945736
luis	bots

the routing of the user is handled inside the dispatchtotopintent method the strings in the case statement match to the intent names under your luis app in the portal
needless to say there will be some additional packages that you will need to include in your bots microsoft.bot.builder.ai.luis is one and you will need to create the ibotservices interface and botservices class in your project along with other changes

56945873
qgraphicsview	qmouseevent
if you want to emulate mouse movements in a qt graphics framework then you must send qmouseevent to the viewport of the qgraphicsview
in the following example i show how to move an item by emulating the mouse using qmouseevent in conclusion the qgraphicsscenemouseevent constructor must not be enabled in python since it is not accessible in the public api of qt in c++
so the behavior of pyqt5 is correct but pyside2 has a bug

56946156
free	malloc
the key operation of new is to ask the os for some free memory for dynamic allocation like malloc but from another memory pool
see the difference between malloc and new here
another option without dynamic memory is to declare a static array with a fixed size

56946589
centos	linux

here we can make centos rootfs tarball we
it will be easier if you have a real linux distribution installed in machine

56946589
dnf	yum

extract the tar.xz files in a folder tar -xf centos-7-docker.tar.xz -c folder repackage the extracted folder in a tar.gz file move that tar.gz folder to windows drive mv test.tar.gz mnt c myfolder import that tar.gz file as a new distribution wsl.exe --import centos myfolder test.tar.gz dnf is not installed in this docker file
so use rpm or yum to install rpm or yum yum install dnf

56946818
boost	allocator	allocator	stl
this means if you use stl or boost in your dso interface all exes and dsos must use exactly the same version of the c++ runtime compiled with the same build flags and same version of boost if that s your kind of thing
i d recommend using warning level 4 on visual studio which will nicely list all of the above problems in your dso interfaces as c4251 warnings as for your question yes the function will return a std unique_ptr however you are now allocator memory in the dso which you may be freeing in the exe
this can be very bad in the windows world where you may find that debug builds have different heaps

56946945
ubuntu	linux

you can t run docker easily inside of wsl ie the version of ubuntu from the windows store you have installed
the reason is that the windows subsystem for linux which you are using isn t a true version of linux with a linux kernel

56947124
clang	llvm

it can be the case of clang format previously the entire file is automatically formatted on file save and it drove me nuts for the repositories which clang format is not enabled
such behavior is gone after turning tools - option - llvm clang - clangformat - format on save - enable to false

56947239
folder	directory
to move through directory you could either hard code the directory where your script is present or you could toggle through the directory using simple commands such as .. to move out of the given directory or to move inside a folder in the directory
for example - .. script.py or folder script.py
similarly you can use this to find your .zip file

56947585
temp	tmp
any unix systems will periodically clean out the tmp directory this behavior is undesired in a servlet container and has been known to cause problems
this durable directory at opt jetty temp solves for this behavior


56947734
jar	war

if you are using maven add below to your project should solve your problem you don t have to add others jar because it will automatically pull the rest of dependencies
i prefer to add the jar to my war instead of tomcat lib

56947910
hex	binary
left click that recorded http request and click hex tab of request panel
this will show the binary representation of request together with some parsed text. edit the saved request

56950130
cos	sin
identify + - sin a therm the a can be any of the euler angles so print sin of them all now see so we found our therm.
cos ey for the unused angles yet
so if ey is the 20 deg i print 10 and 30 deg .

56950792
google-chrome	firefox

this difference in behaviour seems to be because google-chrome is starting the animations as soon as the page loads
whereas firefox and edge are only triggering the animations once the svgs become visible

56951069
for-loop	loops
i had a main program that calls the collect data part for each file and then also the for-loop in the collect data part so that caused the double writting
so i just removed loops


56951246
oncreate	onstart

just use you re code in oncreate
cause onstart includes when the application is first created and when the application is brought back on the screen without being terminated

56951624
try-catch	exception-handling
this allows you to try-catch for concrete exception-handling types and handle only cases you really can handle
in this case the try-catch is redundant
and this here it is much better to use await task.delay ....

56951847
ubuntu	debian

for now simply use the version built for ubuntu 18.4
here is the link ubuntu is based on debian testing so there shouldn t be issues regarding using that version

56951847
ubuntu	debian
here is the link ubuntu is based on debian testing so there shouldn t be issues regarding using that version
mongo will probably update their debian version soon
then you may install the debian10

56952025
put	get

first off i d advise to put the anchors that are related to each other all on the same file
but to get the randomrec to center below the connectbox you should use the following anchors so i guess you where almost there with the horizontalcenter parent line which should have .horizontalcenter as well

56952220
required	placeholder
fter that recipient variables can be used to replace placeholder like recipient.name with a name of every contact automatically
this feature is described in batch sending section of batch docs as well as another option that does not required to create a mailing list

versioning	upgrade

the tls security settings in that ancient versioning of okhttp are no longer capable of connecting to your target https server
upgrade to a more recent okhttp

56952331
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
in order to loops over the arrays langs you need to use the for-loop
the for value in loops is used for going through elements of an arrays
if an index is required an alternative form for index value in can be used

56952568
minimum	max
now the code the above will group your data into groups of 6 with minimum 1 occurrence which you can remove and get nan
finally to add this as column use idea for max was taken from here
edit given your example now i d use this

56952625
filtering	grouping
his collection of user nodes can naturally be sorted and filtering as needed
however if we wanted to grouping needed together according to some criteria similar to grouping by in sql we would create a separate usergroup type and a usergroupconnection


56952787
stateless	stateful	stateless	stateful
change your widget to be stateful
put the cursor on your stateless class and press ctrl + shift +r if you have the vc code extension installed
select convert to stateful

56952915
filtering	grouping
there is a difference between the view and the items collection which you are trying to use in the code
to get the filtering applied on the ui you need to use the following sequence of property and method calls explorer.currentview.sortfields the currentview property of the explorer or folder class returns an object representing the current view
the view object allows you to create customizable views that allow you to better sort grouping and ultimately view data of all different types

56952915
sorting	filtering
or more information about using dasl syntax to filtering items in a view see filtering items
also you can cast the view object to the tableview and use the tableview properties for detecting the sorting mechanisms


56953229
capitalize	capitalization
if you want to capitalize the first letter of your sentence you can check to see if
this checks the first letter of the first word for capitalization
if you d like to add spaces to each string when you concatenate it you can try a ranged for loop this will leave a space at the end remember to .strip it. put it all together and you ve got your code

56953967
background-image	background-position
for example background-image url your image
background-position top calc 200px - 20vw right
background-attachment fixed

56953976
git-merge	git-rebase
git-rebase can be used also for merging one branch into another
instead of git merge git-merge and git-revert add a new commit into your repository
another possible solution for that is using git reset

56953986
submit	submission
y submission the captcha token separately you are still leaving the endpoint that submit the form unsecured
or if you re not submission via ajax then you should put that token in a hidden form input and process that token along with the form


56954301
hide	show
lternatively you could hide the tabcontent blocks by default using css and show the first one
the js line is simpler but you ll probably notice a slight flicker on page load before the js line hide the tabs to start


56954504
post	get

a post with correct data will usually return a redirect
this is due to the post redirect get architectural pattern wiki

56954566
nerdtree	netrw

if you simply want - on startup - to execute nerdtree on the first argument if it is a directory your function is ok but just execute the desired command
when nerdtree plugin is installed opening vim with a directory automatically shows a nerdtree browser primary where o opens the file replacing the browser instead of the regular netrw browser

56954679
postgresql	mysql	folder	directory	folder	directory
then mysql 8.0 s entrypoint will start the mysql server put things in var lib mysql so you can see things in windows folder
but things different for postgresql 11.3-alpine if you check the log you can see data directory var lib postgresql data has wrong ownership although the docker-entrypoint.sh has did to change the ownership from root to postgresql but unfortunately this just works if you run the container on linux
for windows this will fail but postgresql need this folder s ownership to be postgresql not root

56954829
filtering	grouping
the window grouping by hour and orders the frequency in descending order
thereafter filtering for the top 2 rows


56955619
onchange	onblur	onchange	onblur
avoid using onchange and onblur together - even though some people post that this fixes some onchange problems that occur on ios devices
at some point in the past i was dealing with an issue with iphone and ipad not opening a window when running an onchange event
everyone kept posting about using onblur events on those devices

56955715
dictionary	map

i d be tempted to construct a dictionary of regexes first that you can use to categorise your filenamess if you re unsure about using regexes try regex101 which is a great learning resource for this powerful pattern matching toolkit
then define a type-to-folder mapping define a function to perform the matching and then within your loop extract your filename and use a subloop or def to perform your tagging - and map that to your predefined list of paths finally make use of os.path.split and os.path.join to reconstruct the filenames you want for your files and then either construct an os call to move your files using os-commands or using the kind of technique employed here

56955750
tidyr	stringr
separate the paths by with tidyr s separate
remove redundant strings from the file names using stringr s str_remove and the other variables as patterns
finally separate what s left of the file names with another call to separate which returns the following using some synthetic data

56956466
hide	show

this is because you are hiding the modal on success using this create a banner in the modal like this an initially hide this
on success call show method

56956505
put	get
to set a variable scope.set name value
name is a string and value is a pyobject object. to convert to pyobject obj.topython convert to pyobject if you need to put your object into python
to evaluate 0 1 2 3 4 an expression scope.eval expr to get a variable 5 6 value scope.get variablename c# code that doesn t have an end semicolon before any comment and is one-line represents an expression

56956505
put	get
to evaluate 0 1 2 3 4 an expression scope.eval expr to get a variable 5 6 value scope.get variablename c# code that doesn t have an end semicolon before any comment and is one-line represents an expression
full version on devdrive cdn because i only have 1 reputation and not enough to put reference links


56956550
for-loop	loops

we can avoid the for-loop and use replicate to repeat fake data using setnames to name the dataframe with x_names
cbind data setnames data.frame replicate length x_names fake x_names # data x1 x2 x3 #1 1 2 2 2 #2 2 3 3 3 #3 3 4 4 4 #4 4 5 5 5 ideally one should avoid growing objects in a loops however one way to solve op s problem in loops is

56956982
clang	icc

at the time this is written gcc and clang both warn with -winit-self and -wuninitialized respectively
neither msvc nor icc warn about this

56957047
prometheus	metrics
he prometheus server will pull metrics from your metrics api
but i can recommend that the prometheus server is better to use official jmx exporter


56957703
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops	for-loop	loops
there are three basic types of loops
a for-loop
commonly used to loops over a collection such as an arraylist map or arrays

56957896
jar	.war
a .war file is really just a zip file
you can use something like unzip -l somefilename.war to list the contents of a war zip jar file or use whatever zip file interrogation tool you like


56958176
capitalize	capitalization

since you are using the capitalize letter as the key l and l have the same key
but it seems like you want to sort by letter then by capitalization

56958552
dateadd	datepart
select dateadd month datediff month 0 current_timestamp - 7 0 let me explain
first off we need to understand that sql server interprets 0 as 1900-01-01 as shown by the following datepart functions
select datepart year 0 as year datepart month 0 as month datepart day 0 as day

56958606
put	get

logic reverse the array and check weather the given element is integer if it is an integer put it into a temporary array otherwise check if the process of saving integer data has already been started if yes break the loop otherwise continue with the loop
finally reverse the array again to get the data in same format

56958852
width	height

put the width 100
height 100

56958865
jobs	cron
task scheduler windows or cron linux would be the way to go
there are also tools like autosys that are built for scheduling batch jobs


56958878
dictionary	map
it is much better to store many similar structured objects in one container instead of 144 separate objects flooding your global environment
you lose no functionality of data frame if stored inside a list or dictionary
to avoid tuple keys map values into a single string keys with underscore delimiter

56958913
versioning	upgrade
if you changed or upgrade the versioning of r currently being used then r kernel will not work in jupyter
r studio - tools - global options - change to review versioning of r installed on pc
if the current versioning of r is different than the versioning in the kernel file select that other versioning of r

56958992
strstr	strcmp

one problem is that strstr returns null if the needle is not found
then you pass a null pointer to strcmp which will go all wrong

56959216
botframework	bots
first this is how you can locate your botframework appid apppassword if you don t know it
navigate to your azure bots s resource group
on the left menu pane select deployments. then select the bots deployment and select inputs in the menu pane

56959225
background-repeat	border-box

don t use the background-repeat repeat along with the background-origin content-box ..it just won t work
for all other background-origin such as border-box and the padding-box the repeat option would work just perfectly fine

56959225
border-box	background-size
for all other background-origin such as border-box and the padding-box the repeat option would work just perfectly fine
if you are trying to fill the content with the background the only option for you is use cover in background-size
the best solution comes if you are willing to write an extra piece of code in html by just giving a container element like div for all the content that you need and just fill it with the background

56959502
submit	submission
ava code in the xhtml i removed the field1 field2 field3 from the process attribute since the seemed useless submission takes place on the submit no ajax submit needed
also removed no ajax submit from the update attribute the change of a field becoming required after a change does not need an update changed the actionlistener on the p commandbutton to an action xhtml code and then for me an action xhtml code started working


56959637
dictionary	map
if not provided the list of classes will be automatically inferred from the subdirectory names structure under directory where each subdirectory will be treated as a different class and the order of the classes which will map to the label indices will be alphanumeric
the dictionary containing the mapping from class names to class indices can be obtained via the attribute class_indices.

margin	height
this is viewcell_sizechanged when the viewcell is filled with data the grid is resized so the viewcell_sizechanged event is rised
there i have the current grid.height and margin valorized
when i have reached the total number of items i have the exact height of all grids in the listview

julian	difference
update i forgot about the part that says the julian day epoch is noon instead of midnight
if you want to take this into account it is very easy with the date lib i simply subtracted 12 hours off the epoch difference and let auto deduce the return type for me which is now a system_clock -based time_point with a precision of hours
the exact same display function with the same input now outputs 2019-07-09 12 00 00.000000

from there pick a random number within length of that list and get the answer key
the out put may be like question c answer c and may print different item in next run

subtraction	add
if you must approach the problem in this way use the locals function instead and manually add to the list of local variables but perhaps a better way of addressing this problem would be with the random.sample function which allows you to select any number of unique values from a sample the random.choice vals function is roughly equivalent to random.sample vals 1
if you want to avoid duplicating values you can use set subtraction to pare down the range of acceptable random samples

post	put	put	get
he storyline content will then try to retrieve that information from the lrs during the launch initialization process this means that your lrs has to store the data provided during the post request the which is special syntax that should act like a put so that a put may then be retrieved during a get request to the same resource
the storyline content is ignoring your additional parameter as one that a put doesn t expect

post	get
inking multiple databases to a single connection is very simple with the createconnection mongoose method things get slightly more unusual when you have multiple model.js files and a single server.js or main app.js file
my file structure for a visual reference -main folder -controllers -usercontroller -staticpagescontroller -postscontroller -models server.js i contain all the database and server connection tools post i need a db of my own users i need a db of my own -public stylesheets -views user all user ejs files post all post ejs files site all staticpage ejs files partials all partials -index.js inside your server.js file you must create two connections one for each db like so each of your model.js files will have your model.js files own schema inside i ll use a user as reference ie inside here you must require your server.js file like so now the confusing part that is so very subtle but makes all the difference

integer	unsigned

it is a bug in randtoolbox the c code doesn t use width-base integer types like uint32_t and has some subtle bugs when int and long differ in width like on linux 64 bits but not on windows
for example in the file mt19937ar.c an int is assigned to an unsigned long which causes sign extension if you replace the last line with a bug in randtoolbox the c code doesn t use width-base integer types like uint32_t disappears

inherited	subclassing
it is important that subclassing should not change the signature of their __init__ method since instances of the classes are instantiated automatically by parts of the framework in order to be run
so the problem is not with how testprovince is inheriting from helper but with how helper is overriding the __init__ method it inherited from the library code
if you add a call to super helper self .__init__ it will probably work properly

56963098
inherited	subclassing
i managed to find solution from this old thread 7 years ago so i changed all three classes as the following base.py helper.py test_province.py from helper import after this i could access any variable inside superclass helper from subclassing testprovince
the cause root of problem could be i might trying to inherited init function of testcase of class of unittest instead of class helper itself
thanks

clearly for something greater than -1 0 1 you will have far more possibilities and you will also potentially have more items to carry forward
maybe put the choices in a directed graph using relative offsets

.htaccess	httpd.conf

you have to define url rewrite in the public .htaccess file. check if you have the correct settings there. the laravel default file looks like this just backup your .htaccess and try to copy paste this to your htaccess file and check if it works
if you use laravels authorization you also have to add this maybe you also have to turn on the modules mod_rewrite.c and mod_negotiation.c if they arent already. you can do this by search and uncomment the line for the desired module in apache conf httpd.conf if you want to customize your .htaccess for what ever reason there are many ressources available on the web

56964405
for-loop	loops

the issue with your approach is that you are returning within your for-loop
whenever you return your function will stop running your function essentially jumps out of your function so whenever you run into a person over the age of 18 you stop your loops and thus your loops cannot count any more people

56964425
inherited	properties
n my case i also created a testdbcontext which inherited from my standard test modeldbcontext class which in turn inherited from my library dbcontextbase class which does the ef ignore work but i simply set a properties to the provided modelbuilder so that i could interrogate a properties during my tests
then i could test a properties using the following code note i had to use reflection to extract the ef internal classes required to determine if indeed the field was set to ignored


56964538
memcpy	strcpy

to do so since you already know hello world is 12-characters including the nul-terminating character you can simply memcpy pointer hello world 12
note if you already have the length there is no need to call strcpy and cause it to scan for the end-of-string again now your new allocated block of memory contains hello world and the memory is mutable so you can change any of the characters you like

for-loop	arrays
in this case function tickets arguments i would suggest using arrays for both arguments list and results list. so the function call would be tickets 25 25 50 25 100 as other people suggested - you can use array.map array.reduce or foreach instead
if for-loop is mandatory for some reason this is a possible answer

the following fails c program files r r-3.4.0 bin rscript.exe doing following succeeds subst z c program files r r-3.4.0 z bin rscript.exe the reason the above-proposed solutions didn t work evidently has to do with the rscript.exe executable s own internal path resolution from the rscript.exe working directory which has a space in the rscript.exe rather the windows command line being confused with the space

inline	inlining

only the static final variant of the methodhandle is seen as a constant by the jit see cifield and only calls through methodhandles that are constant are inline see callgenerator for_method_handle_inline where it does several checks to see that the receiver is constant like this difference makes it so that the call to the static final methodhandle can be inline and is therefore roughly as fast as the plain case
if you print out inlining information you can see this as well

layoutparams	viewgroup

why textview.layoutparams returns null from docs the layoutparams associated with this view or null if no parameters have been set yet you re calling textview.layoutparams for a view that was created manually not through xml layout with layoutparams field says how a particular view is attached to the enclosing layout
so if you ve created your view programmatically and you have not attached a particular view to any viewgroup framelayout linearlayout constraintlayout etc the getlayoutparams will return null because there is no enclosing layout for your view

virtualenv	conda

if your project doens t have any dependencies apart from what s already included in anaconda i d imagine that you can just run your code without activating your virtualenv environment
other than that the easisest thing to do would be to create a new conda environment and install the dependencies of your project into the newly created env

56972299
for-loop	loops

you would need to create a for-loop to cycle through your file and execute the necessary command on the line
the ifs option will prevent leading trailing white space and the -r will prevent backslash escapes from being interpreted. the while loops will cycle through each line until the end of the file

56972704

accessor	properties

first add accessor for weekday and monthday to frequency now you can use accessor to create bindings for your subviews to change the frequency when a segment is clicked you need to give the segmentedcontrol a binding that changes the frequency
i would introduce another private enum to use for the segment then add an extension to frequency to translate to from segment finally get rid of your segment properties and use frequency.segment instead

int	boolean
you could do last note in python don t use an int to check the loop.
either do while true and break when necessary or simply use a boolean variable


56978200
hide	show

both of the code snippets you posted only hide categories from the widget it has no effect on hiding the category otherwise
not 100 on what your goal is two things seem likely to me if you want to exclude products from a particular category on the shop page do it with below code does not hide the category if you selected to show the category under design customizer woocommerce product catalogue in the backend as seen in the woocommerce docs

56978200
hide	show
ot 100 on what your goal is two things seem likely to me if you want to exclude products from a particular category on the shop page do it with below code does not hide the category if you selected to show the category under design customizer woocommerce product catalogue in the backend as seen in the woocommerce docs
to actually hide the category do the following as documented here hide a woocommerce category from shop page which does not hide the products of the category


56978255
squash	branch
o rebase off the develop branch git fetch git rebase -i origin develop it will give you a text editor view of your commits
if you want to squash origin into a single clean commit change pick to s for all but the first line


56978255
git-rebase	undo

save and quit and the git-rebase is over
if the git-rebase says there were conflicts you can undo the git-rebase git rebase --abort then google how to resolve conflicts if the git-rebase worked you will have to push with git push --force warning force pushing overwrites what is on the remote server it is a destructive operation

56978421
width	height
layout the remaining text as a single line text with width of circle at line 2
the y position at line 2 can be obtained by adding the height of the single line 1
repeat until no more text or circle is filled

56978474
elasticsearch	kibana

after so many days of going through elasticsearch and redis documentation this is my insight redis and elaticsearch for encrypted content redis search is fast as compared to elasticsearch however redis search have less community support
elasticsearch tools like kibana logstash are very helpful in viewing and analyzing data

56979103
margin	height
f it does then that means it s not a white bar it s the background and the height of your image needs to be adjusted
however if the white bar remains then try setting the margin and padding of the img to 0


56979132
subtract	add
dit i will try to add the rest of what you might be looking for but i m not sure about the equations so i will use a simple substitute equation
ok lets say for simplicity sake your are adding before mean to before stddev and after mean to after stddev and for both rows than subtract both rows from each other


56979234
email	dkim
also as recommendation set up spf dkim and dmarc to authenticate email
if you are still not able to receive email i would suggest to contact g suite support
also make sure where your domain ns servers are pointing to there is where you have to update the dns

56979349
octal	decimal	octal	decimal
n is one of those as a stand-in for 0x0a decimal 10 a byte designated in ascii as a newline
here are the legal ones a b f n r t v the escape sequences 0 and 1 work because c supports using followed by digits as an octal value
so that ll also work with say 3 and 35 but not 9 and note that 35 has a decimal value of 29

56979647
int	double

declaration order of overloads does not matter in the sense that following are equivalent 1. void foo int
void foo double

56979647
int	double
2. void foo double
void foo int
foo 42

56979658
hide	show
o i tried following hacky workaround to re-initialize the input from scratch and hacky workaround worked i placed a dummy variable on input to show hide the element
and whenever ngmodelchange emits input is hidden and show immediately here is a working demo


56979805
for-loop	arrays

value is the value of the current element in the for-loop it s not a dictionary key so is not right
and your dictionary elements are not arrays so it makes no sense to use etc

56980013
spaces	delimiter

it sounds like you only want spaces in between each number
the best way to do this is the join method which operates on a delimiter takes a list of strings and creates a new string where the delimiter separates each string in the list

56980030
box2d	havok	box2d	physx

i d probably recommend trying to get your head around a simple 2d physics engine first box2d
if you absolutely need 3d collision detection then you probably want to be looking at physx bullet or havok

56980250
put	get

i would suggest to put your ec2 instance in the asg with the desired capacity of 1 and take advantage of updatepolicy attribute
additionally you will get a self-healing capability out of the box

56980288
folder	directory
check source cmd run as administrator and npm uninstall -g ionic cordova shutdown the system not restarted start boot system after sometime removed all from temp folder
installed the latest version of nodejs as administrator open cmd as administrator and updated npm install -g npm npm install -g ionic npm install -g cordova after that test it works fine with any directory


56980345
int	chars

string indices aren t int
string indices aren t int re opaque objects of type string.index which can be used to subscript into a string to obtain a chars

56980366
srp	principles
good example sourse patterns and principles are great things but used incorrectly they can make a simple problem just as complex as not having them
srp shouldn t be understood in a strict manner
one object should have very few responsibilities not one . here customerdao is only responsible for customer persistence so it has only one responsibility

56980389
put	get
it doesn t get any purer than that
there s absolutely nothing that you didn t put there yourself
this is the route traefik chose for instance

56980432
folder	directory
delete node_modules folder manually
run npm install if not working try from vagrant ssh vagrant then go to the directory and run npm install


56980559
setcontentview	findviewbyid

so after setcontentview xx you already have a listview instance in memory
when you perform the method findviewbyid returns the reference of the listview and pass the reference to list so the list now refers to the listview object

56980793
setcontentview	findviewbyid

previously we had to cast to specific view types while using findviewbyid which is not necessary for newer versions of android sdk
hence the object is not created when you have declared listview list the object was created when you called setcontentview

56980805
distance	altitude	distance	altitude
but if you add a tilt zero degrees is looking straight down then the altitude determines the elevation of the view target above the lat lon location and the distance determines how far the camera is from that point
if you make d 0 then altitude will define both the view target and camera height above sea level
if you make a 0 then the distance will be from the lat lon at sea level even if that s underground

56980864
chart.js	ng2-charts
he documentation in chart.js is more detailed how to label y axis using ng2-charts in chart.js y-axis s ticks are determined automatically based on the data you have pushed into chartdatasets e.g
max y-axis value will be 99 to control the appearance of y-axis s ticks refer the documentation in chart.js so if you wish to control the tick s stepsize to be increment of 2 you can do something like if you want to set the maximum y-axis tick label to be always 100 you will define your options like this to label your y-axis


56980911
put	get
lternatively it may be a problem with your packages in your flutter project because flutter it cannot understand what s been put in the json file try manually updating the package.json for your project looking for any weird syntax and such or finding an automated way to do it for example with node.js you can run npm-update alternatively it may be a problem with flutter itself if the package.json file is fine and dandy then flutter is broken because the package.json file s not properly reading in the json file the package.json file could be a bug but i d say that s unlikely
in this case reinstall flutter for your project and see what happens uninstalling vs-code windows press the homebutton + r at the same time type in appwiz.cpl to get to the control panel window for uninstalling software search for vs code or search code in the search bar


56981151
folder	directory

you can use basic ftp an ftp client module and use an ftp client module ensuredir method to implement the requirement if user folder doesn t exists i need to create folder before sending image
according to an ftp client module document ...we make sure a remote path exists creating all directory as necessary

56981802
width	height

if you want a widget to maintain its size then you must use setfixedsize button.setfixedsize qtcore.qsize 5 80 if your button is in a layout your button will use the sizepolicy to determine the size behavior in the case of the button it is horizontal qtwidgets.qsizepolicy.minimum which makes the widget take all the available width
vertical qtwidgets.qsizepolicy.fixed that causes the widget to use the height defined by sizehint that depends on the content text font size etc

56981847
put	get

also note it s cleaner not to put the fcounts series column in either values where it definitely doesn t belong or ts where it would be kind of kludgy
note that the and this allows you to directly get the index id of the timeseries with most fluctuations but really since conceptually we re applying the function separately row-wise to each row of timeseries values we should use note still trying to debug the too many indexers pandas issue last here s the boilerplate code to set up two separate dataframes with shared index id

56981912
post	put

after one year i found this post in my tray again. and i have found the correct way to do
just put this line inside the html template and everything is ok

56982139
build.gradle	gradlew
include library dependencies on the library s build.gradle file on android studio as well
on gradlew system with library as a maven artifact add the dependency and sync
gradlew will include the library dependencies itself

56982253
ionic	angular
you don t use the window.addeventlistener offline api type code to monitor connectivity
instead you should use the ionic native plugin called network which exposes this information in a cross-device angular-friendly way network - ionic documentation so you would put some code in like this this code isn t going to just drop in to your project i m just trying to show you the direction that you should be taking
it seems like you are starting from the beginning so really what you need to do is learn more about angular ionic

56982448
versioning	upgrade
o know the shinyapps.io pando versioning i ve used pandoc_version from package rmarkdown and i got 2.3.1 older than mine local that is 2.7.3 so i downgraded my local pandoc versioning to 2.6 just to test out a not so old versioning
this got me the same problem with shinyapps.io raw xml to test out again i upgrade my local pandoc to my local pandoc again e tested again


56982640
maven	pom.xml	ant	pom.xml

you have to run maven build mvn clean install ant build ant for generating executable files out of your project
for that two necessary files are build.xml and pom.xml

56982711
union	distinct
sets a set object is an unordered collection of distinct hashable objects
it is commonly used to test membership remove duplicates from a sequence and compute mathematical operations such as intersection union difference and symmetric difference
usage from some of the answers it is clear that a list is quite faster than a set when iterating over the values

56983022
int	chars

just try to cast item_no as int i suppose it s non-numeric
without seeing the picture considering the comment all of the data end with a non-numeric chars all data composed of digits upto the last chars

56983137
for-loop	loops

okay i found the solution to this we can do this by checking the name inside a for-loop
first of all check whether the name is empty or not if empty place the first name in name variable and loops throughout

56983422
client-side	server-side
or you should try to find alternatives that allow at least part of the code to run client-side
if you use an office application from a server-side solution the application will lack many of the necessary capabilities to run successfully
additionally you will be taking risks with the stability of your overall solution

56983473
ionic	angular
angular can build and ionic can build app and test on cordova
solution from embedded twitter widget on angular 2+ app only shows up on the first page load put here in .ts and put twitter tag in template files

innodb	myisam
y engine was myisam which does not support rollback transactions
i changed my db engine to innodb and now my engine is working fine


56984149
post	get

there is no direct way to connect to wcf service from android studio but you can still consume no direct way to connect to wcf service from android studio wcf service as soap post
to get you started - look at previous answer by andy white - i m using this approach as well and it is working quite well

56984401
rspec	minitest

shoulda matchers.configure do |config| config.integrate do |with| with.test_framework rspec with.library rails end end to learn you more about setting it up
i m not exactly sure but i d guess some sort of configuration is required for some sort of configuration to work with minitest as well

56984484
put	get
you just copy the value of the name splitting by so you just get the name and not the entire path
you will probably need to do it when you print the file so put the code inside this


56985581
multiplying	division
if you want to improve performance get rid of recursion and avoid recomputing the entire product
use the product computed in the previous step multiplying it by the number entering the window and divide by the number exiting the window
division is slower but it will pay off for larger values of c

56985662
put	get
the result will be interpolated at the time the shell evaluates the xargs command line and there is no simple way to get the count with this mechanism
refactoring this to put the curl command and some scaffolding into a separate script could solve these issues and should be trivial enough if it s really important to you
rough sketch .

56985894
move	drag
edit the same with group and sprite and now you have to only add images to group items and rest of the code doesn t need to be changed
edit this version use group to move only clicked image s
if you click in place where two or more images are overlapped then it will drag two or more images

56985894
move	drag
if you click in place where two or more images are overlapped then it will drag two or more images
edit similar program in pyglet - it move two images with less code
pyglet has point 0 0 in left bottom corner

56986101
setlocale	strftime
it returns exactly what the system setlocale function returns
setlocale lc_all fr_fr
echo strftime a e b y mktime 0 0 0 12 22 1978

56986170
keras	tensorflow
this one should be fine. here is one possible way written in low level tensorflow
you might need to wrap this in a keras layer or just use lambda to integrate it into your model
this would implement max pooling

56986554
set	bag
ith brandedfares option enabled you get 1 basic price with its extra prices cabin bag meal etc.
if you re using bargainfindermax operation to search and get flights you have to set brandedfareindicators attribute as true like this and also your pcc also have to be available and has access to get brandedfares you need to discuss your pcc with your sabre consultant


56986555
installation	upgrade
 assume you are using kubernetes cluster that is available as an installation option of docker desktop for windows
in that case you cannot easily upgrade your kubernetes cluster server side as that case particular versioning is bundled with docker desktop installer docker community edition 2.0.0.2 2019-01-16 comes with kubernetes 1.10.11 versioning


56986563
keras	tensorflow

if you are using tf 2.0 beta make sure that all your keras imports are tensorflow.keras.
any keras imports will pickup the standard keras package that assumes tensorflow 1.4

56986566
ssl	https
this will probably lead to ssl verification errors fix your systemtime otherwise ssl verfication will fail
it might work similar to pepper follow the instructions here you also get the snimissingwarning an https request has been made but the sni server name indication extension to tls is not available on this platform. this may cause the server to present an incorrect tls certificate which can cause validation failures
you can upgrade to a newer version of python to solve this

56987010
multiplying	multiplication

you have just a simple mistake you are multiplying string value with 10
that s why you are ending up with 1111111111 because multiplication works like this in strings

56987332
pull	push

git pull origin branch-name replace branch-name with the branch you are working on
after that you may proceed with git push origin branch-name

56987665
intersect	contains
if that s correct then there you re looking for a way to intersect two types in typescript
while there s no generic type in the standard lib that does that there exist a lib contains a lot of generic utility types to perform operations like this on types
here s the intersection type from the lib utility-types from t pick properties that exist in u usage from their readme this effectively creates a type contains only the properties that exist in both of your types

56988050
plot	heatmap

actually there s a coordinates function included in the sp package imported from raster with which we easily can add the points to the plot
to get a heatmap using your google analytics data here ses we can use spplot also included in sp

56988050
post	get
to get a heatmap using your google analytics data here ses we can use spplot also included in sp
first we need to create a spatialpointsdataframe which - according to this post on gis.stackexchange - we aggregate to match points and polygons from slovakia_level_2
result data

56988204
floating-point	integer

yes you can perform floating-point arithmetic with constants in expressions in c programs and yes the compiler will often reduce these expressions at compile time
the situation is almost the same as for integer constants

56988204
floating-point	fractions	integer	fractions
the situation is almost the same as for integer constants
that is your example is just as legal as the integer example there remain two things to worry about especially on older compilers the floating-point model used during compilation may be different and may give you slightly different answers than the model used at run time
the innocent-looking decimal fractions 0.1 can famously no t be represented exactly in binary floating point so your expression 100 0.1 might reduce to something like 999.99999 or 1000.00001

56988268
hive	hdfs
but this is not how hive works and what it was designed for
quite normal scenario is when you loaded very big file with semi-structured data in hdfs
building an index on it is too expensive and without index to check pk violation is possible only to scan all the data

56989237
post	get
hen calling get on a query object the object that is returned is of type task
iterate through your list create those task objects and add all of those task objects to a and then pass your list to tasks s whenallsuccess method as it is explained in my answer from the following post android firestore convert array of document references to list pojo edit you should iterate through your list of strings and create the task objects


56989388
build.gradle	gradlew

the logs without the build.gradle is useless information .
and one cannot use gradlew 2.10 with android studio 3.4.2 .

56989397
migrate	downgrade
so there are two possibilities downgrade com.google.android.gms play-services-ads if you downgrade the version of that library this issue should be fixed because old versions were still using support library and not androidx
you can try for example com.google.android.gms play-services-ads 17.2.0 here you can find the list of released versions you should consider to migrate your app to androidx
support library was deprecated

56989570
width	height
moreover it is for cell not for image. valign setting should be included in your like set alignment for image like phpoffice phpword simpletype jc center as in this example tweak width and height if you want to adjust dimension of images
height
height in pt

56989570
width	height
height in pt
width

56989601
migrate	makemigrations
first you run makemigrations which will create a file based on changes from the last file generated from running makemigrations
then you run migrate which will push the changes in the migrations folder which are not yet registered in the database in table django_migrations
the migration file names are important because django uses it to identify the migration

56989916
fish	bash
bash and other shells including dash - it s one of the few posix extensions it has have the local keyword to create local variables
they just default to global while fish defaults to local
also when you say environment variables what you mean are exported variables which require an explicit export step in posixy shells and the -x or --export flag to set in fish

56990051
inherited	subclassing

edit to add to this usually there are 2 reasons to use inherited specialisation and extension
for specialisation you use define your methods in your superclass and your subclassing differ in how specialisation implement those methods

56990051
superclass	subclassing
for extension you use a superclass as a base class containing everything that overlaps
other than that the subclassing might have very different implementations and uses
a lot of interfaces have this kind of use

56990280
margin	height
caveat if the table goes across multiple pages the margin would be applied to all pages but one can assume each page will have the logo in that case it s more an advantage than a problem
additional hint you can use the setting rowpagebreak avoid to prevent the row to be split across the pages when cells have different height


56990338
chown	mount
hen docker-compose mount to that location docker-compose mount to that location will retain those permissions
dockerfile # setup folder before switching to user run mkdir volume_data run chown postgres postgres volume_data user postgres docker-compose.yml volumes - home me postgres_data volume_data source

hide	show

closing all modals in background .modal .modal hide
now opening new modal #mymodal .modal show

56990647
for-loop	arrays

if you use it in a for-loop you would replace it with some dynamic index
now that we have a reference to the current child grid we could call it datasource s dataview method that would give we the current data that is rendered in this child grid and would allow we to check the records in order to see which ones have been checked please note that allchildrenwidgets returns a flattened arrays of all child widgets containing all the hierarchy levels you would not have to call it on the current child widget recursively in order to get to it level 3 children grids

56990665
post	get

you send data with the post method as set in your js code the method attribute of is set to post
the php script is waiting for get data so you have to replace by

56990697
put	get

you can approach this as create an attribute for the product as multi-select which have the all available payment methods as option or you can create yes no attribute and put yes by default assign no for the products which paypal is not allowed
now use this attribute values at checkout to hide the paypal method you can get an idea for hiding the payment from here

56990731
versioning	upgrade

it might be a bug in qt 5.2 especially if it works with later qt versioning
the right answer is upgrade to a later version of qt the reason is that qt 5.2 support ended more than 3 years ago

56990731
versioning	upgrade
the right answer is upgrade to a later versioning of qt. the reason is that qt 5.2 support ended more than 3 years ago
you should be using one of the currently supported versioning 5.9.8 5.12.4 or 5.13.0
note that 5.9 and 5.12 are lts but 5.9 support is due to end next year

56990914
notepad++	sublimetext

i was editing in notepad++ which adds windows-specific newline characters onto the end of the line
tried doing it in sublimetext and it worked immediately

56990980
select-object	get-wmiobject
if you really want to wmic you can use the magical stop parsing operator wmic -- path win32_process get parentprocessid commandline creationdate executablepath name processid get-wmiobject or get-ciminstance will output objects though that are easier to manipulate
get-ciminstance even has tab completion on the classnames and piping to select-object or where-object you get tab completion on the properties

pivot-table	crosstab

if on postgresql you re really looking for a pivot-table like thing
i d look at the crosstab function see here . which handles things of the format name value a 1 a 2 b 3 b 4 b 5 and produces a 1 2 3 b 3 4 5

56991308
for-loop	loops

as requested without knowing exactly what you re trying to accomplish i ve restructured the for-loop to make a bit more sense
for example there s no need to have separate loops with the same for options when all you re changing is the do commands - so i ve nested the loops and added multiple do lines when applicable

uninstall	upgrade	versioning	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
this should leave two versioning installed afterwards uninstall of old versioning never happened

versioning	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
productversion there might not have been a bump up of one or more of the first 3 digits in the product versioning fourth field ignored
product code as a side-note you might get a warning that the product is already installed this means the product code has not changed which it should for a major upgrade
dangling versioning it is also possible that your wix markup is fine and you have a dangling older versioning that was never correctly configured if so uninstall it manually and try again or try on a clean virtual

56991527
installation	upgrade	uninstall	upgrade
further details some further things to remember a major upgrade is essentially an uninstall of the older versioning and an installation of the new versioning with a number of scheduling options for the order in which actions take place install new first then uninstall old or vice versa
as stated above you could also have a straggling older versioning of a setup on the box that wasn t properly configured or some x-files nonsense happened that caues it to fail upgrade
happens

56991527
versioning	upgrade
i believe this simple configuration adds the protection against downgrade that you seek see the upgrade table that results test case using the transparent aluminum as test project you can try this procedure to make the upgrade work set the product code to in order to auto-generate a new productcode for every build
compile the first versioning of your msi
right click wix project in solution view in visual studio and select open folder in file explorer

serializable	deserialization

this blog post and the associated code illustrate how to serializable and deserialize structs that are declared to be unmanaged
one approach to serialization is as follows the corresponding deserialization code is as expected this produces considerable speed gains documented in the blog post

56991574
serializable	deserialization
one approach to serializable is as follows the corresponding deserialization code is as expected this produces considerable speed gains documented in the blog post
thus this may be a useful serializable technique when data is stored as a span of an unmanaged type
the technique does assume however that values are deserialized on a platform with the same endianness as the platform on which it was serialized

56991916
int	chars
the order of bytes of an int is implementation defined
note that the behaviour would be well defined in this case because chars is listed as one of the exceptions in the quoted rule


56991951
int	double
when passed to a variadic function like printf the chars is again promoted to int
aside for the float type that too is promoted when passed to printf to double
this is why the printf format specifier f works for both float and double

56991998
for-loop	arrays
you re not using map the way it was intended to be used as you re not looking to output an arrays
for purely iterative purposes you should use array.prototype.foreach or a traditional for-loop if you need access to an i iterator index


56992028
client-side	server-side

the warning message says the warning message seems your data is too big for client-side datatables
you may consider server-side processing on the documentation website your data shows a shiny example which uses dt renderdatatable

install_requires must be a string or list of strings containing valid project versioning requirement specifiers yes your setuptools is too old
to upgrade pip install -u setuptools perhaps you also need to upgrade pip pip install -u pip setuptools

base	fractions
from here excel stores dates and times as a number representing the number of days since 1900-jan-0 plus a fractions portion of a 24 hour day ddddd.tttttt
this is called a serial date or serial date-time. now you have to ways to filter by date on your query in the query you can use date_add to add your number of days cell value to the base date
carefull date_add takes int and the date value is float so needs prior casting

56992328
int	chars
lemma is in lower case and collocations are formed by joining individual words with an underscore _ chars
ss_type is a one digit decimal int representing the synset type for the sense
see synset type below for a listing of the numbers corresponding to each synset type

maven	pom.xml
however i discovered that a maven build failed and that i needed to include gson in my pom.xml
after fixing the pom.xml everything fell into place

google-chrome	firefox
one can only set a https proxy via pac files automatic proxy configuration url field in firefox
the switchomega extension in fact generates a pac file for google-chrome to use though how it interacts with google-chrome is so far unknown to me
by clicking the export pac button in switchomega i get a file contains from http host port the specified proxy should be used https host port the specified https proxy should be used i think i build a https proxy server

spaces	delimiter
if there are not any assume spaces
this can be implemented as a simple for-loop and your possible delimiter can be a simple string from the most important separator - |
regexes are bad for such simple things

56993488
instances	transient
this same instances is then used by all the subsequent requests
so in general a singleton service is created only one time per application and that single instances is used throughout the application life time
addtransient - this method creates a transient service

56993544
maven	pom.xml

let s assume you ve built your .aar and published s to a maven repository artifactory nexus what have you - implementation com.mycompany library 1.0 aar
any child dependencies need to be included in the pom.xml delivered by the server to have any child dependencies available in your application

56993711
jobs	cron

the web jobs won t be deleted but the tiggers will so the web jobs won t execute on schedule anymore
you can set up a logic app to poke the web jobs or you can redeploy the web jobs with a cron expression

56993721
for-loop	loops
by the logic which is implemented your program will exit first level for-loop whenever your entered value is not divisable by 4
read on for loops if you want to learn more . i recommend to start from while loops instead
the logic whould be this 1

width	height
e want we contentviewwidth to simply be the size of we squirtleviewcontroller s view s width
we contentviewheight s constant will be a little different though as our contentviewwidth depends on the height of our contentview s subviews

post	get

this post may be helpful
then you can control this post s alpha channel change this post s rendering to 0 right before unpausing the game action to get this post s drawing cycles back

56994284
dictionary	map
f you wanted to have one path for each url then you should use a dictionary to have a map between url and xpath
you can iterate over a dictionary to do what you want to do


56994370
for-loop	loops

it looks like you are opening output.csv twice once in the beginning and then in the for-loop
since you are opening with the option w like it will overwrite the file every loops

56994510
pop-up	dialog
our modal you ve got is fine but you probably ought to use a separate component for the pop-up and to pass information to a separate component for the pop-up a separate component for the pop-up would look like this within your calling template include some template that will have a template for the pop-up or modal or whatever which contains the component see below this will pass these values in as inputs as these values are into your component when it s created on click as you pointed out you ll also have to open your dialog or pop-up or whatever which is described in detail here
but here s a quick summary - in your component for your original form-containing template you ll need a reference to your pop-up which we ve already created


56994689
stdout	fflush
this will make your compiled program marginally slower very unlikely to be noticed at human interaction speeds but behave more like the interpreted version
import system.io and use hsetbuffering stdout nobuffering at the beginning of main
explicitly fflush the buffer when you know you are going to pause for user input

56994689
stdout	fflush
explicitly fflush the buffer when you know you are going to pause for user input
import system.io and use hflush stdout just before each call to getline
do output in a way that behaves the same between the two buffering modes

56994747
dpkg	apt
olution i uninstall mariadb with this command sudo apt-get remove --auto-remove mariadb-server and install sudo apt install mysql-server instead but it leads to a more problems successfully install mysql but can t start dpkg error processing package mysql-server --configure dependency problems - leaving unconfigured no apport report written because the error message indicates the error message a followup error from a previous failure errors were encountered while processing mysql-server-5.7 mysql-server e sub-process usr bin dpkg returned an error code 1 so by removing mariadb s deb sources and purging mysql-common and then reinstalling mariadb s deb sources
do sudo apt edit-sources and look for anything containing mariadb like comment mariadb s deb sources out by putting a # in front of mariadb s deb sources


56994902
post	get

just add this code to check if post type is news then render 404 template else render content template
you can get more info about how pages works in wordpress from this link - or you can create a template 404 and then assign a template 404 in your custom post type and now a template 404 will always render 404 page and this is how you can create templates in wordpress also you can create single-news.php page for your news post type which simply loads the 404 page ref -

stateless	stateful

class components could always be stateless if state is never used
functional components were originally only used as a simpler way of defining components which did not require state but with the introduction of hooks hooks now have the ability of being stateful

56995223
background-repeat	background-size	background-image	background-size

but to satisfy quasiconcavity both of the inputs must be concave
since the inputs are convex the curvature is not known

56995556
prop	pseudo-class	prop	each
selected is one of the material-ui special states that it refers to as pseudo-class and the documentation provides the default class name for each mui-selected
this means you can do the following this is no longer referencing another rule so isn t needed and neither is selected classes.selected needed in the classes prop
instead this is referencing the actual class name that material-ui applies for the default styling when

56996571
rtp	rtsp

ffmpeg is expected to send the rtp packets to a server peer actually outside the container my host machine
ffmpeg was not serving the sample audio like an rtsp server.

56996805
children	parent

in order for the child property to allow multiple children we would turn it into an array
so we would first check to see if the child property exists in the parent

56996851
stdout	stderr
you are trying to capture the error message on stdout
to feed the stderr of which to grep you would need to write the order of and also matters
but you should not rely on the specific error message of which

iboutlet	ibaction
connect the top-constraint via iboutlet
finally connect the button s touchupinside to the ibaction


56997137
getter	setter

for example you may want to implement some checks when the getter is called and make a decisions whether to return the data or not
likewise in the setter you may verify that the data the setter was called with meets the requirements and throw an error if it s not

56997414
apache	nginx
make sure it match cpu architecture x86 x64 along with full chain fbclient.dll - php_pdo_firebird.dll - php engine - web server apache nginx
if php runs as a plugin then fbclient.dll should be loadable by webserver apache
it means to be in the same binary folder or specified in path environement variable

56997658
hide	show

using the mouse is not supposed to display the keyboard related ui features for example if the last input came from the mouse the system will hide the keyboard cues
and if the last input came from the keyboard the system will show the keyboard cues

56997881
versioning	upgrade

the ultimate guide to upgrading functions to mysqli api the reason for the new mysqli extension was to take advantage of new features found in mysql systems versioning 4.1.3 and newer
when changing your existing code from to mysqli api you should avail of these improvements otherwise your upgrade efforts could go in vain

56998234
puts	gets
is the pid of the running script which we pass into our function to become the more descriptive pidofparent in which we kill after we ve finished doing stuff
the after calling the function puts it in the background
gets the pid of the last executed command thus we now have the pid of the background process we just started

56998487
bash	zsh

from this article by james-coyle following command works for me i believe docker cli natively does not provide such a functionality so we have to rely on filtering and good-old bash pipe and xargs update-1 note that depending on your environment you might have to do these run docker commands with sudo just prefix both docker
commands above with sudo enclose name pattern in double-quotes particularly on zsh

56998513
128bit	64bit
it s not terrible yet so software like x264 and ffmpeg that still have significant amounts of mmx code for stuff that natural works in 64bit chunks don t suffer too badly
128bit avx versions of integer instructions would probably be the best bet in many cases to avoid register-copy mov instructions


56998515
qobject	qmetaobject
_qtobject gets destroyed with your class after the user-provided destructor if any so it s almost no different than if you derived from qobject indeed a base class from many points of view is really similar to a hidden first class member
that being said i would use qmetaobject connection possibly wrapping qmetaobject connection into a std unique_ptr or something to get auto-disconnection on destruction


56999174
put	get

the reason is is because you put the style section at the end
things get executed in order so first the script executes

56999310
ssl	https	ssl	https
while some others take https proxy as a man-in-the-middle attack type of proxy server
but the way connecting to a http proxy server over ssl does exist
check my question and answer here https proxy server only works in switchomega you can deploy one by yourself with tens of lines of code

post	put
since links to blog post often die quite quickly i ve replicated the source below the code above was published on july 16 2017 by yi zeng
you d put this in a file called something like lib tasks to_fixtures.rake
i loaded my sql fixture data into the otherwise empty clean test-mode database then ran

56999323
for-loop	loops

one possibility is to let the possibledate persist outside of the for-loop
this will allow you add 1 day to this for each loops iteration

56999386
bash	subshell
he trick is something that i picked-up from around these parts runs something within a subshell is a compound command hint should show relevant documentation causes standard error to be written where no input returns appends element to _preexisting_list by way of if part checks if the number of elements within _ipv4_addresses are greater than 0 via the # sign elif part checks if function should be board by now in either case a break from the while loop is taken when logic is tripped
will add 1 to whatever previous value was in _counter and assign _counter to _counter sleep causes loop to chill out for a number of seconds so other things can be contemplated by the device bash semicolons with testing brackets instead of || or causes return to return the status of if the number of ip addresses found where greater than 0 regardless of truthiness of test if there s something questionable after all that feel free to post a comment so that the answer can be improved


56999592

you ll need to add the height of the scrollbar to the window.innerheight
there doesn t seem to be a super solid way of doing this per this other question getting scroll bar width using javascript

oncreate	recreate

assume in your oncreate method you have something like this if so pls try to change the code like below after i send the update request and the update request is successful then your recycler view will be updated with latest data
and like adm s comment finish and recreate the activity is never a solution for updating recycler view the ux will be very very bad

57000300
versioning	upgrade
in these kinds of changes it is better to use a versioning upgrade
for more details about kubernetes api versioning changes refer the following links

57000317
dns	spf

within their company s dns their company s dns have willingly specified that their company s dns emails are sent using email provider a whilst sending their emails emails using email provider b
your own mail provider sees this and immediately thinks that the email is not legit because of their company s dns own dns policy this is called the spf record

57000364
maven	pom.xml

after a little bit digging into testng and maven the way i found to disable the junitreportreporter is to disable all default listeners in testng and attach the wanted listeners + your own customized junitreportreporter
below is the snapshot from pom.xml file of my project

57000438
email	dkim
f those email are not really sent by your team server those email could be spoofing
you can implement spf dkim + dmarc in your domain so that recipients can reject spoofed messages whenever recipients re not coming from your server


57000470
for-loop	arrays
however i had to convert the second arrays to a set check if element exists in an arrays
i think that s more intuitive than a for-loop iteration


57000562
for-loop	loops

to iterate a posted checkbox input it s better to use foreach instead of for-loop since the arrays index is not always sequential
i ve changed your codes to just call the update method only once after the foreach loops controller model this will save each and as an arrays first then insert this as batch insert

57000697
azure	hdinsight	azure	hdinsight
the key is that you need to configure azure storage account as hdfs-compatible storage in core-site.xml file and add two jars hadoop-azure azure-storage to your classpath for accessing hdfs via the protocol wasb s
you can refer to the official tutorial to know hdfs-compatible storage with wasb and the blog about configuration for hdinsight more details
for spark running on azure the difference is just only access hdfs with wasb the other preparations has been done by azure when creating hdinsight cluster with spark

57000943
versioning	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
it tells you that you shouldn t use sklearn.externals.joblib anymore if you want your code to be compatible with later versioning of scikit-learn
should means that you still can as long as you do not upgrade scikit-learn to 0.23 or later
the way to make your code ready for later versioning of scikit-learn is to not use the deprecated sklearn.externals.joblib but to use joblib directly instead

migrate	upgrade

migrate your project to androidx
dependencies are upgrade to androidx

57001038
migrate	upgrade
dependencies are upgrade to androidx
so if you want to use androidx contents migrate your project to androidx
with android studio 3.2 and higher you can quickly migrate an existing project to use androidx by selecting refactor migrate to androidx from the menu bar

57001298
appdata	uninstaller

according to your error message you set c users pc appdata local xenko nugetdev as one of the package sources
suggestion first of all to avoid something from xenko rest corrupt the package-install process make sure you ve uninstaller the extension

57001912
client-side	server-side	client-side	server-side
also you cannot call the places api web service in client-side javascript
web services are server-side
to understand the difference between places api web service and the places library js api client-side service please refer to google s documentation

57001952
keystore	jks

you don t need to create keystore file
you can use existing jks file to sign the app

57002225
for-loop	loops
hat i meant with c-style searching is that iterating a list and indexing it every loops s iterations is not effective in python and simply looks ugly
for you problem for-loop would be preferred for item_name item_price in zip name_list price_list .. where zip takes two lists and let you iterate over two lists at once in an effective way


57002463
x86	64bit
ut we can copy a 64bit register with 1-byte push + 1-byte pop
assuming neither register needs a rex prefix to access xor-zeroing is the most well-known x86 peephole optimization it saves 3 bytes of code size and is actually more efficient than mov edi 0


57002832
range	max
ince when the end date is na you want to still consider the transaction as ongoing first i d convert the nas as the maximum date of your calendar dataframe so we ll count them later on as 1 for each day till max after this we need to generate the missing dates between the start - end dates
to do so we can use complete from tidyr as per mkr s example in the following way we new dataframe nf now has a new start date that corresponds to each transaction quantity area combination unique for the date range


57002852
put	get
to correctly get the value of an input element you ll need to select the element with #elementid and then chain the val function like so #elementid .val
the form will be triggered by pressing the submit button so you ll need a listener on the forms submit event in the callback function you ll put your ajax request


57003188
setinterval	settimeout

a setinterval will continue running with the values passed as arguments there is no way to change that
you could cancel the interval and create a new one but in that case it just makes sense to start a new timeout with settimeout whenever the previous finished

57003293
atom-editor	sublimetext

it is good that atom-editor is opening
i ve tried this with vsc and sublimetext and this worked but as you can see you were trying to commit with blank message

57003301
win64	windows
you should follow the build-windows.txt instructions but run . vsgen -g visual studio 15 2017 win64 inside your conda-metis file path in command prompt with full permissions instead of using visual studio 10
before moving on to using the files that were generated by the above command in path_to_your_metis_dir build windows we need another fix
following what was said in rint issue after creating vs project using cmake we have to edit the file path_to_your_metis_dir gklib gk_arch.h by removing the line #define rint x idx_t x +0.5

57003614
folder	directory
but if this method not use and relative import used like from .simple_page import simple_page then if simple page file is removed and refactored into different folder and __init__ file also then it become hard to debug
using from yourapplication.simple_page import simple_page this way will tell the full structure of project and all the import are made from the source directory level which make it easy to refactor in later stage
overall in one sentence it is just for maintaining scaling the project

57003730
puts	gets
he main thread fetches the data at fixed time intervals and puts the data into a queue
the processor thread gets data from a queue and submits the data to a pool of workers for processing then collects results and put a pool of workers for processing into another queue


57004344
woocommerce	shortcode

ok so within woocommerce there is content-widget-product.php which returns a product s details for one type of widget
there is also content-product.php which returns a product for their main products shortcode loop.

57004381
imageview	picasso
ou d basically need to get the image from the uri and set the image from the uri to an imageview
i d probably recommend you to use a image loading library like glide or picasso to reduce the boilerplate code and not have to worry about caching and stuff


57004705
imageview	picasso
in picasso like this picasso.with activity .load imageurl .into holder.productimage
and in glide like this glide.with this .load url .into imageview


57004708
children	parent
o access it you will need the following helper method this traverses the visualtree under a parent and searches for descendants of certain type
we can use it like this make sure to call the findchildren method only after the page is actually loaded for example in the page.loaded event handler or onnavigatedto as in the page constructor the template children do not exist yet and the helper would return no children


57005100
put	get
see this documentation how to get date in a desired format in windows batch
put that in a script which does type filenamevariable at the end
let s say the script is named data_gen

57005616
oncreate	ondestroy

you could register the listener inside your oncreate method
then unregister the listener when you close the activity by overriding the ondestroy method or unregister the listener whenever you call finish method

57006239
post	put

you need to look into php post and get requests and also wrapping your inputs in a tag
if configured correctly an element of _get or _post will be created with the name of buku in this case and this case value will be stored as 1 or 2 depending on the value of what you ve put in the value attribute

57006959
post	get
but here is a small guideline
i would create an endpoint that receives the document receive_document with a post method
since you are sending your document to the server i would create an endpoint that serves up the processed document processed_document with a get method

57007087
client-side	server-side	client-side	server-side
if you are building a solution that runs in a server-side context you should try to use components that have been made safe for unattended execution
or you should try to find alternatives that allow at least part of the code to run client-side
if you use an office application from a server-side solution the application will lack many of the necessary capabilities to run successfully

57007097
maven	pom.xml

i assume you are using maven
in your pom.xml you can set the name of the project in the name-tag for ant projects have a look at this answer

57007199
inherited	properties
now you may ask why do we have both the prototype and the __proto__ properties
the reason for this is because an object in javascript let s call it derived inherited from another object let s call it base if and only if
consider the following code now when you create an instance of a function the instance actually inherited from the prototype of the function

57007290
build.gradle	gradlew
you can refer to the work done for gradlew see this build.gradle
other than that the only hint i have is some work done for the karate gatling integration which uses scala a little build.gradle


57007379
versioning	upgrade

the code works in scipy versioning 1.2.0 and above
i made sure to upgrade to 1.2.1 and found no more problems

57007546
post	get

ok so instead of naming the endpoint differently for each operation type you just change the http method i ll try to make an example post used to upload the document returns 200 ok when the upload is completed
get returns the processed document you can also return a different http code in case the processed document is not ready or even different if the document hasn t been uploaded

57007546
post	get	post	put	put	get
ut to make a more solid api maybe you can return an id token to the user into the post response then forward that token to the get request so the server will be able to know exactly which file the user is requesting
put this method should be used when updating a resource that has been already created with post delete removes a resource then return 204 or 404 options the post response contains the allowed methods on this endpoint


57007573
range	min

because the range is n the minimum item can go at and the max item at
you can map any item to the range is position in the array simply by subtracting min

57007590
background-color	transparency

i moved the background-image into the row div and set the background-color back to rgba 255 255 255 0.5 in the col-md-12 class
i added margin 10px to the col class for effect to highlight the difference between the opaque background 255 255 255 0.5 and the completely transparency one

57007744
pop-up	dialog

the selections pop-up is not a different window tab it s just an html pop-up
you can tell this because if you right click on the dialog you will see the normal context menu

57007935
chef	inspec
if you moved to those version and have a commercial relation with chef contact chef support for help getting automate setup
if you don t have a commercial relation with chef fall back to chef14 as client and chef-server12 or goiardi
there s a community effort ongoing to provide a free-as-in-beer distribution of chef client 15 named cinc as well as the other products from chef you can find us in the community-distros channel on chef s slack for chef and inspec ports and habitat s slack for biome the community version of habitat

57008216
rubygems	bundler
see disable_shared_gems bundle_disable_shared_gems stop bundler from accessing gems installed to rubygems normal location
and path.system bundle_path__system whether bundler will install gems into the default system path gem.dir


57008261
junit	mockito
make sure you use the proper runner extension rule or whatever else there is like mockitoannotations.initmocks testclass
there are certain differences between the junit version you might be using
if you still need help with that provide the junit mockito verison you are using

57008261
junit	mockito
if you still need help with that provide the junit mockito verison you are using
see another possibility that things are not injected might be that your class is structured in a way mockito can t handle
from your test case i would assume you used field injection so the mock annotated field should have the same name as the private field you have in your test class

57008369
width	height
adjust your body s width and height to your desired width and height and if necessary you could create a div to surround the svg and set a lower width height there
the percentages will prevent your svg from clipping when the screen width is less than 800px width currently specified
hope this helps

57008380
for-loop	arrays
what you want to do is create a for-loop to access all of the values in npimage and if necessary change to black
creates an arrays of 0 s of length 256 sets the 256th element in lut to 0


57008868
put	get

for apache put this in the site configuration file that essentially tells the user-agent to never even think about using http only https on this site for the next 6 months roughly
3 mod_security should be available in one of the rhel repos probably epel setup and configuration of that can get complex so start here it s the manual for version 2.x there s a 3.x but i suspect it s not made it into rhel yet so i m posting the 2.x version

57009045
put	get
onnect to the container samba daemons are running you use the right name format in your code and command lines target name is resolvable samba shares are visible and accessible ls get put commands provide expected output here try to mount remote share as suggested by cwadley mount could be prohibited by default in docker container for investigation purposes you might use docker container available at github or even deploy your application in docker container since docker container contains samba client and helpful command line tools after you get this working at the docker level you could easily reproduce this in kubernetes
you might do the checks from within the running pod in kubernetes having got the checks working in command line in docker and kubernetes you should get your program code working also


57009730
int	boolean
ases must be an int string or enum
cases are not boolean statements


57010049
swift	objective-c
now let s change the swift declaration of the parameter type this changes nothing as far as objective-c is concerned
we changed the name of the function to actionwithlayer but objective-c knows nothing about how the parameter is typed the calayer part
it just goes right ahead and calls the method and passes along the sender which is still the button

57010129
for-loop	arrays
the part with the +1 and -1 in the for-loop is needed as a workaround because the arrays start from index 0 but the cells in a range start with row 1
is needed to write the values of the result arrays to the column e without defining the length of the range in e


57010263
folder	directory
he ssh private and public keys go under .ssh directory of your logged in user directory
just copy the .ssh folder and paste the .ssh folder under c windows system32 config systemprofile step 3 add your public key to your git server account


57010347
queue	fifo
nserting series of elements in particular is not something which is defined for fifo container and the whole reason of using std queue in the first place is to restrict operations logically not part of the fifo container interface
having said that std queue exposes the underlying container using std queue in the first place uses as a protected member variable c so one way you can workaround this limitation is by inheriting your custom adapter from std deque and exposing underlying container


57010485
filtering	grouping

short version your question has been addressed on github already a few comments though custom_headers is to define http headers which won t help for your scenario by design when you create a networkmanagementclient you already filtering by subscription since subscription is a parameter of it
the parameter of public_ip_addresses.list is a resource grouping name so you already filtering by resource grouping name see your first code is fine but you need to re-inject the public ip id into public_ip_addresses.get

type-safety	typechecking
java arrays have run time typechecking generics only have compile time typechecking
java implements type-safety through a combination of compile-time and runtime checks
casting bypasses most of the compile-time checks but there are still run-time checks

put	get

i have checked the screenshot uploaded and i notice that the uri you put in the create table window is weird according to bigquery external-data-drive the uri should look like this
i suggest you to get the shareable link instead to only copy the browser link

post	get	post	get
so once you have a token you app can post to any public channel
to get a token a user needs to install your slack app
alternatively can create dynamic webhooks that can post to any channel in a workspace

if you re sure this is an error i think the best way to fix this is to fix the original source post an issue to or not sure which is better
try one and if you get it wrong they ll tell you

integer	fractions

the standard sleep function operates in integer seconds
you can use the sleep functions from time hires as a drop-in replacement that supports fractions seconds

57011418
post	get

to go in-depth i suggest you visit this blog post about websockets from scratch
here you ll notice some ruby code that you don t have to understand but just get the idea that the bytes are being decoded from the frame and then being read

57011480
prepare	execute

your not using prepare statements correctly
you need to use placeholders and then pass the values in the execute

57011513
children	parent
e can use grid-gap to specify the spacing between the children themselves
this allows we to remove margin and focus on a more declarative layout from the parent element


57011543
factors	mean
it doesn t provide any way to glue bytes together into messages
the actual number of bytes you will receive when you call recv is arbitrary and will depend on all kinds of factors that vary such as the exact implementation of the other side how quickly you got around to calling recv the network s maximum message size and so on
it doesn t mean anything

57011555
post	get

or are they going to submit a form via post
let s look at each one via a link this will issue a get request to your server so you need to handle this via

57011555
post	get

via a form using post body with contain user 1
this will issue a post request to your server so you need to handle your server via on a side note it is important to know that an html can submit either a post or get request

57011985
int	chars
after executing the statement is false
preserve the return type of getchar by doing int c
instead of chars c

57012026
for-loop	loops
so no need to change your code just add line after your for-loop
when you loops it every time you get a string
this is what happen each and every time when you looping

57012495
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
it replaces only first form feed because of using the option pflag which means running the case-sensitive replace without flag g for a non-global replace
but it is necessary to specify also option p with a regular expression string in addition to the regular expression search string specified as first argument for usage of option pflag with empty flag string or with i for a non-global case-insensitive search
in this case the additional regular expression after p is the same as the main search expression just f to match a form feed the first form feed in entire file

57012521
dplyr	sqldf

consider window functions such as rank of which likely dplyr row_number is adopted among other sql semantics like select group_by case_when
sqlite default dialect of sqldf recently added support of window functions in version 3.25.0 september 2018 release

57012621
tidyverse	tidyr

an option would be to replace the duplicated elements by letter to na and then in the reshaped data remove the columns that are all na if we want to use the tidyverse approach a similar option can be used
note that pivot_wider is from the dev version of tidyr tidyr_0.8.3.9000

57012720
hide	show
you can wrap that formula in to hide the #num
error that show up when you run out of matches.


57012878
fadein	hide
probably a way overlap the effects also although not sure that is necessary
i thin the fadein and out require jquery ui and there are some compatibility issues with that
probably should hide first but seems to work

57012907
qspinbox	qobject
assuming your gui is in a class object which is typical for gui you can call self.findchildren qobject where qobject in this case would be the type of object you are looking for
if you are looking for qspinbox objects then you would call self.findchildren qspinbox
this returns a generator object that you would then loop over

57013292
post	put
hat s why as you mentioned the model.predict produces a lot of values because tokenizer has iterated over the characters of post and produced a tf-idf vector for each of them
just put the model.predict in a list and the problem would be resolved


57013310
jar	war

from spring docs do not use the src main webapp directory if your application is packaged as a jar
although this directory is a common standard this directory works only with war packaging and this directory is silently ignored by most build tools when you generate a war

57014563
stdout	stderr
you need use utf8
and binmode stdout encoding utf-8
in your perl script i did the same with stdin and stderr just for consistency the output is correctly aligned |x | | | if i comment out either use utf8

57014719
qtabwidget	qtabbar
n the case of the elimination of a widget added to the qtabwidget this will notify the qtabbar that the qtabbar will be deleted so there are no problems of accessing non-reserved memory
considering the above a possible solution is you can check the qtabbar with the following example as you can see the qtabbar is not necessary to use the attribute qt wa_deleteonclose but if you use the qtabbar the qtabbar would be enough to close the widget

crypt	md5

here is a version with using crypt and a seed starting with makes a sha512 with seed
the comment about not using md5 is a good advice

57014806
crypt	salt

more on using crypt on security sx
be warned that crypt is to be removed from mysql from 8.0.3 and crypt have no salt versions so you need to roll your own salt and sha2 if you want to make a save password in a trigger

folder	directory
the better directory structure might be to just have utils.py in the same folder as your command line scripts or in a subfolder as a module inside a package
that s because the directory of the script when directly executed by the interpreter is always on the module search path


57015081
ssl	https
ince you already have an ssl from host gator you can import that certificate to aws certificate manager instructions here
once you import a certificate you import a certificate is immediately considered validated and you can immediately proceed to configure your eb environments load balancer to terminate https as described here

onclick	preventdefault
using jquery you can get the value of your custom attribute and execute a code during onclick event of your link
use preventdefault to prevent the default functionality of a link


57015807
build.gradle	gradlew
eeing as your build.gradle is simply a script it is not arbitrary to simply import a plugin or task from it
as i have already pointed out and this is from the gradlew docs one of the reasons for having a buildsrc directory is upon discovery of the directory gradlew automatically compiles and tests this code and puts this code in the classpath of your build script

prometheus	metrics
hat prometheus pushgateway does your cron job will emit metrics that must be pushed into prometheus pushgateway
in this architecture what prometheus pushgateway replaces the opencensus prometheus exporter endpoint


57016015
jobs	cron
all you need -- possibly nothing more than curl statements added to your cron jobs -- is something that will generate http requests and ship these to a pushgateway
see then you d configure a prometheus server to scrape the pushgateway endpoint to ingest your cron job metrics

57016125
post	get
f your concurrency is over the limit your request will get throttled and the returned http status code is 429
as some other post already mentioned if you use a function call another function the first function is waiting for the result of the second and your concurrency will be 2

post	get
then lets change your routes to pages route get pagecontroller index

next let s create another blade file to make it easier to manage your table layout

57016362
children	parent
the onintercepttouchevent method is called whenever a touch event is detected on the surface of a viewgroup including on the surface of its children
if onintercepttouchevent returns true the motionevent is intercepted meaning it is not passed on to the child but rather to the ontouchevent method of the parent


57016379
folder	directory
then inside views folder create layouts folder and partials folder
create layout.hbs inside layouts directory
inside this file insert a basic html skeleton and inside the body place this

57016443
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	arrays
then use another arrays to keep track of how many times the character at that index was seen up to that point
insert your characters from s into the table and positioncount table as follows then for each test case all of the above is intuitively faster since there s no inner for-loop
hash table insertion and lookup is o 1 as is each arrays lookup

57016611
for-loop	arrays
so the for-loop will iterate over the empty elements too
instead you can create an arrays using -
also every time the question is set to empty arrays when the button is clicked which will erase already inserted items earlier

57016871
oncreate	recreate
f you require the buttons to be created everytime just call your dynamic button creation code in oncreate
in case you create multiple dynamic buttons you ll need to store the data associated with the buttons by some means retrieve the data associated with the buttons by some means when the app is opened and then recreate the buttons based on the data


57016920
ostream	ostringstream
1 empty constructor default constructor constructs an ostringstream object with an empty sequence as content
internally its ostream base constructor is passed a pointer to a stringbuf object constructed with an argument based on which
so yes

post	get

it sounds like the value post text isnt set in your array
if you are not sure that the array section key you are using exist you should always test for the array section first maybe even check if your array is set if you cant get the correct value then try to var_dump your array to see the type and content hope the array section helps

after that when i go to some url i get nice smooth scrolling to the comment specified in hash part of url
i tried christopher solution but it didn t worked for me

57018233
folder	directory

the issue here is that the google drive rest api uses ids to identify files and folder
the google drive rest api does not provide file or directory pickers which is why you are using android s built-in pickers

57018233
folder	directory
he api does not provide file or directory pickers which is why you are using android s built-in pickers
for instance to allow the user to select a name and destination folder for a new file you can use this intent and create this intent in your activity remember to delete the empty file in case writing the actual content in the second step fails the file pickers identify files by uri and don t know anything about file ids


57018299
padding	overlapping
x86 cpus can efficiently handle overlapping 16-byte stores to work with 12-byte structs like harold s answer shows
cache-line splits probably cost less than the extra memory bandwidth needed to store the padding
or another strategy would be to use separate stores for the floats vs

57018299
128bit	64bit
even avx2 doesn t have very good 2-input lane-crossing shuffles and avx1 is very limited
so we can use 256-bit - 128bit double- float conversion to feed an interleave strategy based on __m128
doesn t cost a shuffle uop on intel cpus just a pure store so shuffling together 2 vectors and getting into a single vector sets us up for two 64bit stores of the low and high halves without any extra shuffling

57018438
inline	inlining
all modern compilers are smart enough to inline small functions and then completely optimize away an if constant
inlining + constant-propagation are what make modern c++ possible to compile efficiently
but if the bool value is not known at compile-time option b is likely more efficient

57018508
valgrind	glibc
however what you observe is a quirk of the implementation you re using which is likely to be glibc - pthreads library glibc implementation re-uses the initially allocated stack for threads - like a cache so that previously allocated stacks can be re-used whenever possible
valgrind simply reports what it sees something was allocated but not de-allocated
but it s not a real leak so you don t need to worry about this

57018623
serializable	deserialization
this can be caused by faulty deserialization or comparison
by default symfony uses the serializable results of getpassword getusername and getsalt from the session to compare against the user provided by the user provider the database
if any of those values changes you are logged out cf

57018885
bash	subshell

if you use bash instead of sh for your commands you can benefit from bash s built-in string transformations here it trims all trailing characters from the class witch includes actual spaces and newlines
if is always an integer you can force the shell to use the shell like an integer with if you are sure that contains no space you can force the shell to trim all spaces by using the shell like a table element you can also use the automatic trimming of a subshell returned value that would trim any leading trailing and duplicate spaces in-between

57018887
inline	inlining

but keep in mind the benchmark data in this answer is from this version which may have stopped some compilers from realizing that the function pointer didn t change between calls and thus could be inline
until the compiler tries inlining the pointed-to member function the compiler won t realize that the function doesn t change the pointer-member of the class editor s note the benchmark numbers for version d probably aren t representative of using it with most loop bodies

57018907
klocwork	coverity
ppcheck occasionally finds some bugs missed by cppcheck but similar in character klocwork and cppcheck rival coverity both find much deeper bugs in c c++ sometimes breathtaking in c c++ depth of analysis
coverity though has been taken over and made little progress in coverity c c++ checkers in the last decade


57019117
super	self

you are incorrectly using the super and this keyword
here is an example of how they work explanation the first log outputs super.name this refers to the prototype chain of the object tom not the object tom self

57019117
super	extends
this method is called from horse class move method with the syntax super.move 45
using the super keyword in this context will look for a move method on the prototype chain which is found on the animal prototype
remember ts still uses prototypes under the hood and the class and extends keywords are just syntactic sugar over prototypical inheritance

57019596
int	chars
the .net framework also includes an unsigned 64-bit int value type uint64 which represents values that range from 0 to 18 446 744 073 709 551 615
so you can safely use int to interate over all the digits of num or nums
also you can rewrite your for loop as follows - as ascii for 0 is 48 so subtracting 48 from chars 0 will give you number 0

57019655
required	placeholder
alternatively you could have a library_init function placeholder name
choose your own that you d required the user to call before using your functions
nonportably there s __attribute __constructor__ on clang gcc which works like the library_init approach but is done automatically on program libary load

57019773
pow	sqrt

in c++ means xor bitwise operation if you want to rise x1-x2 to the power of 2 you can write or use std pow function
so this sqrt x1 - x2 2 + y1 - y2 2

57019862
button	checkbox
uring click of the recyclerview row button check whether checkbox is checked
and if checkbox is checked then write this code yourlist.remove position notifyitemremoved position


57020450
integer	unsigned
when doing a float to integer conversion you have to make sure your scale and offset results in a value in legal range for the destination type
check that -1.0 to 1.0 results in 0 to 256 unsigned byte and out-of-range values are clipped to legal values
also pay attention to the number of samples you convert as an audio unit callback can vary the framecount sent number of samples returned

57020995
put	get
his is the form here s the code code.gs receipts.html global.gs the spreadsheet looks like this note i changed image id to image url so that you can just click on the url to get a viewer to look at the image
i think this is much cleaner than trying to put images of varying sizes into the spreadsheet


57021219
inherited	properties
this method can determine whether the specified properties in an object can be enumerated by a for...in loop with the exception of properties inherited through the prototype chain
if the object does not have the specified properties this method returns false

57021291
super	self

since i was missing the actual solution to get rid of the error for the action button from previous answers i want to add my own to make the button compatible with python 3 we need to remove the buttons keyword from kwargs when calling super
from there you can do whatever you want in the on_config_change self config section key value function in your app class

57021332
post	get
o for your total variable you ll need to do this line instead then you can iterate the total list but you ll also need to recast the total list to the total list original type to get the total list values easier to handle
here is a simple example the output of the above example will be 1 null post 1 null 2 null post 2 null 3 null post 3 null 4 null post 4 null null 1 null productdesc 1 null 2 null productdesc 2 null 3 null productdesc 3


57021407
filesystems	ntfs
therefore when git checks out those files on a case-sensitive filesystems it has two files with different contents
when you copy that to an ntfs drive you can t represent both of those files
you can try copying the repository with cp -fr in an attempt to overwrite the files that already exist but your git repository will always show some files as modified

57021473
post	get	post	put
but your retrofit definition seems to put your parameters into the request body
if your service takes query parameters in a post request then you need to do something like this it seems odd to post something with query parameters but maybe you have good reasons 4 that
by the way you would actually get your client object as a return type this is not the request type

innodb	myisam

myisam and the rest don t seem to work


57022302
folder	directory
 when you type powershell.exe into file explorer s address bar instead the currently open folder is made the working directory before powershell is started and no startup command to change the working directory is passed
in that case already sees the ultimately effective working directory


57022433
for-loop	loops	for-loop	loops
then look at this code you create mynode as a local variable inside the for-loop
that means that each iteration of loops gets a new instance of mynode destroying the previous one
so you ve connected mynode to your linked list through pointers and then you let it get destroyed the next time through the for-loop

57022581
maven	pom.xml

since maven 3.3.1 it s also possible see the note at the very end of using the executions tag section since maven 3.3.1 this is not the case anymore as you can specify on the command line the execution id for direct plugin goal invocation
to execute copy-dependencies execution directly not modifying your pom.xml at all mvn dependency copy-dependencies copy-dependencies note that of the two copy-dependencies separated by the former refers to the plugin goal and the latter refers to the execution id

57022590
int	chars

you are trying to convert a string which can t be converted to a number int double
remove the chars before doing the conversion

57022608
migrate	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
it means that you are using both support libraries and androidx libraries
you can migrate to androidx as described below downgrade your firebase dependencies but it is not a real solution because you have to migrate before or after you can check the official release notes warning this release is a major versioning update and breaking change. the latest update to google play services and firebase includes the following changes migration from android support libraries to jetpack androidx libraries
libraries will not work unless you make the following changes in your app upgrade com.android.tools.build gradle to v3.2.1 or later

57024056
versioning	upgrade
the .net standard comparability matrix has been updated with a footnote for 4.6.1 which reads the versioning listed here represent the rules that nuget uses to determine whether a given .net standard library is applicable
while nuget considers .net framework 4.6.1 as supporting .net standard 1.5 through 2.0 there are several issues with consuming .net standard libraries that were built for those versioning from .net framework 4.6.1 projects
for .net framework projects that need to use such libraries we recommend that you upgrade the project to target .net framework 4.7.2 or higher

ionic	angular
t uses a specific set of classes and they aren t out-of-the-box compatible with angular ionic
ionic will give you a cross-device baseline set of styles so you should really work with ionic to build upon their styles rather trying to fight it with another system


57024625
ionic	angular
s of ionic 4 you also need to decide which front end framework you will use
which front end framework supports angular reach and vue plus no framework at all


57024736
post	get

another possibility is that it s the pressense of the script in the post request so you could try base64-encoding that before it s submitted using javascript using window.btoa data and then decoding it on the php side with base64_decode
you can test whether it s at the mysql level by just commenting out all of that code and seeing if you still get a 403 when submitting the form

57024969
hash	hmac
note hmac sha256 is hash value it cannot be decoded
based on unique secret and unique message generally date-time is used a unique hash is created
client sends this hash value and server generates its own hash value using same algorith if both hash value match then authorization is successful

57024976
dictionary	map
 dictionary will map an input value to an output value so in your case you would map your string to an integer
as an example you would setup a dictionary in a class like so


57025190
folder	directory
fix unfortunately i was not able to empty the deleted items folder on any client or the exchange web access i wrote a little script to delete each item programmatically
after that i created a new outlook profile and restarted outlook in safe mode and voilà suddenly i can now empty the deleted items folder on any client
even the move operation to pst file works as expected - the origin mails are deleted in the source directory

57025587
folder	directory
but with those i realize that it s an issue with linking the directory
i deleted .virtualenvs folder and recreated all virtual envs
open the pycharm again and it works fine

57025683
spaces	delimiter
ted wrigley has his eye on the ball noticing quite rightly that the neatest and most efficient solution is by way of text item delimiter
i defer credit to him for providing in my view the most suitable answer offered thus far to which this is essentially just a follow-up to illustrate that one can achieve identical results with a much more compact two-line handler i also took the liberty of having it clear out all traditional whitespace characters besides spaces tab characters and new-line characters too
you can probably deduce how to remove those options if you so wished

57025862
implements	extends
then the solution may be a wrapper class around smbfile that extends java.io.file
i guess that all you need is to implements getinputstream through the same method of smbfile


57026177
int	chars
in short the sum of two chars become a int
the sum of two short become a int
this should clarify why works but not exactly as you want i suppose your second version of operator+ you have that decltype l.value + r.value is int

57026204
maven	pom.xml

you can create a maven artifact and group if and push to repository
users who is in need of your functionality they can add your dependency in thier pom.xml

57026420
vim	emacs
 think it is because emacs do not have the permission to edit the custom.el this file is read only in emacs
so i use sudo vim .emacs.d custom.el to edit it and it work well


57026527
fixed-point	fractions
he general decimal arithmetic specification and ibm arithmetic manuals suggest this rounding is done in the way that exact fractions part 0.5 shall be rounded away from zero unless least significant result bit becomes 0 or 5 in that case this rounding is rounded toward zero
but if you have no such rounding available a general away-from-zero is also suitable if you are implementing arithmetic for money accounting it is reasonable to avoid floating point at all and use fixed-point arithmetic emulated with integers if needed


57026716

jasmine	mocha

well as you did e2e automation testing previously will surely help you in your e2e unit testing as typescript protractor and jasmine are widely use in frontend browser automation as well as in unit tests
you can unleash your knowledge of end 2 end testing in unit testing with the usage of assertion library mocha and chai

57027528
folder	directory

it should open the folder picker and allow the user to browse and select a folder only the closest thing that android has to something like that is action_open_document_tree
this allows the user to pick a document tree which could be a directory on the filesystem something offered by a cloud storage provider or other document tree structures

this is how to fix it no reinstall of firebase needed as suggested in the linked post delete all created firebase files from users myusername directoy .firebaserc firebase.json index.html and dist-folder run firebase init on project directoy use dist projectname as public directory configure as a single-page app yes do not overwrite index.html if you do make sure to ng build again before deploying firebase deploy by the way for everyone who is using angular 7 this tutorial about deploying an angular 7 app to firebase hosting was really helpfull to me


57028181
move	drag
the thing is that if you rely on mouse drag event which is only triggered when the mouse move you won t be able to paint on the wheel by keeping your mouse static as shown in your reference demo
so you would better keep track of the mouse position by listening to a mouse move event and draw on each frame adding the last mouse position to the current path only when drawing of course
better than a thousand words here is a sketch demonstrating how this can be achieved

57028211
post	put

if you want to use pathvariable you have to do something like this you usually write post method without variables at the end
for such scenarios you should use put - i m not sure if you can return plain integer as a response but you could optionally wrap your integer into string - string.valuof id

57028212
mouse	keyboard
he default action occurs when the user clicks the element with a mouse but the user also occurs when the user focuses the element and hits enter or space and when the element is triggered via the accessibility api
you have no possibility to detect that the element has been done by from a screenreader from a keyboard or from an eye tracking device

results are similar to google-chrome and i am not surprised as opera is based on chromium and blink it turns out every browser has it own implementation details apart opera which is based on google-chrome s chromium and blink


57029051
folder	directory

another approach would be that you designate a folder in your web host that is accessible via your site url
for example - file 9d6fdb34-f92f-4078-9ab3-e5ada4522f2e.pdf is physically stored in your cloud host local folder which can be any where like var files but your webserver points to this directory when user enter and a reference to this file can be stored in a mysql along with other metadata example for your case - file_guid 9d6fdb34-f92f-4078-9ab3-e5ada4522f2e file_name binarysearch file_extension pdf user_id 123 if applicable in the user interface your users see binarysearch.pdf text which link to when you store this file to the var files if your users are uploading files always rewrite the file name as a unique uuid but store the file name they uploaded in your database as i specified above

folder	dir

sounds like you want to pull your repository into a clean folder remove everything and add the new code if you are sure everything is ok you can delete the copy of the new code
a better idea in my opinion if you want both revisions in the same place is to branch off from the initial commit after you cd d to the clone dir then continue from the cp line

57029076
folder	dir
a better idea in my opinion if you want both revisions in the same place is to branch off from the initial commit after you cd d to the clone dir then continue from the cp line
this also has the benefit that you can use your existing folder you init d - just stash your code pull the master branch checkout the first commit branch off and pop

filtering	grouping
also it can work together with having clause to filtering grouping
the top n clause applies to each grouping

versioning	upgrade
create-react-app supports css modules right out of the box as of versioning 2 which is now stable
upgrade to v2 react-scripts latest by running yarn upgrade react-scripts latest
you just have to create a file with the extension .module.css for example then you can use it like so to read more -

division	subtract

use integer division to calculate the size of the first part the destination arrays must be created with the right length before calling array.copy
dim sortie separator - 1 as byte dim sortie2 bytes_executable.length - separator - 1 as byte note that since in vb we specify the upper bound of the array index and not the length of the array we must subtract 1

tinyint	boolean
also mysql will choke on t and z in datetime literals . instead of varchar 7 use tinyint unsigned
this will let you use boolean operations shift operations and the bit_count function
see . these should facilitate the desired computations

pdcurses	ncurses

it has even a windows alternative pdcurses that has identical syntax

57030145
for-loop	loops	for-loop	loops
j is reset with every loops run in your code
for1000 a for-loop is repeated as long as the condition in statement 2 is true
in the for-j-loop the condition is never true when entering loops so loops is never executed

57030361
division	addition
the reason why the difference is not very obvious is due to the for-loop taking time
using timeit from this is is clear that multiplication is about 3 times faster than division
in addition the for-loop itself is taking much more time than the multiplication or the division ops

57030406
for-loop	loops

this is because you are waiting for a keypress each iteration of the for-loop
it is designed to show one bounding rect per loops and wait for a keypress until you open a new window

57030481
for-loop	if-statement

see my comment below in the for-loop this code ..
is semantically equivalent to this so this statement happens both when the if-statement is true and when the if-statement is false

folder	directory
and the reason was the resource was in the not on the classpath of the test class package so when i added the cfg folder to my classpath path entry in eclipse and set the output directory in the build conf to the same class package the issue was resolved
when you try this approach just make sure the classpath conf file shows the classpath entry of the resource directory eg
cfg

hive	hdfs
emrfs makes s3 look like hdfs or the local filesystem
this is then used by many of the applications in the hadoop ecosystem such as spark and hive
for example this is how you would use emrfs to read from s3 in spark

np-hard	np-complete
the hamiltonian cycle problem is still np-complete when restricted to grid graphs of max degree 3 as proven in christos h papadimitriou umesh v vazirani on two geometric problems related to the travelling salesman problem journal of algorithms volume 5 issue 2 june 1984 pages 231-246 issn 0196-6774
thus your problem is np-hard


57032113
post	get
t also eliminates the need to add the trailing 0 the lack of which caused the problem your post was originally about
unless you use this function in a tight loop somewhere this function s unlikely to be a huge deal performance-wise but every little bit helps and you should get in the habit of writing for this optimization anyway because this optimization s also usually good programming practice to do so

the problem with using npm or yarn commands is that there is a chance that the versioning that is re-added is a different versioning than the one that is currently used

57032791
addition	multiplication
if however we were to want to do something different for the x and y values the memory layout becomes problematic for simd x y x y x y x y + + + + x y x y x y x y if you consider for example the multiplication case suddenly the operations are jumping between simd lanes which is pretty much going to kill any decent vectorization
take a quick look at this godbolt addition boils down to some vaddps instructions working on 8 floats at a time
multiply ends up using vfmadd231ss and vmulss which both work on 1 float at a time

57032887
put	get
if you try to assign a key which is not a string it will be cast to a string before being put onto the object
see what happens when you try to turn a set into a string no matter what the set contains when cast to a string you get
so as expected if you want to use non-string keys you should use a map whose keys can be any value at all and not just strings

57032893
filtering	grouping
you can check if you have a grouping policy applied to your machine by running from an administrative command prompt gpresult v you can search the output for powershell to find powershell related grouping policies that may be applied to the system by a system administrator
you can check if if configured a setting of 8 full language mode. this could be configured in registry hklm system currentcontrolset control session manager environment__pslockdownpolicy if you can t find what is locking down powershell launch procmon and set a filtering operation is regqueryvalue include process name is powershell.exe include process name is powershell_ise.exe include result is success and launch powershell you can look through the keys that are loaded and check the details column for what the value is set to
through this approach you can identify anything registry configuration locking down powershell

free	calloc	free	memset	calloc	malloc	memset	malloc
the onus is on the calling code to check that a null pointer is not returned. alternatively you could also use memset to zero the data provided by malloc but using calloc will do that at least as efficiently
continuing to use malloc copiously change the type of struct schedule to note that this uses a lot more memory there is overhead for each allocation and the structure is a lot harder to free you need 49 calls to free instead of just 1
style guide always check that memory allocation functions report success before using the result

factors	mean
then we can convert the one column into a factors and translate m and b into numerical labels
now we coerce to numeric calculate the products and finally may easily calculate the mean divided by 1e9 using american billions

fflush	gets
when the page fault handler returns and clflush gets re-executed the target cache line gets fflush
on intel processors rdtscp ensures that the line is fflush before the first load in the loop is issued
therefore the first load misses in the cash hierarchy and its latency would be about that of a memory access

width	height

the reason for the problem is that the border width of the container is not taken into account
to take the border width of the container into account totalspacex and totalspacey must be determined as follows the figure on the left shows a container height and width of 492 each taking the border width of the container into account

spaces	delimiter

a class can have spaces separated classes and id needs to be unique
you are not actually allowed spaces but the browser allows a class anyway so spaces in the classname are handled the browser is expected to have spaces delimiter classes the id with spaces has the spaces as part of the id - it is tolerated by the browser if you use the spaces in accessing the browser

aggregate-functions	sum
this creates one group for each of the distinct values of orderdate and you can then use the aggregate-functions sum to get each sum for each group so for you that s the sum of price for each date
if you do not supply a group by orderdate you just get the sum across all rows
that said you are currently injecting variables directly into the query which should be avoided by using a prepared statement

57036778
button	checkbox
 checkbox or a radio button is not a character so it will not be recognized by an ocr
you can still give a try to a custom vision detector to find those items but it will be a bit complicated as this service will only find those items in your document and you will have to combine with an ocr call to get the text then try to match the zones in your document to know which text is associated with which combo radio button

57038393
width	height

here is an idea that rely on skew transformation where it will be responsive and you will have transparency if you want to keep the same width for the arrow you can consider a different idea using background and with svg too you can also optimize the code and do the code without pseudo element the same svg can be used to obtain the first result where the arrow width is also dynamic
the trick is to only define the height and preserve the ratio you can easily add a coloration inside too

fast-forward	merge
since git doesn t particularly mind whether a branch is on the left or right of a merge for that matter there can be more than two parents pointing source at that commit is the same as performing the merge the other way around
this would have been a valid fast-forward push even if your client wasn t misconfigured to always force

class-method	delegation
ut at the base is the sqlalchemy.sql.default_comparator module where or_ and and_ are indirectly mapped to class-method of sqlalchemy.sql.elements.booleanclauselist producing an instance of that class
the booleanclauselist._construct method is responsible for handling grouping there by delegation to .self_group methods on the two clauses this passes in operator.or_ or operator.and_ and so lets each operand decide if each operand need to use a grouping instance based on precedence

setinterval	clearinterval

setinterval returns a unique id
so when you want it to stop you will just call clearinterval intervalid if you want to call it in the function itself you need to just have the correct conditional to monitor when you want it to stop it you would need to reference the global or scoped identifier

post	get

i see few things here your component is guild.js but you are rendering you are setting state to post but using this.state.guilds to render the components you are overriding that piece of state each time to the last object in the snapshot with the way you are mapping the firestore data you are setting the ids in the list wrong using doc.id instead of doc.data .id you aren t mapping guilds to render
guilds is an array of guild objects so you should do something like these are few things to fix and then try to console.log this.state.guilds before rendering and see if you get the right data

57043720
lxml	python-docx
you can use python-docx to access the xml directly while still leaving the details of proper saving or re-packaging to python-docx
if you re using lxml you can get the xml for the document part as an lxml.etree._element object using document._element
whatever changes you make to that xml tree will be saved when you call document.save

put	get

iiuc i is index column and you want to put in bins and averaging the other columns
so you can use pd.cut then new_df is t m3 m4 0 43564.844 nan nan 1 43564.864 306.811625 -1.212687 2 43564.884 nan nan 3 43564.904 nan nan 4 43564.924 306.861750 -1.170584 5 43564.944 306.838482 -1.024283 which you can merge with df1 on t and get m1 m2 t m3 m4 0 0.556529 6.863255 43564.8 nan nan 1 0.556558 6.863277 43564.9 306.811625 -1.212687 2 0.556556 6.863276 43564.9 nan nan 3 0.556570 6.863287 43564.9 nan nan 4 0.556557 6.863277 43564.9 306.861750 -1.170584 5 0.556532 6.863257 43564.9 306.838482 -1.024283

create a uibutton
disable user interaction on the button

57044318
folder	dir
name cannot create a new file directory or folder
note that last line name cannot create a new file directory or folder. hence you ll need to first ensure that the target folder exists before attempting to move the file
for this you can use a combination of the dir function and mkdir function

57044543
multiplying	multiplication
textbook rsa enables multiplication that is if you multiplying two the ciphertexts then decrypt you will get the multiplication of the plaintexts
so if you want to multiplication of your data on the cloud just send your data encrypted with rsa
rsa only multiplies but there is no other operation and this called partially homomorphic

57045039
hex	binary
ncoding the binary data to a string will garble the binary data unless you encode the binary data in something like base64 or hex encoding
you can simply keep the chunks as buffers then concatenate all the buffers before writing the binary data to your file or you can take advantage of stream piping and let the stream do the work for you on the client side a request would look like this


57045089
strlen	strcpy
however what is preventing the program to run at least is the lack of space of each of the locations
you just reserve space for one character malloc sizeof char but you have to reserve space for the whole string that afterwards is copied plus the ending 0 malloc strlen c + 1
also take into account that using strlen strcpy etc

57045104
next	except

in practice the real bytecode within a function would be more like 1 0 load_fast 0 i 2 load_const 0 1 4 inplace_add 6 store_fast 0 i each of those instructions requires either a run through a switch statement or a computed goto depending on how cpython was compiled loading the next instruction and updating code position information it also involves repeatedly checking to ensure no other thread is asking for the gil
load_fast and load_const instructions involve a c array lookup and reference count adjustment a single reference count adjustment alone is equivalent to the i++ from before except the i++ has to change memory not a register so it s slower

57045104
for-loop	loops	for-loop	loops
for demonstration of the difference in bytecode complexity consider a function that does nothing but run a loops with either while and a manual counter or for and range disassembling each function shows for whileloop and try it online
for for-loop
the body of loops the stuff executed once per pass including testing the termination condition for the while runs from the load_fast following the setup_loop to the jump_absolute encompassing nine instructions per loops

57045366
for-loop	loops
by doing that you imply that it s optional when in reality it needs to be there or the for-loop will never execute
likewise with dic_test since you already know how the keys are constructed the index plus _id construct the key in the same fashion to do the lookup or as a dict comprehension this way you are just leveraging the dictionary api directly which is fast and readable while avoiding unnecessary loops


57045471
ssl	https
you can install a wildcard ssl certificate to enable ssl for all services mapped to domains included in the wildcard ssl certificate
for more information see enabling https
you can map multiple custom domains to the same cloud run service such as example.com or www.example.com

57045872
integer	unsigned

the win32 dword is a 32 bit integer but the c# ulong is a 64 bit integer
the confusion stems from the fact that dword is an alias for unsigned long but the c++ long isn t necessarily 64 bits in fact in msvc the c# ulong s 32 bits

57045925
min	max
create a mutable class minmax for storing the min
and max
index

57045925
min	max

create a for storing the min
and max

57045925
min	max
for each value in a find all divisors for and update the map accordingly such that the minmax object stores the min
and max
i of the number with that particular divisor

57045925
min	max
the min
and max
values of that entry is your answer

57045976
for-loop	loops
you are potentially getting the error from your for-loop declaration
you are providing a predetermined exactly 31 iterations for that loops
to alleviate this error you will have to have 31 elements in each of your arrays

57046045
division	modulo

sas provides the mod function which takes the remainder after division by a number
this is similar to the modulo in many other programming languages which does the same thing

57046105
google-chrome	safari
also i m pretty sure you have to set touch-action none on relevant elements to avoid the browser intercepting touches for default pan zoom etc
example css js works in google-chrome at least
not so much in mobile safari 13 beta though.

57046150
submit	submission
his also appeared to me while i was submission my solution
the best way to deal with this is don t run your script on online ide rather directly submit your script


57046707
hex	binary
f i understand correctly you are passing hex strings as a first argument to bn_bin2bn whereas you are supposed to pass binary data such as
so you need first to convert binary data to get proper results


57046783
put	get

you need to put single quotes around the pack uri
the xaml parser doesn t realize you re trying to set source to all of that so you get errors

57047273
google-chrome	firefox
his will affect chromium and firefox as chromium and firefox are using the system freetype which on debian 9 appears to be based on 2.6.3
this should not affect google-chrome since this ships this own version of freetype


57047337
width	margin
he image in question is being used in a page header which is using squarespace s imageloader to scale the image so that the image in question fills the space based on the text font size and the padding margin around the text
this is a feature of squarespace and you can see this in action by changing the browser width and watching the viewable part of the image change along with this


57047676
robocopy	xcopy
ere s a way with xcopy  there s also robocopy but that would be too powerful for a simple task like this
i ve used that for entire drive backups because this can use multi-threading but let us focus on xcopy


57047699
tiff	png
se a tiff file to do this you d be surprised how similar the metadata works between tiff and png these days
once you do this use whatever tool you have to read the camera maker data from a tiff file


57047729
prepare	execute

to insert data into mysql with pdo you need to use prepare statements
execute should not be used for inserting data

57047740
folder	directory
it s the root directory that has a hidden version control folder correct
all the version data is stored inside the root s .git folder
i found git-archive that makes a zip just use the builtin git archive tool for that

57048208
geocoding	geocode
places autocomplete is designed to return place predictions based on the user input and perceived relevance
while the geocoding api is designed to convert a single string address to coordinates and vice versa
you can use this geocode tool to test this

57048212
put	get

on other frames this optimization wasn t applied because the line wasn t exactly vertical or horizontal or it was applied but just happened to put the points on different pixels
i think for applications like this where pme wants full control it s best to have all smart optimization turned off or one get quirks like this

57048332
for-loop	loops

the first part of a for-loop is a normal declaration just like the one above where you declare and define multiple vectors in one line
write the type only once you also have an error in loops condition use instead of the because otherwise this is a comma operator whose result is only the last part

57048533
hid	keyboard

a hid device specifies how a hid device data should be interpreted by providing a structure called the hid report descriptor
it seems your app is using a report descriptor designed to simulate a keyboard rather than a gamepad which is why you re seeing keystrokes instead of gamepad button inputs

57048533
hid	keyboard
it seems your app is using a report descriptor designed to simulate a keyboard rather than a gamepad which is why you re seeing keystrokes instead of gamepad button inputs
you can find more information about the hid report descriptor in the device class definition for hid v1.11
the hid specification defines numeric values called usages that represent the intended purpose of a device

oncreate	setcontentview

you can try this in oncreate
case r.id.dialog_button_accept accept setcontentview r.layout.activity_main

57049212
google-chrome	firefox
other options the following only works on firefox
tested on google-chrome and it flickers when pointer is moved - but could perhaps give some ideas
instead of setting pointer-events on the input-element directly set it using the hover pseudo-class

57049296
for-loop	arrays

then you can write your for-loop note that the only change being made is to the model so the rest of your code stays the same but must be included within the for-loop
another note is that the carr and degreearr will only be tested with the carr and degreearr matching indexes in the arrays because it is not being done with a double for-loop

57049348
prometheus	metrics
 think the answer to your question is that over time if prometheus is configured to scrape the pushgateway endpoint that s receiving your code s pushed metrics it will be building time-series of the metrics for you to query|graph
prometheus includes prometheus own querying|graphing functionality that you may use to test this hypothesis and prove this to yourself


57049435
for-loop	loops

i have experimented and found that replacing the for-loop with try except block below sped up the computation by a third
the except is used for the very first loops to populate the dataframe with the new columns with out it there would be a mismatch error

57049577
superclass	subclassing

answer since arrayadapter class has no default constructor we need to define a constructor that matches one of the six constructors in the superclass
you can read more about this here not every constructor is being inherited by a subclassing

57049577
superclass	subclassing
there are lots of articles which describe the exact behavior of constructors in subclassing
answer in this case if no default constructor is present in the superclass


57049751
post	put
remote authoring semantics put patch delete really don t fit well with a single actions endpoint
post does a bit better in that the constraints are minimal
to some degree posting everything to a single endpoint reduces http from an application protocol to a transport protocol

imageview	picasso

if you need to display an image from a url in an imageview i recommend you to use an image loading and caching libraries
some well-known ones are glide and picasso

post	get

on analysis we find that the bootstrap version in is 3.1.1 the bootstrap version from the stackoverflow example was unknown post was dated 2015 but there was an update which referred to this page we see that classes nav-pills nav-fill are available in bs4.
to get the pills from the navigation on nav-pills nav-fill each separate line we can write some css ourselves working snippet on bootstrap 4.3.1 below

57050445
for-loop	loops
here each a is in a scalar context and returns only the index not the value at that index
since we re in a for-loop we have the value in _ already
the same mechanism is often used in a while-each loops

57050462
put	get
i suggest you not to do that as you ll get unexpected results
for example if you put it as the first fname being column name and the second one a parameter it ll be as if you wrote disregard nulls for this example
precede parameters names with p_ or whatever you find appropriate

57050636
button	checkbox
you can use the event.target.checked handle change method to track the selected checkbox store them in the state
on click of add checked button dispatch the action and send the entire selected list to the reducer
hope this helps

57050792
x86	64bit
ut at least since msvc 2017 least since msvc 2017 includes user mode for desktop applications ntdll.lib libraries for x86 and arm in both 32bit and 64bit varieties
this might require the windows 10 wdk to be installed just search your c program files x86 for ntdll.lib and you should find ntdll.lib


57050966
abstract-class	superclass

nsproxy is a abstract-class
apple docs about nsproxy says an abstract superclass defining an api for objects that act as stand-ins for other objects or for objects that don t exist yet

57051614
width	height

your image has a width of 3980
using height auto height auto will display your image in full height and scale the width anchored to 3980px

57051832
shadowing	named
while the module my_class is imported it will not be assigned a variable in your local scope and hence you will not be shadowing it by using my_class for your myclass instance
update when importing a module within the same package it looks like a reference is added to the local scope however there is no risk in using the same named
variables in python are references to an object rather than the object

57051891
int	double
double used to minimize risk of rounding errors
year in now represented as a int instead of a float thanks to the data structure used


57051981
post	get

though this is a very old post i d like to answer my solution here as well
to get errors of model validations just use the

57052043
for-loop	loops
o from the perspective of the for-loop the for-loop will run synchronous
so yes the await keyword has the effect of blocking the running function until the async function either resolves with a value or rejects with an error but it does not block the javascript engine which can still do other things if it has other things to do while awaiting yes the execution of loops will be sequential there is an awesome tutorial about all this at


57052167
ggplot2	gtable

there is a solution with the grid package which is the package ggplot2 uses to draw the plots
first i would make the small adjustment to your plotting code by also setting the plot background colour to black next we convert the g to a gtable and draw the g with the grid package the problem is that many coord-functions set a fixed aspect ratio for the plot which will in turn affect other plot elements that are defined in absolute dimensions

57052247
put	get
get it working in proper iis instead
one thing to check the error method tells you that the particular method you re accessing does not support put
this doesn t mean that the put verb is not enabled in config

57052707
folder	directory
owever you can create .gitignore or .gitkeep or any other hidden file in folder and add it
as per git documentation currently the design of the git index staging area only permits files to be listed and nobody competent enough to make the change to allow empty directory has cared enough about this situation to remedy empty directory


57052780
for-loop	arrays

you cannot put a for-loop inside an object like that
you can pass events as an arrays to calendar s config edit if you want dynamic events you can also pass a function

57053743
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops

i think what you may want to do is move the print code line into your inner for-loop but then again you would just be better off printing x c if this is what you re trying to do
if what you want is to display the elements within array1 after the inner for-loop has completed filling -loop and before -loop is added to arrays then you will need to iterate through the collection if you want to print each element within the arrays list then you need to do the same thing with yet another loops

57053779
folder	directory
 think given your problem description for my package i want to run a test script which exists in my package depends on my package and which needs to be run in the parent directory of the location my package is located in you probably want something like this test imports - ludosim source_files - tests test_ludo.py - tests runtest.py requires - pytest commands - pytest tests this should copy the given source_files from your source folder into the test directory then install pytest then run pytest tests
i m not sure if i ve interpreted your directory requirement correctly but your test commands can include any number of calls to pushd or similar to move around to where you need to be


57053895
memcached	apc
please take a look here this script will automatically installs nginx create virtual server block for nginx installs php php apc php curl etc
supports php fast process manager php-fpm installs memcached installs database mariadb mysql optionally installs php composer and laravel configures and strengthens ssh activates firewall optionally enables swap space in do server and fixes a locale issue


57053977
getter	setter
ou can call your encrypt method before the execution of setter method and pass the encrypted value to your setter
for the decryption you run your encrypt method after the execution of the getter method


57054037
pull	push
push worked within xcode this way
hopefully pull works as well


57054302
screens	tablet
by dividing all sizes by the pixel ratio you are converting dips to regular pixels
if your widget sizes are defined in regular pixels you will find that your layout will vary a lot depending on screens resolution which is likely not what you want
your container is now configured to be 100 pixels wide and 200 pixels tall on a tablet with a resolution of 2560x1600

57055267
multiplying	subtract

here i am multiplying the count by 60000 as time differences are in milliseconds because it is casting it to int
then finally we subtract the min and max time for each value and divide the min and max time for each value by the above counts

57055368
children	parent

every time you remove a child there is one less elements in the children array so a loop like will make j too big at some point
prefer a code structured like this note that in order to wipe out the content of a parent node you might prefer the more simpler

57055653
sudo	passwd

it is rarely a good idea to have sudo inside scripts
instead remove sudo inside scripts from the script and run the script itself with sudo sudo myscript.sh that way all commands within the script itself will be run with root privileges and you only need to give the passwd once when launching the script itself

57056236
inherited	properties

cbcentralmanager and cbperipheralmanager inherited from cbmanager
as of ios 13 cbmanager has an authorization properties

57056387
for-loop	loops

it was because the first column was done outside of the for-loop
after commenting this out and changing loops to i got this to work as expected

57056402
inherited	subclassing

don t change the method signatures use inherited to implement a single class for each source you have
in this case you can inject the corresponding subclassing matching your source

57056601
countdowntimer	chronometer

try replacing this new countdowntimer timer timer with this new countdowntimer timer 1000 you can put other value in place of 1000 but make sure it is less than timer value else ontick will get called only once
also check out chronometer if your task is suited to this

57056608
getter	setter
the reason is that the getter and the setter may have different types
for example edittext has editable getter now kotlin creates a synthetic property text of the type editable


57056997
inherited	properties
additionally you need to set the correct table for both objects and you need to add some of virtual properties so that entity framework can handle these types as it would any of your other classes
now your dbcontext no longer has to inherited from identitydbcontext


57057054
imageview	picasso
add this into your build.gradle file inside dependecies implementation com.squareup.picasso picasso 2.5.2 try this line of code if you re using older version for example v.2.4.0 picasso.get context .load imageurl .into imageview
add this into your build.gradle file inside dependecies implementation com.squareup.picasso picasso 2.4.0


57057565
post	get
however if you are worried about that fraction of the time when a cdn might be down you can load bootstrap from one bootstrap cdn and fallback to an alternative cdn in case the first one is down
about your second concern the links in this post are hard coded versions of bootstrap and jquery
so even if the bootstrap and jquery libraries are constantly developed and get new features your site will stay the same over time

57057975
maven-jar-plugin	pom.xml
download the pom.mustache template from this link to that folder
edit the downloaded pom.mustache and update the maven-jar-plugin version and configuration as required
in your pom.xml specify the path to the codegen-templates folder in the parameter now swagger codegen will generate pom.xml based on your custom pom.mustache template

57058155
jar	war	jar	manifest.mf	war	manifest.mf
his is because the t option of jar only lists the files in the war file and does not extract the files in the war file
then piping the list of files into cat meta-inf manifest.mf causes the error message because the war file does not exist because the war file was never extracted


57058223
filtering	grouping
his means that length mpg in the above code will return the length of the mpg column vector of each grouping separately
to invert the logic the logic s enough to invert the filtering condition

range	max

try this adjusting range to suit
find the relative position of the max in row 2 1 and return the corresponding element in row 1 rate1

57059008
inherited	subclassing
one of my favorite things about python is at the deepest level its consistency - everything is an object and all objects are basically hashmaps with names pointing to a references
python s idea of duck typing works not because the underlying c code has any idea of inherited but because the code just looks for an attribute with the right name and if it finds one it uses it
subclassing in python then are the same as above - a new python object that initializes itself from the top down adding more and more fields to the hashmap as it gets closer to the bottom

57059203
folder	directory
hanging the project folder to an rstudio project solved the issue
an rstudio project sets an rstudio project own working directory using the local path for each user so replaces the network path with a local lettered path


57059363
comparator	comparable
one example could be then use the comparator as collections.sort arraylist new classcomparator
an alternative way to do the same thing is to implement comparable interface in class class then call collections.sort arraylist


57059505
min	max
edit it the number to be 2048 this increases the max heap size to about 2 gigabits
as your min size is about 1 gigabit


57059723
inline	constexpr
an inline static data member may be defined in the class definition and may specify a brace-or-equal-initializer
if the member is declared with the constexpr specifier it may be redeclared in namespace scope with no initializer this usage is deprecated
see depr.static.constexpr

57059723
constexpr	inline-functions
a function or static data member declared with the constexpr or consteval specifier is implicitly an inline-functions or variable dcl.inline
if any declaration of a function or function template has a constexpr or consteval specifier then all its declarations shall contain the same specifier
emphasis mine

57060113
flatmap	concatmap

you can use flatmap where fetchdatafromremoteservice a a return publisher
or you can use flux#concatmap the difference between flatmap and concatmap will be that in the second case all actions will follow each other

57060229
put	get
f you have the possibility i would try to put a content delivery network cdn in between the server and client so that the cdn can offload the down- and upload to an edge server that is close to your physical location
if this isn t possible you get be creative and for example have a second server in the uk that synchronizes t with the files located on the server in the us

put	get

in the if-match header you can t just put you need to put there the etag of the page
in your first get call use invoke-webrequest instaed of invoke-restmethod now in the response you will get also headers response and there the etag exist now the second invoke-restmethod will work to update the page

57060544
openacc	pgi
you might try setting the environment variable pgi_acc_debug 1 for pgi or cray_acc_debug 1 for cray to have the runtime print detailed information
not sure if gnu has an equivalent env variable for their openacc implementation
if you need more help investigating please provide a small reproducing example and we can see if we can determine what s wrong

57060645
for-loop	loops
i believe the range based for-loop in this case roughly translates to something like this side note ach
it hurts to calculate my_array + 1000 and each loops
that s like 3 operations done each loops

57060827
installation	upgrade
as such no binary installers are provided and windows users are instead expected to have upgrade to 3.7 already
if you still feel you want to compile python 3.6.9 then the readme.rst file includes installation instructions for unix linux bsd macos and cygwin and for windows points you to a dedicated file on windows see pcbuild readme.txt
which can be found online at

versioning	upgrade
kubectl -n kube-system get configmap kubelet-config-1.15 maybe your master is at versioning 1.14 and your new node downloaded a kubelet versioning 1.15. in that case your configmap didn t exists and you have a configmap kubelet-config-1.14. upgrade your master node to v 1.15 or install kubernetes v1.14 into your worker node
you can see what versioning your nodes are with kubectl get nodes root master # k get nodes name status roles age versioning master ready master 32d v1.14.0 node6 ready 32d v1.14.2 nodo2 ready 32d v1.14.2


57061056
folder	directory

the solution is to use a .yarnrc file in your root project folder next to your package.json
add this line to .yarnrc # install modules in the specified location --modules-folder  client note if you already have a node_modules folder feel free to delete a node_modules folder after creating .yarnrc and follow a node_modules folder by running yarn install for all your packages to be downloaded again into your target directory

57061059
post	get
you could easily adapt this to use a list of urls generated by using wget to crawl your site or simply post them as wget crawls your site
i plan to do this if i get push-back from marketing about using node nodeid urls
this particular shell script is slow enough that i didn t even need to throw in a delay

where i think you re going wrong is with your for-loop structure
to see this let s break down what s happening on each loops in order to prevent this problem you should use nested for loops


57061088
post	get

you are using post method for passing login credentials at android side
while at php side you first check whether it s a post request and then try to get parameters with a get request

subtraction	addition	subtraction	addition	subtraction	add	subtraction	add
use overflow exor carry out add sub to determine overflow for both unsigned addition and unsigned subtraction using 2 s complement addition for single interpretation
in unsigned addition overflow is indicated by carry out 1 correct result is indicated by carry out 0 but add sub 0 is for addition so anyway overflow is indicated by 1
similarly in unsigned subtraction overflow is indicated by carry out 0 correct result is indicated by carry out 1 but add sub 1 is for subtraction so anyway overflow is indicated by 1

57061199
subtraction	add
similarly in unsigned subtraction overflow is indicated by carry out 0 correct result is indicated by carry out 1 but add sub 1 is for subtraction so anyway overflow is indicated by 1
thus we can have single interpretation for overflow in both unsigned addition and unsigned subtraction


57061207
put	get

yes you could put launch arguments in your scheme edit scheme - run - arguments that will only be applied when launching from xcode if launching from tapping on the app icon or downloaded from app store these launch arguments will not be present so you will be able to tell if the app is launched from xcode or not
you can get a launch argument by going

57061407
daemons	systemd

you need to allow non distributable artifacts by setting the allow-nondistributable-artifacts option in the daemons configuration json file
for linux create or update the docker daemons json file with the above option at etc docker daemon.json for windows right click on docker icon in the systemd tray and select settings select the daemons tab enable advanced option if disabled add the option allow-nondistributable-artifacts into the json like replace localhost with the name of your own server name

57061529
serializable	deserialization

i m not sure and am just speculating but it doesn t look like the serializableobject is being populated until after the dictionary that was serializable in this case dict has added the serializableobject is being populated
it does seem like you can get around the issue by having serializableobject implement iserializable and provide your own getobjectdata and deserialization constructor

57061669
tidyverse	stringr

a tidyverse way.
library stringr the output of below will return you list.

57061689
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops

the above problem was having issues because the for-loop took all items in first line as one item which is why .split was best solution of .split
to read follow working code and then later implement another loops to access the model.vector function vector representation derived from model.vector will be saved in numpy arrays named vec_of_all_seq

57061709
folder	directory
ou might also find it in some kind of share folder
if you don t find it nested somewhere in your gdal directory try searching your system for the proj.db file and if you find your system for the proj.db file set your gdal directory not the full file path as your proj_lib value reboot and see if things start working


57061884
put	get
he .basename is easy to get to use .split on
then one can use -join to put the .basename back into one basename finally add the extension onto one basename


57062263
post	get
django s login form is returned using the post method in which the browser bundles up the form data encodes it for transmission sends it to the server and then receives back its response
get by contrast bundles the submitted data into a string and uses this to compose a url
the url contains the address where the data must be sent as well as the data keys and values

57062263
post	get	post	get
get and post are typically used for different purposes
any request that could be used to change the state of the system - for example a request that makes changes in the database - should use post
get should be used only for requests that do not affect the state of the system

57062263
post	get
post coupled with other protections like django s csrf protection offers more control over access
on the other hand get is suitable for things like a web search form because the urls that represent a get request can easily be bookmarked shared or resubmitted


57062364
selenium	appium
es you can use selenium web driver for web application testing and appium for native app testing
since you have some programming experience you would be able to set selenium web driver up and use selenium web driver fairly quickly


57062549
entities	entitymanager
f you wish the entitymanager to be cleared automatically you can set the modifying annotation s clearautomatically attribute to true
fortunately starting from spring boot 2.0.4.release spring data added flushautomatically flag to auto flush any managed entities on the persistence context before executing the modifying query check reference so the safest way to use modifying is btw spring data docs has not updated btw spring data docs docs yet with this


57062775
internationalization	translation

answer google is trying to help you with internationalization but we need to understand why this is failing
building off of ninjacat s answer we assume that google s reads and predicts the language of your website using an n-gram algorithm -- so we can we say exactly why google s wants to translation your page

57062775
n-gram	words
uilding off of ninjacat s answer we assume that google reads and predicts the language of your website using an n-gram algorithm -- so we can we say exactly why google wants to translate your page
we can only assume that there are words on your page that belong to a different language


57063490
fseek	fgetc
also don t use magic numbers in fseek you should use seek_cur not 1
finally function fgetc returns an int type not chars
this allows eof to be distinguished from the data byte 0xff

57063767
inherited	properties
t is not a getter setter even though it behaves like one and it is not inherited from array.prototype
each array instance has it own .length data properties which shadows your getter setter on gcflist.prototype


57063803
for-loop	loops
i is the value of the each of the elements of the dictionary
instead of a list comprehension you could continue to use a for-loop the use of items might be a bit clearer here
each iteration of loops fetches both the key and value from shop_items

57063897
for-loop	loops
ou can do this in your for-loop instead
then you would generate the hashcode only once at the end of loops instead of doing the hashcode in each loops


57064102
post	get	post	put
if you want to only see post requests you can use method post
this will filter out get put and so on


57064287
for-loop	arrays

you don t really need second for-loop
just check the word i is in the letter arrays or not and you can do the letter arrays by using includes or indexof

57064343
for-loop	loops
this covers all numbers since all numbers are either more than 5 or less than or equal to 100
this means that the for-loop will run forever as the check will always be true
you then have a manual check after each loops that checks if is greater than 500

57064405
post	get

shamelessly stolen from this post from vadzim
you should be able to get the format you re looking for by using this pattern rtrim to_char num fm999999999999990.99 . select rtrim to_char 0 00235 fm999999999999990.99999 . from dual select rtrim to_char 156 45623 fm999999999999990.99999 . from dual select rtrim to_char -0 0235 fm999999999999990.99999 . from dual select rtrim to_char -156 45623 fm999999999999990.99999 . from dual results 0.00235 156.45623 -0.0235 -156.45623

abstract-class	superclass

nsproxy is a abstract-class
apple docs about nsproxy says an abstract superclass defining an api for objects that act as stand-ins for other objects or for objects that don t exist yet

57064493
post	get
t returns a 500 when you try to post to it which could be actually anything like for example missing configuration or programming errors
if i hit the given url in a browser i get actually a 405 method not allowed error

int	double

let s consider the following fake data set and the following fake functional relationship between dose and id when time is a multiple of 168 then the new column dose can be computed as so note that here we assume that the time variable in an int
if it were double we would probably need to have a condition such as

57064897
ssl	https

i found this in the error log failed to configure at least one certificate and key for internal.va.com 443 with the config shown and this error message the problem is pretty obvious you have ssl enabled but no certificate configured for a host
but https without a server certificate will not work

57065555
int	chars
n such implementations differences between the two only appear when these two conditions are the two true an expression involving an unsigned chars or unsigned short produces an int-wide result in which the sign bit is set either a unary operation on such a type or a binary operation in which the other operand is an int or narrower type
the result of the preceding expression is used in a context in which the preceding expression signedness is significant sizeof int sizeof long and it is in a context where it must be widened to a long type or it is the left operand of the right-shift operator in an implementation where this shift is defined as arithmetic or it is either operand of or


57065976
submit	submission
you should remove get method from that method list here s a minimal working version of your app that i ve recreated
it updates text.html on form submit and uses sessions to flash messages to user
once you run the app you get a page like this after submission some content it redirects you back to homepage with a message and page shows up with the content

57066080
for-loop	loops
our for-loop in the success callback loops 15 times so if there are ever less than 15 results it will fail once it processes the number of results returned and goes on to the first undefined result
to fix this either modify your looping so that this won t loops more times than there are results or alter the condition inside loops such that it doesn t check if is undefined


57066126
min	max

as a more algorithmic approach you can use a min heap of size n to keep track of the top n elements
you can use python s heapq library which is very easy the 100 a tuple is needed to give the priority in the max heap and to maintain a mapping between prices and items

57066128
ready	each
each platform has a different variant for example
jlink is the tool introduced with jdk9 so you re good to go that can make ready to go apps that include a shaken-down jre
you ll need to run it for every platform you want to target

57066142
textview	imageview
the content description attribute links a text description to a control imageview or other focusable objects that otherwise has no text content
hence the talkback function should only vocalize the text that is written in your textview
in your case you might consider having a work-around

57066142
textview	imageview
he imageview should have the same size as the textview and should be placed over the textview
hence when the imageview is clicked you can hear the desired contentdescription as specified in your program


57066269
versioning	upgrade

specifically a newly created database at versioning 2 would not contain the default value
so what these sentences are telling us is that you have an app implemented with room 2.1.x or lower which has no columninfo and you have already upgrade your schema to versioning 2 with alter table song add column tag text not null default

57066269
versioning	upgrade
o what these sentences are telling us is that you have an app implemented with room 2.1.x or lower which has no columninfo and you have already upgrade your schema to versioning 2 with alter table song add column tag text not null default
at this point you get a new user install which lets room 2.1.x create a versioning 2 of your schema without the default value since columninfo did not exist


57066269
versioning	upgrade
now users are upgrade to a binary of room 2.2.0 with columninfo and room will complain about the hash of the database being different for one subset of your users
so the migration_2_3 outlined in the document would be needed only for those users who let room 2.1.x or before create their schema 2 versioning without default value
it is thus a dummy update for users who had migrated from versioning 1 to 2 through the manual alter table

57066271
kerberos	ntlm

with spnego whitelisted domains will get your kerberos token on each request
an attacker could craft a form and trick a user to submit a form and if the target is an api with spnego support that the browser is whitelisted to send tokens to the browser can trick a user into sending authentication information my knowledge the only two mechanisms are cookies and kerberos ntlm over spnego

57066330
put	get
you can use buttons instead of inputs and put all the courses in the same form
if you use the course id as the value of the button the value of the clicked button will be the value you get in when you submit the form


57066547
websocket	pusher

at the end of perform method queue new delayed job for sending the message the code of the perform method is executed sequentially as any regular code update to send the message to the front end there are two ways push and pull more info - push using websocket you push the message from the backend to the front end - pull the front end sends requests every certain period to check if the backend has a new data and you can use any of these techniques to solve the problem if you used pulling you will make the job update a data store as an example redis or mysql
the front end will send a request every interval to check for the new data in some scenarios this will be a better solution but i think you are looking for the other technique pushing here you can use something like active cable or a third party like pusher the main idea here your frontend app will open a websocket connection with your server

57066603
public	protected
in the comments for anyone reading this in the future you identified your problem as a case of intentional strong coupling as stated in an answer to this question emphasis mine in general friend classes are useful in designs where there is intentional strong coupling you need to have a special relationship between two classes
more specifically one class needs access to another classes s internals and you don t want to grant access to everyone by using the public access specifier
the answer goes on to state the rule of thumb if public is too weak and private is too strong you need some form of selected access either protected or friend the package access specifier in java serves the same kind of role

57066850
client-side	server-side
or you should try to find alternatives that allow at least part of the code to run client-side
if you use an office application from a server-side solution the application will lack many of the necessary capabilities to run successfully
additionally you will be taking risks with the stability of your overall solution

57066885
memcached	apcu	opcache	apcu
currently developed with support for php 7.3 are apcu + apcu_bc varnish memcached wincache opcache you will find all installation instruction in a downloaded tgz zip file
apcu windows users download apcu and apcu_bc dll files that matches your system specification x64 64bit or x86 32 bits windows select ts or uts version and of course the right php version
paste .dll into your php ext directory you can determine thread mode by looking at your php directory

error-handling	exception-handling
e don t have to write any exception-handling handlers rules will simply fail with the appropriate diagnostics
what s more some inputs can lead to multiple hopefully helpful diagnostics now main becomes just live on coliru and the program prints attribute propagation on_success parsers aren t very useful when t don t actually parse anything so let t add some constructive value handling also showcaseing on_success defining some ast types to receive the attributes make sure we can print value s now use the old trick to coerce attribute types this time with error-handling as icing on the cake let t demonstrate on_success in with_error_handling now with largely unmodified main program just prints the result value as well live on coliru prints really overdoing things i don t know about you but i hate doing side-effects let alone printing to the console from a parser


57067532
width	height
ince rotation is based on the source position of the painter i also had to translate to the textrect position and swap the textrect position width and height
the textrect position might need some small polishing to ensure that the text is correctly aligned but the text should work and the text also sets the minimum height of the axis item based on the tick text


57067562
for-loop	loops
each time you pressed next the for-loop would run from until questions.length
this means that it runs until the end of loops changing the value of p.textcontent very quickly on each iteration of loops
therefore the only result you would see is the last message after loops ends

57067674
ready	each
when you re ready to code you can do it pragmatically with isinstance referencing h5py objects
to test if variable node is a group use if isinstance node h5py.group to test if variable node is a dataset use if isinstance node h5py.dataset to test if variable node is an object dataset use you can use visititems -function- to loop recursively down an object tree calling -function- with each object
here s a very simple example to demonstrate

57067801
inherited	properties

the only way i know how to do this is to define a separate possibly abstract class and inherited from a separate possibly abstract class
when you do that you can make the properties protected and the field private like so see a working example on dotnetfiddle

width	height
o your and of course to its wrapper and you ll see its works exactly like chrome also remove width -moz-available
its useless here and with this approach you won its need height -webkit-fill-available


57068817
for-loop	arrays
note that the output for which you are asking is actually a 3d arrays arrays of 2d arrays this prints for some notes the strategy i used to is to loops over all positions swap positions using a two level for-loop
for each possible swap we start by cloning your input 2d a arrays
then we swap the individual 1d arrays at whatever positions are chosen

57069172
hash	salt

the hash string must be generated and verified based on the unique secret mentioned above
note that the secret is also used as the salt to generate jwt signature the timestamp calculated from when the request is sent the rule to define these timestamps is predefined between hash generator on client and hash checker on server so that both can parallel come up with the same timestamp without communicate with each other so to secure the web service every request has to be routed through this hash generator where these timestamps will attach the hash string to request header in order to be recognised by the web server

the web server then calculated the timestamp scan through the same timestamp secret database to find the one that matched the hash sent from client


57069370
qpainter	qrect

note it is not possible to change this property while a qpainter is active on the generator
viewbox qrectf this property holds the viewbox of the generated svg drawing by default this property is set to qrect 0 0 -1 -1 which indicates that the generator should not output the viewbox attribute of the element

57069828
ngrx	rxjs
se ngrx and manage the state there overkill 2
create a service with an rxjs subject and have your top menu subscribe to an rxjs subject and then be disciplined when navigating and always be sure to push to an rxjs subject so your top menu knows what to show 3


57070127
put	get

it seems like you are working with react so simply put you should look into redux or context api instead of creating custom functions to import and export data from one file to an other both of above are used to create a global state which can be accessed in any file of your project
it will be little bit difficult to understand both of above at first but once you get to know how to use both of above one of both of above it will make global state management very easy for you

57070653
feof	fseek

you definitely don t want your loop to test feof fp -- indeed that is practically never right -- because feof fp will always be false at the end if the loop so the loop will never end
the fseek manpage spells the fseek manpage out a successful call to the fseek function clears the end-of-file indicator for the stream

57070653
feof	fseek	feof	ftell

so testing whether there was an eof after you handle the possibly unread data can t be right even if feof fp actually returned a useful value
a couple of other notes you re better off using ftell to recall the read cursor before the read and then fseek ing to the saved point

57070791
folder	directory

you can use as this would always return the root folder of whatever you re working on
an example implementation of this this would return something like this #loc server path to my folder needthis.php however if your file gets moved to a subdomain of the server you need to tweak the affected files a way to circumvent this is to use getcwd for example if your file gets moved to a subdomain example server subb the above script will return something like so #loc server path to my folder needthis.php warning include server path to my folder needthis.php failed to open stream no such file or directory in server subb index.php on line 4 if we replace with getcwd the problem won t happen

57070857
for-loop	arrays
when you then invoke the repetitioncheck a b c function the for-loop will run nearly forever unitl i flips over to negative because i is always increment
and then you access arrays indices 1000 your arrays size
then you get a seg fault

57071180
charindex	substr

neither charindex nor cast are in the cosmos db querying language that s why your query is not accepted
the only acceptable string functions are concat contains endswith index_of left length lower ltrim replace replicate reverse right rtrim startswith substr and upper

maven	pom.xml

given the threat of non-reproducible builds imposed by automatic plugin version resolution this feature is scheduled for removal as far as plugin declarations in the pom.xml are concerned
users of maven 3.x will find users of maven 3.x output a warning when missing plugin versions are detected to encourage the addition of plugin versions to the pom.xml or one of the pom.xml parent poms

57071300
maven	pom.xml
sers of maven 3.x will find users of maven 3.x output a warning when missing plugin versions are detected to encourage the addition of plugin versions to the pom.xml or one of the pom.xml parent poms
the enforcer rule requirepluginversions can be used additionally check for missing plugin versions in the pom.xml


57071329
entities	entitymanager
since you actually want a non-repeatable read
otherwise the behavior you re seeing would be really unexpected solution one easy solution would be to actively and explicitly sync the data from the database by either calling or - before fetching the user again - to call which will detach all entities clearing the cache which might have a noticable performance impact and allowing you to call find again with the proper results being returned
please note that detaching entities means that any object previously returned from the entitymanager should be discarded and fetched again not via refresh

57071333
maven	pom.xml
if your plugin s artifactid fits this pattern maven will automatically map your plugin to the correct prefix in the metadata stored within your plugin s groupid path on the repository
more about plugin prefix resolution here for version 1.4.0 for example the descriptor pom.xml file has a configuration section changing the version to something more recent 1.2.0 should fix the error
run with mvn package dockerfile build

57071473
int	double
as for image it behaves a bit differently if int or floats are supplied as can be learned from image s documentation if c is of type double then an rgb triplet value of corresponds to black and corresponds to white
if c is an int type then the image uses the full range of data to determine the color
for example if c is of type uint8 then corresponds to black and corresponds to white

57071473
int	double
or example if rgb8 is true color image data of type uint8 convert rgb8 is to double using to convert true color image data from type double to an int type rescale the data and use round to ensure that all the values are int
for example if rgb64 is image data of type double convert rgb8 is to uint8 using


57071482
prepare	execute
his level emulates serial transaction execution as if transactions had been execute one after another serially rather than concurrently
applications using this level must be prepare to retry transactions due to serialization failures


57071673
inotifypropertychanged	icommand
assuming that thingstodo is a long running task you should use an async await construct via an icommand implementation
observableobject is from mvvmlight framework but you can replace this with any inotifypropertychanged implementation
this can then be assigned in the code behind of your window you can then define the button s look using a style in your windows s xaml file including a trigger bound to the isexecuting property of the command to update the image

57071681
minimum	max

it also seems from the second topic that specifying only one threshold or only minimum does not work
therefore i d recommend you to try setting both min and max to your expected minimum

beanstalk	amazon-web-services

maxrampercentage is jvm parameter so it is defined inside container if your terminology refer to a process that is running inside elastic beanstalk
just as an additional note to use it is defined inside container if your terminology refer to a process that is running inside elastic beanstalk you can set in on amazon-web-services console - elastic beanstalk - instance - configuration - modify software - environment properties -- add property name java_tool_options value -xx maxrampercentage 80 as an example

ubuntu	linux

so i just tried on a mac with docker for windows docker-compose.yaml version 3 services app image ubuntu 16.04 volumes - usr local bin docker usr local bin docker - var run docker.sock var run docker.sock command docker version execution it seems all ok to use the docker daemon also the docker client of host
and if you mind to use the docker client which mounted from host you could also use static binary see how to install static binary update also i try to run a real container not just docker version like next 2rd update according to pierreb s suggestion to add more about how to use static binary download from choose one package which suitable for your target image e.g if target image is linux then download from here

57072561
folder	directory

the folder structure of your sap ui5 app is very important during deployment
ideally you should have your webapp folder and your dist folder as the only folders in the root directory of app

57072561
folder	directory
deally you should have your webapp folder and your dist folder as the only folder in the root directory of the app
your webapp folder and your dist folder s okay if you do not have a dist folder


57072649
folder	directory	temp	tmp

so i have to find a workaround for this and i have i use the windows temp folder to let jetty unpack the war
you can get this user based directory by typing tmp into the command line the windows temp folder won t be cleared automatically by standard settings in windows

57072967
strtok	malloc
strtok manages an internal global state which makes it non-reentrant
the solution of op seems to have none of those restrictions buying that with the usage of malloc with all the concerns mentioned above
so i changed the assumptions a bit there are actually no restrictions mentioned in ops question

build.gradle	gradlew

signing your apk aab you can configure your app build.gradle so that signing will be done after your build has been completed
in your app build.gradle you can read more about signing your app here now when you build your app build.gradle by invoking a gradlew task gradlew signs your app build.gradle and runs zipalign for you

ubuntu	linux

building and installing global from source is pretty straight-forward if you ve done this sort of thing before but in the spirit of showing how to plant an apple tree instead of giving an apple here s how i went about installing gnu global on my ubuntu 19.04 machine
hopefully this can be easily adapted to other linux environments

57074827
for-loop	loops

so that is why the for-loop executes one more time than the body
the same reasoning applies to for loops of course

post	get

sadly i cannot post comments so i m going to have to post an answer instead even though i m more of asking for clarity
you haven t really shared enough information as to where pistol gets executed and if you have even set up the fire1 button in edit project settings input if those if-statement bodies even get executed

57075153
reactjs	mobx

there are many ways to share state in reactjs
for example use global state tree such as mobx use context just like redux or native createcontext use common parent to pass props use hooks api you can try any of these methods mobx is simple redux is industrialized props is a easy way to share simple private state

57075489
google-chrome	safari
 just let google-chrome do it s thing as it s efficient enough
on ios only safari supports service worker installs for now


57075551
noexcept	throw
this notation is the pre-c++11 way of declaring that a function doesn t throw anything
nowadays noexcept is recommended but apparently microsoft didn t catch up with that yet.
instead the error tells you that you are trying to call the copy constructor in the line you marked but your class doesn t have one

57076015
for-loop	arrays

your code is fine except that you misplaced the return your code should be moved out of the for-loop
so ...should be as a side note in javascript you don t need to safeguard against an arrays reference that is out of range as that will just return undefined which is unequal to any numerical value

57076040
scatter	graphing

create the coordinates for your orange line columns f-h choose and x-y scatter plot
right click on the graphing area and select choose data

57076378
starttls	smtps
it mentions that gmail uses ssl for the smtps server on port 465 and tls for port 587
to resolve your issue you could use port 587 because the smtp.sendmail function internally makes a call to net.dial that uses plain tcp to send the mail traffic with a call to starttls later in the process
if you want to use port 465 here is a nice example that works for sending emails using ssl

57076395
min	rank	rank	max
equivalently to swapping you d have to apply max instead of min and vice versa for the result field
the check can be performed by computing the rank within a group according to the user id and the review result and check whether they match in a given record or not
note that the result of the matching predicate is constant in any given group

57076403
jboss	weblogic
remote queues on jboss are named differently from those on weblogic
the name of a remote queue should be something like this java jboss exported jms testqueue2 refer to the jboss documentation for a more detailed explanation on queues


57076561
post	get	put	get
the http call post products is not idempotent that is each subsequent identical call should create a new child of the product resource
put is used to update existing resources post is used to create new ones
note that if you want to be rest compliant as laravel try to do you shoud make idempotent get put delete head options and trace http methods but not the post method

57076938
int	double

i think you problem is two fold first you are using name instead of name as jezrael points out secondly when use .iloc with single brackets and a single int position you are returning the scalar value at that location
to fix this i d use double brackets to return a slice of the pd.series or pd.dataframe

57077025
std	ostream
the operator accepting a double value is implemented as a member function of std ostream see cpp reference
you ll notice that there is no overload for or std string provided
these are defined separately as free-standing functions among some others

57077040
filtering	grouping
aying this i think you need to omit that you filtering this in the where clause to display the results of only that user_id
so you may try this and finally grouping this by u_id


57077047
post	get
first do a get request against the projects api to get a list of all projects
then do a post against the projects id members api for each project you want to add the member to
you can see an example of the post request on that page

57077065
for-loop	loops

some actions are performed and then i set a break statement to jump out for loops once the value is found
then i set the variable as false as a condition in the if statement outside the for-loop

57077065
for-loop	loops
then i set the variable as false as a condition in the if statement outside the for-loop
some actions are performed and then i set another break statement to jump out for loops once the value is found. it works all the results are shown as expected and without duplicates


57077139
spaces	delimiter

the str test shows that is a single string so we can extract the elements with scan and then use hist upon looking at the op s data there are spaces and
so we change the op s data to a single delimiter and then use scan

57077201
apk	dex

understand the composition of the .dex dalvik executable files when you click on any dex file you will see a summary of how many classes and methods it defines and how many total references it contains
compare apk files it can be used to show the difference between two different apk files for example between debug and release builds

57077601
client-side	server-side

if you re using the api key in client-side code there is always the chance that a malicious user can find the key and abuse the key
the only way to protect against this is to not use the api key in client-side code or to have a backend system that can protect access based on something else such as firebase s server-side security rules

57077635
typedef	struct
n list.c include the full declarations but not as typedef since the header file already tells the compiler about the typedef names
this way the contents of the struct are not usable in other c files but the functions in list.c can still use other c files


57077894
mvp	presenter

the main thing that mvp do is the main thing that mvp do separates data layer and view layer if you are using model inside your view class then the main thing that mvp do means your view is directly communicating to data
the best approach is to use model in presenter layer if you want to pass data to model just add one more parameter of that to presenter constructor

57078355
mongodb	dbref
if not you need to remove the after dbref
i use robot 3t a gui tool to look into mongodb directly to examine the shape of data being saved
make sure your connections are setup properly you should also see the configurations for each connection something like this 3 you can single-step into class org.springframework.data.mongodb.core.convert.defaultdbrefresolver method fetch

57078401
subtract	add
in this case ebx - eax done by cmp sets cf if
so we need to subtract cf from 6
however for an 8-bit register that you need to initialize setcc + add may be a better choice it s fewer uops on more cpus

57078616
strstr	strcmp
the first one is that the separator of arguments is comma while you are using a dot
the second one is that instead of the construction you have to use the expression password take into account that the function strstr is not suitable to check whether two strings are equal each other
it is better to use function strcmp

57078621
hash	salt
to verify the password your code needs to query that salt value for the given user and use that value in the hash digest method the same way as you have used in your password salt+hash calculation then you make a comparison
to summarize generate your random salt value for a new password storage request
define where you ll want to append your salt value

57078621
hash	salt
when your user attempts a login get that user s salt value in your database then apply the same hashing method based on his input concatenating it with your queried salt the same way as your hash storage method does
if both hash digests are equal then you can proceed to authentication
take a look at this article to understand salting better

57078716
post	get
ypically when you post something some data will be created updated in a database for example
a get request comes in goes to the db and gets some data as a get request is after the change


57078955
folder	directory

your problem sits on the wildcard symbol on your copy instruction in a dockerfile if you want to copy the entire folder you have to target the entire folder otherwise everything after the gets interpreted as a file
also the entire folder should sit on the same level of a dockerfile and the entire folder is included in the context sent to your container and not listed on your .dockerignore file this should appropriately copy the files of the local project conf.d directory up to your container s folder copy  conf.d etc nginx conf.d

57079074
google-chrome	safari
 made a quick research and it seems that for ios users some extra steps are needed to use enable pwas the user has to access the pwa url with safari and then manually press the share icon and then add to home screen there is no indication that the visited website is a pwa
about the add to home screen in google-chrome i could not indeed find any official information when any official information has been removed


57079156
post	get

you need to do a little extra work to simulate a post to begin scraping against a asp.net webforms application
mostly you re going to need to pass along valid viewstate and eventvalidation parameters which you can retrieve from an initial get request

57079369
client-side	server-side

i recommend you to investigate a bit different approach for generating pdf from html just because all the client-side libraries for html to pdf generation have lots of problems when generating really complex documents with lots of formatting etc
the alternative way is to perform the pdf generation itself on the server-side

57079486
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
the file system from your operating system linux and mac use case-sensitive file names
windows file names are case-insensitive
git git has a configuration called core.ignorecase that you can set

57079490
put	get
ow how i do this alternatively we can simulate actual key presses note that we don t need to put indents in the template anymore
hopefully the current buffer has the current buffer very very difficult if not impossible to get pluggins i suggest you to watch this video on youtube


57079492
serializable	deserialization	serializable	deserialization
basically any serializable field like or public string somestring
works like this and ofcourse requires at least some kind of deserialization system on runtime and in a compiled build
it is further possible to also use serializable and deserialization on runtime in a build for converting classes from and to json or xml or other formats or load and create assets or assetbundles

57079742
stdout	stderr
or your specific purpose you ll need to log both streams stderr and stdout into files in the volume
then you need to export both streams stderr from the main container to the whichever logging driver you re running in your cluster


57079895
uilabel	textkit	uilabel	textkit
on the one hand you say uilabel
on the other hand you use terms like nslayoutmanager and nstextstorage and nstextcontainer the textkit stack
those are opposites because uilabel is not drawn with the textkit stack

57079895
uilabel	uitextview	textkit	uitextview

to be sure uilabel must draw in some deterministic way but what that way is is completely unknown and opaque and has nothing to do with textkit
on the other hand uitextview or a view that your draw yourself using textkit does use textkit and now all the textkit tools apply

57079899
put	get
query won jquery actually put jquery in a dom attribute
see get wrong value in data attribute jquery btw you misspelled specificity


57079983
interpreted-language	compiled-language
interpreted-language usually have some sort of trace trigger so that along with interpreting every line as it executes it also traces the lines
c++ is a fully compiled-language and as such has no such trace facility


57079999
imageview	picasso
picasso is not an option since it doesn t support gifs and that s one of the requirements in my question
moreover i want to keep displaying the loaded image in the imageview hence i don t want to change the into to a custom target
hence the solution with glide would be the following one first we try to find the downloaded media inside my database through trytogetfrommydatabase

57080200
junit	testng
we do not need to use cucumber-jvm-parallel or cucable plugin when cucumber version is greater than or equal to 4.0.0
cucumber parallel execution via junit first - update pom.xml with correct set of io.cucumber dependencies
point to note down - there could be an issue like everything is ok but still tests do not execute in parallel and could be if your pom.xml is having direct transitive dependency of testng

57080488
post	get

you are posting json state.search.method post users json.stringify data
you claim you are posting x-www-form-urlencoded data contenttype x-www-form-urlencoded if you are trying to post json then send state.search.method post users json.stringify data with the correct content-type application json if you are trying to post url encoded data then send state.search.method post users json.stringify data with the correct content-type state.search.method post users json.stringify data s the default for jquery so omit the contenttype parameter entirely or get state.search.method post users json.stringify data correct application x-www-form-urlencoded

57080645
abstract-class	superclass

a node is the highest level abstract-class from which nearly all that is graphically displayed in a gui is derived
a gui superclass is object

57080645
children	parent	children	parent
a child can have only one parent
but can have an unlimited number of children
the getparent method provides access to a nodes parent

57081198
folder	directory
that s why before we start extracting the content of this file we first need to decide where we want to create our db_home directory
mistake i made was i had the setup.exe in d drive and for other locations left it as default which are in c drive solution copy and extract the entire folder which contain setup.exe in c drive
manually remove all the files in in c program files oracle including oracle folder run the setup.exe as administrator leave the other configuration paths as default additional satisfy following condition when configuring the password oracle recommends the following guidelines when prompted for a password

57081247
build.gradle	gradlew
you need to increase the sdk-version in build.gradle app or under settings - gradlew and or 2
change the implementation of your recyclerview in build.gradle app to a lower version
this one you are using here androidx.recyclerview recyclerview 1.0.0-beta01 is the newest version. you probably need this com.android.support recyclerview-v7 more of this i suggest to watch this official android developer migrating site

57081536
versioning	upgrade
using the current versioning in the dojo this looks okay
maybe you should renew your license and or upgrade the project


57081594
robocopy	xcopy
i killed the background sql processes and the files copied with no issues
not sure if robocopy would have worked
i m still using xcopy at this point

57081675
srt	subtitle

use youtube-dl to download the captions as either srt ass vtt or lrc
use transcribefiles online captions subtitle converter to convert to any of 11 different json schemas

57082026
google-chrome	firefox
ut i needed to switch to google-chrome until another bug in the firefox driver got fixed
this is no full clean solution at all but the firefox driver works as a workaround until a better solution is found


57082154
division	multiplication

seal doesn t support division between ciphertexts
however if you are looking to divide ciphertext by plaintext you can use multiplication by inverse as shown below see example_weighted_average function in pyseal python examples

57082429
strncmp	getline
strip any newline character thus for example or more efficiently since getline returns the line length in read in your case adding a n to fixed_str may seem simpler but is not a good idea because the last or only line in a file won t have one but may otherwise be a match
using strncmp as described in your question should have worked but without seeing the attempt it is hard to comment but it is in any case a flawed solution since it would match all of the following for example testline4 testline4 and some more testline4 12345. where fixed_str is taken from console or file input rather than a constant the input method and data source may cause problems as may the possibility of alternate line-end conventions
to make it more robust you might do or the simpler better solution pointed out by andrewhenle that way either input can be compared regardless of lines ending in nothing cr or cr+lf and the line end may even differ between the two inputs

57082441
ocaml	utop

the problem indicates that the missing symbol is not provided by the objects that constitute the ocaml z3 bindings and that the missing symbol is not a part of the runtime
the verdict you can t use the ocaml z3 bindings in the ocaml toplevel with the default runtime with the ocaml or utop applications

57082608
post	put
ther reading a couple of blog post have been put out on the internet with some tips and tricks around linqpad
this blog post from dan clarke talks about how he creates symbolic links to manage he scripts he also lists some other tricks


57082991
range	minimum

the easiest way will be to brute force by testing all possible range that include 90
to do this we figure out how many terms that is and what indices the range therefore can start at and compute the difference for each and then the minimum of those

57083360
implements	extends
that is all done for you by default in a uitableviewcontroller
since your issue is only with the layout of your custom section header views you need to fix how you have implements those views
like cells you should use reusable header footer views and your header footer view should extends uitableviewheaderfooterview

57083633
width	height

in the following examples the following text is used hello world. another line of text. a line of text that wraps around. the red rectangles are meant to illustrate the width metrics
the height can be ignored

57083987
let	curry
cala s overloading with let us do this
add 1 2 3 4 the indicates that us re done curry this is relatively straightforward


57084205
sequence	permutation
 d recommend to start with a normal recursive solution maybe a fancy and efficient generator function now all you need to do is add the condition for neighbouring elements anything above sequence up to 0-7 will take a ridiculous amount of time that s rather normal
there are many many permutation for array of that size and your condition only filters out a few of many many permutation for array of that size and your condition


57084256
int	chars
ut when i am running this code with some int values i get an output with seemingly random spaces and newlines
that sounds like the result of a character-encoding mismatch or even two but see also below there can be a runtime mismatch because the locale you tell the program to use for output does not match the one expected by the output device a terminal with which the program s output is displayed and there can also be a compile time mismatch between the actual chars encoding of your source file and the encoding the compiler interprets the compiler as having


57084946
maven	pom.xml

maven profiles may be able to help
add something like this to your pom.xml

57085242
post	get
then filter by that parameter in the view to get a queryset that you then return back to the template
blog example anything in the context you can then use as variables in your template so you ll have categories and the filtered post for example


57085943
post	get

firestore is able to handle this properly for simple get requests just not list requests at the moment
since the postrefs collection stores only id s and not sensitive information which may be in post post security rules can be relaxed such that i only verify a user is logged in

57086165
width	height

if you use translatex 50 you re going to move the element to the right by 50 of its width 100px
if you were to use translatey 50 by contrast you d move its down by 50 of its height which in this case would be 25px

57086232
printf	atoi
ou print it without storing it using printf d atoi string
note if you weren t aware of it existence there is a already a function atoi in stdlib.h

folder	directory
when this image is built the files in your current directory
are copied to the image s app folder
this only occurs during the build

57086648
prometheus	metrics

for this sample app the path should be actuator prometheus according to the readme my brief test
when i used the command cf register-metrics-endpoint app-name actuator prometheus i was able to see the custom metrics in the output from cf tail i do not see the custom metrics in the output in your included output

57086648
prometheus	metrics

ex not showing up in your screenshot in the referenced sample app there is no metrics called high_latency so that won t work as the name of your metrics as it will never get generated by the app
you can see all the metrics if you access the actuator prometheus endpoint in your browser

57086704
setinterval	clearinterval
to stop the interval you have to save the return of setinterval to a variable
you pass this value to the global function clearinterval to stop the interval you can create a function that encapsulates the interval and execute some callback when some condition is true


57087194
printf	strcpy	printf	strcmp
strcmp input name strcpy r.name test1
else printf invalid field
n

57087263
dateadd	sysdate

there s no function like dateadd in oracle
you can simply add a positive or negative integer to a date to add or subtract days.use sysdate instead of getdate

57087263
getdate	sysdate
you can simply add a positive or negative integer to a date to add or subtract days.use sysdate instead of getdate
you may do a trunc on sysdate to ignore time component
also for arguments do not use the column names as it is

57087272
ready	each

you need to switch the order of the producer ready listener and the consumer message listener
otherwise you re setting up the ready listener for each and every consumed message for example i would suggest looking at this library though if mostly processing and forwarding to new topics

57087385
put	get
 suggest creating a list of latlng model and put even json s cells to lat and odd json s cells to lng of the latlng model and add it to a list of latlng model in for statement
note get your json as string and then you will have access to even and odd cells of the array


57087417
int	chars
0 is a chars with ascii code 0
as such it is an int with value 0
null is usually also an int with value 0

57087710
elasticsearch	fluentd
probably what you are looking for is fluentd daemonset that creates a daemonset which runs in each worker node and then help you move the logs to s3 cloudwatch or elasticsearch
there are many sinks provided with fluentd
you can use one that suits your needs

57087791
folder	dir

i had similar issue but with file attributes not with missing privileges in cmd under c program files x86 git run command attrib attrib you will know if srv folder has system or hidden file attribute
if you would like to view srv folder in cmd then use dir a s

57087929
versioning	upgrade

you are using a very old versioning of xcode
since the framework has been compiled by a newer one you would not be able to use it until you upgrade your xcode

57087929
versioning	upgrade

most probably you will also need to update your macos as the most recent versioning of xcode at this time 10.2 requires macos mojave
another reason for upgrade is that starting march 27 2019 app store will only allow apps that are compiled with 12.1 or later

57089319
pull	push
you should be able to solve this problem by updating your local branch by running this command git pull --rebase
this will pull the remote changes and then replay your local changes on top of those
you can read more on git-rebase here if however you really want to overwrite the remote branch there is also a --force option to git push

57090112
csv	tsv
such tsv files can be easily parsed line-by-line with a simple line.rstrip.split t -1 note -1 which prevents split from removing empty trailing fields
if you want to use the csv gem simply set quote_char to nil

qcolor	qimage
other sample images can be found on the official test-suite for png . after building and running in vs2017 i got the following snapshot when mouse is moved over the displayed images the bottom label shows the current position in image and the respective pixel as qcolor and raw hex-values
out of curiosity i implemented the approach of op with two nested loops fixing the qrgb issue to compare the result with the qimage converttoformat which i found in the qt doc
qimage qimage converttoformat qimage format format qt imageconversionflags flags qt autocolor const qimage qimage converttoformat qimage format format qt imageconversionflags flags qt autocolor returns a copy of the image in the given format

57090522
put	get

will give empty out put since | creates a subshell and executes the in subshell
to make it display the value of body change the value of body into proper way to achieve the desired goal is using command substitution alternatively you can use read to get the value of body but you cannot use it outside subshell

57090700
maven	pom.xml

the easiest way is to add the project as a maven project directly
to do this in the project explorer on the left right-click on the pom.xml file for the project towards the bottom of the context menu you will see an option called add as maven project click the project

57090700
maven	pom.xml
o do this in the project explorer on the left right-click on the pom.xml file for the project towards the bottom of the context menu you will see an option called add as maven project click it
this will automatically convert the project to a maven project


57091030
viewdidload	viewwillappear

i have just hit this problem as well the root cause of this problem is because i put self.navigationcontroller.delegate self on viewdidload
my solution is to put the delegation on viewwillappear after that popviewcontroller will hit viewwillappear

maven	pom.xml

all you need to familiar with maven add following dependencies and some configuration for your wsdl files
1 first add dependencies 2 add configuration for wsdl file 3 build source code mvn generate-sources run this command in your root folder of this project where pom.xml resides

57091379
int	double

so the result will only be an int
changing the itemcount and totalitems to double resolves this...i am now slapping my own head

57091643
spaces	delimiter
the string delimiter is modified with from default normal spaces or horizontal tab to character
of interest for this task are lines which have two dot delimiter substrings whereby the second substring should be xgph82640
for that reason is used to get first dot delimiter string assigned to loop variable i and second dot delimiter string assigned to next loop variable which is j according to ascii table

57092424
screens	hdpi	screens	mdpi
i need to correspond the device screens resolutions
if it is not should i separate them and for the png part i need mdpi hdpi xdpi .
no i think you will be in trouble with multiple screen resolutions after all the png is just a png

agile	sprint

i have written a possible qa strategy document as follows goal the purpose of the qa strategy document is to list best practices and some form of process that the team can follow mission statement defect prevention will be prioritised to defect detection definition of qa qa is a set of activities intended to ensure that products satisfy customer requirements in a systematic reliable fashion product quality is of higher priority than quantity in scrum agile qa is the responsibility of every development team member product backlog the most common cause of software development failure is due to unclear requirements and different interpretation of requirements by different members of the team
the product backlog items pbi will be sorted in a top-down approach where the items to be done in the upcoming sprint will feature first user stories will be simple concise and unambiguous the invest model will be followed here as described below independent - a user story will be independent of other stories negotiable - a user story will not be fixed and can change or be discarded in due course while lying in the product backlog valuable - a user story will deliver value to the stakeholders estimateable - the size of a user story will be derivable in story points small - a user story will be small enough to plan task prioritize within a level of accuracy a good rule of thumb is that a story will not take more than 50 of an iteration testable - the description of the user story must provide the necessary information to make test development possible the format of a user story will be as a role i want feature so that benefit each user story will consist of clearly defined acceptance criteria scenarios valid invalid and edge cases will be thought of and written in the user story on completion of a user story this must be reviewed by the development team and the product owner the user story will be updated to incorporate any changes or feedback backlog refinement in the backlog refinement process po and dev team must be involved everyone in the team will learn about the stories and have a clear understanding screen designs will be reviewed feasibility analysis will be done everybody will have the same understanding of what the story is about developers will have a good understanding of the technical details that are involved in delivering the story the team will know how the story will be tested impediments if any will be discussed here the items to be taken to the next sprint must match with the current team capacity backlog refinement must be complete for at least 50 of the current team capacity definition of development done for a story all the acceptance criteria defined by the story are met will pass all test cases coding will only start after the acceptance criteria for the story has been defined and reviewed code builds without warnings technical task 100 of the unit test cases must be passed technical task 100 of the functional test cases must be passed no high priority and high severity bugs must be open for any story the feature branch is merged to the release development branch without any conflict ready to be deployed to the staging environment for po acceptance code review and necessary documentation will be done development guidelines unit tests must be written for all stories and incorporate all acceptance criteria as well as technical criteria unit tests must be reviewed code quality must be reviewed by another developer any new code and or refactoring of legacy code will have appropriate unit tests that will be part of the unit regression test api service unit testing will be done to ensure that the communication between components are working the functional test cases will be written in parallel with the code development and reviewed build will be given for testing only when the code development is complete functional test cases will be complete before the testing starts qc guidelines acceptance sanity testing why to ensure customer s expectations are met what verifying acceptance tests on the stories verification of features when definition of done is complete where dev build ui testing why to ensure the ui of the new features are intact with the mockups what compare ui of the developed features with the mockups from zeplin invision when definition of done is complete where dev build smoke testing why to ensure the critical features are working as expected what basic flow testing of critical features only when when acceptance ui and exploratory testing is completed where staging build system integration testing regression testing why to ensure the whole system works when integrated what scenario testing end-to-end user flows and typical user journeys when when acceptance and exploratory testing is completed where staging build non-functional testing why to ensure the non-functional aspects are taken care of what compatibility testing usability testing recovery testing when when acceptance ui exploratory testing is completed where dev build interruption testing why to ensure that the app behaves gracefully when interrupted what battery low battery full- when charging incoming phone call or video call incoming sms incoming alert from another application plugged in for charging plugged out from charging device shut off application update reminders alarm network connection loss network connection restoration when when regression testing is completed where staging build

put	get
the response i get contains the scope claim scp with the value master.webapi01.read master.webapi02.read
scp master.webapi01.read master.webapi02.read this way i am telling to system that the trusted client-ui application has a token with accessibility to two features. simply put whoever can log into the client application will have access to both the features. an authenticated user is now authorized to use two features
this can be further restricted

57094158
post	get
ere is a nice post around the topic
then read about the get method itself -- the get method itself returns a value which may be a function since functions are first class objects in python


57094538
datediff	difference
for example when comparing december 31 to january 1 of the following year datediff returns 1 for dateinterval.year dateinterval.quarter or dateinterval.month even though at most only one day has elapsed
to get the actual difference between different instances of datetime either use subtract or - as you wrote in the question


57094710
daemons	systemd
one normal solution is to use type forking and then make your program do the forking and only fork when initialization has successfully completed and we know the daemons can run
systemd waits for the forking process to exit and interprets this as meaning the initialization is done and can then give feedback to you on the command line
since playapp is presumably not designed to fork like this you can t immediately use type forking

57094833
range	min

you set your range of data to be filtered just to one column c but ask autofilter to set the filter according to the 3rd column of that range so that would be column e as column e is not part if the range to be filtered you will get the 1004 runtime error
however if you had already autofilter active that included column e that means you have this triangle button visible on column e the runtime error is not issued - maybe that s the reason the code worked 10 min ago

57094835
width	height
from react-native
const width dimensions.get window .width
const height dimensions.get window height

57095178
folder	directory

nu1701 has nothing to do with dependencies nu1701 s about the dlls that were selected in the lib folder of the package
if you look at the package using fuget.org or looking at the directory in your global packages folder or downloading the nupkg from nuget.org and using nuget package explorer or any other program that can open zip files you ll see the dlls are directly under the lib folder whereas usually dlls are under

57095657
for-loop	loops
owever when an argument with wildcards matches a lot of items the for-loop would iterate many times before reaching the exception section
with the else clause the else clause is already entered after the first loops iteration


57095812
for-loop	loops
instead of it should be as to the solution you chose the comments in the main section about the nested loops should be addressed
instead of a nested for-loop you should sort the data first
thus finding the minimum value between two values is much easier and with less time complexity

57095943
int	chars

string data types cannot be used as a condition for switch because switch works correctly only on datatypes that can be converted to int unambiguously
for example chars data type can be converted to int unambiguously and int itself can be used as a condition for switch but string would be too ambiguous to be changed to int that is why the error message pops up

57096027
versioning	upgrade

it was due to confliction of php versioning in apache and composer
i uninstall the old versioning of composer and then install the latest versioning of composer from if you are using ubuntu then you need to upgrade or uninstall the latest versioning of the composer using commands the latest versioning of the composer works for me

57096042
post	get

stephen suggested you add a get route
if you don t want to or can you don t do that you need to call login with a post method

57096406
mouseup	mousedown

as a workaround you can use global mouseup event
in the controller the controller would look something like this you need of course to import matslider in the mouseup method you can add check if user actually started dragging slider by observing the flag which is set in the mousedown event handler on the mat-slider control

57096832
int	chars
after reading the int values m and n
to clear the eol chars before using s.nextline to read the input


57096938
int	double
he tricky part is that the number is stored as a string - you ll have to convert the number to a double divide by 1000
convert the number back to a long to chop off the decimal and you can t use int as the number is too big and finally back to a string


57096987
int	chars
and 5 a directive composed of white-space chars s is executed by reading input up to the first non-white-space chars which remains unread or until no more chars can be read
pay attention to that according to the c standard the function main without parameters shall be declared like int main void from the c standard 5.1.2.2.1 program startup 1 the function called at program startup is named main
the implementation declares no prototype for this function

57097017
int	chars
the last newline chars will remain in the stdin buffer untouched and unseen until the program terminates and the buffer gets deallocated
tip you probably meant to write int main void instead of void main


57097118
imperative	declarative

the functional or declarative style does not really fail
the imperative solution here s rather raising questions about the exact goals conditions and context and maybe even philosophical questions about language details like why there is no standard pair class in core java

57097178
do-while	break

the do-while loop runs until the end of the file
exit the loop with break once you have encountered the matching line

57097528
folder	directory

the point of a symlink is to create a virtual folder or file that points to an existing folder or file
but you can t create a folder or file when it already exists -- more precisely you can t create a virtual folder symlink when a physical directory already exists

57097528
folder	directory
you d need to remove or rename the existing web server directory
as an aside the symlink got created inside the folder because you specified an existing folder name as the target
update assuming a sane set of permissions on the server you probably need to do this as root or using sudo

57097632
multiplying	multiplication

tf.sparse_matmul is for multiplying two dense tensor not sparse type of data structure
that function is just an optimized version of tensor multiplication if the given matrix or both two matrixes have many zero value

57097767
post	get
move this call out of the post function handler
i dont see any reason for you to be registering a post call at all
just use the get call to retrieve your data

57097887
children	parent
f the maximum path in one of the subtrees does not contain the subtree root or the subtree root is somewhere in the middle of the maximum path then you can t form a path by joining the parent node to t
thus you need separate sets of information about each subtree information about the general maximum-sum path within that subtree and information about the maximum-sum path within it that starts at the subtree root even if as will be common the subtree root path sum is less than the maximum in the subtree when processing a node you can combine the latter sets of information about the subtrees rooted at the subtree root children to compute both sets of information for node under consideration


57098030
x86	64bit
the obvious way is _mm_movehl_ps + or then another shuffle+or
see fastest way to do horizontal float vector sum on x86 but replace _mm_add_ps with _mm_or_ps but since we don t actually need an exact bitwise-or when our inputs are compare results we just care if any element is non-zero
we can and should think of the vectors as integer and look at integer instructions like 64bit element

57098904
dictionary	map

if df2 is not a big dataframe you can convert df2 to a dictionary and then use list comprehension and when function to check the status for example note i assumed data types already set to integer for the above cols in df1 and df2.min df2.max
create a map from df2 add new field problem based on two when functions use a list comprehension to iterate through all concerned columns f.when df1 c .between min max 0 .otherwise 1 f.when sum .. 0 yes .otherwise no we set a flag 0 or 1 with the first when function for each concerned column and then take the sum on a flag

57099357
maven	pom.xml
so the phase itself will know what mojo to run
these are the docs for the maven plugin api the one for using annotations is nearby
if it is not your plugin you can put the configs you want into a parent pom.xml into the pluginmanagement section

57099484
cos	sin
ts lenght is equal to sin theta 2 where theta is the angle of rotation
so w is not the angle of rotation its lenght is cos theta 2


57099531
put	get
ou have to do two things to get this to work
brew install aspell or maybe brew install aspell --with-lang-en go to emacs and evaluate this function or better yet put this function in your init file setq ispell-program-name usr local bin aspell note the location of aspell can be found using which aspell in macos terminal which should be equal tot step 2


57099592
for-loop	loops
the first loops is o n where
the inner for-loop for good_words is another o m and the in keyword is another o n
it is total o n 2 m

57100224
versioning	upgrade

it seems like you or some of the packages you installed is using react hooks but those are available only in the react native versioning starting from 0.59
so try to upgrade rn and see if the issue persists

57100640
for-loop	loops

solution 2 has only 1 for-loop meaning it has an o n efficiency while solution 1 is o n 2 since it has a nested for-loop
this is because the inside for-loop runs the code a.length n times and the outer for-loop runs the inner loops a.length n times making a nested for-loop s efficiency o n 2

57100640
for-loop	arrays
this is because the inside for-loop runs the code a.length n times and the outer for-loop runs the inner loops a.length n times making a nested for-loop s efficiency o n 2
the correction to your 2nd piece of code is as vatsal jain stated above assuming a return value of 1 is a bean arrays


57100775
width	height
width 100
height 100
the removed extra padding in h3 and changed the margin to 0 auto

57100775
margin	font-size
font-size 20px
margin 0 10px
margin 0 auto

57102475
inherited	subclassing
moreover classes can have subclassing inherited
therefore if i need inherited or many instantiations i gather functions and variables under a class definition methods and properties
otherwise i keep it simple and stupid kiss and use modules

57102563
submit	submission
try entering an invalid value and submission the form in the snippet below
if you don t want to wait for the submit button to be clicked check out htmlformelement.reportvalidity


57102651
versioning	upgrade
here is how i resolved it
first i found this error popup from xerces versioning 1.2.3
so i tried to upgrade to 1.4.4 which is latest for versioning 1

57102778
median	minimum
for instance if you were able to remove the black sections on the last image you would get this result
potential optimizations would be to play with the median blur as this helps to smooth out the pattern on the belt
you could also adjust the minimum threshold area to control the size of the detected crack

57103170
next	except
hat you want to do is start set and call start round or finish start round and call start workout or start the next set repeat 6 times work out and 7 seconds later call short break or long break take a short break and 3 seconds later call work out take a long break and 180 seconds later call start set this is series of steps that are called in x amount of times except for new set and new round which are just data updates with certain pauses in between
code to not come empty handed this is working proof of concept general concept is function training that takes arbitrary object with config data and next step and calls this again with new values until condition is met in this case number of sets finished


57103461
padding	right-align

str.format s padding can help here
for example the format says indicates that this is a format specifier 0 pad with zero right-align 4 pad up to four characters we could change a couple of these to pad with a different character and a different width here s an example function that does the padding

57103837
subtract	add
e can normalize we daily altitude changes by sorting them so a is the smallest then subtract a from each of the altitude changes and subtract n a from the total altitude change
this means we now need to add a bunch of 0 s and two other values let s call two other values d and e


57103874
put	get
so each time you receive one put it in a queue or similar and once you have a pair with matching timestamps forward the pair onward to processing
for robustness this requires correctly handling capture errors which can cause either the result or the image to be lost otherwise you ll either have orphan objects in the queue that never get handled or you ll stall your whole app waiting for an object that ll never arrive
or both. a simple option might be to just discard objects that are more than a second or two old

57104145
client-side	server-side
i had a solution before generating data with javascript but that is going to render the useless as this is done server-side and the js is done client-side
need to generate the areasdata server-side
thanks

57104222
google-chrome	firefox

i ve always battled to find this feature in google-chrome i m sure it s in there somewhere but no one seems to be able to find it
in firefox is quite easy inspecting an element will show if an element has an event attached and will even show the code

57104255
pandas	dask
it s quite common for dask dataframe to not provide a speed up over pandas especially for datasets that fit comfortably into memory
however if your apply function is quite slow then you might consider using processes instead of threads which is the default for dask dataframe especially if that function is gil-bound
see for more information

57104261
chown	chmod
chown -r mysql mysql var lib mysql var run mysqld
# ensure that var run mysqld used for socket and lock files is writable regardless of the uid our mysqld instance ends up having at runtime chmod 777 var run mysqld


57104275
shadowing	named
this means you frequently use this almost-always incorrect pattern of shadowing variables
because having multiple different variables with the same named is confusing even when employed correctly they can easily lead to unexpected behavior
thus you should never shadow a variable

57104309
subtract	add
even better you can often optimize away a negation by later doing a subtract instead of add or an fmsub or fnmadd instead of fmadd or producing a originally with an fnmsub instead of fmadd to negate as part of the fma
but if you had to choose between an actual fp multiple or fp add instruction normally subtraction has latency at least as good as multiplication
intel haswell and broadwell have multiply throughput twice as good as add throughput running on fma units with worse or equal latency to add but most microarchitectures including modern x86 ryzen and skylake have balanced fp add vs

57104309
multiplying	add	multiplying	add
intel haswell and broadwell have multiplying throughput twice as good as add throughput running on fma units with worse or equal latency to add but most microarchitectures including modern x86 ryzen and skylake have balanced fp add vs
multiplying throughput
in general for non-x86 architectures generally add will be at least as cheap as multiplying

57104331
lxml	libxslt	libxml2	libxslt

from the lxml documentation it requires libxml2 version 2.9.2 or later
libxslt version 1.1.27 or later we recommend libxslt 1.1.28 or later

57104496
free	calloc	free	malloc
i changed it to malloc instead of calloc and called join to wait for each thread to finish before continuing
then free d all the created threads
it does not crash for me

57105014
terminate	timeout
o circumvent the blocking you need to open the network share asynchronously using a new instance of cmd and then attempt to terminate that instance after the timeout period
using taskkill to terminate instance instance should be given a unique title in order to distinguish from other processes


57105336
folder	directory
root cause is because the sampleapp binary can not find the folder of qml in output directory
it is searching for folder output sampleapp samplemodule but we are outputing projects as output sampleapp output samplemodule note add env variable qml_import_trace 1 in build run environments variables in qtcreator to get which plugins is loaded and what is wrong
i also push the fixed patch on my github for template project

57105680
public	protected

you can use the public function of the parent class getnoofseats if you want to keep the variables private
or just change the variable noofseats to protected or package-protected

57105755
versioning	upgrade

this is due to this issue which has been solved in versioning 8.0.1 with this pr
so upgrade primeng to resolve this issue

57105798
for-loop	loops
and that the reason why in the outer loops the increment didn t effects - the for-loop depend only the i that defined in the for-loop and every loops he look on the last iteration value when the inner loops every outer iteration creates new for-loop and look on the value of j
in addition if you using for-loop on known ds arrays dict.. the pythonic way is to iterate on the elements and not using c styling of indexes


57105841
free	calloc	free	malloc
n the code shown you should not be calling free valread because you didn t allocate free valread with malloc or calloc
you should only free memory that you previously allocated from the heap


57106101
udp	mtu	packets	multicast
i wrote an open-source library that uses essentially the technique you describe multicast udp + tcp-retransmit-to-recover-from-packet-loss to synchronize databases across multiple hosts as quickly as possible
some things i learned while implementing it include if when you can pack your data-messages together into larger packets up to the mtu of the network you are transmitting over 1388 bytes for ipv4 ethernet
very small packet-sizes like 48-bytes packet are inefficient since the fixed-sized packet-headers make up a greater percentage of the total data sent received

57106393
cagradientlayer	calayer

there are a lot of ways to obtain a gradient background for uitableview. the key point is to utilize cagradientlayer class
cagradientlayer cagradientlayer is a subclass of calayer

57106393
uiview	cagradientlayer	cagradientlayer	calayer

as you might know calayer is the backing block of uiview instances and do the basic rendering
cagradientlayer is for gradient effects

57106496
submit	submission

where are you trying to submit the job
to run any spark application you need to submit the job from bin spark-submit in your spark installation directory or you need to have spark-home set in your environment which you can refer while submission

57106666
range	minimum
if the current value falls outside the new range the progress bar is reset with reset
the same is with minimum
access function is setminimum

57106889
apache	nginx
o debug the situation a variable was introduced in the log_format directive in etc nginx nginx.conf this variable allowed to understand that there was a problem with sub.domain.org when we accessed sub.domain.org the host was changed to the nginx server s hostname contrary to customroute which host was not changed
the host appears sub.domain.org was not a simple dns config but was an apache proxy pass configuration


57106889
apache	nginx

to correct this behavior we had to add the following configuration in apache proxypreservehost on
once we restarted apache apache the target host was preserved and we server_name sub.domain.org was correctly matched in nginx

57106901
folder	directory

in the path system variable you would add this - java_home bin where java_home points to the root of the jdk installation and the bin folder contains all the executable binaries
notice that you have to use java_home and not just java_home usually the bin directory is added to the path as the bin directory contains all the executable binaries

57106931
folder	directory
delete temp file in your system
then clean your app - remove the . node_modules . hooks and . platforms folder again install npm and add platform
type this command in project directory for remove folder - rm -rf node_modules hooks platforms and try to run the app again

57107012
coalesce	nullif	isnull	nullif
i would simply use coalesce instead of isnull it doesn t try to convert the return value to the type of the first value select coalesce nullif test this one returns the correct value test
so to fix your query you only need to replace isnull by coalesce


57107081
put	get

while using this as context always make sure to put check if this is null or not
you can get the clear idea using below link

57107110
sorting	filtering
ou can do it in your js code in your case the following approach can be used for sorting by created_at after this if you print your object array to console you will see your object is sorted by created_at variable
also filtering can be done like this by department after print newarray variable you will see new filtering object array


57107175
maven	pom.xml
this was due to the spring-boot-maven-plugin repackage classifier changes between version 1.5.7 and 2.1.6 see here my 1.5.7 pom.xml s spring-boot-maven-plugin was configured as follows the resulting manifest from the build after upgrading to spring-boot-maven-plugin 2.2.16 release does not have the correct start-class
manifest-version 1.0 implementation-title my-app implementation-version 2.1.0-snapshot start-class org.springframework.boot.loader.jarlauncher spring-boot-classes boot-inf classes spring-boot-lib boot-inf lib build-jdk-spec 1.8 spring-boot-version 2.1.6.release created-by maven archiver 3.4.0 main-class org.springframework.boot.loader.jarlauncher changing the spring-boot-maven-plugin 2.2.16 to the following fixed the issue - the jar manifest now contains the correct start-class

57107327
folder	dir

you will need to use the sudo command as this directory is at root level sudo mkdir usr lib jvm-oracle copy your tarball over sudo cp downloads name of your tarball usr lib jvm-oracle move into the usr lib jvm-oracle and extract your tarball move into cd usr lib jvm-oracle extract sudo tar -xvzf name of tarball list out the directory contents and find your extracted folder ls -al you should see a directory like jdk1.8.0_172
move into your dir and the bin folder with cd and list out the directory contents move to new dir cd jdk1.8.0_172

57107374
folder	directory
save it
run ndk-build in the jni folder where your application.mk is present
if you ve configured your android .mk with current modules you ll get so s for all the architecture in libs or jnilibs directory

57107402
daemons	launchd
f your concern is the packaging side of things you can package all jobs in a single jar and use the spring boot property spring.batch.job.names at launchd time to specify which job to run
i was wondering if which job s possible to trigger the app once like a daemons and communicate with the app using jms or any other approach


57107602
folder	directory
compiled classes and processed resources ends in the target classes folder not in the src folder
it is a maven gradle directory that you will not retrieve at runtime
only which is contained inside will be available at runtime

57107871
folder	directory

i just figured it out bat rmdir target generated-sources something s q there was an additional catch the bat or cmd or whatever exe is executing the delete operation is refusing to delete the folder if the delete operation is not empty
some msdn site said you can use s to delete the entire tree directory tree including the stated folder and the q turns it quiet forces the delete operation like -f in powershell

57108080
put	get
s in the comment if you want the value of the option to be event name you need to put this in the value or leave the value blank and then it will take whatever is being displayed
i think the best thing to do would be to use the data- attribute to clean up your code and simplify your code like this then you can access the values - look at this link here for a start on how to do this if you use the data attribute then you don t have to have the complication of trying to give a value split it out and somehow get a new value which at best is hacky


57108107
cpu	processors
that said these calculations are likely to be more efficient in a more efficient computer language than javascript and or a better cpu than my very low end atom cpu processors but then the composite number culling speed is likely to also be more efficient as well
this javascript code is only three to five times slower depending on cpu closer in performance on higher end cpu s when run on newer versions of node google-chrome browser google-chrome version 75 is still about 25 faster than firefox version 68 than kim walisch s primesieve written in c and compiled to x86_64 native code
coming is chapter 4.5b that will be about two and a half times more code but will be a prime generator capable of sieving to extremely large ranges limited partly by that javascript can only efficiently represent numbers up to the 64-bit floating bit mantissa of 53 bits or about 9e15 and also be the amount of time one wants to wait sieving to 1e14 on a better cpu will take in the order of a day but that isn t much of a problem - just keep a browser tab open

57108672
free	malloc	free	malloc
that s why you have to malloc x1 and x2 separately
so when you free x you also aren t freeing x1 or x2 either
free doesn t know how and doesn t know that you ran malloc for x1 and x2

lambda	methodhandle	lambda	methodhandle
refer the below byte code of lambda linkage as foreach accepts consumer functional interface object
java.lang.invoke.lambdametafactory this class provides two forms of linkage methods a standard version metafactory methodhandles.lookup string methodtype methodtype methodhandle methodtype using an optimized protocol an alternate version altmetafactory methodhandles.lookup string methodtype object...
these linkage methods are designed to support the evaluation of lambda expressions and method references in the java language

57108705
folder	dir
solution was to select folder of the running debug config everytime i rebuild project destination location with dll and a reference to it stays with warning mark for some time until intellitrace does its job
after doing the setup mentioned above i still have to do a manual rebuild on a project that generates a dll into specified dir
pressing f5 does nothing i don t have time to find out why.

implements	sealed
data classes cannot be abstract open sealed or inner
before 1.1 data classes may only implements interfaces
so your data class should be something similar like below data class foo val bar any note in kotlin you can declare class constructor just by placing following by class name to make it as primary constructor

int	chars
to set every byte individually the pointer to int is casted to a pointer to chars x chars a
as a chars is always coded in one byte
now the four bytes are treated as an array of four bytes

put	get
in the below code i group the max per actor in createdby in a derived table and run the above functions where the actor is not ivr
i ve put some test data into a temp table but you can adapt to your own data
to get your own columns you can inner join the derived table with alias t onto your original query

error spawn eacces problem i ll start with error spawn eacces problem as it s more subtle and tricky this is because your debian machine doesn t have the required dependencies installed in order to run puppeteer
the required dependencies differ between distributions centos ubuntu debian etc...

move	drag

how to move tasks from one user story to another it is easy to move tasks from one user story to another user story
you just drag the task from one user story to another

57110987
oncreate	recreate
f you add fallbacktodestructivemigration to your database builder as the exception suggests the database does get recreate or at least wiped but oncreate is not called so if your population code is in there you will end up with no data for your app
for this reason i believe oncreate is a viable option to populate your database as long as you promise to provide room with all the necessary migrations oncreate might need

int	double
you should never use or in to compare double because of the limited floating point precision
either convert it to int or use all_equal
consider this

maven	pom.xml
nevertheless there are ways to build with maven from a docker-compose.yml
one is with the maven-exec for the file in question version 2 services service-a build a image imga service-b build b image imgb links - service-a the relevant part of the pom.xml would be something like the following another solution is to use fabric8 use the one that suits you best

skaction	skeffectnode
but instead of assigning the filter to the scene you assign it to the skeffectnode
however you need to add this line in the skaction block after updating the filter s properties without that line in the skaction block the animation won t work
i regard this as a bug

57111517
post	get
in this code snippet i fetch the custom property i created for the product and i am happy enough with that as a way to identify the products from one another but what i should have done apparently was to search against the meta_key _variation_id instead of edition to obtain the post table id that will give me the product that i can then load using wc_product t finally get the sku from that.
that is wayyy too many calls to make to get something as simple as an sku.
thanks

cpu	affinity
both ran without errors so cannot reproduce
this one seems a bit older than yours by the build number cl_device_version opencl 1.2 build 43 cl_driver_version 1.2.0.43 cl_device_opencl_c_version opencl c 1.2 the second one is i think still the most recent intel cpu driver cl_device_version opencl 2.1 build 0 cl_driver_version 18.1.0.0920 cl_device_opencl_c_version opencl c 2.0 i used gcc 7.4.0 on ubuntu 18.4
to my experience it is not a problem to set affinity with the intel opencl runtime for cpus

57111565
cpu	affinity
the intel opencl runtime using intel threading building blocks under the hood inside each process would then spawn one thread per assigned core adhere to the host process cpu mask as expected
maybe the result is different if you set the first thread s affinity and also depends on where in the program you set relative to where the opencl runtime spawns it s threads
as you seem to already have run your code in a debugger and narrowed things down to clcreatecontext

put	get
the method hiderow hides the rows in a given range so we have to use hiderows were you can use the integer 11 in this case to hide the entire row
you didn t put any semicolons
you didn t get any of these errors as i suppose you were testing the code changing the value of d39

57111676
hide	show
so in order to hide several rows depending of a few cells you have to get the event information e and get the cell that is being edited

vbscript	vba
according to this dictionary is also faster up to a point another alternative i ve done myself was to make use of the .net hashtable making reference to mscorlib.dll
i ve not done any performance tests of that versus vbscript dictionary so i don t if it s worth the effort but it was fun to implement
an example is at cannot iterate hashtable in vba excel

if the folder containg your images is urunler try if the folder containg your images is products try if that fails try using an absolute path instead of a relative path


57112935
folder	directory

first add the file folder to your .gitignore file in your case the app-level one and not the project-level one go to the terminal in android studio and type in these commands git rm -r the-directory-to-remove in which case your the-directory-to-remove is the file folder
the above command will remove the specified directory from git

octal	decimal
integer is represented in four forms decimal binary octal and hexadecimal form
python provides built-in bin functions to convert from non-binary number to binary number oct function to convert from non-octal number to octal number and hex function to convert from non-hexadecimal number to hexadecimal number
these functions return a string literal to represent the values

for-loop	loops

this form of the for-loop is only for arithmetic operations
you need to use a while loops instead

57114365
int	double
our customview initializer looks like this and you call your customview initializer using the showtragets tuple values which is id int state bool x double y double so when you do this you are providing double values for x and y instead of cgfloat
as the cast from double to cgfloat cannot be implicit you need to do it explicitly


57114698
range	minimum
e.g for 8 00 the minimum interval is 8 00-8 30 not 7 30-8 00 8 00-8 30 reference roundup rounddown 2
split the range into sub-range of your interval
example from 8 to 9 in interval of 30min is 8-8 30 8 30-9 using range range is a pretty basic thing normally you have two variables start end and write the same comparaison other and other

children	parent
trash-1 children 2 3 trash-2 parent 1 trash-3 parent 1 suppose you want to serialize trash-1 the parent
here is how jackson proceeds 1 jackson tries to serialize trash-1 fields which the children field trash-2 and trash-3 that interest us
so it starts the children serialization

57115009
children	parent
o it starts the children serialization
2 but to serialize trash-2 jackson also needs to serialize it fields which the parent field that is trash-1


57115009
children	parent
so it starts the children serialization
2 trash-2 is serialized no parent field serialization required
2 trash-3 is serialized no parent field serialization required

spaces	delimiter

basically what i need is for the loop to run through the characters in a string until it finds three consecutive spaces
the string contains morse code and each letter is separated by 3 characters because in american morse letters can contain 0 1 or 2 spaces so 3 is the minimum letter delimiter

57115246
rank	max

something like also note that rank can return multiple rows for a given value if that subquery returns that id multiple times
if that is possible you would need to reduce that is possible to one row only returned into the clause easiest done with a max

57115266
octal	decimal
i don t know why 0011 is converted to an empty string
a leading zero in a number tells javascript to treat it as octal
so 0011 means 9 in decimal and thus removefirstcharacter 0011 is really removefirstcharacter 9

57115351
floating-point	integer
so in the end we reduced the floating-point problem to an integer problem which is easier to check numerically
integer lattice points on a hypershpere is there a simple way to compute the number of ways to write a positive integer as the sum of three squares
s square root is an integer

post	get

it depends from the form action if your form action call a function inside your wordpress for example in function.php you can pick the email address get_option admin_email and use the email address get_option admin_email to send the post data
if the form action call a function external to you wordpress you can add the email as an hidden field in your form and get the value in the _post object

57115403
put	get
f the form action call a function external to you wordpress you can add the email as an hidden field in your form and get the value in the _post object
because you form is added by javascript you can add the hidden field by javascript before the form submit maybe using jquery you also can do this in vanilla js  if you print the script directly inline with php if you put the script in js file you can print the hidden field outside with php and then pick the value with jquery or also vanilla

try-catch	exception-handling
you have to handle the exception-handling using try-catch block
however in order for your code to look more readable create a function that will handle the exception-handling and return the desired result
in case if you care what will be the result map it and filter for the result of your function is not null otherwise ignore it but watch logs for any errors

seaborn	colormap

based on the sample image it seems you want a kdeplot rather than a jointplot so you can use sns.kdeplot directly plotting onto subplots using matplotlibs s subplots or using seaborn s facetgrid
in sns.kdeplot you can use cmap to specify a colormap and and cbar_kws to control the color bar

for-loop	arrays	for-loop	arrays
you re getting that error because you re changing the length of the arrays mid-loop
at the beginning of loops you have 11 elements and you use that to define how many times your for-loop will go
when you get to hello5 you pop the last element off making your arrays 10 elements long

57117035
for-loop	arrays
when you get to hello5 you pop the last element off making your arrays 10 elements long
however your for-loop will still try to access the 11th element

filtering	grouping
aybe it s a matter of mysql versions as suggested in the comments as pwe your question the solution should be to arrive to the solution not using grouping by
how about order by + limit for example in this case the order by brings the needed row first the limit makes only one row to be returned another approach less efficient is by left join + null in that approach the inequality enforces tye latest row not to be joined to the other table filtering by that criteria will extract the last row

for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
ry it separately if it is not known yet even if you wanted a for-loop still you would not use an arrays but loops over the characters in string.valueof num of course if -s can be used in place of the switch that part was completely fine in your attempt too arrays have no natural place here because too arrays would have to be populated first your code did not work because your code had only 1 of these 4 lines the and too arrays was left empty which means full of zeroes
and then a separate loops would do the checks the result is same functionality a bit of wasted memory the arrays and 4-5 extra lines of code to type again too arrays

ou can get the memory address of the data b refers to fairly easily to actually correspond that with a variable name though the only way to do that would be to look through the variables and find the one that points to the right place
you can do this by using the globals function there are two big problems with this solution namespaces - you can t put this code in a function because if you do that and then call this code from another function then this code won t work

t s .net core 2.1 http trigger function app v2 i wanted to get rid of any directory that start with  cause my sftp server has .cache folder and .ssh folder with keys
also didn t want to have to deal with folder names like  or . what i will end up doing is projecting the sftpfile into a type that i work with and return that to the caller in this case this case will be a logic app


57119963
folder	directory
i ll then pass that object into a stored procedure and use openjson to build up my monitoring table
this is basically the first step in creating my sftp processing queue that will move files off my sftp folder and into my data lake blob for now until i come up with something better i guess
the reason i used .workingdirectory is because i created a user with home directory as home

put	get
 suspect it s caused because you put a colon in front of nextline you wrote when it should be but i suggest getting rid of the referencing clause and just using new and old in triggers as the referencing clause reduces confusion

onchange	onsubmit

you are doing multiple thing wrong here for every input you should have only 1 onchange handler every input have name attribute to work with state
for example and onchangehandler function should be and finally your onsubmit function should be note you won t get value here in console.log beacuse sestate is async you should use callback in setstate to make console.log

with python primitives only you would need to do a nested-loop one way or another. however the data you describe seem to fit well the tabular model. if you find yourself doing tabular operations often you may be better off using a specialized tool like pandas note that merely not seeing the word for does not mean you are actually not looping. consider for example the following here although there is only one explicit looping through d you are actually having an extra loops hidden in the list creation. another hidden looping goes with the magic. hence with the above code you are actually looping through your dataset 2 times with 2 nested-loops each time. granted that these hidden loops are typically faster for large enough datasets this solution will be slower than the one-liner from above

f you followed recommended route from here try this check with steps in not recommended way in above tutorial if every listed files is same as in your project especially in root android gradlew wrapper gradle-wrapper.properties set probably you have version 5.1.1 in root android build.gradle set check if in root android app build.gradle sdk version is set to minimum 28 for compilesdkversion 28 and targetsdkversion 28 if you still get error then here is what helped me delete .gradle and .m2 folder from directory as well with in app folder root android .gradle and root build flutter doctor flutter clean flutter packages pub cache clean if you changed as me app icon then run flutter packages pub run flutter_launcher_icons main it will render icons for app - without it print same error with gradlew
invalidate caches in android studio if nothing from above works open android project as module you can do open android project by opening any file inside android folder for example manifest then bar above code will shows with link to open for editing in android studio more here then click on gradlew tab on the left and compile app - should show now more detailed error message

printf	strlen
printf s s specifier stops printing when it first encounters null
to see this in detail start by looking closely at the data in each buffer strlen buffer1 11 sizeof buffer1 12 the buffer actually contains hello pipe1 0 the compiler allocates 12 bytes 11 bytes of text and 1 byte for the null terminator
checking the return value of write show that it actually writes all 12 bytes n_written 12 it does this because write s count argument tells it to you can change this to write only the contents of the string but then you need to be sure that readbuffer is null terminated

shadowing	named
the existence of an assignment to a variable named in a function causes that function to have a local variable with that named shadowing any global or builtin by that named unless this behavior is explicitly overridden by a global or nonlocal statement
import os is an assignment to the os variable named causing func_a to have a local os variable
this local is unassigned when func_a tries to print os.name causing the unboundlocalerror

the methods below only support files upto 2gb for 32bit python versions typically one should use np.memmap to use the array without loading on to the ram
from the numpy docs memory-mapped files are used for accessing small segments of large files on disk without reading the entire file into memory. example usage however since your files as already stored as .npy files i stumbled upon np.lib.format.open_memmap which creates or loads memory mapped .npy files
the usage would be as follows identical to what you d do with np.memmap here s the docs for the second function from this answer

malloc free calloc realloc
i have no idea why iso c++ left out calloc and realloc both are very useful for large allocations especially realloc for resizing a std vector of trivially-copyable objects that might have room to grow its mapping without copying
but since new delete aren t guaranteed to be compatible with malloc free and new is replaceable libraries can t very easily use calloc and realloc even under the hood

if you want to customise for your own needs and use whatever coding language you prefer amazon ec2 offers flexibility and a whole range of ec2 instance types to choose from in conjunction with elastic beanstalk services for deploying onto amazon ec2
amazon-web-services lambda is a service for running code in response to events such as changes to data in an amazon s3 bucket and amazon dynamodb tables or as compute services to run your code in response to http requests using amazon api gateway or api calls made by using amazon-web-services sdks
this is an ideal computing platform for applications when running within the standard runtime environment

replace the contents of userprofile with your desired directory

57132400
put	get
hat being said i d highly recommend you use the safe cast operator in combination with let to avoid a crash if you get null
in case you didn t check that can happen returns uri the uri of the data this intent is targeting or null you can go with something like alexey romanov mentioned - run an if-else statement to check if data is null and put it directly into an array using arrayof if it isn t null


57132489
integer	unsigned
for casts you can use
however if the destination type is a superset of the original one and converting it cannot lose information such as your case you can self-document that by using this particular case cannot overflow but for other cases you can prevent overflows using functions note that overflowing an integer operation panics by default in debug builds
if what you want is wrapping arithmetic just like in old c you can use with the additional bonus that it works for signed as well as unsigned values

57133736
integer	unsigned
then converting 128-bit unsigned integer to hex ascii
the first part is like for this you ll need code to multiplying 128-bit integers by 10 compare two 128-bit integers subtract a byte from a 128-bit integer and add a byte to a 128-bit integer
for multiplying by 10

57133736
int	chars
i ll also use nasm syntax because i m less familiar with masm syntax but it should be easy enough to convert to masm syntax left shift
you d split the 128-bit int into 4 32 bit pieces and use something like for addition of two 128-bit numbers for addition of a dword zero extended byte to a 128-bit number for subtraction of a dword zero extended byte from a 128-bit number for comparing 128 bit int the second part converting to hex ascii is fairly trivial - mostly just a for each byte from highest to lowest
convert byte to 2 hex chars possibly using a lookup table thing

57133960
int	chars

interestingly the actual bytes of a string are treated as unsigned 8-bit int
in utf-8 the values of those int are combined in various ways to determine which glyph or chars should appear on the screen when those values are encountered in the data

57133960
int	chars
n utf-8 the values of those int are combined in various ways to determine which glyph or chars should appear on the screen when those values are encountered in the data
utf-8 is a variable-byte-length encoding which can have between 1 and 4 bytes per chars 8 to 32-bit


57133960
integer	unsigned
for numbers particularly integers implementations can vary but most representations use four bytes with the most significant byte first in order and the first bit of the first byte as the sign with signed integers or the first bit is simply the most significant bit for unsigned integers
this is referred to as big-endian ordering of bytes in a multi-byte integer
there is also little-endian encoding and integers can in principle use any number of bytes but the most typically implemented are 1 2 4 and sometimes 8 where bit-wise you have 8 16 32 or 64 respectively

57133995

57134359
for-loop	loops
n your for-loop as you go through the line you could just add a if statement which determines whether you re at the end of a word or not
i think the problem in your code is the multiple loops but i am not sure of the problem in your code


57134362
strlen	strcpy
you need to use strlen instead
on a 32-bit platform you d allocate just 5 bytes for an 8 byte string which means strcpy str astr
could crash or corrupt memory enough for the next realloc to crash

modern gcc defaults to assuming a pentium-pro compatible 32-bit target but you can still use if you want
inner loop with gcc -o3 -m32 is note the fxch to put the operands in the right order for fcomi and the fstp st 1 to pop val from the x87 stack leaving maxval at the top
and if you compile with for example in a 64-bit build you get efficient maxss

57135194
integer	unsigned
ou choose the number of bits that comes out it checks for valid values of 8 16 32 but i suppose you could change that you choose whether to treat it as a signed or unsigned integer
it will check for range issues given the combination of signed unsigned and number of bits though you ll want to improve the error handling

taking consideration that you have correctly commented the first connection string which is not shown correct from your post i will suggest to check the following

57135407
pull	push
whether it is a branch or not depends on your personal definition of branch. you can keep adding more commits to this thing-that-is-like-a-branch and the pull request automatically updates so that people who are on the web site viewing the pull request can see the new commits
the method by which you add new commits to your pull request can also vary from one hosting provider to another
for github you simply git push to whichever branch you used on whichever repository you used to initiate the pull request

57135556
submit	submission
mplicit submission with enter key is i think an absolute must except if an absolute must causes more annoyance than an absolute must solves but an absolute must s extremely rare
generally screen reader and keyboard-only users are much slower than normal users and i confirm that an absolute must s quite annoying to have to navigate manually to the submit button when the enter key doesn t work as expected

int	double	int	double
putting that all together gives although bir can be left out since it is 1 and my personal inclination would be to leave the constants as constants in the equation which makes it easier to verify if int based math is not desired you ll need to change a few types to do things with floats or double
in this form all the constants are specified as double values so that each term is evaluated as a double with one cast in the last term to also calculate that as a double
this result can be cast to an int if necessary

daemons	launchd	daemons	systemd

in addition to the helpful answer from mahmoud control-m isn t great with daemons
sure you can launchd a daemon but anything running for a substantial length of time into several weeks and beyond is prone to error and you can often end up with daemons that are running that control-m is no longer aware of if the systemd has issues that cause the control-m agent to assume the daemon job has failed and then launchd another one

min	median
you make exactly o log #elements steps and since your #elements is exactly min n m the complexity is o log min n+m
there are exactly n + m 2 elements smaller than the median and the same amount of elements greater
let s think about them as two halves let the median belong to one of your choice

57138011
range	median
it must be in range from 0 to n
then you know since there are exactly n + m 2 elements smaller than the median that you have to choose n+m 2 - x elements from the bigger array
then you have to check if that partition actually works

sorting	grouping

the django orm doesn t directly expose a way to do this that i can think of but if you have the database do the sorting for you you can at least get your items pre-grouped in your queryset
i would therefore do this by using itertools.groupy to handle organizing the values with the same id into a shared iterable after using .order_by id on the queryset to grouping the elements by id

the issue is about versioning mismatch in package.json and app.json in your expo project
you need to perform upgrade as given below update your expo sdk versioning open the app.json file from your expo project and change sdkversion to 33.0.0 update your dependancies open the package.json file and update the following dependencies update the jest-expo to 33.0.0 in devdependencies update the react-native to in dependencies update the jest-expo to 33.0.0 in dependencies update the react to 16.8.3 in dependencies after making the changes run npm install and then start your expo project by clearing the older js build cache by running expo r -c and you will be good to go

folder	dir
thougt i should share what worked for me
make subdirectory name the same as the repo name and run mvn sonar commands from there sonarqube uses a java library from eclipse jgit for the git work and this checks if the sonar.projectbasedir has .git folder and some other git files folder inside among other things
n.b when the jenkins git scm clones it puts the contents of the repo directly on the workspace no dir is created setup sonarqube 7.7 jenkins declarative pipeline sample code

57142557
range	max

while iterating on a range can be pythonic in some situations it s often better to iterate over the contents of the list directly
finding the lengths seems like a good match for a multi-loop generator expression that gets passed to max while printing the table calls for zip i renamed the functions and some of the variables for a mix of clarity and style reasons

mp3	wav
see the only common format is mp3
oddly enough wav is supported by all the other browsers which is strange because wav is primarily a windows thing


57143124
width	margin

to fix this you need to remove width 100 from wrapper and consider min-width 0 instead
you can also remove the min-width applied to .l and you need to consider flex-shrink 0 on .r or replace its width by min-width if you want the element to remain at least equal to max-width when there is a small amount of text add flex-grow 1 to better illustrate the 1 here is another example with overflowing margin that you can hardly notice you can see that we have a long text forcing we element to not shrink the min-width constraint the element is taking full width and we are centring the content

57143152
flip	slide
then the default is slide horizontal movement from the right
other options are fade flip and show and the names of any registered custom transitions. none of the standard transitions is currently making use of any given transition parameters.


57143278
bash	subshell

you have one misunderstanding with the bash comand lines ampersand operator
the trailing ampersand directs the shell to run the command in the background that is it is forked and run in a separate subshell as a job asynchronously

57143472
post	put

i had such a simple reason for this not working that i must post my answer to prevent anybody else going through this
don t put repositories and dependencies in the file called build.gradle projet yourprojectname

57143619
qtimer	qthread
hen you use a qthread you create that event loop but when using time.sleep you are blocking a qthread preventing timerevent method from being invoked
so the solution is to replace time.sleep with another option qeventloop + qtimer that does not block time.sleep


57144624
range	minimum

the value range of the mantisse and the exponent depend on the bit length of the float you use
the exponent is responsible for the maximum and minimum representable numbers while the mantisse is responsible for the precision of the displayable numers loosely speaking the granularity of the numbers

57145349
dpkg	apt

1 install libzip4 curl -ol sudo dpkg -i libzip4_1.1.2-1.1_amd64.deb 2 then install mysql workbench on ubuntu 19.04 by running the commands curl -ol community_8.0.16-1ubuntu18.04_amd64.deb sudo dpkg -i mysql-workbench-community_8.0.16-1ubuntu18.04_amd64.deb 3 install missing dependencies libatkmm-1.6-1v5 libglibmm-2.4-1v5 libgtk2.0-0 libgtkmm-3.0-1v5 libpcrecpp0v5 libpython2.7 libsigc++-2.0-0v5 libtinfo5 by this command

57145592
typedef	struct
you may rewrite the typedef also the following way to declare a pointer of the type structname that is the same as there is no need to define the structure struct_name
that is the type struct struct_name may be incomplete
so this approach usually used when you need only a pointer of a structure type in some compilation unit

57145619
maven	pom.xml	ant	pom.xml

if you want to modify your .java files or any other file using maven or ant you can call an external program script to modify the files for you
maven pom.xml example with ant eather way you ll have to write an external script create a runnable jar python shell script exe... to do what you want like reading all .java files looking for a string pattern putting a string a line above.

post	get
ending a payload body on a get request might cause some existing implementations to reject a get request
so you must send your payload in post to be working perfectly


57146002
width	height

i think you mean this convert kernel.png -chop x60+0+240 -chop x60+0+110 result.png the syntax is -chop widthxheight+xoffset+yoffset as i didn t specify the width it chops the whole lot
i worked out the height by subtracting 110 from 170 to give 60

57146002
width	height
i worked out the height by subtracting 110 from 170 to give 60
the x-offset is zero because i am cutting the entire width and the y-offset is 110 because that s the distance from the top
note that i did 2 separate chops one for each chunk of white-space to be removed

57146202
put	get
ut since you will want the same access and getting rules for a lot of similar attributes it makes more sense to create an specialised descriptor class - that will know the source of an attribute and always go to it source to get or set its source value
the code bellow along with the car tire screw classes provide an example of this and in the interactive interpreter we have and of course if you don t want to allow any of the parent s attributes to be modified from the contained classes just leave out or put a guard flag on the __set__ method


57146306
border-color	background-color	border-color	background-color
instead set the border to 1 and make it transparency or match the background-color border-width 1
border-color rgba 0 0 0 0.0
background-color rgba 0 0 0 0.0

57146691
put	get

you just need to put check on the basis of your current time
with calendar instance you will get the current time

57147580
pull	push
by doing so you can forbid everyone to push to the protected branches and proceed on a white-list basis
you can define restrictions for pushing no merge commits on this branch mandatory pull requests before merging etc
this will stop people from randomly pushing to production branches and rule out major sources for issues

57148198
tinyint	varchar
your values appear to be all numbers under 8 so you could use a tinyint type
if you have different storage types varchar int float i would create a separate column per type val_varchar val_int val_float
the primary key for this table now becomes a composite primary key id data_type

57148338
jmenubar	jmenuitem
f you don t you will get jmenubar has a add jmenu method that you are already using
but if you are passing a jmenuitem a add jmenu method that you are already using won t be called but the inherited add component from java.awt.container will be instead that s why you can add any component though only jmenuitem is correctly supported

in case you are interested in alternative solution you can use to unpack the dictionary values and then use zip to get three different lists
here i am using map to convert the output into lists which is what you want

57148979
wildfly	jboss
if library jars are inside ear lib then application.xml will work fine since it is under ear app-inf lib jboss or wildfly will not understand this appication.xml deployment descriptor
so use jboss-app.xml which wildfly understands even if the library directory is different
solution simply copy complete content of application.xml to jboss-app.xml and place it meta-inf folder also make sure to delete application.xml file or not making this get generated through pom.xml

57149215
httpcookie	cookiejar

they are not compatible objects and nothing other than httpcookie can read the file it creates
you need to use a mojo useragent cookiejar with mojo useragent

57149357
inherited	properties

you need to implement init from decoder decoder in the subclassing and call the superclass init although you don t need to implement it for the superclass init for cardlistresponse notice the call to super.init another option is to skip inherited altogether and use composition instead
in the subclassing you make a properties for the codeanddetails array instead this way you won t need a special init method anymore

57149357
superclass	subclassing
in the subclassing you make a property for the codeanddetails array instead this way you won t need a special init method anymore
cardlistresponse can then be changed to below and the superclass can be removed
in the long run i think this is a more attractive solution

57149477
inherited	properties
he getboundingclientrect function could be called from the element object the getboundingclientrect function is the most general base class from which all objects in a document inherited
the getboundingclientrect function only has methods and properties common to all kinds of elements


57149523
httpcookie	cookiejar

i ve uploaded a new version of httpcookie mozilla and a new version of httpcookie mozilla includes a sample program that solves this issue
load your data using http cookie then convert a new version of httpcookie mozilla whatever format that you like by calling scan with a callback inside that callback convert a new version of httpcookie mozilla to the mojo cookie response object alternately write a subclass of httpcookie that reads your format the httpcookie way but populates a mojo cookiejar instead

since there is no dir attribute to start then no internal s will show


57149710
range	max
if you wanted to be safe you can use something that maps the range 0- max length of a string onto the range 0- 1
the max length of a string depends on the amount of memory you have assuming 64 bit so i d recommend doing...not this
source practically you can also just check all of the strings you are about to compare and choose the length of the longest string in that list as the max value

57150183
multiplying	add

then you create a new 3 columns red count green count and blue count and multiplying quantity by the color flag
then use sum function to add sum function in the other sheet

57150413
integer	fractions

the cause of this issue turned out to be the data type of selectedindex which was an unsigned integer
despite the fact that verticallineannotation s x y value type is icomparable if you are using the iseditable true function the drag step size is fractions and if bound to an integer type it will continually round to 0 making it incapable of movement

57150717
boost	allocator

if you are willing to pay a high runtime cost in exchange for minimal constraints you can use std function with std any for c++14 use boost any std any and std function are both owning type erased wrappers
you may have heap allocator for this or you might fit inside both small object optimization

inherited	subclassing

you are describing the basic usage of __init_subclass__ hook docs whenever a class inherited from another class __init_subclass__ is called on that class
this way it is possible to write classes which change the behavior of subclassing

57151364
superclass	subclassing

you might be able to just abstract this functionality out into another method and call another method from the superclass s constructor
if subclassing call the superclass s constructor which they should then another method will get executed when a subclassing is instantiated

57151364
superclass	subclassing
if subclassing call the superclass s constructor which they should then that method will get executed when a subclassing is instantiated
and then as long as subclassing don t overwrite the functionality of _onsubclasscreation the behavior should be as expected

udp	tcp
even if the sender did guarantee this behavior the receiver could still experience an overfull buffer or temporary network hardware issue that would prevent the packet from being received properly so any guarantee on the sending side would still be meaningless
you just can t rely on in-order delivery of udp packets without a higher-level protocol on top no matter what
if you need in-order retrieval and retries but can t use tcp look at quic for an example of how to do it

57154828
int	chars
when you insert an int into a chars stream the output will be a number with equivalent format to num_put put
so if you want to see output like y then you must insert either a chars or a chars string
if you want to output one object like a chars and another like an integer then those objects must have a different type

57154870
put	get	min	max

your problem is that when you run the line your random numbers haven t been put into your array so you re setting min to zero up front

onchange	onsubmit

you have set up code to handle your form state and onchange in the parent component but you aren t using code in the child component

qspinbox	qmainwindow
 suppose that ui is an object of a class generated by qt designer if you check the code generated by pyuic the following instruction should be qtcore.qmetaobject.connectslotsbyname .. the connectslotsbyname method makes an auto-connection if the slot has the following pattern in your case on_xoffsetspinbox_editingfinished meets that requirement since on_xoffsetspinbox_editingfinished has an xoffsetspinbox object that is a qspinbox that has an editingfinished signal that you can check if you comment on the connection you made and you will see that you still observe the same problem
a possible solution is change the name of the static method so that a possible solution does not match the indicated pattern for example class appwindow qmainwindow def __init__ self # .. self.ui.xoffsetspinbox.editingfinished.connect lambda appwindow.on_another_name self # .. staticmethod def on_another_name instance # .. another solution is to use the pyqtslot decorator by passing a name parameter that does not match the indicated pattern


57155461
int	chars
the difference between a string and an int is that the former is intended to contain chars data like a name or a sentence
mathematical comparisons like apply to numeric data like int and floating point values
so to get the behavior you re looking for you need to convert your text data into a numeric type

the further openmp tricks are another subject not related to segfaults refactor the indexing so that better cache-line aligned processing re-uses row-wise data-elements from already fetched cache-line neighbours and best if shared access to third -cells is completely avoided performance boosts will reward these efforts performance will get boosted if or above will become transposed as the iteration will follow the row-wise memory-blocks already pre-fetched into cache-line data-access costs will drop from about down to on cache-hits 200 x do not hesitate to read more and learn the needed technical details about cache-hierarchies coalescing memory-access-patterns and about smart cache-line tricks to increase the cache-line re-use instead of re-fetching the data that was once already fetched just by a poor order of index iterations

alternate approach another approach is to design your tables in a relational way parent objects child objects then to retrieve a parent based on a set of child ids 12 14 use an anyof query on the children table conclusion i ve presented two optional approaches that would both be efficient solutions for you question
the first option is to add a simple array of child ids and index that using multientry index the other option is to put the children in a separate table
if you d go for the second option you might also have some help from using the dexie-relationships addon to query children with parent included or parent with children included

ut unfortunately plumbum does a local pipe mechanism so grep output goes to plumbum and then plumbum pipes plumbum to the next command - meaning the cat can t swallow the exit code 1 there will be an exception thrown before plumbum

if a numeric value is found we can use setvalue using j + 1 as arrays are 0-indexed we need to add 1 for the row in getrange example 1 slower example 2 faster as themaster correctly pointed out the script will run faster if we build an arrays and use setvalues instead so here s the code to do that if you re experiencing performance issues references getvalues javascript if statements javascript arrays typeof

next	except
after cancelling the corresponding counter the next maximum element in this same vector gives the second most repeated letter
hope that helps edit the same thing in c style without any library function except printf at the end after the comment but i have to do it without algorithm and cctype

inherited	subclassing
subclassing must parameterize the implementation of an abstract class
fully inherited the implementation of the abstract class
have your own implementation

57163181
put	get
if you put the above code into the typescript playground you can see the inferred types by mousing over the variable names and if you try changing names and types of things you ll see that you get compiler warnings
you should also get auto-complete suggestions when you start typing

postgresql	mysql
ostgresql on postgresql you need to use the random function as illustrated by the following example select artist|| - ||title as song from song order by random when running the aforementioned sql query on postgresql we are going to get the following result set notice that the songs are being listed in random order thanks to the random function call used by random order by clause
mysql on mysql you need to use the rand function as illustrated by the following example select concat concat artist - title as song from song order by rand when running the aforementioned sql query on mysql we are going to get the following result set notice that the songs are being listed in random order thanks to the rand function call used by random order by clause


57163694
queue	fifo

if anything fails along the way the message will eventually endup in a dead letter queue - either the same on or one per queue - that makes no difference but nothing that was supposed to happen after the event failed would happen
doesn t even sound to me like you need a fifo queue at all in this case though there is no real harm except for the slighlty higher cost and lower throughput limits

57164137
post	put

looking for that error brought my to all kinds of reasons such as but the real reason turned out to be the one described in this post i should have used load instead of import
not knowing what was going on docker s error message didn t put me in any sense on track towards the import cause till i stumbled over this post

57164519
persistent	transient
ts using transient variables
such variables is not persistent to database but its are lost as well when the wait state come


57164555
directoryentry	ldapconnection
i don t know of a way to make it not do that
directoryentry has no way to override how it verifies the ssl certificate either
ldapconnection does which you can see here but it might be a little harder to work with

57164637
for-loop	loops	for-loop	loops
you initialize the perm vector to all zeros and according to your logic block within loops you fail to update perm at index i if the inner if statement is false
since you are in a for-loop you continue on to the next iteration e.g i i+1 and therefore perm at the last index can never be updated
instead use a while loops and set your iterator to advance by one only when your inner if statement is true

57164865
portrait	landscape

when i quit avmediaselectionviewcontroller avfullscreenviewcontroller return to portrait mode
hold the device in landscape and keep video in portrait mode then click media button again the crash happened

57165134
folder	directory
reate a .htaccess file your laravel root directory if a .htaccess file does not exists already
normally a .htaccess file is under your public_html folder now you should be able to access the website without the public index.php part


57165423
hide	show
se show and hide instead
when you set windowstartuplocation to centerscreen ther is a problem after the window is show any programmatical changes to the window position will be ignored


57165473
put	get
ersonally i like to use them when i get an error and i stare at the screen scratching my head wondering what exactly the screen means or in the case of something broad
in the example you gave i would personally put the screen as name too short name please enter a name greater than 10 characters just something so that the end user who may not exactly know the needed length would be able to understand why them are getting such an error hope this helped


57165475
firefox	safari
inside the browser s dom the input value is stored attribute defaultvalue true for all browsers and the attribute value is empty not true for safari
my workaround for this confusion is some javascript note that date.parse 27.04.2017 works with chromium but not with firefox


57166023
for-loop	loops
after you re done the foreach loops loops through your toremove list and use divisible.remove value to remove those
change your foreach to a for-loop which will allow you to use divisible.removeat i
but you will have to make sure you don t skip a value on the next iteration of the for-loop since removing a value changes the size of the list

57166079
int	chars

the issue is that the column is factor which gets coerced to int storage mode value
convert the issue to chars before looping better would be to use either while reading read.csv read.table or if we are creating with data.frame as in both cases the default option is and the default option can create some issues similar to this

57166216
matplotlib	cartopy

the usual axes in matplotlib are rectangular
for some projections in cartopy however it does not make sense to show a rectangle where part of it isn t even defined

57166333
post	get
however you can use some linux bash to manipulate the ouput of a cluster dump to get the fields you want
take a look at this blog post on medium
as to the do all resources matter the answer is no

57166500
button	checkbox

you can use jquery and ajax for that .i.e problem 1 php execution example one as there are around 20 entries if you will click on submit button you will never get which row the user have clicked
so to solve this you can do like below your php file now your ajax call will be like below your php page problem 2 php execution example two you need something to recognize which checkbox is been switched you don t need to use ajax here .do like below in above code - this will be used to recognize which rows switch has been change so we will update that row only in php file

57166672
move	drag

because of this i have move the navigator.geolocation implementation to the init function of the component and simplified the ondrag implementation to take the passed-in attributes
this will initially update the map with a marker for the current location and will then allow the user to drag the marker which updates selectedlatitude and selectedlatitude

57166843
filtering	grouping
are just virtual views of the all mail folder that filtering out all messages that do not have the corresponding gmail label
that s why if you add a label to a grouping of messages they will show up in your inbox and in a new folder that gets created that matches the name of the label that you just created


57166905
for-loop	loops

you need to pay attention to this line m is used in the for-loop to limit the quantity of iterations done
the previous statement means that loops will go from 2 to the half of the value of n

57167148
dplyr	rlang
library stringr dplyr arrange data desc
rlang sym str_c column_ name


57167252
for-loop	while-loop

the reason why the inner for-loop is required and why the makes sense to repeatedly add to the list songs is that the spotify api uses pagination to avoid having to return more data than necessary in api responses
so tracks is different on each iteration of the while-loop

57168233
accessor	properties
since version 5.4 laravel have made these properties public
i d recommend either updating to a newer version of laravel writing your own custom class that adds an accessor method or use the pry bar technique to force the protected variables into the public api


57168293
goto	break

you can use below code for your program - and the function - i have removed goto as it is not recommended
you can achieve similar functionality using while true and providing a break statement to exit the program

57168331
int	double

i ve had similar problem although i don t think we changed the column type from int to varint - it was varint from the beginning
the only thing that worked for me was double conversion hack

57168363
ready	each

to use that js script all you need is an ajax call once the page is ready the ajax call will retrieve the data jobs from your flask route as json data and insert the data jobs from your flask route in the table with no need for jinja at all
or if the data jobs from your flask route s not necessary for you to use a table you can use the inline display in your frontend where your jobs will float next to each other as long as there is space otherwise your jobs will fall to the next line you will loop over your jobs exactly as you did but instead of having rows and cells you will have divs or something like that

57168584
for-loop	loops
termination
increment the initialization expression sets up the initial conditions for the for-loop
loops will stop when the termination expression evaluates to false

57168735
theano	tensorflow
theano uses the channels_first format nchw while tensorflow uses the channels_last format nhwc
as far as i know the channels_first format isn t supported for the tensorflow backend


57168827
try-catch	exception-handling
you can use try-catch to respond to a terminating error
in some cases -erroraction is used to terminate a non-terminating error so that error and exception-handling handling can be done from the perspective of a terminating error
see about preference variables for the expected usage of variable and the common parameter erroraction

57169102
int	chars
from the documentation the pos argument can specify the environment in which to look for the object in any of several ways as a positive int the position in the search list
as the chars string name of an element in the search list running the function lastassigned gives a dataframe df_head a simple example can help you to understand i hope this is what you were expecting
thanks you can also use parse function over here like you can replace the entire return with below line

57169334
put	get
once data get fetch this.props.products will have remote data and component will get re-render
you can put if condition in productview component


57169402
client-side	server-side	client-side	server-side
if you are building a solution that runs in a server-side context you should try to use components that have been made safe for unattended execution
or you should try to find alternatives that allow at least part of the code to run client-side
if you use an office application from a server-side solution the application will lack many of the necessary capabilities to run successfully

57169695
put	get
show it or not with details depending on git log options
put its parent s into the queue with details depending on git log options
the queue itself determines the order in which commits get shown but the parent linkage determines the ability for commits to get into the queue

57169892
for-loop	loops

that is because your for-loop fails the given condition to run
at 2 the condition is false since 0 is not less than 0 hence your loops won t run

57170104
countif	named
however the solution worked out based of a number of assumption and hope to offer only broad outline to be modified as real time solution according to actual layout of the working file assumptions named are in column b named start at row 11 for trial only rows up to 35 are used days span from column d to af approx column al is free and used for countif formula for solution with excel formulas populate column al of all the monthly sheets with formula countif d11 ae11 休息 in a blank sheet named main populate column b with list of all the named may be starting from row 11 now column c representing month1 may be added with formula similarly column d representing month1 may be added with formula and similarly add formula to all the 12 columns pointing towards 12 sheets in the workbook and the create a summation in next blank column result sheet layout - main and month sheets layout vba solution add one blank sheet named mainvba containing list of all the named in the column b starting from row 11 as done in sheet named main
alternatively this employee list could be created by using dictionary object and collecting all unique named case sensitive from all the monthly sheets
for using this code please add reference to microsoft scripting runtime

57170342
for-loop	loops
already from the beginning count starts at 0
the next line is a for-loop
what loops does is go through each value of x recall that

57170435
range	max	range	min
you can use vectorized methods to calculate the ratio if a value fell anywhere and then mask between valid range
this makes the assumption that all values that are non-null fall between min values and max values
if this requirement is not met then the step where you create the mask m will fail with an index error

57170548
build.gradle	gradlew

this is because you ve enabled enableproguardinreleasebuilds in your app-level build.gradle file
by enabling this you re instructing the gradlew to run proguard to shrink the java byte-code in release builds which ensures small size of release apks

57170548
build.gradle	gradlew
by enabling this you re instructing the gradlew to run proguard to shrink the java byte-code in release builds which ensures small size of release apks
to solve this issue we have two approaches first is to disable enableproguardinreleasebuilds in your app-level build.gradle file you are using react-native-fbsdk which is causing the crash in the release build
during the facebook authentication process the fbsdk accesses native webview for facebook authentication

plot	heatmap
here i use a heatmap to visualize and organize the 13 haralick parameters
the plot pretty clearly shows that images 1 and 3 are rather similar and quite different from image 2
still differences between image 1 and 3 can be seen

57170831
folder	directory

the file you are opening does not contain a folder a folder is just a filename therefore python interprets a folder as a relative path meaning a folder adds the current path to a folder beginning
you most likely run the program from therefore the file ends up in your home directory

57170831
folder	directory
you most likely run the program from therefore the file ends up in your home directory
there are multiple ways to deal with that give the output folder to the program as a command line argument hard-code an absolute path use a path relative to your script
therefore you first need to find out the path of your script like described here

57171122
for-loop	arrays

this will make your for-loop run only once
you want your for-loop run to run as many times as there are values in your arrays so that your for-loop run prints each value in your for-loop run

57171512
int	chars
so cast the data to string first then replace and then cast to int see the regex demo
details - a chars d+ - any one or more digits - end of string


57171551
hide	show
if the conditional is based on browser-sensing responsive design then javascripting can be bypassed show something in the sense that you would merely hide the condition which does not apply
in the example below if-part is show on mobile devices only
else-part is show on larger screens

57171576
put	get

you can either define a variable or put your map into the returned jsx
right now your map result just get lost because your map s not assigned to anything

this is a variant of swiftui presentaionlink does not work second time the following simplified code exhibits the behavior you re experiencing the sheet only displays once there appears to be a bug in swiftui when you put the .sheet inside a list or a foreach
if you move the .sheet outside of the list you should be able to get the correct behavior

build.gradle	gradlew

as your using one signal one signal is using an old version of 12.0.1 firebase and gms library s for this you need to add a resolution strategy to convert to the required version you can delete this from your build.gradle file as firebase-messaging is used in other library implementation com.google.firebase firebase-core 11.0.4 implementation com.google.firebase firebase-messaging 11.0.4 use this in your app build.gradle file and update google service version to 16.0.0 i have tried with only above dependencies
i have not added all other dependencies which you re using in the app you can analyze the app dependencies and see like which version libraries are using use below command in android studio terminal  gradlew app dependencies

57172159
oncreate	onnewintent

check if your launcher activity has android launchmode singletop in the manifest and you are trying to read the extras in the oncreate method
if that is your case only 1 instance of that class will be created so if the activity is in the background when the user touches a notification in the tray the method that is called is onnewintent

57172314
for-loop	loops
enerate a sequence of 5 integers arguments you can write your code with same results as or with an explicit loops redirected to tmpfile the printf method is the most efficient as the printf method executes only one bash statement versus multiple ones with a for-loop
remember bash has no jit compiler so the printf method parse each command each times in a loops


57172357
put	get

it helps to put your data into the correct classes posixct in this case

thanks folks for replying here is the answer that i was looking for i had following configuration on remote server 1 repo abc_123 clone to repo xyz_123 2 repo abc_123 has all the projects from branch_name dev repo xyz_123 has all the projects from branch_name feature 3 all above were created on remote server 4 we need to regularly pull all the changes from abc_123 to branch_name dev repo xyz_123 repo to make sure xyz_123 our feature branch never gets outdated to abc_123 our dev branch
our pull using these steps task-1 sync the feature branch first 1 git clone or repo init sync the xyz_123 feature branch 2 set origin url of each projects 3 go to each projects of this repo and perform task-2 task-2 1 git fetch origin dev a this fetch all the changes from dev branch pointed by origin url and put all the changes from dev branch pointed by origin url aside note name of the branch is dev our master branch from which our want to bring the change to feature branch 2 git merge --no-edit --no-ff origin dev b this will merge step-1 fetched changes to current branch feature branch 3 git push origin head refs for refs heads feature c this will push the pulled changes to feature branch in form of gerrit

getter	setter
the args array is converted to a list of the individual values in apply then the values themselves are passed as arguments
a function parameter never will exhibit a getter functionality
there are some horrible hacks to make identifiers in a certain scope act as getters setter but you should never do that and you d need to do that inside the function anyway

put	get
get the center coordinates clone the image and do the following on the clone threshold the image so that the inside of the black lines is white
if necessary use -connected-components to merge smaller black features into the white in the center apply some morphology open to make sure that the black lines are continuous floodfill the image with red starting in the center convert non-red to black and red to white put the processed clone into the alpha channel of the input input here is python wand code that is the equivalent to the above for opencv i would suggest that the following processing could be one way to do it
sorry i am not proficient with opencv threshold the image so that the inside of the black lines is white

spaces	delimiter
the docs say a b c - three tokens a b c quoted text untouched so spaces are part of the token

maven	pom.xml
you could explore the maven exec plugin capabilities and run custom commands during the build proccess check i want to execute shell commands from maven #39

here is the most updated code that is about a factor of 3 better than the equivalent numpy in response to the numba attempt here is one more attempt that gets down to 725μs by working around a bug where multiplying real and complex arrays would convert the real to a complex
manually coding the multiplication yields this

post	get
first you should remove observer when the view controller disappears so you should hold a reference to the listener take a look at this post on where to initialize and remove references and listeners
your valuedictionary should look something like but you are just doing which doesn t exist. if you need to get an update when the values in the server updates you d probably want to use .value not .childadded . also remove all previous values in business before the update. you should note there might be typos

inherited	properties	inherited	subclassing
onsider the following code in esnext static properties and methods are inherited by subclassing see mdn example
in typescript when something is inherited the usual rule is that you can override the inherited thing with something more specific but the inherited thing has to be assignable to the overridden thing


57173661
multiplying	add
ounter doesn t get meaningfully slower if t can t short-circuit all the cost is paid in the single counting pass but your foo1 in the same benchmark i used from point #2 longer input in list form goes from 106 µs to 185 µs if i just add a single d to the end of the pre-multiplication moves making the u and d counts the same and requiring two more count calls
foo2 only goes up to 143 µs from 140 µs presumably because moves actually got longer adding the d before multiplying by 100 meant the d went from 2900 elements to count to 3000

i m only using the form element for styling and maybe you ll want to use the jquery validation

switching	screens
on windows the key to switching is f11 on macos it s n a according to here i think that s a documentation error but i m sure you can find the appropriate key somewhere in the settings
you indicated you were indeed running full screens but the toolbar never displays in full screens for any project while it does display in non-full screens
submitting a bug report here with screens shot and good info on your setup is likely to quickly get you more information - or the confirmation that this is a bug and hopefully a quick fix

57174943
mongodb	bson

out of the two options above the best way is to just read the xml files and store into mongodb collection
this is because mongodb does not store data in json format but in binary json bson

57174949
post	get	post	put

if your use ngrok i believe your use ngrok will appear in the console this when your app is uninstalled post abc yourfile 200 ok if you believe that the webhook had been created
in delete_store_info.php put these line of code the webhook will catch the json shopify send when you uninstall your apps and put into file something.txt after that get the info you use to store in db

57175085
prop	each
each can then emit the computed area to its parent which can collect and compute the maximum
for example typically to support v-model your component would have a value prop
however since your components initialise their own data i have omitted that

57175250
webkit	blink
or compatibility reasons the old -webkit- prefixes were retained in blink removing support would break sites that relied on webkit prefixes
due to the above reason the old -webkit- prefixes were not replaced with blink specific counterparts and since chrome 28 no new prefixes have been or will be added

simpledateformat	zoneddatetime
localdate .parse 2017-10-16 .atstartofday zoneid.of australia victoria if you must use the terrible gregoriancalendar class use the new conversion method added to the old class
details your code is a strange mish-mash of the terrible legacy date-time classes simpledateformat gregoriancalendar with the modern java.time classes that supplanted them localdate
specifically zoneddatetime replaced gregoriancalendar

57176135
width	height
in my approach i ve opted to use min-resolution over resolution as this will at least select something close if the exact dpi isn t matched
for this to work you must not be setting the width property of the img elsewhere
height will be automatically calculated as is the default behavior

57176180
for-loop	loops

you are not storing the user inputs in an arrays in your for-loop
also in while loops you are again asking for user inputs

57176180
for-loop	loops
also in while loops you are again asking for user inputs
so remove your for-loop
also there is no need to store inputs in order to just find the maximum

57176211
dictionary	map

method launch from application class will launch a new instance of your stack class which will have an empty dictionary
if you want the lauched application to retain the values populated in dictionary than make dictionary a static map or populate your dictionary in start method

57176292
capitalize	toupper

in python the capitalize method converts the first character of a string to capital uppercase letter
if you are seeking to do the same with go you can range over the string contents then leverage the unicode package method toupper to convert the first rune in the string to uppercase then cast the string contents to a string then concatenate that with the rest of the original string

57176628
trie	tree
uffix tree is a trie containing all the suffices of a string with every non-branching edge chain compressed into a single long edge
the problem with an ordinary trie with all suffices is that all suffices has o n 2 nodes so it takes o n 2 memory


57176628
trie	tree

the compressed trie takes o n memory but it is still useless if you build it with o n 2 algorithm as you do in your code
you should use ukkonen s algorithm to construct suffix tree directly in compressed form in o n time

57177037
folder	directory
another question about keytool that explains more what it is
i think your problem here is that java_home should be the root folder of your java installation
in the bin directory you hopefully have the keytool binary

57177378
range	max	range	min
90 + 2.5 x 0 90 90 + 2.5 x 1 92.5 93 90 + 2.5 x 2 95 90 + 2.5 x 3 97.5 98 .
so it is just the mismatch between range default step amount
you can modulate this with maybe using a custom step amount with axis.setsteps on the bottom axis using a value that will divide the value max - min evenly

57177411
put	get
n this case i think you could put this case in layoutsubviews
if you do that this case will automatically get called when the light dark style changes so you wouldn t need to do anything else


57177535
atomic	lockless
another thing i would like to mention is std atomic the atomic library provides components for fine-grained atomic operations allowing for lockless concurrent programming
each atomic operation is indivisible with regards to any other atomic operation that involves the same object
while a mutex may be subject of os kernel functions an atomic access might be done exploiting cpu features without the necessity to enter the kernel

57177642
mouseover	mouseenter
mouseenter fires only once per time the user moves his mouse into the element
mouseover will fire a lot of times when the user moves their mouse over the element

keras	tensorflow

not sure if i faced the very same problem but tf.keras.backend.clear_session at the beginning of the cell in which the model keras in my case was constructed and trained helped to cut the clutter so only the current graph remains in the tensorboard visualization after repeated runs of the same cell
environment tensorflow 2.0 in colab with built-in tensorboard using the load_ext tensorboard trick

folder	directory	folder	dir
f the problem remains then try the following steps re-register all of the dlls and recompile the .mofs in the wbem folder and re-registering wmi service and provider
you can use the following script by saving to txt file then renaming to .bat and running from command prompt with admin right and changing focus to following directory c windows system32 wbem echo off sc config winmgmt start disabled net stop winmgmt y systemdrive cd windir system32 wbem for f s in dir b .dll do regsvr32 s wmiprvse regserver winmgmt regserver sc config winmgmt start auto net start winmgmt for f s in dir s b .mof .mfl do mofcomp s b

for this example i installed the following packages python3 version 3.6.9 python36-pip python36-virtualenv optional in case you work with virtualenv to manually add an existing python version to pyenv create a folder and add link to binaries there mkdir .pyenv versions 3.6.9 bin cd .pyenv versions 3.6.9 bin ln -s usr bin python3.6m.exe python3.6 ln -s python3.6 python3 ln -s python3 python ln -s usr bin pip3.6 pip3.6 ln -s pip3.6 pip3 ln -s pip3 pip ln -s usr bin virtualenv-3.6 virtualenv-3.6 ln -s virtualenv-3.6 virtualenv-3 ln -s virtualenv-3 virtualenv ps i imagine that other python versions can be installed through the regular windows system and symlinked likewise inside cygwin

folder	directory

if you used npm to install you used npm to install it will created a folder called node_modules possibly hidden in solution explorer click show all files button to check you used npm to install it
you have to write some script gulp grunt etc to move the files from node_modules directory to wwwroot lib file how to use npm with asp.net core how to install font-awesome in visual studio 2017 using asp.net core v2 if using gulp you can try with and can reference the css file in _layout.cshtml

accessor	properties	inherited	properties

non-static methods and accessor of a class lie on the prototype of the class so that every instance of the class inherited them
you can access them through the instances but them are not the own properties of the instances

57179513
accessor	properties

static methods and accessor lie on the class which is a function itself
how to set properties enumerable you can make non-static accessor which are properties on a prototype enumerable using object.defineproperty

57179513
accessor	properties
how to set properties enumerable you can make non-static accessor which are properties on a prototype enumerable using object.defineproperty
but this way it ll be mostly of no use as most of the useful functions such as object.keys object.values object.entries json.stringify et cetera do only look for own properties of objects
bringing properties on a prototype down to instances you can also bring copy properties on a prototype down to instances

57179737
squash	branch
telling from experience... git as a version tracking tool exists for the sole purpose of keeping history
so squash commits simply to make the tree less complex is the equivalent of burning history books
to reduce complexity on the repository and restore maintainability you may want to refactor in order to implement a consistent branch scheme

57180014
pull	push

an open pull request will accept new commits until new commits is eventually merged
so yes you can still work on your local branch and even push other commits to the same branch they will then be added to the existing pull request

57180014
pull	push
o yes you can still work on your local branch and even push other commits to the same branch they will then be added to the existing pull request
you might need to refresh the page displaying the pull request if you have it already open in your browser though of course once the pr has been merged new commits on your local branch will require a new pr to be merged into your receiving branch

imilar frameworks include theano or pytorch
using a framework like tensorflow comes with tensorflow own additional perks too like gpu support again not impossible with numpy but not straightforward multiplatform support distributed training.


57180210
pull	push

you say when i want my remote changes to update in production i use git pull alt master but this is not the appropriate action to send your new changes to the production server
you d have to push your new commits there this is what the message hints at

57180535
put	get

since this is common to all comparators comparing a property of the elements it was a natural decision to put the common code into a shared method
this separation also simplified the function you have to provide as this separation only needs to express how to get the property value

57181047
folder	directory
i have a c version of an r function saved in the file f1.cpp
what i and the op want is the result of sourcecpp f1.cpp namely the file f1.so which is hidden in the temporary folder defined via the argument cachedir of the function sourcecpp
if however i set to a director of my choice still temporary directory are created and the result is not saved as my path f1.so but as my path sourcecpp-x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-1.0.1 sourcecpp_2db138ae3a0c sourcecpp_2.so

57181366
daemons	launchd

once the linux kernel gets booted the granddaddy init will starts to run whose pid is 1 which will further starts all the init related daemons process like logd installd ueventd lmkd and zygote init further zygote init will start the systemd server and it is just like a container holding various services like powermanager service location manager service acitivity manager service
for example acitivity manager service will further starts launchd activity

57181498
super	implements
if the member stores the reference to the other member rather than only needing it within the construction and if your class is copyable or movable then the implicitly generated constructors and assignment operators will leave the object in a state where one member does not refer or point to the other member of the same super object and may even be left dangling
in such case you probably need to specify a class invariant that one member always refers or points to the other member of the same object and you must implements custom copy and move constructors and assignment operators to enforce that invariant
other than that you probably must also be careful to initialise the members in correct order

innodb	myisam	innodb	myisam
in other words innodb follows the acid properties to maintain the integrity of data but myisam doesn t follow acid properties thus failing to maintain the integrity of the data
in an innodb transactional table the transactional changes can be easily undone if a rollback is required
but changes made to a myisam non-transactional table cannot be undone when rolling back a transaction is required

57182374
ubuntu	centos
this is true at least for ubuntu when using ondrej s ppa
i guess there should be a way to achieve parallel php installations in centos as well
with fpm you could use nginx as well as apache as your webserver

57182374
apache	nginx
with fpm you could use nginx as well as apache as your webserver
i would recommend nginx but it s up to you
there are plenty of tutorials for both of them

then write the corresponding javascript to send the data on submit to your external database
alternatively use a squarespace form block prevent the default submission from executing and use your own methods instead

stdout	stderr

a couple options the result.csv 2 1 says to write stdout to the file result.csv
also redirect stderr fd 2 to stdout fd 1 ie also write stderr to the file result.csv

57183278
shadowing	named
one more thing be careful with your variable named
they are shadowing inbuilt functions of python namely list and dict are both keywords
to see what i refer to try this which will result in a typeerror as your string list is not callable

57183340
post	get

you can achieve this by following this - firstly you register a custom post type like course in my code then you need to add custom taxonomy for this like course type in my code
then get all posts with using page template or any other method which you are followed i add my code in my page template then attach those page template to a page here i get all posts when page reload with thre select boxes for parent terms like service technology industry - then you add jquery code in your js file for calling ajax like this - then add my code in functions.php file for getting posts after filter-

57184008
stateless	stateful
the first one is as you might know a stateful thing whereas option #2 is stateless one
afaik the best way to do this is create a property in the class of stateless which holds the data to display on the screen
so the news info in your case

57184039
clearinterval	settimeout
the interval needs to be assigned to a variable like this
then you can clear the interval like this clearinterval myinterval
alternatively as you are only using the interval for 1 iteration and immediately clearing it afterwards you can use settimeout

57185260
range	min
you have this where clause this does equality matches on variablename and alarmstate and then a range match on devicetime
the equality matches come first in an index then the range
and try refactoring your dependent subquery to use min instead of order by .

57185270
pull	push
push those branches to the remote first if you want to preserve them
you could also copy your entire pre-fixed up working folder locally add it afterwards as a remote and pull those branches into your fixed up copy after the steps below are done
it is best to backup your entire local working folder tree before starting in case an unexpected problem occurs

57185690
post	put
the right answer in this case is almost certainly going to be to post your request to the collection resource and let the server figure out the right thing to do
a resource can be created by sending a post request to a url that represents a collection of resources
using put to create a resource assumes that the client can should guess what the correct identifier for the new resource should be

grepl	substr

an option is to paste an option into a single string collapse by | and feed that as pattern in grepl

for-loop	loops

you can use the function outer to create matrices of the results you want that s much faster than a for-loop
in general in r you want to avoid for loops as most functions are vectorized

57186228
hide	show

wp media frame settings object have no property to hide left menu i spend some time to find left menu and left menu not exist
if you don t want to show this menu for your users you can hide left menu with simple css styling like so

57186422
versioning	upgrade

this code shows for example one of my databases when i increase the versioning i simply add a new case for the old versioning
when you havent upgrade your database yet set the new versioning to 1 higher than your old versioning and add a case clause for the old versioning

57186599
versioning	upgrade

whenever you want to make changes in tables or create a table on app update you have to change the versioning of database
in your case let us suppose you have upgrade from dbversion from 2 to 3 and you want to create a table for versions greater than 2.then you have to create a table in onupgrade like below here i am creating a table for all the versions greater than 2 since there is a possibility that dbversion gets upgrade from 2 to 4 or some other versioning greater than 3

once the page is rendered and client side you will need to use an ajax callback to the server when the dropdown changes to get an updated list for secondary dropdown
the ajax call can go back to the same razor page see this question for an example or call a separate web api controller this post has an example of that

this sequence of key value tuples is passed to dictionary uniquekeyswithvalues to turn that sequence into the desired dictionary


57187899
inherited	properties

the statement doesn t say all iterators are iterable but all iterators that are built into es6 do inherited from iteratorprototype and are thereby iterable
your custom iterator is a plain object and not iterable because your custom iterator doesn t have or inherited a symbol.iterator properties

57187981
filtering	grouping
it is possible to use groupby ... .apply ... to filtering the source dataframe
example df.groupby key .apply lambda grp grp.head 2 returns first 2 rows from each grouping
in your case write a function to applied to each grouping which contains some logic processing the current grouping generates the output dataframe based on this logic returning only some of input rows

57187981
filtering	grouping
another possibility is to use groupby ... filtering ... but in this case the underlying function returns a decision passing or blocking each grouping of rows
yet another possibility is to define a filtering function say filtfun which returns true pass the row or false block the row
then run to generate a mask which rows passed the filter

57187981
filtering	grouping

in further processing use only these rows which passed the filtering
but in this case the underlying function has acces only to the current row not to the whole grouping of rows

57188318
stdout	fflush	stdout	fflush	stdout	stdio	stdout	stdio
by default when standard output is connected to a terminal stdout is line-buffered meaning the buffer is fflush and output actually written to the terminal on newline
when c stdio is disconnected from the c++ standard streams std cout is fully buffered meaning output is actually written when either explicitly fflush using std fflush or std endl manipulators or if the buffer is full
the two buffers used by c stdout and c++ std cout are different and not connected

range	min
stereo matching if all above steps are correct then you may have a problem on the parameters of the stereo matching
first thing to check is disparity range since it looks like you have different resolution between example images and your images you should check and adapt that value
min disparity can also help if you reduce the disparity range you reduce the error possibilities and also block size 15 is quite big smaller is also enough

for-loop	loops
when using asynchronous operations inside loops that keeps each separate i variable with it s own asynchronous callback and thus one doesn t overwrite the other
since var is function scoped when you do this there s only one i variable in the whole function and each iteration of the for-loop uses the same one
the second iteration of the for-loop has changed the value of i that any asynchronous operations in the first iteration may be trying to use

57191751
int	chars
but i would guess that it s writing a 32-bit int a memory address to a chunk of memory that used to represent 4 8-bit chars in a string
so now you ve corrupted exactly four chars
and if foo is using malloc as you show also introduced a memory leak

57191912
filtering	grouping

here is a more generic solution to get only the latest entries for a set of accountids first you filtering only the required accounts based on the id
after that you grouping only the required accounts based on the id by id and date which will give you this intermediate result finally you use only the values of the resulting map and flatmap this intermediate result to the last value of the grouping treemap to get only the list with the latest dates

57192158
luis	bots

you d probably do best to use the nlp-with-dispatch sample as your starting point instead of the corebot template as it already has all of the wiring done for luis and qna maker
if your already have a qna maker kb and luis dispatch app setup then you will just need to enter the relevant keys in the appsettings.json file otherwise you will have to complete the pre-requisite steps in the guide here before being able to run the bots locally

57192184
ord	unpack
e can recreate the original value using ord some bit shifts and addition in the comments you asked why it isn t just t
hopefully this example answers that question the tells pack and unpack that the tells pack are working with 4-byte little-endian integers so we need to give the tells pack at least 4 bytes


57192275
for-loop	loops
i say likely because your code doesn t account for the possibility that the number of entries in the directory can change between your two readdir loops
a quick fix for this is to simply set i to zero at the start of the for-loop


57192524
accessor	properties
instead you are supposed to call setasync and getasync on the properties accessor objects
what you re supposed to do with a bot state object like a conversationstate object for example is call createproperty to create state accessor and call savechangesasync
and you re never supposed to store anything in a local variable that lasts for more than one turn

57192609
folder	directory
o correct this for namespace packages just add all the directory that have the namespace folder to the content root
so if you had a structure as rootdir +--dist_package1 +--namespace +--file1.py +--dist_package2 +--namespace +--file2.py instead of setting content root directory as rootdir set +--file2.py to all the directory that contain the namespace such as dist_package1 and dist_package2

inherited	properties
efore digging into your problem here is an introduction in c# you can define a method properties indexer or event as virtual using virtual the keyword
by doing so you are declaring that the virtual member can be overridden in a derived class private members cannot be virtual because a derived class private members won t be inherited by the child classes so a derived class private members cannot be overridden


57193345
post	get
this version handles cyclical references by making them either null or using an optional callback to get an object id such as a guid
taken from my post here here is a typescript version note arrays are treated like strings - an array of primitive values
thus any nested object items are treated as the next level instead of the array object itself much like how a string can be an array of characters but is one entity

57193689
for-loop	arrays
t is writing the whole arrays which is containing zero values
if you don t want to write all the zero values then either you can reduce the arr size or iterate the for-loop only for the number of rows it contains data

qmodelindex	qfilesystemmodel
mphasis mine from what is understood that the root of the model has never changed so if you want to access the items below the rootpath you must obtain the qmodelindex associated with that path and then get your children
on the other hand qfilesystemmodel performs the other hand qfilesystemmodel tasks in another thread to avoid some blocking of the gui so you will not get an adequate route as you change the rootpath but at least you have to wait for the directoryloaded signal to be issued indicating that the work done on the thread is over

ou can look at table per hierarchy inherited but i m still not sure you would be able to use that in a mapping table either

int	chars
you just need to use b test test testing
in python 3.x it happens because the bytes type in python 3.x is a list of 8-bit int
so taking one chars of a string will return a one-character long string but taking one byte of a bytes object will return an integer

post	put

i ended up find this post by redgate that describes some of the validation that goes on when connections are taken from the pool if the connection has died because a router has decided that a router no longer wants to forward your packets and no other routers like you either then there is no way to know this unless you try to send some data and don t get a response
if you create a connection and a connection pool is created and connections are put into the pool and not used the longer they are in there the bigger the chance of something bad happening to it

57194612
post	get	put	get
so we can pattern match on it to get at this point it should be obvious what to do simply return dir instead of gamestate map dir bool
you shouldn t really ask two questions in the same post but to answer this let s have a look at their types the idea is that put simply writes a new state whereas modify takes the existing state and modifies it using the given function
these functions are in fact equivalent in power meaning you can replace either function with the other however usually it is easier to use put or modify in different situations

throttling	throttle
say we need throttling click with requesting server having some short timeout in case server does not respond in 5 seconds
we can either use event handler wrapped into throttle and then running promise-based fetch with attaching promisified timeout with promise.race

according to the documentation in matplotlib scatter 3d the arguments taken in can be in arrays form
by using a for-loop you are unpacking the values in the list
edit after looking at your dataset you have categorical values in your x and y axis however scatter plot in 3d requires you to define the cartesian coordinates. hence what you can do is to set the xticks and yticks

if we define similarity in terms of absolute difference in case of numeric values and similarity ratio calculated by sequencematcher in case of strings or more presicely 1 - ratio to make it comparable to differences we can apply these operations to the respective columns and then normalize the result to the range of 0 .
1 where 1 means almost equality and 0 means minimum similarity

selenium	appium
s temporary solution i modified the remote_connection module of selenium that appium inherits forcing temporary solution to use a proxy url for the connection
my python knowledge is not that good but i think temporary solution shoudnt take much effort for someone to make a module that wraps override the appium webdriver remote connection to include a proxy option

udp	tcp
tcp and udp port 7946 for communication among nodes container network discovery
udp port 4789 for overlay network traffic container ingress networking
kindly note aside from those ports port 22 for ssh traffic and any other ports needed for specific services to run on the cluster have to be open

57199926
children	parent

there are 4 flexbox directions row row-reverse column and column-reverse for example a flexbox parent that contains 4 child elements
you can make the children column direction on xs row direction on sm and up of course the children can also be used to override the default flex row direction of the grid .row

int	boolean
so you can t be checking that myint holds an int or something else there is nothing else to hold except int
as such the only question is how an int can be tested for truthiness
as you have been told already int are convertible to boolean

57200691
qprogressbar	qpainter

if your text is drawn directly in the widget like in a qprogressbar you just have to deal with the color used to draw the background
your text s quite easy with a qpainter and qpainter setclippath method since your label is another widget in the header you have to find the right color

57200933
inherited	properties
let the nested class inherited this interface and implement it explicitly
whenever using an object of this nested class cast it to the interface and call the respective properties
here s an example from unity

57201403
gson	jackson

one difference i found on the serializing java object to json string is that by default jackson write out the properties whose value is null
gson is just the opposite

57201729
disk	ram
his only logically links the cpu ram etc
when you start the machine aws allocates the actual machine to you and connects your hard disk to the actual machine


57201730
portrait	landscape
nitstate should trigger the rotation to landscape - the try-catch is to handle android part no such channel as it works as expected without it
when disposing - rotate back to the portrait mode - feel free to change zgadula orientation to something which would match your project better


57201940
public	protected

looks like this is a new c++17 feature of aggregate initialisation each direct public base since c++17 array element or non-static class member in order of array subscript appearance in the class definition is copy-initialized from the corresponding clause of the initializer list
it comes with the change that a class with bases may now be an aggregate as long as a class with bases are not virtual private or protected hellip

dictionary	map	dictionary	map
then just replace the palette with the colours you want to map to
input image output image so to do specifically what you asked with a dictionary that maps old colour values to new ones you will want to initialise oldpalette to the keys of your dictionary and newpalette to the values of your dictionary
keywords python pil pillow image image processing quantise quantize specific palette given palette specified palette known palette remap re-map colormap map

put	get
you just have to put it in the postsave - event of your form
i just don t get why you need to open a specific database to do this
i would use currentdatabase for that

57202209
for-loop	loops

all you have to do is replace the inner for-loop with the new function you must use and pass the correct variables to the function by putting the function in the function call accordingly such as rept uptri star
uptri is passed to rept and is the variable named int alot the number of times loops will run in that scope and star is the character char that will print in rept and is the variable named char sym in rept s scope

57202223
min	max

one way of doing this is as follows solve problem with min cost objective
assume this has a cost cbest add a constraint to the problem total cost cbest solve problem with max quality objective

57202333
many-to-many	one-to-many	many-to-many	many-to-one

it is not possible to add custom column in the auto created many-to-many bridge table
so create another table and and give one-to-many and many-to-one relationship between them

57202337
put	get
f you want the bins all to be of equal size then you want the bins all to be of equal size needs to be symmetric so instead of running from min pd to max pd you could use this calculation this will put zero exactly in the middle of the middle bin but some of the bins at one end or the other might not be used
if you don t care if the bins are of equal size you could get just as many negatives as positives by dividing the bins up separately


57202525
rsa	aes

you have to encrypt the key with a rsa public key and only the server knows the privatekey for this public key and can decrypt the privatekey for this public key
you decrypt the aes key with the private key on the serverside and use the decrypted aes key to decrypt your original message

57202614
width	margin	margin	height
to ensure that some margin is placed between the frame and the buttons i added the frame to the layout starting from column row 1 using a span of width height + 2 grid size + grid slots for left and right with buttons added starting from column row 2 heading + margin
if you want a bigger margin use setcolumnminimumwidth 1 minwidth and setrowminimumheight 1 minheight and then apply the same minwidth minheight to the last row and column of the qgridlayout to keep it graphically consistent
the only drawback with this is that buttons have a fixed size so if the widget is resized you ll see that there will be some blank space around the buttons that s why i ve set the qsizepolicy in order to avoid that

57202724
inherited	subclassing

what you re after is the concept called inherited a key part of object-oriented programming see wikipedia here
when you define your class with class image object what that means is that image is a subclassing of object which is a built-in type that does very little

ienumerable	iqueryable
the solution that worked for me was disabled lazy loading disabled auto detect changes split the big query in small chunks a sample can be found below iqueryable is needed in order to do all the filtering at the server side
ienumerable would perform the filtering in memory and this is a very time consuming process. entity framework will fix up any associations in memory

nuspec	csproj
so just as nuget s docs on creating multi-targeting packages says just use dotnet pack to create your package and let nuget figure out what folders to use
avoid using nuspec files
any other metadata you specify in the nuspec can specified via msbuild properties in your csproj

57203035
testng	allure

a solution is to add a testng listener that catch specific error exceptions of citrus and embeds the citrus error on a assertionerror
the error will be considered as a assertionerror and will be displayed as test failed in allure

57203064
background-position	background-size

consider a scale transformation to have a better rendring you are centering the background which means applying a background-position equal to 50
the calculation of this value is related to the background-size so the position is changing slightly when the size is changing creating this bad effect if you consider a position using pixel values you will not see this effect

57203170
keras	tensorboard

i ve seen this before with keras metrics
in that case the problem was that the metrics maintain a running average across each epoch and it s that average so far that they report to tensorboard

57203361
int	chars	int	chars
you can imagine a very basic data formatting 11111 10001 10101 10001 11111 a getline call + a chars by chars parsing for each line would do the job to parse this file pro tip you can also write your level information in one line assuming that every 5 chars you treat another line height of your level depending on your level width
it will reduce the parsing time and will also reduce your level file size ex 1111110001101011000111111 pro tip 2 you can encode your level data into int or hexadecimals thus when you ll parse your file you ll need to convert these values into an arrays of boolean every boolean value will be determined by one bit of the int hexadecimal
can be represented as thus you can write more information with less chars but you ll have to seperate your int with some ex 31 17 21 17 31 to keep the same map as previous examples

57203666
superclass	subclassing

another way of potentially handling the issue was to in the superclass make the setter getter abstract
move the implemented setter getters from the superclass to the subclassing

57203861
int	double
ow when the function test is called which is implicitly declared returning int from test2 the compiled code reads the wrong register because the wrong register looks for an int value and converts the wrong register to a double returning the wrong register as a result
as the wrong register happens the last int result was the result of the printf which is the length of the printed string


57203997
flatmap	concatmap
concatmap ensures that the elements on the flux are processed sequentially inside the operator generation of inners and subscription this operator waits for one inner to complete before generating the next one and subscribing to it
flatmap lets you do the same by exposing concurrency and prefetch parameters which provide you more control over this behavior the concurrency argument allows to control how many publisher can be subscribed to and merged in parallel
in turn that argument shows the size of the first subscription.request long to the upstream

57204056
serializable	deserialization
f no jsonproperty field is specified i tested the code out and the serializable works for the jacksonerror class as there is a getter which aligns with java naming standards for bean accessors
however while deserialization it looks to access a getter by the name setsomething  if you observe the classes which have the setsomething method dont give a deserialization error


57204073
istream	getline

in the current case the error does not come from the terminal nor the compiler but from your code as john mentioned the of std cin object of class std istream reads only single words
if you want to read strings into std string objects i think you should use std getline instead

57204195
post	get
f you get in the habit of writing tests in that way then over time you ll end up with a slow build that will take too long to run and you ll end up with fragile tests good talk on the subject of why fast tests are important here
let s take a look at this route ...and decompose it notice how we ve isolated nearly all the points of failure from post into legendspostservice and further we ve removed all the flask internals from legendspostservice as well no global request objects floating around etc

prop	each
dapted from the answer re-render react component when prop changes componentdidmount was just being called too soon before the component had access to the redux state so the call to firestore was trying to use a variable that didn t exist yet
by checking each time the component updates we can see when the component finally gets access to that variable

maven	pom.xml
version 2.2 in your cluster env is not officially released to maven repo artifacts yet
since you already have tispark jars deployed in your cluster you can just remove tispark dependency in your pom.xml
in most of the cases you don t need any special api from tispark unless you are using older version 2.0 and you still can query tidb directly

57205877
screens	tablet
you must declare each one of these
any combination of size and density that you do not specify is considered a screens configuration with which your application is not compatible
here s what the manifest entry looks like if your application is compatible with only small and normal screens also it doesn t make much sense to use these filters android layouts adapts pretty well even for 8 inch tablet from the doc caution normally you should not use this manifest element

57207089
pdfbox	itext
you can extend them to in addition to analyzing the current contents also replace the content stream in question with an updated version like i did in this answer for itext 5 or in this answer for itext 7
pdfbox for the same task offers the class hierarchy based on the pdfstreamengine
based on these classes it should similarly be possible to create a graphics state aware content stream editor

multi-intent utterances with luis so it sounds like the solution you re asking for with regards to day 1 of your question is for luis to be able to detect multiple intents within a single utterance
as of now assuming you ve built your luis model according to best practices the only solution to work with these potential multi-intent utterances is on the bots level to break the user s utterances into chunks then send multiple calls to the luis api

as of now assuming you ve built your luis model according to best practices the only solution to work with these potential multi-intent utterances is on the bots level to break the user s utterances into chunks then send multiple calls to the luis api
with your business logic you could specify to filter by a certain threshold and have the bots only return intents that xyz threshold you set proactive messages to users with regards to the reminders feature you should look into the proactive messages feature in the bots framework

in this particular case time is not that important but have that on mind

this is how it looks like and to not have to mess with the path i just symlinked the desired sdk executables from the current versioning into usr local bin which i already have in my path in general this should work on a wide variety of linux variants the versioning i have installed worked just fine with my pretty archaic opensuse 13.3 and survived a complete os re-install to opensuse leap 15.0
this approach should be completely opaque to your package manager so don t try to upgrade using that and can even be done as a regular user not necessarily as root if needed
you probably still need to figure out your python versioning issue in order to use the sdk

ou click the show button your only instance of the form is show you close the show button your only instance of the form with the x in the top corner the runtime destroys the form disposes the show button your only instance of the form after the show button your only instance of the form is closed you try to show the show button your only instance of the form again but this this the show button your only instance of the form s gone trashed doesn t exist any more waiting to be garbage collected either make a new form each time you open a new form to reduce code clutter assign this same event handler to both button clicks or copy paste a new form out twice if you want both to be coded differently eventually or intercept the formclosing event of the formcontact form and cancel the closing and perform a hide instead so that instead of being destroyed your form is made invisible
your form will then still exist and can be show n the next time


57213176
hide	show

you might or might not want this either if you hide not close
hiding is different from closing and show the same form rather than making a new one then the user can click add 10 times but hiding still only see one form

int	double
f you want to keep track of all matching keys then consider using a collection of strings note that in your original question the values of the hmap were int literals not strings
you want to keep track of all matching keys would need to be strings enclosed in double quotes in order for your code to even compile

uninstall	upgrade	versioning	upgrade

if you have no custom code of your own i would suggest the following steps - backup your code and database for 6.5 uninstall your vtiger 5.4 versioning install xampp with php7.1 support
moving away from the standard vtiger installer will let you upgrade to future versions of php apache without this hassle

filtering	grouping

demo db fiddle the where clause filtering the tags before aggregating
in your case a having clause helps which can filter the grouping records

57214679
cpython	ironpython

as you have seen in cpython the encode and decode functions do not check for the existence of an error handler until an error is encountered
in contrast in ironpython the encode and decode functions check for the existence of the specified error handler before attempting to encode decode and thus the example code you gave produces an error like this of course other python implementations may have different behavior in this situation

maven	pom.xml

this seems more like a maven problem that mockito
most likely you are using that jar without specifying that jar in your pom.xml as a dependency

put	get

i ll put up an answer for you there are 2 ways for this use multicolumn listbox concatenate you string second one i ll describe here as i prefer this one
so in your code use now to get the selected item back use split listitem.list listitem.listindex 0 so if you have name in one cell mikku in the other listbox will display name mikku and the second line of code will give you name demo

ore precisely events work well for implementing push send schemes cf
rxjs or kefir but rxjs or kefir cannot be used for a pull send and wait for confirmation scheme not as was intended in the original question at least


57215246
int	double

using the numeric comparison operator numifies the value but it s probably too large to fit into an int and becomes a float
it can also just become an int and lose double quotes when serialized to json or similar format

57215347
qtablewidget	qmodelindex	qtablewidgetitem	qmodelindex

when you create a qtablewidget with qt designer and set the rows and columns not necessarily every grid has a qtablewidgetitem associated so it is not best to use currentitem
so instead of using a qtablewidgetitem you should use a qmodelindex using the indexat method and the position of the event

57215745
cumsum	posixct

we can create groups using lag and cumsum and then select first and last value of time however it looks like you want to select max and min time for each sensor but your time column is factor
we can convert your time column into posixct class and then select max and min value from each group

57216098
folder	dir
using projectsavedir results in saving files to in packaged builds or in your project s saved folder in development builds
additionally fpaths has other named dir functions if projectsaveddir doesn t suit your purpose
using fpaths combine to concatenate paths is less error-prone than trying to append strings with

57216199
int	boolean
here s a suggestion please note that if memory efficiency is an issue you re better off casting to a more memory-efficient smaller int type
the best choice for your case is np.int8 which is just a byte this takes the same amount of memory as boolean
example for a dataframe with 1000000 rows

bower	npm
t s a built-in part of the node.js non-browser environment and a function provided by various libraries and bundlers such as webpack and bower
if you want to use an npm module in browser-hosted code you have to either include an npm module in browser-hosted code you have via script tag provided an npm module in browser-hosted code you have doesn t rely on any other modules unlikely or use a bundler that understands require syntax and can bundle up the module code into a browser-compatible script

57218184
background-position	background-size

this widget seems to use all icons as a css sprite link here - so all icons are placed in one large image grid and icon is determined by background-position property which only shows a clipped icon that is required
changing font-size background-size won t help

57218184
width	font-size
changing font-size background-size won t help
you d need to use little math and with each width height change recalculate the scaled coordinates of the sprited icon correct background-size and background-position to fit the icon precisely
that s imho a waste of time and i d use some different icon either an image or background image or a font icon

client-side	server-side
however i think that you cannot use ifromfile on client-side blazor
you may use iformfile in server-side blazor
if you want to get that data from an you d have to get the binary data via something like getting byte array through input type file using js interop samples hope this helps.

57219933
hex	binary

make this change and this change might work regarding the response body #i can t return raw bytes so i transform this change into a string body output.getvalue .hex you can t send back a hex string you need to send the raw data
otherwise you would have to convert the hex back to binary as well on the client side before making a blob and later a objecturl as you may already know the browser will not save an attachment if you fetch the browser with ajax what you have to do is navigate to the file to trigger the download

57220070
int	double
no it does not make sense every data type larger than one byte is going to be affected by the endianness of the system
this includes short and long int
the htonl and ntohl functions are exactly what you are looking for and can also be used to send floating point numbers which are 32 bits not double s though which are 64 bits.

57221991
width	margin

your issue is that the svg s width is too narrow to accomodate showing all of the legend texts
if your graph follows d3 conventions space for elements that are auxilliary to graph itself axis names ticks legends etc. is made using an margin object

57221991
width	margin
ollowing d3 conventions the margin values are fixed which would explain why changing the width value just makes the bars wider yet still doesn t make space for the legend texts
therefore locate the margin object and change t right value to something higher

directx	vulkan

directx is an api used for programs that run under ms windows and xbox
so is vulkan another api that is intended to be used for all platforms that support it like windows and linux and those are pretty much the only oses that support vulkan

57222089
matplotlib	scipy

i have created a matplotlib layer for aws lambda using docker following these steps note that this script deletes numpy from the layer which is necessary due to size restrictions of a single lambda layer
so you will need to enable the official numpy scipy layer from aws in your lambda function as well

versioning	upgrade

as a netbeans user you are stuck with checkstyle-beans as far as in-ide support goes maven and checkstyle-beans are completely independent of each other but both depend on checkstyle of which both should use the same versioning
this means you are also stuck with checkstyle 6.15 no upgrade unless checkstyle-beans gets a new versioning which you must consequently use everywhere else also or your checkstyle configuration will not work for example checkstyle 6.15 config xmls won t work with checkstyle 8.22

implements	extends

just to be clear qassociativeiterable only implements a const_iterator if you were hoping to modify the values via the reference it s not possible
but if you think of what the const reference in range-for here does you see that it simply references a copy and extends the lifetime of that copy for you

i m assuming that you re just debugging for now so you can get your debug certificate here you ll want to open up project settings and add your fingerprint there following up on derhugo s suggest threading may be an issue in addition to the basic setup instructions above
i wrote a post recently on how to work with threading and firebase in unity here the easiest way to make your code thread safe would be to replace continuewith with continuewithonmainthread
this is an extension method on task provided by the firebase plugin to make it easier to work with

in xcode navigate to preferences - accounts and download manual provisioning profiling
you should be able to put debugging builds on physical device now that development profiling is imported for the same bundleid that you have distribution enabled on and since game center entitlement is associated with that same appid you shouldn t have any issues
i m assuming whoever created distribution profiling to get a release version out never created equivalent development profiling for the same app

subtract	add
to get the difference between days you use datediff passing 3 parameters the timespan in which to calculate the difference the first and the second date
it will then subtract the first one from the second one and give you the result in the selected timespan
and finnaly the sorting just add order by followed by each column that you want to use for ordering and then specify if you want it ascending asc or descending desc

put	get

i believe the line you are confused about is referring to this example i put in the code below in a non-static context you can call a method using this.method but this is implicitly called and can just be used as method from the same class
note you cannot use this from a static method or you will get an error and using this to call a static method from a non-static method will give you a warning

57225209
filtering	grouping
it does not return rows with distinct top n values
from documentation - usage top_n x n wt arguments x a tbl to filtering n number of rows to return
if x is grouping this is the number of rows per grouping

57225375
multiplying	add
cc auto-vectorizes with avx2 vpmulld if available which wouldn t be safe if integer multiplying wasn t associative
clang does unroll with multiple accumulators does when optimizing fp loops with -ffast-math to make multiple accumulators treat fp add mul as associative so multiple accumulators s too bad multiple accumulators isn t doing that with integer math


57225517
chmod	sudoers
i m using update-os instead of apache role to give a more meaningful example. i have a role called let s say . roles update-os in my . i add a file called . role-update-os.yml which looks like #
usr bin ansible-playbook --- - hosts all gather_facts yes become yes roles - update-os make this file executable chmod +x role-update-os.yml . now you can run and limit to whatever you have in your inventory . update-os.yml -i inventory-dev --limit 192.168.0.10 the limit you can pass the group names as well
--limit web db web and db is the group defined in your inventory --limit 192.168.0.10 192.168.0.201 note that you can configure ssh-keys and sudoers policy to be able to execute without having to type password - ideal for automation there are security implications with this

57225733
response.redirect	redirecttoaction
response.redirect as well as redirect used with just url redirects a request to a new url and specifies the new url
redirecttoaction terminates execution of the current request and starts execution of a new one using specified action and or controller name
redirecttoaction keeps the old request with session

57225733
response.redirect	redirecttoaction	response.redirect	redirecttoaction
redirecttoaction keeps the old request with session
response.redirect does not as it s out its scope
redirecttoaction stays on the server to execute another request while response.redirect returns the response and then processes next request from scratch as a separate one

57225787
int	chars
the length of a string is its number of bytes that is the usual meaning of string length when each chars is one byte
the length of a table t is defined to be any int index n such that t n is not nil and t n+1 is nil
moreover if t 1 is nil n can be zero

57225859
inline	inlining
the inline keyword is not about inlining
if you want to put the definition of a function in a header file you will likely need inline to prevent redefinition errors


57225906
inline	inlining
there are compiler-specific extensions that you can use if you do want to force calls to a function to be inline but that is not what the inline keyword does
with that out of the way i ll add that the compiler inlining a function call doesn t change the rules of c++ at all
it isn t a textual replacement like a preprocessor macro

57226003
datediff	difference
you would then join to that table where the month of the date is between the dates in the calendar table to do this you need to use a dateadd datediff function to round your date to the first of the month dateadd month datediff month 0 startdate 0
this works by calculating the difference in months between some random start date in this case 0 i.e
1 1 1900 and then adding those months back on to the start date

for the darktextfield syntax there are a couple options this first syntax will pass all the classes along via the separate keys underline and input of the classes prop of input

width	height
ow i solved this in a little hacky way i assume your problem is that your fit does not converges find the highest peak maximum in data - x1 cut out the data in the environment of the peak x1 +- 2 half power width depending of the distance of your peaks and the height of them find the highest peak maximum in the new reduced data - x2 use a custom fit curve which is a sum of your two gauss curves
where gauss x x1 width amplitude y_offset and sorry it s years ago that i did that and without lmfit so i can t give you details on it

factors	mean

from there you simply would need to multiply your widgets fonts stylesheets by that scale factors
it may sound cumbersome and it definitely is but this would mean iterating through the qstring returned by ui- mywidget- getstylesheet and scaling all number instances preceding a px substring

57227562
dplyr	purrr
perhaps it s unlikely enough to not be a concern
i should also note that i m using dplyr bind_rows but nothing else from dplyr
this could easily be converted into something using purrr or perhaps other tidy-package groupings

57227635
for-loop	loops

you may switch to pd.groupby or itertools.groupby if your for-loop goes way beyond 6
for instance this solution would be faster for long loops and probably slower for small loops 50

57227808
matlab	simulink
he way you have set up the from workspace block requires you to define in matlab a variable called t and another called v1 both of which must be column vectors
it looks like you also need to define a variable called tauf although it s not clear what that block is so i can t be sure specifically note that t is used to define the time points at which v1 changes it has nothing to do with the time steps taken by the simulink solver stepping the model through time

lisp	scheme
macros are derived expression types individually introduced as library syntax
the motivation for this may be some conscious decision to blend into the cs academic mainstream by scrubbing some unfamiliar lisp terminology

uiview	uipangesturerecognizer	uiview	subviews
it would have required quite a bit of refactoring to move the uiview outside of the uiscrollview as we had a complex view hierarchy
as a workaround i added a single uipangesturerecognizer to the subviews in which i wanted to prevent from scrolling
this uipangesturerecognizer will cancelstouchesinview which prevents the uiscrollview s pangesture from activating

superclass	subclassing
uppose your class object is a subclassing of several classes and several classes have many fields that are initialized at the time of declaration
in that case all your superclass hierarchy and all your superclass hierarchy fields will be initialized before your validation

fgets	getline
and check if any character in each word is f or f output the word if found
read input from user you are to be commended for choosing fgets to take input from your user
that along with posix getline would be a good choice

57228678
for-loop	loops
make a copy of str if you need to preserve the original to tokenize with strtok you could do the for-loop above declares a character pointer p as loops variable initialized to the return from strtok str delim which will be a pointer to the first word
loops then checks p as loops conditional and increments with on each iteration to ensure p points to the next word
you may think of the logic a little easier as both are equivalent check if word contains characters to find to check if a word contains one of any number of characters the strpbrk function is tailor made

cannot pass binary data through the pipeline as noted by gordon davisson need to represent newlines with n instead of n the powershell script that ultimately replicated my results in ubuntu bash was.
while it s a better idea to use printf over echo on linux unix systems that difference wasn t material in this use-case

width	margin
hence 15px - 15px + 15px 15px using only .row hence with negative margins row has -15px left and right margin col-6 has 15px left and right margin -15px + 15px 0px
hence there is no outer gutter width at all
simple codepen example

57228958
for-loop	loops	for-loop	while-loop
the while-loop s exit condition is unnecessarily complicated you shouldn t try to brute-force check in such a way
the for-loop s exit condition again depends on the contents of the arrays
problem 3 it looks like you forgot to add between the first for-loop and the while loops

57228958
for-loop	loops
problem 3 it looks like you forgot to add between the first for-loop and the while loops
in general i recommend you write for-loop headers like so
this way you will avoid these kinds of errors or at least reduce their numbers significantly

57228965
folder	directory
this will also make react-router work
add the following .htaccess file to your public folder in your create-react-app folder options -multiviews rewriteengine on rewritecond request_filename
-f rewriterule index.html qsa l run npm run-script build frp the entire contents of the build directory to your linux server on plesk

57229171
put	get
since i sell my own products shameless plug and i m the manufacturer i get to decide what mpn values to put there
what i did is to simply use the same value both for sku and mpn and i now i don t get this warning anymore


57229226
move	drag
for this use case you ll need at least two things what kind of data the drag object contains otherwise one could drag any kind of object in your application for example the user is dragging an image and releases the mouse button on your window by mistake and if you don t check for that you ll get your button move even if the user didn t want to
what widget you re going to move there s just one widget in your case but that might change in the future this is done by attaching some data to the qdrag object which is set in mime format
since this is a specific case see qmimedata documentation for standard types provided by qt you ll need to create your own mimedata format and provide some data

57229571
plink	prompt
ee displaying windows command prompt output and redirecting windows command prompt output to a file
so this should do what you need powershell plink -batch servername -m cmd.txt | tee logfile.log


57229713
swift	objective-c
objective-c code then you can utilize the feature of bridging swift arrays and pointer
swift code


57230626
put	get
ist of all you need your button and something to show the progress you could actually show the progress on the button but that s semantics then you need a bit of javascript to do the progress checking this function will be called when the button is clicked and will repeatedly poll for updated progress until the task has finished running there s no error checking so you ll need to put the button in don t want to poll indefinitely if the task has failed
in your back end page you ll need a class to run the task in a thread and also somewhere to store a reference to the current task and a page method that the js calls to get the progress public partial class longrunningtaskpage system.web.ui.page the code is very simple as the code has no error handling so you will need to add that the code s possible to do the whole thing using page methods only but in my case i needed access to session variables so had to do it this way


57231045
inherited	properties

java does not support multiple inherited because of two reasons in java every class is a child of object class
when java inherits from more than one super class sub class gets the ambiguity to acquire the properties of object class

57231602
build.gradle	gradlew

add another submodule create another submodule which targets only jvm say subb which will have the gradlew notation project subb so subb will have plugins application and org.jetbrains.kotlin.jvm 3
add your module as a gradlew dependency see my build.gradle you can proceed and build subb as you would a regular java project or even use the existing plugins it will work

57231790
pull	push

as the hint says - pull in remote changes
doing git pull origin master and then git push -u origin master should fix your problem

57231921
windows	wow64

however starting with windows vista the 32-bit processes can refer to and access the files and folder in the sysetm32 directory by replacing system32 with the special alias sysnative in the file path
to launch the x64 cmd shell from a x86 perl instance you need to explicitly specify the path to the 64-bit cmd.exe by systemroot sysnative cmd.exe note however that this only works on a wow64 process so this can not be used as a single one-liner solution for both x86 and x64 versions of perl under windows

57232359
hide	show
ut you could render your code and hide your code with display none
and using axios or ajax after calling your api show that section


57232395
screens	tablet

changing the screens resolution is changing the dpi windows and winforms do provide some mechanisms for scaling your app so the interface can be more proportional on different screens but it can be a bit more hit and miss to take advantage of in winforms compared to other technologies like wpf uwp especially if you have an older application or code base
if the scaling is not what you expect first check that the users have turned scaling in the users display settings back to 100 many laptops and tablet have the set to 125 ootb

57232404
build.gradle	gradlew
it mostly corresponds to your original setup with the exception of the changes indicated by xxx
project testa settings.gradle build.gradle project testb settings.gradle build.gradle as requested in the comments here s some more explanation on the created default configuration and the added artifact in project testa
composite builds in gradlew currently have the limitation that substituted project dependencies will always point to the default configuration of the target project

57232445
debian-based	linux

i think that s typical of xampp on debian-based distributions
also my instructions on what to click in the control panel to see the log may be a bit different for you because i m running xampp on an ubuntu-based distribution of linux feren os

57232458
filtering	grouping
xpand the selected grouping to retrieve the matching records
if your data also contains records where a client name has only a status success associated with a client name you need to adjust the where-object filtering to remove the matching records from the result


57232805
int	chars
when you try to print value inside the for-loop you will see 1 2 3 but that is in fact the second chars of the key attribute and not the value attribute
if you try printing print type value you will get to know that it is in fact a string variable and not an int
to get the proper value of the key you need to only use a single variable

57232825
superclass	subclassing

so in this case you augment the documentquery type which is the superclass of query but you assign the cache method to the query prototype
that works because query extends documentquery so when you declare that documentquery now has a cache method typescript assumes that subclassing including query have the same method

57232913
put	get

i have no idea maybe if i put a few headers in axios axios would function properly as well
still there is something weird in console you can see the fetch log you might have to check the log xmlhttprequests checkbox in console and api roadmap getallroadmapsthumbnails shows fetch finished loading get while my backend is 5000 and so my backend should be localhost 5000 api .

57233063
int	chars
it is equivalent to 0 chars constants have int type and a macro for it would be of limited use
the chars 0 is often referred to as a null chars but this is different from the null pointer constant


57233074
folder	directory

you probably have a folder on your computer called mysite in the virtual environment you re in
try changing directory and re-run wagtail start mysite note if you run wagtail start mysite mysite without a directory called mysite you might run into an error that says destination directory path to folder mysite does not exist please create mysite first fun trick if you run into this error again in the future you can see all of your currently installed pypi packages by typing pip freeze

57233092
innodb	myisam

yes in innodb for sure as innodb will use a algorithm to create a algorithm s own rowid which is defined in dict0boot.ic the main problem in that code is which blocks others threads from accessing if one thread is already running this code
meaning this code will table lock the same as myisam would

57233128
put	get
think about what kind of settings should be allowed and probably put these in an enumeration
that definitely needs a bit of brain power to get it right
as said these are a few loose thoughts

57233830
width	height
here percentage is percentage of the width for the y coordinate and percentage of height for y coordinate
since height vary with content you get unpredictable results


57233945
superclass	subclassing
the first thing a subclassing constructor must do is to invoke one of the superclass constructors
if you don t then the compiler calls the no-arg constructor of the superclass for you
but of course that fails if the superclass doesn t have one

57233957
uitableview	uistackview	uitableview	uistackview	uiview	uistackview	uiview	uistackview	uistackview	uicollectionview	uistackview	uicollectionview
earlier i had a structure like this uiview uistackview uicollectionview now i have embedded collectionview inside another uiview like this uiview uistackview uiview uicollectionview and the warning disappears
it seems that uicollectionview and same is true with uitableview - just found out expects superview to be a derivative of uiview
i am sure there should be a way to add the missing function as an extension to uistackview to be able to hold uicollectionview or tableview

57233985
qapplication	qwidget
 good place for that is at the start of main the start of main also works with qapplication since the start of main inherits from qguiapplication
the start of main just provides extra things needed for creating qwidget based objects which you don t need


57234062
build.gradle	gradlew

rename build.gradle.txt to build.gradle
if you don t want to rename the file you can execute gradlew tasks -b build.gradle.txt gradlew doesn t need a build.gradle file to have tasks for example the init task creates build.gradle

57234374
short	base
makedel will generate all possible variants of a short sequence with an arbitrary number of deletions
the companion function makeins will generate variants of the short sequence with the insertion specified as the iupac symbol in symbol
makesub will make the desired substitutions using the base specified by the iupac code in symbol

57234374
int	chars
he argument seq can be a chars string such as gggcgactg or a dnastring object
the argument seq n is an int that specifies the upper limit on deletions insertions or substitutions


57234426
width	height

if free_x their width will be proportional to the length of the x scale
or if free both height and width will vary

57234471
inline	inlining
in the other cases you access the field directly
the injected setter will almost certainly be inline by the jitter which removes the performance penalty of a method call
check this q a for details on jit inlining

57234781
subclass	accessor
using a leading double underscore for class attributes means python will use name mangling
python turns the name __attr in class x into _x__attr so that when subclassing this attribute is less likely to be overwritten if a subclass also defines a __attr but the parent class attribute is needed
when you do you re not overwriting the attribute defined in the class since this has become x._myclass__n to any outside accessor

57235007
post	get
but the browser url is a get request so the request would still fail
you will need to send the post request by javascript then
for example something like please let me know if the error still exist

57235008
prng	random
f a particular prng is a particular prng bad no seed selection strategy can make a particular prng is itself bad better
the choice of random number generator rng will depend on what kind of application will use the random numbers and you didn t really specify what kind of application you have in mind if the random numbers are intended to further information security in any way the random numbers serve as random encryption keys nonces or passwords then only a cryptographic rng will do


57235008
prng	random
if the random numbers have to be reproducible at a later time then a seeded prng of high quality has to be used
there are several good and bad choices for such a prng
in this sense the rand function in c uses an unspecified algorithm which hampers the goal of reproducible randomness

57235547
git-rebase	amend
ou have to finish the conflicted merge and run git-rebase --continue to get the commit made
i forget whether git then 1 makes the commit and 2 stops to let you amend the commit but i suspect the commit does 1 the as if by cherry-pick also usually becomes actually by cherry-pick here


57235655
prepare	execute
once the majority of replica nodes have returned a promise to the leader then the next phase is execute
propose accept if the proposer receives a response to its prepare requests numbered n from a majority of acceptors then it sends an accept request to each of those acceptors for a proposal numbered n with a value v where v is the value of the highest-numbered proposal among the responses or is any value if the responses reported no proposals new entry
if an acceptor receives an accept request for a proposal numbered n it accepts the proposal unless it has already responded to a prepare the request having a number greater than n

57235662
maven	pom.xml
if you didn t have any run configuration created when selecting maven build will ask you to create one and provide the required goals
this means that eclipse doesn t guess which of the possible goals from your pom.xml you want to run when you click the run button
note that alternatively you can press the drop down icon and open a dialog that will show your custom configurations pressing hellofx will run the specified goals

57235879
google-chrome	firefox
replacetrack works in google-chrome even without resetting the tracks.enabled to true
after resetting the tracks.enabled to true everything works perfectly in firefox


57236137
children	parent
nly difference is that all the new pages that fit under v-app-bar will have to be added as children of this intermediate-ghost-page because without it v-app-bar won t be dragged from there
but actually to be honest it s not even a bad thing because it will force me to group pages under certain parent so code won t be as messed up later on


57236314
getter	setter	getter	setter
however your issue here is relating to the getter setter methods generated by attr_accessor
the getter method does not require self unless you have a local variable with the same name
setter methods are different

57236351
feedback	review
this is purely based on my experienced and colleagues feedback there s no inside information google has none to my knowledge
the whys about why this process is so slow and how google review goes


57236408
sudo	passwd
i tried just restaring the xrdp agen sudo etc init.d xrdp restart but this left me with a black screen on the new session so i had to restart anyway the downside to this is that you will no longer be able to connect from the hyper-v manager
the upside is that you will not have to type in your passwd every time


57236500
setinterval	settimeout

the issue is in the bindings you have within your setinterval functions note at the end of the functions i use .bind
callback functions used in setinterval and settimeout need to be bound to a scope in order to handle this

57236538
fflush	gets
he only proper way to read large files is via chunks then the only proper way to read large files s safe to call stream_with_context on this chunk reader if you serve video files under the hood the flask response procedure takes each chunk from the generator read_file_chunks fp and fflush the flask response procedure to the http connection before loading the next chunk
after flushing the chunk data is no more referenced and gets cleaned up by the garbage collector thus there will be no many chunks staying in the ram at the same time


57236591
folder	directory
didn t know how but it happens that my http folder had been moved to my project directory
a simple copy of the http folder and pasting into the app folder resolved the issue


57236647
queue	fifo

you are using a single instance of queue to add items from two processes that are executing square and cube functions separately
queues are fifo fifo so when you get from queue print in the main thread fifo fifo will maintain the order in which fifo fifo has received the items

57236826
puts	gets
so gets all combinations of elements the cartesian produce
for example runs the applicative by returning each combination and then puts the results back in a list giving
in general any time you have a collection of effects you want to run you should be reaching for sequencea

57237086
int	chars
it s bad practice to use a void return type though as mentioned in the comments so stick to int
but the arguments that main takes are either void or the combination of an int and a which is the equivalent of
thus your second argument to main is missing another level of indirection it should be a pointer to a pointer to chars

57237409
width	height
section.frame position relative
width 50vw
height 50vw

57237409
width	height
width 100
height 100
object-fit contain

57237468
int	boolean
f the given chars matches any of the given values the boolean is set to true because the given chars is a vowel
the second last else statement checks the utf-16 values of the alphabet you can cast a chars to an int which determines ist value in utf-16 encoding for the lower cases it is 97-122 and for the upper cases the upper cases values are 65-90


57237539
for-loop	arrays
the nested loops in step 3 is also wrong
you don t need a for-loop inside a while loops
you need a single loops that iterates the over the lines and also increments the arrays index i

57237585
width	margin
ou could use margin width absolute positioning.
one thing you will have to do for sure is toggle create a class for when the sidemenu is supposed to be full width and when the sidemenu is supposed to be partially open


57237781
for-loop	arrays
just like arrays + element 1.. highnumber can use a lot of memory
a for-loop should work fine in the job
you also never use itercount

57237968
folder	directory
hen in src folder create a new directory name routers
inside of src folder create approuter.js src routers approuter.js finally in app.js


57238040
inherited	properties
n particular you can navigate from the attributes page to the properties via dom interface link and navigate the inherited hierarchy up to htmltablecellelement
the html attribute and the dom properties are not the same thing even when the dom properties have the same name


57238077
sorting	grouping
it does not need o n log n and sorting
this code shows how output from this test program test 1 8 values 8 1 0 3 5 0 2 1 6 grouping 8 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 output 8 0 1 5 3 5 6 6 2 test 2 18 values 18 1 1 3 5 0 2 1 6 6 3 5 5 5 3 2 3 7 3 grouping 18 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 3 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 5 output 18 1 1 5 3 5 6 6 6 6 6 5 5 5 7 7 7 3 7


57238206
clang	llvm
ome compilers are not bad apparently apple clang llvm for aarch64 does ok more often than it used to
but still see arm neon intrinsics vs hand assembly - jake lee found the intrinsics version of arm neon intrinsics vs hand assembly - jake lee 4x4 float matmul was 3x slower than arm neon intrinsics vs hand assembly - jake lee hand-written version using clang in dec 2017


57238787
inherited	properties
all javascript objects are instances of object and inherited from object.prototype
so you can extend the properties of this class to add a properties to any other objects in javascript like this see the jsfiddle sample here


57238955
for-loop	loops

create the empty dict before the for-loop
and then in loops add to the empty dict like so

57239012
swift	objective-c	swift	objective-c
the issue was swift 4
the method must be attributed with objective-c
in earlier versions of swift inheriting from nsobject nsviewcontroller etc

57239195
apache	nginx

ok i couldn t sort this in apache and i changed the web server software
before the web server was running apache2 on ubuntu server 18.04 and i ve changed this over to nginx

57239272
int	chars	int	chars
is an assignment which leads to the invocation of and has an overloading taking chars which makes work after the implicit conversion from int to chars
4 replaces the contents with chars ch as if by assign std addressof ch 1 is an initialization which tries to call the constructor of std string to initialize b
but these constructors don t have such overloading taking int or chars then won t work

57239358
spaces	delimiter
and result contains zero-sized spaces
the get expected result you need capture only delimiter
you can do that adding two flags demo

57239837
concave	convex
polygones which are drawn with the legacy opengl primitive type gl_polygon have to be convex
concave polygons might not be drawn correctly
use the primitive type gl_triangle_fan and start with the point 59 149

57240622
for-loop	loops

the variable b is not incremented the variable count starts from 0 and incremented in the for-loop
when the count variable becomes 2 loops ends

57240911
hash	salt
bcrypt algorithm bcrypt returns a different hash each time because it incorporates a different random value into the hash
this is known as a salt
it prevents people from attacking your hashed passwords with a rainbow table a pre-generated table mapping password hashes back to their passwords

57241195
stdout	fflush
ut this way this way will also work if the user disobeys the instructions and types yes or no  i also made some other changes i added fflush stdout after the prompts to make sure they come out
prompts that don t end in n sometimes don t show up right away unless you fflush the output i got rid of the no spaces wording because once we fix the inputs there shouldn t be problems with inputs with spaces in t


57241195
fgets	strcpy	fgets	strcpy
i used fgets to read the tournament name too because the problems with mixing input styles get even worse if you throw scanf into the mix
i changed to strcpy tournament practice
i changed one instance of fgets name 100 stdin to fgets name 40 stdin

57241317
scipy	scikit-learn
the first is linearregression class and is using ordinary least squares solver from scipy the other one is sdrclassifier class which is an implementation of the gradient descent algorithm
so to answer your question if you are using sdrclassifier in scikit-learn then you are using an implementation of gradient descent algorithm behind the scene


57241480
maven	pom.xml

after several days of work and research i finally find the solution of my problem my problem is caused by a version conflict between dependencies of es hight level client api and those existing on glassfish modules jackson-core is one of those existing on glassfish modules jackson-core  because replacing jars of glassfish module directory is a risky practice the solution that i applied is to shade the es dependency and rename there packages using maven shade plugin these are followed steps to implement the solution create the shaded dependency of es create a java maven project
the pom.xml of a java maven project run clean build and maven package goal

57241692
put	get
s such it has average running tree of as each insertion needs to cover all the tree nodes upto the place where you are going to put the key
also if you get an already ordered set average running tree degenerates in a list you always go to the right branch until you reach the place of insertion degenerating into o n²


57241754
super	implements

well as you know which two diamond traits you mix in you can call both super implementations and specify the trait from which you want to call each super implementation
so you could implements c like this and would get the output b1 1 b2 2 c f

57242021
multiplying	multiplication
let s start with this sequence that sequence can be generated with a simple formula now if we consider your sequence we can generate that with a formula that makes use of the previous one if we make a sequence of vectors containing all the components we need then we can construct a matrix m so that and so since the size of the matrix is fixed at 3x3 you can use exponentiation by squaring on the matrix itself to calculate m n-1 in o log n time and the final multiplication takes constant time
here s an implementation in python with numpy so i don t have to include matrix multiplying code


57242037
fast-forward	merge
if you haven t touched your local branch then git pull will simply update your branch to the remote s version also called a fast-forward
however if you have made any commits on your local version then your branch and the remote has diverged and in order to merge the remote back in git needs to create a merge commit
that s why you re only sometimes asked for a merge commit message

57242455
post	get

so this post helped me to solve the problem
i used this code to get goal position

57242525
bash	zsh
here is your desired outcome with some steps that show us getting there bash can do but can t nest to do the final step
posix can t do anything of the sort. this uses zsh s parameter expansion p flag


57242667
migrate	upgrade
here is also a workaround where you could use jetifier which is a tool that will migrate old dependencies to the new androidx imports however i found a workaround where you could use jetifier which is a tool that will migrate old dependencies to the new androidx imports a little buggy dependening on your project
my 2 cents right now would be to go to 0.59.8 until all major dependencies have time to upgrade and release all major dependencies updated versioning


57242719
qapplication	qcoreapplication	qtwidgets	qtcore	qtwidgets	qtgui

the most you can do is to exchange the qapplication for a qguiapplication thus avoiding the useless dependency from the qtwidgets module
qt initializes most of its static global stuff inside the bowels of qcoreapplication for qtcore stuff qguiapplication for qtgui stuff qapplication for qtwidgets stuff

57242719
qapplication	qcoreapplication
qt initializes most of its static global stuff inside the bowels of qcoreapplication for qtcore stuff qguiapplication for qtgui stuff qapplication for qtwidgets stuff
each derives from the other so if you have a qapplication you already have all the stuff from gui and core
the font engine and other paint-related stuff is initialized inside the qguiapplication constructor as hinted in qfont documentation note that a qguiapplication instance must exist before a qfont can be used

57242766
versioning	upgrade
efer to the following reference also you should migrate to androidx for getting new features and upgrade on existing support library
remove the following code since the following code is trying to use old versioning of support library


57243073
pdcurses	ncurses
i believe there s a clone of this library in windows called pdcurses
below is an example of a basic ncurses program that prints input characters as soon as the key is pressed
further information can be found in the ncurses howto

57243276
for-loop	loops

a for-loop is really very simple and a for-loop s what i would personally go for compare brevity and readability with std transform code in the other answer here
but if you really hate that loops you can use std for_each instead

57243379
cells	tablecell

you can set the properties directly on the block elements the border of a row is the border of the cells
to set the border of a row the border of each tablecell has to be set

57243541
octal	binary
for string already in octal
for binary numbers


57243748
for-loop	arrays
f you have an arrays of size n you can iterate through you have an arrays of size from 0 to n-1
you already do that in the for-loop but then want to access which is out of bounds


57244330
httprequest	httpresponse
 suggest you to bind the function after that the xml httprequest returns edit also you put the response in an element then eval another element should become also i would suggest you to do not use eval as this creates vulnerabilities in your code
in order to avoid eval you could send in the httpresponse a script file and add a script file to your code


57244689
int	double

the expression has type int so its value gets placed into the first of those registers reserved for int
but when printf finds f in the format string its says to its f is for double so my caller should have passed a double so i ll grab a value from the first register reserved for doubles but nothing got placed in the first register reserved for double so the value printed is whatever happened to be there already which might just be 0

57244905
put	get
ou need few things script has to use sys.argv to get selected filename you have to add shebang in first line of script so system will know to use python to run this script #
usr bin env python you have to set system executable so system will use shebang to run system and you don t have to use python script.py chmod +x script.py you could put script in folder which is in path so system can run system in any folder without using full path to script


57245112
email	dkim
to name only a few rdns dkim greylisting etc
in general a web server whos main purpose is not sending email does not have all these settings
this might result in difficulties to reach certain email addresses

57245120
free	malloc

i moved the call to free to the end since you don t want to free before you print it
with that said it s not really necessary to free although if you do want to free things before exit you ll also want to free and finally b  i also got rid of some unnecessary casts on malloc s returns and some unnecessary multiplications by sizeof char in the sizes passed to it

57245147
folder	directory
when you run the script either in terminal or in jupyter a folder named mlruns is automatically created
by default wherever you run your program the tracking api writes data into files into an mlruns directory
you can then run mlflow s tracking ui if you want to run mlflow s tracking ui from the notebook you should write

57245382
pull	push

the current git pull as of git 2.6.0 and later is no longer a shell script and probably doesn t break repositories any more
- i still rarely use a shell script myself meanwhile git fetch git push and git status all acquired new features and all of this stuff got tangled up

57245382
pull	push
there are tons of additional configuration options there are many more configuration options you can set that affect git fetch git push git pull and more
you can for instance fetch from one remote and automatically push to a different one or a different url for the same remote which is probably only useful if you have the ability to fetch without authenticating but can only push with authentication and authentication is slow or painful for some reason
some of these options influence things like why git push -u isn t the default too

versioning	upgrade
very fast if you only need y n as a long int which allows you to avoid the slow fpu fscale function
this is agner fog s x86 hand-optimized versioning if you only need results with y n as an int
i upgrade it to __fastcall __declspec naked for speed size made use of ecx to pass n floats always are passed in stack for 32-bit msvc++ so very minor tweaks on my part it s mostly agner s work

it was tested debugged compiled on ms visual vc++ 2005 express pro so should be ok to slip in newer versioning


57245539
toolchain	binutils
you should be able to build both gcc and binutils from source with --target as either aarch64-linux-gnu or aarch64-none-elf depending on your goals
yet another note since macos silently aliases gcc to clang and many tools depend on that you ll probably also want to build this toolchain with something like

folder	directory
you re talking about directory
in your url the path grief_ui display.jsp and grief_ui servlettorun is not necessary related to folder
it is a structuring element of the url

57245593
firefox	safari
nd in general it s best to express objectboundingbox dimensions as decimals - firefox at one point at least wouldn t accept percentages
and it s also best to define your filter higher in the document than the html it will apply to safari at one point at least couldn t find the filter if you did it this way


57245732
inherited	subclassing
bstractuser subclassing abstractbaseuser and provides a base implementation of an user model
with abstractuser you basically use the user model with all abstractuser fields but abstractuser comes with extra inherited functions and django s implementation of authentication


57245740
html2canvas	jspdf
you can see this if you put i ve commented out your css and produced the following working stackblitz uncomment the css to see the issue
steps to reproduce stackblitz angular.json dependancies i ve avoided an issue with html2canvas by using html2canvas 1.0.0-rc.1
see - the latest version of jspdf is not working with some issue with file-saver so i ve just gone for the version i know works jspdf 1.4.1 include types types html2canvas types jspdf for some reason in stackblitz you need to import these using import jspdf from jspdf

57245821
width	height
this be because your map array is an array of row-pointers and each row-pointer points to an array of cmaptile - a bit like the argv variable to main except that is an array of char not cmaptile
then for each row-pointer allocate another array for the width this gives you a map which can be accessed make sure you handle memory allocation failures - this will be when new returns null
so a map allocation function may look something like this width height and tiles are class member variables

57245896
put	get
the global view in csta is more complicated because a call state is the set of endpoint states but i try to briefly describe basic simple call states with alice calls bob null idle no call - alice null -bob null pending alice dials - alice initiated -bob null originated alice wait - alice connected -bob null delivered bob set is ringing - alice connected -bob alerting established bob answers - alice connected -bob connected terminated bob hangs on - alice connected -bob null and to get back to your specific concern about pending versus waiting
waiting imply that the call has been put in a wait queue queued call is queued - alice connected -bob queued pending is transient state but waiting can be quite long in that case a voice guide or music is played


57245904
lan	localhost

then find the ip address of the windows host on the lan by running ipconfig on the command prompt of the windows host computer or looking at the router admin page
then on the remote computer do ssh -n -l 8787 localhost 8787 username windowshostip where username is your windows login

57246212
base-class	subclassing
n this restricted mode the app s main activity is not automatically launched the app s content providers are not initialized and the base-class application is instantiated instead of any subclassing declared in the app s manifest
even while your app is completely restored using bmgr tool your app can still be under restricted mode without your app custom application class available but an instance of base-class application


57246217
folder	directory
nstead it looks for a app.yaml file in that directory and returns an error when it is not found even if appengine-web.yaml is there
if the appengine-web.xml file is in the standard web-inf folder the appengine-web.xml file works as expected


57246957
for-loop	loops

your break statement will only break out of the inner for-loop
as suggested there you can just return next_index from the inner for-loop instead of trying to break out of both loops to return the appropriate value

57246977
folder	directory
volumns is the folder where data chunks are saved in the distributed file system on a data node
if 2 or more data nodes have the same directory setting it will cause conflicts


57247115
factors	matrix

character variables passed to data.frame are converted to factors columns unless protected by i or argument stringsasfactors is false
if a list or data frame or matrix is passed to data.frame it is as if each component or column had been passed as a separate argument except for matrix protected by i

57247115
posixct	do.call

the solution here then is to follow the hint data.frame is giving you and use posixct instead of posixlt
if you really want to make the hint data.frame work with posixlt you can iterate over the conditions and posixlt vector with map with if else which maintain attributes including class but only handle scalar conditions and coerce the resulting list back to a vector with do.call c .. ...but frankly that s a little silly

versioning	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
so it has no chance to upgrade terraform versioning any more in container
second make sure you limit the terraform versioning in your codes
if not you have the risk to run terraform with higher versioning 0.12 and get tfstate file upgrade directly

if not you have the risk to run terraform with higher versioning 0.12 and get tfstate file upgrade directly
it will be hard to roll back unless you enable the versioning control when save files


57247211
hackage	stackage

the important bit in this error is the following in the dependencies for spock-0.13.0.0 spock-core must match 0.13 but the stack configuration has no specified version basically here is what is happening the primary haskell package repository is hackage
however stack gets the primary haskell package repository packages from the primary haskell package repository own repository known as stackage

57247744
sudo	passwd
it worked for me perfectly.also provide your account passwd whenever asked in this process
sudo su -c echo deb xenial main etc apt sources.list.d nodesource.list sudo su -c echo deb-src xenial main etc apt sources.list.d nodesource.list sudo apt-get update apt-cache policy nodejs check if the versions listed has node 8 sudo apt-get install nodejs nodejs -v check the node version installed this shall successfully install nodejs version 8 on your system

uefi	acpi
then int 0x15 eax 0xe820 with the restriction that the bda will be considered usable or uefi s get memory map function are all you need
note that for both cases one some areas may be reported as acpi reclaimable which means that after you ve finished parsing acpi tables or if you don t care about acpt tables the ram will become usable
if you want more information you need to do more work because the information is scattered everywhere

128bit	64bit	128bit	64bit
64bit cpus can and regularly do work with 128bit because if you multiplying two 64bit integers you get a 128bit integer so gcc version 4.6 does support 128bit integers
this presents a problem with writing portable code because you have to do an ugly hack where you return one 64bit word in the return register and you pass the other in using a reference
for example in order to print a floating-point number fast with grisu we use 128bit unsigned multiplication as follows

wildfly	jboss
in jboss doc wildfly s class loading is based on modules that have to define explicit dependencies on other modules
deployments in wildfly are also modules and do not have access to classes that are defined in jars in the application server unless an explicit dependency on those classes is defined
you can create custom module and provide .ears load jar within this module

57249010
post	get

that seems you only want to post single entity to server side you can modify the codes like on server side that will send itemid and inputqty when clicking the order button
but i would suggest using javascript to get the values and sending the values to server side using ajax

day 2018-29-05 should get the date 29 year 2018-29-05 should get the year 2018 month 2018-29-05 should get the month 05 if you want to compare how many years is the difference you can use datediff ex
select datediff year 2015-29-05 2018-29-05 as datediff
datediff will be 3

multiplying	multiplication
relying on negating the chars values to prevent some processing is problematic since such negative chars values would become positive and hence potentially undergo the transformation
multiplying a chars value by -1 is performed using type int or type unsigned int if chars is unsigned and has the same size as int which happens only on some rare embedded processors
if type chars is smaller than int this multiplication cannot overflow but the result should be stored into an int to avoid the implementation defined conversion in case the value exceeds the range of chars such as would be the case if chars is unsigned

57251847
int	chars	int	chars
if type chars is smaller than int this multiplication cannot overflow but the result should be stored into an int to avoid the implementation defined conversion in case the value exceeds the range of chars such as would be the case if chars is unsigned
indeed in most cases negating a chars value twice should yield the original value but the c standard does not guarantee this behavior if the intermediary value is stored into a chars
note also that getc returns an int with either the negative value eof or the positive value of the byte read from the stream converted as an unsigned chars

57251852
packets	multicast

if those packets are being sent to different port number which is probably the case then please change your receiver to listen on that port number to start receiving those packets


57251945
junit	testng
solution there could be multiple way of handling this like we can define 2 execution each for testng junit and disable one as per your need
can you please try with this please remove any direct indirect testng dependency
org.testng testng 6.14.3 test and try to add below one - io.cucumber cucumber-testng 3.0.0 also i would suggest you one more thing to keep your pom.xml clean

57251945
junit	testng
doing so can cause unpredictable outcome
cucumber execution via junit you shall remove cucumber-core cucumber-java cucumber-jvm cucumber-jvm-deps gherkin as these are transitive dependencies which would get added by maven when you add below direct main dependencies
just add below 2 and one for testng shared above

57252388
fread	strcpy
n particular when you call functions such as strcpy printf and fread that write potentially arbitrarily many characters to a buffer you supply it is your responsibility to ensure somehow beforehand that the buffer is big enough
some functions such as fread let you say how big your buffer is so that some functions such as fread can be sure not to overflow your buffer


57252549
seaborn	matplotlib

unfortunately seaborn is very difficult to work with if you are trying to move away from the plots that are offered
in your case i think it would be much easier to forgo seaborn altogether and to generate a plot using standard matplotlib functions

for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops	for-loop	loops
second your loops will miss some elements
if you do a for-loop and start removing elements then the length of the collection also changes
what happens in pseudo representation you can loops in reverse from the end to the beginning but it s easier to use foreach which guarantees you go over each element in the initial arrays

superclass	subclassing

such as means the second column is twice the width of the first column

57254930
inherited	properties

a private member means it can only be readed from the container class it means if a class inherited from it that class wont have access to a private member a private member still exists but you cant access it
from ts docs when a member is marked private it cannot be accessed from outside of a member containing classs you cant hide the member you can only limit the access also you have static properties which i think will suit your case static properties are only visible in the class itself not on the instances

57255313
inline	inlining
for most intrinsics a method call is smaller in the bytecode than the inline body would be
inlining the intrinsics would therefore lead to growth of the resulting binaries size
the intrinsics implementation is kept under control in the language evolution process and is consistent across all call sites

57255313
inline	inlining	intrinsics	inlining
the intrinsics implementation is kept under control in the language evolution process and is consistent across all call sites
as the intrinsics is kept as a method a newer runtime library might provide a better implementation that will be applied to all call sites at once as opposed to different binaries having different versions inline
as for inlining at compilation time for the sake of performance in the jvm world this is usually not feasible

post	get

as it sounds like you have control of both the parent and the iframe one way to tackle this would be to use the postmessage api to post the size of the host window in to your iframe and then deal with the postmessage api using js in your react app
if you use something like iframe-resizer you ll get bi-directional messaging as well as the possibility to respond to the size of your iframed content at the same time for free

post	put
there are a couple issues with your current code that could be improved if you want to reuse the score anywhere else in your app that is not a direct child of this component you will have to duplicate the getscore function in that component which is harder to maintain
every time the page is rendered the getscore function gets re-run once for every post in the list and every time the user sorts the list the calculatescore and getscore functions will re-run once for each item in the list which is not very efficient
one solution as you alluded to is to put these functions in the store as getters

i expect the authors of those answers either didn t notice that int were required or intended to leave it as an exercise for the op to do the rather uninteresting conversion
to make a single pass through the array and avoid the creation of a temporary array and local variables other than block variables i suggest using enumerable#each_with_object rather than map and to_h and use regular expressions to extract both keys and values rather than using string#split the first regular expression reads match zero or more chars followed by a chars that is not a space provided that is followed by zero or more spaces followed by the string

if you don t want to affect the offsets of your existing consumer group you would have to post a separate one
you can then query offsets with get consumers string group_name instances string instance offsets note that there might be data being written to the topic between calculating the end offsets and actually reaching the end so you might want to have some additional settings to do a few more consumptions once you finally do reach the end

hide	show

anything that is rendered to the dom might be found even if you have other means beside css js to hide it you may simply analyse the entire server s response
therefore you may want to prevent entirely the html code that should not be show to be sent through backend logic

avaudioplayer	avfoundation

avaudioplayer is the one you need to look at for playback and real time manipulation
i started building a library for audio video manipulation and export using avfoundation

setinterval	settimeout

you were pretty close just need to switch out to setinterval
both settimeout and setinterval return an id that you can use to cancel it out

57262350
setinterval	clearinterval	clearinterval	settimeout
oth settimeout and setinterval return an id that you can use to cancel it out
in this case i keep track of it until the circle gets to a certain size and then i call clearinterval to cancel out the job

nsurl	nsstring
cnparticlesystem particleimage in the documentation scnparticlesystem particleimage in the documentation says you may specify an image using an nsimage in macos or uiimage in ios instance or an nsstring or nsurl instance containing the path or url to an image file
instead of using the nsurl ended up using the uiimage and the uiimage loaded up fine


57262454
xlwt	xlutils
o you would usually either read a file with xlrd and then copy a file with xlrd or create a completely new one with xlwt
a file with xlrd sounds like you re looking for the second solution for an existing workbook for example which was opened with open_workbook you can access the sheets either by name or index to copy and modify a file you can use xlutils example here


57263169
floating-point	integer
dditionally sometimes programmers might pass an integer expression where the function actually expects a floating-point argument such as in pow x 4
when the compiler knows the argument must be a floating-point argument the compiler can convert the compiler to the expected type


57263331
avurlasset	avmutablecomposition

changing the representation of an audio file and then saving the representation of an audio file to your device will require you to first initialize the media object which you can do with avurlasset
you will then need to create a mutable composition avmutablecomposition which creates a copy of your media object for you to edit

put	get

once you add the implementation of swap to your code and put it all inside a class a class produces exactly the output you wanted a class to
maybe you thought swap was a java uitl which a class is for collections but an array is not a collection so very little has changed in the below i ran a class in java doodle and a class printed i did not test beyond that but this should at least get you unstuck or at best finished

for new project you should migrate to androidx
but for new project that tightly depends on libraries that need a support library as dependency you need to do one of the following upgrade the libraries to androidx which is tedious and probably not worth the effort keep using the support library

57264017
qmainwindow	qdialog

you are creating another qtextedit within the gotolinewin widget and that is unnecessary plus you are moving the cursor of the qtextedit that is not the qtextedit shown in the qmainwindow
considering this i have created a qdialog that should only receive the qtextedit that adds the functionality you want

minimum	max

probably one of the ways of doing it would be fixing your minimum and maximum dates
so in your component you set your min and max dates like now in your template this will allow the user to select any date between 1st jan 2019 to 1st jan 2020 including both the dates

57266186
superclass	subclassing
his object is of class derived as when we try to print name of class which object is created it is printing derived which is subclassing
when you have called showall in superclass for first time it doesn t have a value for height variable because of the method showall has overridden.but the value has not assigned at that line the value calls

57267451
return-value	lvalue
just with a different name and a different return-value
functions can not be assigned you obviously know that functions are defined by appending a body . function pointers as any other pointer can be assigned. this is the reason why you get the compiler error lvalue required as left operand of assignment
it says i am not allowed to assign to the left side of the let s look at the code is the short form of assign the address of the function show to the pointer s

it s not an issue it is only occurs when your textfield language not supported capitalize locale
so when you swap from textfield2 to textfiled1 it locks locale capitalization which you can maintain by using shift key

57268139
integer	unsigned

the return type of the function is a 16 bit integer int16_t getlastvaluefromadc
however the variable used to represent the result to be returned by the function is an unsigned integer

57268139
integer	unsigned
however the variable used to represent the result to be returned by the function is an unsigned integer
unsigned integers are meant to be parsed by the compiler in such a way that there value is always positive
this is not the case with regular signed integers in which case the msb most significant bit

57268416
comparator	comparable
basically the comparator returned by nullsfirst or nullslast is an interceptor
now all that s needed is the comparator that will be wrapped by the null -safe comparator
since both integer and bigdecimal are comparable we can use comparator#naturalorder

57268601
margin	height

i recommend using the styled system library which you can use with styled components or emotion create a component this way the color function adds color props color and bg to your component likewise the space function will give you to margin and padding props ml stands for marginleft and p for padding
there are several other functions such as layout for stuff like width and height border .

filtering	grouping	filtering	grouping
you may use see the online python 3 demo the matches 1 or 2 whitespace separated words that start with an uppercase letter and then have 1+ lowercase letters and outputs non-matches between the matched texts too because the whole pattern is wrapped with a capturing grouping
empty items are filtering out
- start of a non-capturing grouping s+ - 1+ whitespaces - an uppercase ascii letter - 1+ lowercase ascii letters

57268926

integer	unsigned
or example unsigned long long is part of c99 and compilers supporting earlier c standards are not guaranteed to have part of c99 and compilers supporting earlier c standards i am not aware of something larger than long long on newer standards  for earlier standards unsigned long is the largest which is there since at least c89
edit as pointed out in the answer by anttihaapala as well as in wikipedia which i referenced also in the prior edit the c99 standard provides you with type | min value | max value ----------+------------+------------ intmax_t | intmax_min | intmax_max uintmax_t | 0 | uintmax_max which provides maximum-width integer types that are guaranteed to be the largest integer type in the implementation

57269993
integer	unsigned

this could be an extended integer type that is implementation-defined gcc for example does not support extended integer types but you wouldn t need to know about it
or if a future standard implements unsigned superduper long long then in the future implementations uintmax_t could be a typedef to that

i understand this is a very old post but just in case this helps someone - the best way forward in cases like this would be to download the image from an external source and then do the async operation
i could get a similar async problem working after fixing the serialization issue as suggested by obeyed didn t need to change celery config though but i eventually moved away from the solution because file contents can potentially be very large and consume lot of resources in the message broker

if you have to use jmeter for recording mobile device activity you could go for usb tethering this way your computer becomes connected to the ios device network hence jmeter should be able to capture the traffic
an easier option would be going for blazemeter proxy recorder as a bonus you will have possibility to export recorded scripts in smartjmx mode with automatic detection and correlation of the dynamic parameters

f you then set the grid s datacontext to vm2 then grid and keyboardbutton would have vm2 depending on how you re running things there is an exception to this - the nature of the frame control can break this cascading effect so that the page does not inherited the datacontext but you can easily have the frame s code-behind explicitly set the page s datacontext to the datacontext own
in any event if you set up your datacontext this way your datacontext makes your datacontext very simple for all the controls within the layout to communicate because they re all looking at and modifying the same object for the datacontext friendly reminder implement and use the inotifypropertychanged interface and properties so that wpf gets notified when the value of a properties change and it can automatically update anything that binds to that properties

you could use the scrolltoitem method but there is a drawback not every grid has a qtablewidgetitem associated because you could not move to those grids
instead it is better to use the scrollto method that qmodelindex uses and in that case every grid has a qmodelindex associated

57273410
keras	tensorflow
for example pytorch normalizes to 0 1 tensorflow normalizes to -1 1 and keras leaves the range as 0 255
i referenced this from the keras preprocessing code
in my experience normalizing does not make any difference for images so just stick with the one used in your framework

subtract	add
e calculate a random number between 0 and the total length of the remaining three sides by adding all four sides together and subtract off the length of the current side width if idx is even height if idx s odd
then we add idx to the total length of the remaining three sides up to and including the index where the ceil and floor calls simply count the number of horizontal and vertical sides these values multiplied by the width and height respectively and added together and finally take a floating-point modulus of the result with the perimeter

hen you use modules the parent or caller or whatever you want to call it will get the values from module.modulename as you put it and in your case you can get the vpc_id directly from module.vpc.vpc_id
when you want to get values for variables from a remote data source you need to publish the data first using outputs and then you have the data available on the remote_state file and for this case tf changed the format of the output on 0.12.x in the new version you need to refer to the outputs as data.terraform_remote_state.vpc.outputs.vpc_id i believe the documentation does not reflect the change

the purpose of that variant is to take the authenticated user and put a null value for the subject_id

htmlcollection	getelementbyid
getelementbyid will return one html object as an id should be unique
getelementsbyclassname will return a htmlcollection as classes do not need to be unique
to alter the value of each of the items in this collection you need to loop over them

57274859
int	chars

per the parseint docs parses the string argument as a signed decimal int
the chars in the string must all be decimal digits except that the first chars may be an ascii minus sign - u002d to indicate a negative value or an ascii plus sign + u002b to indicate a positive value

57274859
int	chars
the chars in the string must all be decimal digits except that the first chars may be an ascii minus sign - u002d to indicate a negative value or an ascii plus sign + u002b to indicate a positive value
the resulting int value is returned exactly as if the argument and the radix 10 were given as arguments to the parseint java.lang.string int method
so even though .replaceall s+ works for you today it is not a 100 fool-proof solution for all scenarios

inherited	subclassing
class variables in some way can be seen as global variables within the context of an inherited hierarchy with all the problems that come with global variables
for instance a class variable might accidentally be reassigned by any of its subclassing affecting all other classes or an ancestor class might later be reopened and changed with possibly surprising effects so unless you exactly know what you are doing and explicitly need this kind of behavior you better should use class instance variables

github rebase and merge button corresponds somewhat roughly to this is the most complicated one the commit-hash-or-name is either the commit hash id that you would supply to the other two or a branch name that identifies that commit hash id preferably a temporary name you just made up for the duration of this operation

57278737
goto	break
instead you can use c labels that are usually used for the goto statement in c

inherited	subclassing	metaclass	subclassing

this thing would be cleaner if you could just use multiple inherited and your configuring parameters as mixin classes -to the point no special metaclass or action at class creation time would be needed
and of course if one won t need neither an issubclass check nor to have subclassing of dynamicderive a factory function that would take in the bases keep a registry as a cache and just instantiate the new object would also not require any special code

57278969
metaclass	subclassing
and of course if one won t need neither an issubclass check nor to have subclassing of dynamicderive a factory function that would take in the bases keep a registry as a cache and just instantiate the new object would also not require any special code
but if you need the parametric bases to be higher up in the mro than derivedclass as you are asking for then the way to customize the instance class at class-instantiation time is to override the __call__ method of the metaclass
this is what python run type.__call__ that will ultimately call the class __new__ and __init__ methods

we need to convert null to a far-off date value because null values are sorted before instead of after non- null values this makes your data look like this onthisdate change 2018-01-01 1 2019-01-01 -1 2018-01-01 1 9999-12-31 -1 2019-01-01 1 2019-06-01 -1 2017-01-01 1 2019-03-01 -1 then we simply sum over the change values after sorting to get the active-user-count as of that specific date so first sort by onthisdate onthisdate change 2017-01-01 1 2018-01-01 1 2018-01-01 1 2019-01-01 1 2019-01-01 -1 2019-03-01 -1 2019-06-01 -1 9999-12-31 -1 then sum over onthisdate activecount 2017-01-01 1 2018-01-01 2 2018-01-01 3 2019-01-01 4 2019-01-01 3 2019-03-01 2 2019-06-01 1 9999-12-31 0 then we partition not grouping
the rows by month and sort them by them date so we can identify the last activecount row for that month this actually happens in the where of the outermost query using row_number and count for each month partition onthisdate activecount islastinmonth 2017-01-01 1 1 2018-01-01 2 0 2018-01-01 3 1 2019-01-01 4 0 2019-01-01 3 1 2019-03-01 2 1 2019-06-01 1 1 9999-12-31 0 1 then filtering on that where actually where inside each partition to give us the final output data at-end-of-month active-count 2017-01 1 2018-01 3 2019-01 3 2019-03 2 2019-06 1 9999-12 0 this does result in gaps in the result-set because the at-end-of-month column only shows rows where the active-count value actually changed rather than including all possible calendar months - but that s ideal as far as i m concerned because i m excludes redundant data

integer	unsigned
therwise both operands are converted to the unsigned integer type corresponding to the type of the operand with signed integer type
note if both operands have the same type then no further conversion is needed since both operands are the same type - unsigned int the result of your multiplication operation will be unsigned int for any conforming compiler


57281181
int	chars
example 2 from 5.1.2.3 program execution is informative on how strictly arithmetic operations must be treated example 6 is even better but it s too long imo to effectively quote example 2 in executing the fragment the int promotions require that the abstract machine promote the value of each variable to int size and then add the two int and truncate the sum
provided the addition of two chars can be done without overflow or with overflow wrapping silently to produce the correct result the actual execution need only produce the same result possibly omitting the promotions


57281422
for-loop	arrays

this is an excellent place to learn about and then use array.reduce instead of a for-loop
the concept of reduce is that you start with some starting value which can be anything not just a number and you then walk through the arrays in a way that at ever step lets you run some code to update that value

tcpdf	fpdf

tcpdf is a great project
tcpdf fpdf

57281463

google-chrome	firefox
in the index.js file i changed serviceworker.unregister to serviceworker.register
this fixed the issue in google-chrome and edge
i m still having the same problem in firefox

57281987
client-side	server-side
scss is a css preprocessor which runs on the server-side
it would compile into css and then be rendered in the client-side browser
and once it is compiled to css all the scss variables are gone because the browser can only render css

57281989
put	get
the range from to _ happens to include uppercase letters so you get spurious matches
to avoid this behaviour you can put - first in the character class which is how you signal you want to actually match - and not a range


57282019
width	height
set the size of the image by giving this value to the image div width 100
height 120px
then give the text containing div position absolute to float it and also give it top 0

57282020
width	border-box

the reason this doesn t work as expected is that the width of each column is not 30 as you might expect but 30 plus 15px padding
you could fix this by setting box-sizing border-box

57282105
range	minimum
it has a minimum value of -9 223 372 036 854 775 808 and a maximum value of 9 223 372 036 854 775 807 inclusive
use this data type when you need a range of values wider than those provided by int
edit truly and unfortunately the above method is not reliable

57282438
versioning	upgrade

you can get versioning info selecting help - about microsoft visual studio then selecting copy info from the right side of the about dialogue
by the way it will be better if you can upgrade your project dependencies as well what you are using is an old versioning of the microsoft.windows.cppwinrt nuget package 1.0.190211.5

57282438
versioning	upgrade
by the way it will be better if you can upgrade your project dependencies as well what you are using is an old versioning of the microsoft.windows.cppwinrt nuget package 1.0.190211.5
the current latest stable versioning is v2.0.190722.3
besides the c++ language standard was set in project properties but the value was not set

57282498
for-loop	loops
a .foreach loops does not wait for await
you can use a regular for-loop instead
an async iife with just a single await in it does not really do anything useful

57282542
maven	pom.xml

maven and gradle are just build tools
you can use that sample just need to create a pom.xml file with dependencies used in build.gradle file

57282542
maven	pom.xml
pom.xml download that sample and delete all the files except src folder put the pom.xml together with src folder
a maven project has done


57282871
margin	text-align

i have removed the below css from your code and added margin 0 auto
text-align center

57283044
post	get

it looks like you are trying to make post request directly from web browser which will not work
when you hit a url directly from web browser address bar a url is considered as get request

57283211
background-image	background-size

57283262
pull	push
f it is a pull request event then case 1 will trigger it is a pull request event then case 1 which in turn will activate your listener here a jenkins instance
case two is just a push event not a pr one you are pushing directly to upstream instead of pushing to origin your fork and making a pr from there


57283507
post	get

from where you are trying post request
if from browser windows you calling post call then post call will not work browser will send only get request

57283588
folder	directory
f it is the correct path to the image then check permissions of the folder it is the correct path to the image is stored in
if it is the correct path to the image is not correct try change media_root path to a different directory only for media files rather than base_dir which exposes all your files to end-users


57283728
put	get

give a try to you put json there
and get all necessary data structures to decode json

57284359
put	get

you should put your response in this site - in that select source type json and annotation style gson after that put your package name and class name what you want
and get the pojo class which helps you to get data easily so include the pojo class which helps you to get data easily in your project

57284429
submit	submission	versioning	upgrade
since sdk33 is the first expo sdk versioning that uses react native 0.59 the react native versioning that allows for 64-bit support prior versioning of the sdk can t be updated. these updates help us support your new submission to the google play store which will need to have 64-bit support starting august 1st
your existing apps won t need to upgrade to include 64-bit until you need to submit your next app update though sdk33 has a lot of other fun things you might enjoy


57284535
pow	math.h

the solution for this problem is cube_root pow n float 1 3
and you should #include math.h library file some compilers like turbo c c++ don t support cbrt function

57284535
pow	math.h
and you should #include math.h library file some compilers like turbo c c++ don t support cbrt function
when we write code like cube_root pow n 1 3
the compiler thinks 1 3 0 division problem in c c++ so you need to do typecasting using float 1 3 in order to get the correct answer cube root 4

57284893
g++	gcc
add -o3 or at least -o2 to your g++ command line
optionally also profile-guided optimization if you really want gcc to do a good job on hot loops
after adding -o3 the output of perf report becomes now we can get something useful from futex_wake and futex_wait_setup as we should know that mutex in c++11 is implemented by futex of linux

57284915
margin	height
ou could easily solve this issue by setting the same height to all form-grops like in the example below
furthermore you should place your row inside a container or container-fluid because your row have got a negative margin


57285329
filtering	grouping
store records in grouping like datatime id object
so when you want to get data for specific date all you need to do is ref desireddatetime brute force not recommended get the entire snapshot in one go and locally filtering for date note - calling push will generate a uid key for you. instead you use child you can determine they key path yourself


57285708
opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
here are the behaviors for popular browsers
google-chrome and opera display all types of text files in the file filter
google-chrome opera firefox and just with every other feature ie and edge go their own way

57285977
floating-point	integer
f it s a number you could maybe round a number to the next lower integer then subtract the rounded number from the original number to get the decimal portion
funnily enough that exact example produces an issue because of floating-point numbers - the result expected would be 0.2 but javascript spits out 0.19999999999999996


57286156
put	get
put it inside jsonobject and it will work fine
if you need to get neasted objects use getjsonobject or getjsonarray methods show your content string in code or how do you load it your edited code


57286262
maven	pom.xml
remove the repository details from pom.xml
you can also remove repository and mirror details from settings.xml which is inside conf directory of your maven installation location


57286574
hide	show
and hide the second part of the string which you wanted to show after clicking read more
and add a jquery click function to show the rest part of string
hope this will helps you

57286762
post	put
create this new category put all the post you want to show as test results inside and create a new page to call this post
script to call post from a single category you can show your statistics the same way
create custom fields on each post showing your values and you can handle this numbers inside the loop above

57286785
cos	sin

all the trigonometric functions defined in expect all the trigonometric functions defined parameters to be values representing angles in radians see std cos
so when you write something like cos ball.radtodeg ang where ang is equal to say 0.13 radtodeg will convert 0.13 radtodeg to 7.44 but even if your intention is to pass an angle in degrees that value is interpreted by std cos and std sin as an angle of 7.44 radians or 66.28

57286785
cos	sin
o when you write something like cos ball.radtodeg ang where ang is equal to say 0.13 radtodeg will convert 0.13 radtodeg to 7.44 but even if your intention is to pass an angle in degrees that value is interpreted by std cos and std sin as an angle of 7.44 radians or 66.28
that leads to your unexpected results cos r 7.44 0.505 instead of cos d 7.44 0.993 and cos r 8.021 -0.166 instead of cos d 8.021 0.992


57286910
versioning	upgrade
henever you upgrade tfs check the requirements of the new versioning
in your case the requirements of the new versioning are documented here


57288095
post	get

this makes a post request to the url
when this gets a response you say this makes a separate get request to the url

57288322
int	double

the problem is that java automatically wraps the int as an int and gwt end up transpiling the boxed int as a special object in js not a number
but if you use a double the boxed double is also transpiled as a native number by gwt and the problem disappears

57288571

you are passing a prepare statement object into query
remove that and write sql- execute in an if condition like shown below

57289272
integer	unsigned
c provides 1 u intptr_t as an integer type sufficient to convert a to a integer and back to an equivalent pointer
unsigned may be too narrow and lose valuable information
avoid signed types in this code

for-loop	loops

use a for-loop without the range clause
receive on the channel in loops and break from loops when the channel in loops is closed

57290226
tibble	lapply

assuming that df2 wins out when there are non-na values this solution would work if you start with a tibble or data.table you could change this solution to a data.frame two base options which would work with tibbles out of the box are for a more robust option which can have data.frames with varying rows we can use a data.table update join performance all of my proposed base options do not have groupings which should allow for better vectorization

put	get

to now get your client using these verbs you can use either ajax or the new fetch api that most browsers now have
it s not difficult to do but i would first get your get put working and then maybe ask another question on so on how to use fetch ajax and finally don t forget about security especially if you plan on making your website open to the public

57291345
lan	localhost
now you can get host machine s lan ip using hostname -i ifconfig or ip addr show depending on your operating system
in nodejs app replace localhost with the host machine s ip
a second approach is to first create a docker network with and start both containers with flag

57291784
mouseleave	pointer-events

in short put the green circle in a g element and attach listener to that element which adds and removes the outer circle on mouseenter and mouseleave respectively
i ve thrown together a jsfiddle demoing it first append a g element for each data element setting pointer-events to all makes it trigger events even when elements have no fill add a green circle for each data element adding event listeners that append and remove the outer blue circle

57293278
folder	directory

my guess is that matlab cannot locate the files in folder b
say your directory tree is something like this --root_folder --foldera --folderb if you change directory cd to foldera folderb is not visible if you don t provide the entire path from root folder

57293278
folder	directory
ay your directory tree is something like this --root_folder --foldera --folderb if you change directory cd to folder folder is not visible if you don t provide the entire path from root folder
one of these approaches will solve your problem provide the entire path from root folder to the load function cd to folder b and load your data

build.gradle	gradlew

be sure to check the compatibility of your react native version in your package.json as well as your google play services sdk number in your project build.gradle so that as well follow the chart here 99 of my inexplicable hair pulling frustrating random errors with react-native-firebase are related to following this chart properly
one other thing that fixed one of my most baffling of errors was by adjusting my gradlew build version to a previous version that worked

57293889
put	get
the method returns a promise of type user i think you are trying to get all the users in one go
i have created a code snip which will fetch the users one by one from your snowflake array of admins and then create a string for you to put in your message

bash	subshell

adding an answer to cover this interesting feature of bash
return inside if or any control command with expression like if while ... return inside if with simple and less simple expressions the subshell explanation is good

57295017
bash	subshell
which might be the bash function
or it might be any of the nested control commands with an expression which has caused a subshell to be invoked
for very simple expressions true or 1 1 there is no subshell invoked

57295657
war	manifest.mf	war	manifest.mf
if yes then most likely it is already executable depending on how you have created the war in the first place
if not embedded nay server then you have to add the manifest.mf under meta-inf
and in the manifest file you have to specify the main class name like main-class mypackage1.mypackage2.myexecutableclass the war structure should look like mypackage1 mypackag2 myexecutableclass web-inf lib web-inf classes meta-inf manifest.mf with embedded jetty the manifest and executable main class are placed the following way in war jetty bootstrap jettybootstrap.class jetty bootstrap livewarclassloader.class meta-inf manifest.mf so why your war file is not executing depends on several factors mentioned above

put	get

regarding the circles you can do something along the lines of and put it after your other g elements in your svg element
regarding the dotted lines you can listen to the mousemove event update your state and draw the dotted lines accordingly first add the mousemove event listener to get the mouse coordinates and store the mouse coordinates in your state remember to add a mouseout or mouseleave event listener that unsets the xy value in your state

57295945

for-loop	arrays
fter that with a for-loop you must carry your old arrays s elements to new arrays
usage when you create an arrays computer fills an arrays the default value of your arrays s type


57296107
int	chars
in c any signed chars used in an arithmetic operation is widened to int and the c standard library functions specify widening chars to int so this puts the variable in the correct format to use
storing is a matter of truncation and converting from any integral type to unsigned chars is trivial bitmask by 0xff
converting from an unsigned chars to a signed value can be done in no more than two instructions without conditionals or register pressure slli to put the sign bit of the chars into the sign bit of the machine register followed by srli to sign-extend the upper bits

57296290
flatmap	concatmap
flatmap subscribes to each inner stream eagerly that s why they are even triggered
note that eagerly here means it subscribes to all the inner streams at once without waiting for other inner streams to complete unlike concatmap
does a dynamic merge of all the inner stream as they emit events

57296290
flatmap	concatmap
it will complete ultimately with a oncomplete signal but you don t know when
flatmap still doesn t care
concatmap however waits for a stream to complete before subscribing to the next

57296347
subclass	inherited

another approach here would be to subclass from dataframe and build your convenience functions in this class and then you should be able to do like so getting to the root of your problem however the code does not work
if i feed the code a data frame the code throws an error attributeerror dataframe object has no attribute print_shape we ve now implemented we own class enhanceddataframe which is a dataframe well ok technically the code inherited from dataframe

57296713
put	get

if someone put text instead of number ie
hello then int gives error valueerror invalid literal for int with base 10 hello and you have to use try except to catch it in except i set so later i can display message for this if you not assign value to guess in except then you can get error that this variable doesn t exist - it can happen in first loop when variable wasn t created in previous loop

57296935
migrate	makemigrations

the existing migration files have information that causes the migrate command to believe that the tables should exist and so the migrate command complains about the migrate command not existing
you need to move the migration files out of the migrations directory everything except init .py and then do a makemigrations and then migrate

57296950
put	get
ore specifically you are going to want to get rid of both of them which you can do with this css nb you are going to want to make this css more specific to that button for example with a class
if you put this in as-is this will apply to all buttons


57296980
short	base
if that would be wrong would it be possible to have some base abstract method that then has two implementations
long story short the direct answer is simply pass in something that is either mock myclass.class or mock mysubclass.class depending on which path you intend to test but much better get rid of that instanceof cast part altogether
the whole point of good oop is to exactly avoid such code

57297000
int	chars
on risc-v an int is 32-bits wide
there are the lb lbu and lh lhu instructions to choose between zero-extending an unsigned short and sign extending a signed chars when loading them from memory
c-family languages don t need any support for 8-bit or 16-bit math beyond that

57297048
serializable	deserialization
take a look at the documentation during deserialization the fields of non-serializable classes will be initialized using the public or protected no-arg constructor of the class
a no-arg constructor must be accessible to the subclass that is serializable
the fields of serializable subclasses will be restored from the stream

57297144
ready	each
b pre-request tests scripts 1- initialise the environment variable in the pre-request scripts like this 2- increment the variable value in tests this creates an environment variable and increments it after each iteration
depending on how you structure your collection you might need to consider flushing resetting the environment variable to be ready for the next run it worth mentioning that pre-request scripts and tests running before and after the requests respectively so you can write any scripts that would like to run after the request in the tests
it shouldn t be necessarily a test

57297256
serializable	deserialization

no the default constructor is not called - it just sets every field that has not been found in the serializable data to 0
you can manually set custom fields on deserialization like that

57297553
buffering	sigpipe

while others have covered the underlying issue in great detail there is a straightforward workaround python whatever.py | tail -n +1 | head -n3000 explanation tail buffering until it s stdin is closed python quits and closes python stdout
so only tail gets the sigpipe when head quits

57297553
buffering	sigpipe
o only tail gets the sigpipe when head quits
the -n +1 is effectively a no-op making tail output only tail starting at line 1 which is the entire buffering


57298349
coalesce	nullif
ecause we have to show null as the max price of there is any null price we coalesce to make all the null prices a massively high price so they will surely be the max price then we turn that massively high price back into null with nullif nullif is proprietary
i could do the same thing with but nullif nullif s more wordy trivia 922337203685477 is almost the max value for a money


57298426
put	get

as per the above discussion it looks like put request
you should not use get as it is idempotent because the same data is not available for the second time call

57298426
post	get	post	put
you should not use get as it is idempotent because the same data is not available for the second time call
post is used to create a new resource
so it will be better to use put http method for this kind of requirement

57298467
post	get

the sequence of operations i wanted to follow is similar namely the one suggested in this other post
i get the error message error sparse checkout leaves no entry on working directory when launching with branch being master

57298526
children	parent
et s consider now a generic node in your hierarchy parent is the entity identifier of the parent node so that you can easily walk a tree a hierarchy from a leaf to the root
first is the entity identifier of the first children that is the list of leaves or internal nodes of the subtree of which the current identifier is the root node prev and next are the entity identifiers of the siblings for the current node


57298526
children	parent
hen you want to visit all the children of a node you start from the first entity a node first child and iterate all the children of a node one at a time by visiting next until it becomes null
when you want to go back from a node to a node parent you can just use parent


57298671
post	get

for the sake of completion and or variety i am going to post it though
my way of thinking is as follows you first read in your file and pass it into a dataframe df then we create a new column named trial where for every row on info that has the trial info the start and stop in this case we pass the corresponding trial otherwise we fill with na as such option 1 original file data option 2 new input file - keep in mind this preserves the in-between trial data that you might want to get rid of i am filling with na since on the next step we want to replace nas with the earliest previous non na value thus assigning the correct trial on every row between the start-stop

57298765
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
it should be done only once after you moved the elements in the for-loop
also look out for the for-loop condition
since you are using i + 1 inside loops you can only loops until or you will attempt to access elements outside of the arrays size

folder	directory
it s because there is an old vendor directory in dev tests acceptance where previously we store composer.json file and now moved to root
deleting dev tests acceptance vendor folder resolve the fatal error


57298947
put	get
so now you have all the textboxes that you want
you can add a event for each something like that or you can put that event int your form and select all textboxes
i hope you can get a mindset with my answer

57298974
installation	downgrade
you need to downgrade numpy to version 1.16.4 to make it compatible with the your current version of tensorflow
your installation is completed
check the output at the end above is a way of running python code using terminal -c is command argument

57298975
multiplying	add
then you can use the counts to multiplying with the r.h.s
of the add operation


57299130
vlookup	sumifs
if vertical you can use sumifs as chucklukowski suggested
if they are oriented horizontally you could use your vlookup and in the column argument put month - 1 4 + 3 where month is the value from sheet2


57299168
comparator	comparable	comparator	comparable
prefer not to implement comparable at all you have a class hierarchy
instead use comparator
so to fix your issue in the current situation declare binarysearchtree the following way in order to allow ngram as k otherwise get rid of comparable and use comparator instead

57299437
for-loop	loops

you re appending the same dictionary ajph18_dict every time in your for-loop any changes made to that dictionary will be reflected in every element of the list
the last loops overwrites all previous changes so you just get values from the last loops you need to put the line first thing in the for-loop so that a new object is created every loops for example l is now a list with 3 elements that are all references to the same dictionary d

57299681
put	get
if you want to dynamically control how much memory gets used and thus how many connections get accepted grpc has a resourcequota object that you can configure 1
if accepting a connection would put the server over the resource quota your server will instead refuse the connection
this provides a much better alternative to oom ing

57300213
aggregate-functions	sum
the outer query can perform a group by operation to collapse the rows into groups and we can use the sum aggregate-functions to total up the values
something like this select t.user_name t.date sum t.consume as consume sum t.recharge as recharge from -- inline view select c.user_name c.date c.consume 0 as recharge from consume c union all select r.user_name r.date 0 as consume r.recharge from recharge r t group by t.user_name t.date this is workable for reasonably sized sets
for large number of rows itgerlarge there are other possible query patterns

57300258
children	parent

the problem is that i m defining the wrong mappedsuperclass class it should be the other way around so the contentblock should be split into separate children classes and each children class must define the second column with the fixed value which corresponds to the other entity of the relation
meaning and this abstract entity is used as a parent for different blocks type like pagecontent and the page entity has a onetomany relation with pagecontent entity so each module will have pagecontent entity own entity class page blog .. and content entity class pagecontent blogcontent .. which has an property foreign key to define the relation with the module entity and an with a fixed value depending on the name of the module entity

57300269
portrait	landscape
ou would need each column on the desktop page in one parent div your html should look similar to this your css should contain this this will just target portrait mobile devices
for landscape orientation this line should contain something like media max-width 50rem although this doesn t use bootstrap at all this doesn t should fulfill your needs


57300435
countif	named

if your data on the december 2013 data sheet has the same structure across board which is l893 4 characters prefix + xxx random number of characters + condition code 6 characters + tgu3 4 characters suffix then you can use an array formula with the combination of sum countif and mid functions to find the desired result
please note i have defined the following named in my example 1 data range on the december 2013 data sheet is named as data_2013dec 2 condition code on the heart-related condition codes sheet is named as condition_code here is the formula please note it is an array formula so you need to press cse ctrl+shift+enter upon finishing the formula to make it work

57300699
for-loop	loops

first of all do not use a for-loop to append elements in a d3 code
we do use for loops and similar methods but in very specific situations

57300748
folder	directory
ndroid app src main assets if the folder assets doesn t exist then create the assets directory there
if the assets directory exists then delete two files viz index.android.bundle and index.android.bundle.meta then return to the root project directory and execute the command

int	double

int bolded portion mine int vectors exist so that data can be passed to c or fortran code which expects data and so that small int data can be represented exactly and compactly
note that current implementations of r use 32-bit integers for int vectors so the range of representable integers is restricted to about + -2 10 9 double can hold much larger integers exactly

57300928
int	double	int	double
note that current implementations of r use 32-bit int for int vectors so the range of representable int is restricted to about + -2 10 9 double can hold much larger int exactly
like the help page says r s int s are signed 32-bit numbers so can hold between -2147483648 and +2147483647 and take up 4 bytes
r s numeric is identical to an 64-bit double conforming to the ieee 754 standard

width	text-align
t starts on a new line and takes up the whole width basically p h2 will display block property and in body u have added text-align center
so p h2 will takes up whole width and aligned center where img will not have display block property that property so you have to add p h2 explicitly

memcpy	memcmp

std copy for example might call std memcpy
comparing two std string objects might result in a call to std memcmp

57301840
fast-math	icc
see the bottom of this answer for workarounds like openmp to get some of the benefit of fast-math for some parts of your code without actually enabling -ffast-math
icc defaults to fast-path so you have to specifically enable fp strict for it to be safe with -o3 but gcc clang default to fully strict fp regardless of other optimization settings
except -ofast -o3 -ffast-math you should be able to vectorize kahan summation by keeping a vector or four of totals and an equal number of vectors of compensations

for-loop	arrays

you can obtain the number of locators during runtime and use the number of locators in for-loop
in the below code i created the arrays which holds

57302257
equals	gethashcode

the problem if you haven t overridden equals etc is that in creating mrt you ve created new objects by copying data items out of your old objects
this means the default provisions of equals and gethashcode which are based on the memory address of your manualreadtag objects are different and your manualreadtag objects are not considered equal you need to either need to reuse the same objects so that memory address based equality assertion is true only works if itemssource was made from _manualreadtaglist _manualreadtaglist.except viewinggridfromcomparison.itemssource or you need to override equals and gethashcode on manualreadtag for best performance except will build a hash set from the mrt then iterate the _mnualreadtaglist hashing everything in the _mnualreadtaglist and looking the _mnualreadtaglist up in the hashset created from mrt

57302286

folder	directory
 create tempory location for dpkg and download relavent .deb file sudo mkdir tmp dpkg then cd tmp dpkg 2 downlod .deb file with relavent .deb file in sudo wget 3 manually go to that downloaded directory and extract the .deb file gdebi installation might not work as well navigate to and now you can see the set of files with cputable file
we need to copy files with cputable file to usr share dpkg 4 check usr share having dpkg folder if not create dpkg folder with sudo mkdir usr share dpkg 5 6 now you can see all the files and dpkg folder will fix the e error reading the cpu table

good to convert input to int
deeper produces a float product from then converts to double in calling round double

57303188
int	double	int	double
deeper produces a float product from then converts to double in calling round double
lastly it converts the results to int as part of the assignment
could have used roundf float and skip the double conversion

aggregate-functions	sum

having is used to calculate aggregate-functions
like in your above case if you want to find out name of the countries having sum population is greater then 2 000 000 then you can apply having clause like this for more info about the same you may find this link

inherited	properties

how about creating a main browserpage or browsermachine class that is a unittest.testcase and have every other page class inherited that
that way you can declare all your methods or properties like defining individualized find_by click_by scroll_to etc.

57303845
post	get

probably you are suffering from something like this post mentioned
one trick to make your component to get the changes from the store when passing state value from the store as a prop is to make a deep clone of your props or the prop in which you want to get the change for this you could use json json.parse json.stringify proptoclone

filtering	grouping
if we could grouping by then avg r.rank that would be more efficient than avg r.rank then grouping by
since there are now duplicates in the result of the nested query i m using distinct to filtering these out and then the outer query calculates a rank of all athletes in each category_id based on these averages
i d still be keen to hear if anyone knows of a better way to do this

57304382
division	modulo

operator will return the remainder of the integer division
modules tend to remove cycles from the number until the number reaches a positive number that is smaller than the number of the cycle which we call modulo or a negative number which we call a reminder

 just happened to need 4 for my code in your case you can do in data you can declare an x to have your supplied x labels i m not sure about the other libraries but c3.js is essentially a wrapper for d3.js so anything that can be done in one is most likely theoretically possible in both
c3.js is just easier to understand my code for

inherited	properties
this would be the datacontext of the window both usercontrols are in and hence inherited to both usercontrols
then bind the datacontext of the second usercontrol or a panel within it to that properties
since this is two usercontrols you cannot bind the datacontext of the second control directly to the selector in the first because it ll be a private member

try-catch	exception-handling

this is explained in the jls 14.20.3.2 extended try-with-resources the meaning of an extended try-with-resources statement try resourcespecification block catchesopt finallyopt is given by the following translation to a basic try-with-resources statement 14.20.3.1 nested inside a try-catch or try-finally or try-catch-finally statement the effect of the following translation is to put the resourcespecification inside the try statement
this allows a catch clause of an extended try-with-resources statement to catch an exception-handling due to the automatic initialization or closing of any resource

google-chrome	firefox

firstly ios restricts third party web browsers or any app that displays web pages to using its own engine - installing google-chrome on an ipad will not enable access to any web apis that ios safari doesn t already support
so in particular file system api is not available on ios even if you re using google-chrome cache api has a storage limitation per website of 50mb indexeddb has a storage limitation per website of 500mb or half the device s free space whichever is smaller pwas and smaller pwas cached data are automatically wiped from devices if not used for a few weeks the navigator.storage api for requiring durable data is not support on ios even if you re using google-chrome or firefox

multiplying	subtract

you issue is mostly around the below lines the way scroll with scale works like below calculate the unscaled x y coordinate where zoom happens calculate the new scaled x y coordinate my multiplying it with the new scale now you want this new coordinate remain at the same place where the existing coordinate was
so basically if you subtract the offset x y from the new scaled x y you get the scroll left and top

opencv	emgucv
isit download specific version of emgucv 2.4.2 according to your operating system like for windows x86 you can download libemgucv-windows-x86-gpu-2.4.2.1777.exe install your operating system some where like c emgucv after that go to c emgucv emgucv-windows-x86-gpu 2.4.2.1777 bin x86 and copy all opencv dll files and paste dll in your application exe output directory
to remove unnecessary opencv dll files you run your application and then press ctrl+a and try to delete the files those files which are used by your app you will not be able to delete as your app is running and dll files you run your application and then press ctrl+a and try to delete the files those files which are used by your app are in use and the reset unused dll files will be deleted other than that you can use dependency walker app which is outdated may or may not work

cpu	processors
n the other hand it will always eagerly spawn at least as many threads as told by threadpool.setminthreads which defaults to the number of logical processors on the machine
in conclusion the test code in question was doing two things which make it keep piling up more threads there are lots of tasks queued up and sitting in the queue for ages which indicates starvation cpu utilization is negligible which means that a new thread should be able to use a new thread

for-loop	loops
so as your code loops through the sheet the output is constantly being overwritten until the last match is made which is the only one you will see
i don t think you need either because your for-loop is already incrementing i so you are skipping a line every time it gets there
edit here is what i came up with

lso note that strings.replace does not necessarily replace all occurrences func replace s old new string n int string the parameter n tells how many replacement are to be performed max
so the following also works try the following on the go playground yet another solution could be to slice the string up until the replacable chars and starting from the replacable chars after the replacable one and just concatenate them try the replacable one on the go playground care must be taken here too the slice indices are byte indices not chars rune indices

my solution was to upgrade to angular animations 8.2.0 angular common 8.2.0 angular compiler 8.2.0 angular core 8.2.0 angular forms 8.2.0 angular platform-browser 8.2.0 angular platform-browser-dynamic 8.2.0 angular router 8.2.0 angular cdk 8.2.0 angular cli 8.2.0 angular language-service 8.2.0 angular upgrade 8.2.0

explode	substr

no need for regex or explode
if you want to remove the 18 first characters then use the substr function

57310117
submit	submission
admin id your are getting from session not from jsp form submission
use this - instead of as type submit submit all form values to a form-handler


57310157
folder	directory
note that this directory is not considered when searching the executable so you can t specify the program s path relative to cwd
these may be helpful command line execution in different folder


57310203
put	get

i know this is an old issue but thought i would put this variant to furtado s answer for reference here
an easy way to get the bounding box for the path

57310233
min	max

just update the min with the newly generated number
but once it reaches the upper limit you can t get any other number other than the max range

57310266
csv	tsv
also let me point out that since you specified csv output using csv is strongly advised but if for some reason you want to avoid those sometimes-superfluous quotation marks you can fiddle with the string-valued values to insert the quotation marks as needed and then use join instead of csv
alternatively you might like to weave tsv into your solution
caveat the solution above assumes the a b c keys are in the same order throughout and that the objects have no additional keys etc

57310606
try-catch	exception-handling
sually you do this if you want to see exception-handling that you have handled and swallowed silently in a try-catch statement
note this shows handled exception-handling so don t worry about t


57310614
for-loop	loops

it s slightly more efficient but not a big algorithmic problem like your double for-loop
if you want i can translate those to for loops but i recommend getting used to those

57310696
versioning	upgrade
because the new package - if the merge module is properly authored - should upgrade all shared files
you still need to update all installers to get the new merge module versioning in there for systems that don t have many other applications installed that use the same merge module
com everyone s favorite legacy technology com

57310818
filtering	grouping

this can be done with a group_by filtering operation in tidyverse
grouping by the columns of interest here used group_by_all as all the columns in the dataset are grouping

57311082
google-chrome	safari

i have done some changes and added updated css some changes is showing same way in google-chrome
if you just want to do some changes for google-chrome and safari use -webkit- for browser speicific.if your text is in the middle then you can make align-items center please check below image and code

57311125
hide	show

a way to solve that issue that issue is to hide the result till the response comes
you can also show a loading icon in the meantime this element load-icon does not exist but you can download another component to replace this element load-icon edit your issue is because of property

57311165
post	get
the first funcion is a post with query
i did implement these new functions there is a new implementation for a get and patch so from now on i dont need to use curl library anymore


57311426
sudo	nohup

sudo does not preserve the caller s environment unless you use the -e option and even then sudo must be configured to allow the caller s environment to be preserved for a given user or command
your first example is equivalent after shell processing to sudo -h -u username nohup sh -c echo bar

57311507
folder	directory

2 new android resource directory 3 in directory name enter mipmap
resource type select mipmap source set remain as main 4 click ok copy the previously backed up folders and paste select mipmap source set into the res folder

57311641
division	subtract

a number written in decimal positional system as a_na_ n-1 ...a_0 is the number a_n 10 n+a_ n-1 10 n-1 +...+a_0 note first that this number and the number a_0-a_ 1 +a_ 2 +...+ -1 n a_n which is the sum of its digits with alternating signs have the same remainder after division by 11
you can check that by subtract both numbers and noting that the result is a multiple of 11

57312132
folder	directory

using copy and add you can only use source files that are in the same folder as the dockerfile or in sub-folders copy obeys the following rules the path must be inside the context of the build
you cannot copy .. something something because the first step of a docker build is to send the context directory and subdirectories to the docker daemon

57312180
folder	directory
make sure . docker folder contains app.py file
if you know the correct directory containing the build context and the app.py file then specify that directory as build context
build path to build context more info about build context here

57312264
innodb	myisam
hence it is somewhat useless without listing a bunch of caveats
note all of this discussion applies to all versions that include innodb which goes back as far as 4.0
meanwhile if you are not using myisam except for system tables set

57312306
typedef	struct

in that case the typedef can be placed in the header file allowing pointers to the opaque type to be used in function prototypes or as local variables
the struct definition itself then goes into the implementation

57312428
typedef	struct

note too that you don t inherently need a typedef at all
having added the tag you can refer to that type everywhere as struct node

57312428
typedef	struct
having added the tag you can refer to that type everywhere as struct node
the typedef d alias is a convenience only and one that i think is way overused
all too often typedef s obfuscate more than they help

57312589
post	get

i found an answer that worked for me i ve referenced this post this other post and the post mentioned on the question
here s some code component content component pageheader layout applayout content tickets this way i can have optional parameters on my content page that get treated by each fragment individually

57312626
passwd	visudo
command should be your_php_user_password is the passwd for the php user
also you have to give to the user root priviledges go to edit this file and add this line under the line that contains settings for root root all all all all you edit visudo file and give the php user more right
if not the php will not have enough permissions to do the job

57313151
post	get
there are plenty blog post and documentation that can help you get started
for example medium post automate executing aws athena queries and moving the results around s3 with airflow
complete guide to installation of airflow link 1 and link 2 you can even setup integration with slack for sending notification when you queries terminate either in success or fail state

57313427
client-side	server-side
note you need to be careful to only use npm packages that are designed to be used in the client-side and don t depend on the node.js environment
many packages are designed to only be used on the server-side and depend on node libraries etc.
using require at this point would likely become unnecessary and make things more complicated as webpack s automated bundling will do a similar thing additionally exporting all the code as a single typescript file may complicate things

57313457
range	median
while this may be strictly true in most practical cases the frequency data reside as in this example within a list of ordered categories and in non-trivial cases have a range of values within the categories
given this form the question is not which interval contains the median so much as what would be a good estimate for where within the interval the median lies
the us census bureau usually uses a technique of linear interpolation within the interval

57313475
maven	pom.xml
what i do is swagger structure in the models project i have a swagger containing just the definitions empty object as paths in the api projects i have a swagger which references the definitions in the models project build process build the models project first with build the apis with typemappings and importmappings in the config telling them to take all the models in common from that namespace i use the maven plugin to run the codegen
i have a pretty hacky bash script that updates the type mappings in the pom.xml when i have added new objects to the models


57313561
folder	directory
note that most parts of git just think of a file has having a full name path to file.ext is not two-directories-and-a-file
there are no folder in git the file just has the long-string-y name path to file.ext
but real systems do have directory folder so a real comparison probably ought to take that into account

57313897
for-loop	arrays
with this your html elements will be treated as arrays
here an example for your case a change in the model have the skillsselected property list as holder of the boolean values then on the view use for-loop and as a reference here an example on how to pass and receive the model in the controller


57314019
inherited	properties
once set to true each chat inherited it and gets selected
add a selected properties to your user component instead


57314624
post	get
so you don t need to use post routes
tag is for get routes
so change your routes as

57314628
tablelayout	margins
make tablelayout as layout_width match_parent layout height wrap_content respectively
also try to avoid the below margins you mentioned
the above can be rewritten as

57314704
post	put

you should post your form.value so people can help you debug
you could also try to change how you are creating your http options object like so then in your put just pass in createhttpoptions note if you are sending a file you don t need to send headersmap

57314737
disk	ram

ddr3 ram operates at 25gbps+ on modern systems so i ll assume you can see the problem with systems running at 1 25th to less than 1 2 of the speed anticipated
the caches on my linux systems are literally the same speed as disk i o of the filesystem meaning the caches on my linux systems do not help our performance and are actively sending the os s ram into swap instead of clearing caches

57314841
for-loop	loops

each iteration of the for-loop defines clean using raw as an argument
however raw is not redefined in loops so each time you run loops it looks at the same raw

57314943
swift	objective-c

therefore you could wind up with a layout mismatch between swift and msl i haven t seen this happen but the point is that it can
the current guidance i believe is to define such structs in c objective-c instead and import such structs via a bridging header

57315225
versioning	upgrade

the pseudo-version format helps provide a simple total ordering across all versioning based on standard semver ordering which makes it easier to reason about what commit will be considered later than another commit or whether an actual semver tag is considered later than a separate commit
controlling dependency versioning you can read more about all of the above in the how to upgrade and downgrade dependencies section of the go modules wiki which also contains additional links into the official documentation

57315545
tiff	png
if on linux macos try running file cells1.tif see wikipedia for description of png signature as suggested by warren
see wikipedia for description of tiff header


57315567
qpainter	qwidget	qpainter	qframe

there s no need to use qpainter for the blue square as you can use stylesheets for your whole widget the trick is to use selectors
i tried to create your widget and used this stylesheet i created a container qwidget the status rectangle is actually a qframe with this stylesheet own layout which i named statusframe you can set this stylesheet in designer or by means of setobjectname str

57315567
qframe	qwidget
 tried to create your widget and used this stylesheet i created a container qwidget the status rectangle is actually a qframe with this stylesheet own layout which i named statusframe you can set this stylesheet in designer or by means of setobjectname str
by using object names and child selectors i was able to set specific fonts for this stylesheet labels by using the qframe#statusframe qlabel selector which means apply to each qlabel that is a child of a qframe


57315944
division	subtraction

however since the author cast to signed meaning signed int or int the signed 0x80000000 evaluates to an int value of 2 147 483 648 and the subtraction is evaluated with int arithmetic
then we have -2147483648 - -1 which produces 2 147 483 647 and division by 10 produces 214 748 364

57316275
postgresql	mysql

postgresql and oracle support returning with multiple columns
mysql does not support it but slick probably emulates it for auto increment ids with the last_insert_id call

57317536
width	margin

the problem is that both of your columns occupy 50 width
you ll need to shrink this allowing you to make use of the newly-created margin

57317536
width	margin	width	margin
you ll need to shrink this allowing you to make use of the newly-created margin
in the following i ve changed this width to 45 and then added margin-right of 10 to the first column with the selector .column first-of-type
note that the columns with the additional margin still occupy the full width as the two columns now total 90 leaving the 10 for the margin

57317746
dateadd	datepart
his works in postgresql between dateadd days datepart day current_date - 1 dateadd month -1 current_date and dateadd days datepart day current_date - 1 current_date i figured it out
you can it put an int in the date field of a datediff or dateadd in postgresql


57318160
put	get
onfiguring the certificates didn t help but t help worked when i put t help in the same line
i also specified which binaries i needed when t help gave this error my resolution i was able to get t help installed with this line npm install --cafile path to myca.cert oracle node-oracledb.git#v2.3.0 i hope this would be able to help someone coming across this issue


57318278
post	get
basically the new lines were getting removed in the ajax get request before being sent to my php script and inserted to db
the solution is to do a post request with jquery
unfortunetly i could not find a vanilla js solution

57318349
short	base

the short answer is typically you don t have to calculate the status on the client since it s calculated at the server level
to illustrate the standard way that you are trying to print with kubectl get pods in the kubernetes code base it s called human readable

57318418
ienumerable	icollection
do use the least-specialized type possible as a parameter type
most members taking collections as parameters use the ienumerable interface
avoid using icollection or icollection as a parameter just to access the count property

57318418
ienumerable	icollection
avoid using icollection or icollection as a parameter just to access the count property
do use readonlycollection a subclass of readonlycollection or in rare cases ienumerable for properties or return values representing read-only collections
as the last point states you shouldn t avoid readonlycollection like you were suggesting

57318455
postgresql	mysql
n the database servers screen select yes to run mysql database server because mysql server is widely used and supported by most applications and no to run postgresql database server
press next to continue on the database servers screen enter your desired mysql root password


57318517
mongodb	bson	mongodb	bson
for most cases in application development you will want to use the bson date type
pymongo uses datetime.datetime objects for representing dates and times in mongodb documents
lastly worth noting that bson timestamp is not to be confused with python timestamp from time.time

57318744
cpu	hyperthreading	processors	hyperthreading

regarding your output for cat proc cpuinfo cpu cores 16 refers to real physical cores as opposed to virtual logical cores providing hardware-threads in this output referred to as processors
you usually have twice as much logical cores as you have physical cores this comes through a hardware-optimization called simultaneous multi-threading smt or in intel-speak hyperthreading

57318807
put	get
use cherrypy put that in a file say main.py then in a terminal python main.py then go to see magic happening when you click submit the one next to the search box i added to your code you ve entered in the form i entered something in the form... i litteraly just pasted an example from the doc tweaked to fit your code a bit more
other than pip install cherrypy you really have nothing else to do to get started
by far the easiest way to make a webserver in python imo

57319039
free	malloc	free	malloc
so if other code still wants to use free on these pointers you do need to keep the overloaded new delete for this class even if it doesn t call dosomething
and you need to keep using malloc instead of using some other way of calling the default new
but if the only thing that was calling free is the corresponding delete operator you only have one place in your source to change remove

57319229
post	get
when specifying a method i like to do it more like except
a form constructed with a form_tag as above is going to submit using post by default
so instead what you really should do is and that should get you going in the right direction

57319351
multiplying	subtract
this is a 32 bit floating point numpy array with shape 2 375 1242 2
convert an array with shape 375 1242 2 to 16 bit unsigned integers by multiplying by 64 adding and casting the values to np.uint16
that is the inverse of this description that you quoted to convert the u- v-flow into floating point values convert the value to float subtract 2 15 and divide the result by 64.0

57319582
folder	directory
well the point is here that sometimes even creating a simple data directory won t work
you would have to go to the source and create a folder yourself
this case is same

57319608
vsts	tfs
ince tfs is a local server wihch built on a sql server back end a local server wihch built on a sql server back process templates need be customized with code
oppositely vsts is a cloud service and oppositely vsts process templates can be updated automatically on a regular basis because of oppositely vsts hosted by cloud


57319608
vsts	tfs
n the org which migrated from tfs to vsts the feature of customize process with code retained
so in these orgs you will see that these orgs both has the feature which support on cloud and local and also you can customize the process which in vsts with rest api


57319608
vsts	tfs
o as your question if you are using vsts and your org is not migrated from tfs you could not export and import process in boards
if you are using tfs you can directly export the process customize the process and then import into your org to apply the process in boards


57320108
pull	push
git fetch origin pull id head branchname but the remote refs pull namespace is read-only
if you try to push any commits there you ll see this error so i did not see any full ie read write support
and the notion of namespace for gitlab is completely different anyway

57320441
chmod	mkdir
because of 1 you should have a path owned by root to be the data path you d better give full privileges to the path chmod 777 yourpath
mention you should mkdir when logining the sftp server with sftp -p 22 admin 127.0.0.1 not to do it in data path because the path will owned by root or other system user but not the user in your sftp system so that you can not upload files because permission denied
after changing all of above i can finally upload and download files on the server

57320552
screens	tablet
mobile tablet monitor
while developing go from small top big screens resolution


57320715
integer	fractions
ccording to official documentation the number returned by dimensions-related apis including .outerheight may be fractions in some cases
code should not assume code is an integer


57320745
istringstream	gets
his is a template and as a template parameter a template gets the type of data that id should read and as a constructor parameter it gets a reference to an input stream
it doesnt t matter if the input stream is a std cin or a std ifstream or a std istringstream


57321204
restrict	shared
 had assumed that this would also shared information between tabs when i went through the documentation as it was a subscription- it does not
it is apparently restrict to only one instance of your session a single tab on browser


57321382
sse	avx
this repo contains a number of tensorflow pip wheel files which are build using sse instead of avx
sse build run without any compilation errors
use this file from the repo

57321449
implements	sealed

you can delegate this to the creator of the class by implements idisposable
public sealed class cachemanagementhelper idisposable the creator of this object now creates the idisposable object and hence is responsible for disposing the idisposable object

57321496
doc	rtf

it seems no any migradoc renders that support doc or docx formats
on documentation page we can see one migradoc feature supports different output formats pdf word html any printer supported by windows but seems documentation says about rtf format that perfectly works with word

57321496
doc	rtf	doc	rtf
on documentation page we can see one migradoc feature supports different output formats pdf word html any printer supported by windows but seems documentation says about rtf format that perfectly works with word
i have reviewed migradoc repository and i do not see any doc renders
we can use only rtf converter for word supporting

57321496
doc	rtf
e can use only rtf converter for word supporting
so we can we generate doc file directly using this package


57321538
folder	directory

you can find jdk in this folder when you install oracle
choose c oracle x32orx64 client jdk directory

57321879
ssl	https
our hunch to create a new elastic beanstalk app and try the application load balancer is a good idea but i found this in the amazon-web-services docs for configuring load balancing elastic beanstalk that might contradict that unlike a classic load balancer or a network load balancer an application load balancer can t have transport layer layer 4 tcp or ssl tls listeners
this supports only http and https listeners


57321983
put	get

you should not put your private key in code it s bad practice and usually with this key you can do crud operations with api and even drop some parts of database
get your marvel public key for example 1234 your private key for example abcd and choose timestamp for example 1564731162583

57321983
put	get

go to website put your strings like 1564731162583abcd1234 timestamp + private key + api key without spaces
you will get with parameters from example hash b5936debcc1a252c679d2d3e5361b6c0 one more important thing when you add hash b5936debcc1a252c679d2d3e5361b6c0 one more important thing in your api call timestamp have to be the same as in hash previously chosen example 1564731162583 and also md5 hash have to be in lowercase

57322263
put	get
additionally try to use state to record the width and define that ref-width reading logic outside of the render
put it in componentdidmount instead that way we ve ensured that the element has rendered to the screen and we don t need to check if ref.current is truthy
also you can use .clientwidth instead of .offsetwidth so that you get the actual element width not including borders

57322268
versioning	upgrade
here was an error running the selected code generator failed to upgrade dependency information for the project
please restore the project and try again steps go to the project and update all nuget packages to latest versioning


57323087
folder	directory
i had many and i trimmed them down to only 1 instance of a 64b jre and 32b jre each
i removed the rest by just deleting their folder
subsequently i checked that my user and system environment variables specifically java_home still pointed to a valid java directory

57323155
post	get
you may get some inspiration from my two articles and their demo applications entering iso formatted date with input mask and full validation in microsoft access entering 24-hour time with input mask and full validation in microsoft access if you don t have an account browse for the link read the full article
too much code to post here but code is also on github vba.dateentry and vba.timeentry


57323170
filtering	grouping
and based on the result of that function call the grouping will be formed
since we are interested only in the items which are present in keys we filtering with if res in the list comprehension


57323580
for-loop	loops

mistakes you did in the inner for-loop you re counting from i + k - 1
then your loops starts at and one line below you try to do but is not defined

57323617
inherited	properties

to make your code cleaner you should also refactor the productstructure object like this edit another way to do it without inherited would be -in some scenario- to store your subnodes as a string inside your productstructure object
this way you don t load hundreds of objects without the need you just have a string in memory then when you need those objects call a method on your productstructure object that would deserialize a string in memory and assign the result to your subnodes properties

57323640
filtering	grouping
distinct change this cte-code to this using distinct the engine will return all rows and filtering the final output
using grouping by will return a single refrecid and continue with this
your execution plans might tell you count of estimated and actual rows if the set was reduced to single ids before or after you are calling the stuff sub select with xml .

57323961
tapply	rep
tapply a gl length a 4 4 function x prod 1 + x - 1 # 1 2 #0.2579 0.1800 the grouping part and calculation part can be done in variety of ways
for example the above can also be done using split + sapply sapply split a gl length a 4 4 function x prod 1 + x - 1 or grouping can also be done using rep


57324177
int	chars

texts are therefore encoded as a sequence of unsigned int
different chars encodings differ in the chars they allow and how they assign these unique int

57324177
int	chars
he unsigned int encoding a chars is encoded as a sequence of bits
chars encodings differ in the number of bits chars encodings use for this encoding


57324528
next	except

i did install the setuptools first and omitted the -e next i was able to download model using python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm and ran the example longer answer using the -e after a long time the error below popped up
pipenv.patched.notpip._internal.exceptions.installationerror command python setup.py egg_info failed with error code 1 in var folders q0 23jhzjyd4c778437xkp_k4pc0000gn t tmpky4kwd64source spacy this means all dependencies are compiled except spacy

57324961
width	margin

ie calculates padding as part of height width other browsers interpret it height width plus padding
so try to give only height width or padding margin

57324961
width	margin	width	height
so try to give only height width or padding margin
so if i delete width and padding plus add .px-3 like jeremy suggested in the comments it will works as expected on all browsers


57325073
prng	random
he states array can be generated in the host using another prng and copied to the device or the device can be initialized in the device using some kind of hash function applied to the work-item global ids
if you use the work-item global ids as initial seeds the random streams for each work-item will be very low quality due to high correlation between the work-item global ids


57325239
allocator	stl
it defines a set of containers algorithms and utilities some of which emulate parts of the stl
there is no dynamic memory allocator
the library makes no use of the heap

57325425
seaborn	matplotlib

but be aware that seaborn creates a pyplot figure
embedding a pyplot figure in a custom gui may cause problems note how none of the examples from the matplotlib page on embedding use pyplot

57325959
factors	mean
if this will be less efficient than for j in range b for i in range a #do stuff you can work out that for i in range a for j in range b for k in range c for l in range d #do stuff calls the range function many times which is minimized when
in your case you can work out that the difference between the most efficient and least efficient ways of looping measured by number of range calls is a factors of roughly 34 which is more than i had initially expected
this doesn t mean that one approach will be 34 times quicker than the other

57326153
jar	war

the primefaces jar file is essentially also a web fragment jar file but actually not a custom one hence the error message being slightly unhelpful for starters i ll improve that for the next omnifaces version
in order to solve your problem you need to make sure that there s only one primefaces jar file in web-inf lib folder of the produced war file and that there are no duplicates throughout the runtime classpath

57326153
jar	war
in order to solve your problem you need to make sure that there s only one primefaces jar file in web-inf lib folder of the produced war file and that there are no duplicates throughout the runtime classpath
in case your application is in ear format you also need to make sure that no one web fragment jar file ends up in lib folder of the produced ear file
in case you deploy to a custom built server stack you also need to make sure that no one web fragment jar file is manually placed in default classpath of the server lib folder of tomcat

57326661
floor	sqrt
this should be easy to convert to other languages
you could use floor rather than int here. this version uses python to return two output values x and y for one input value i
in python 3 the line from math import sqrt would be needed at the top of the code

57326711
post	get

create a file named and in this file write the logic to delete the post using id of the blog like this and in the blogs view you will be having a php forloop to show all the blogs
you can add a button anywhere with a link to the delete file with the id that you ll get by echoing like this and when the user clicks a button a button will run the code form delete.php file

57326729
folder	directory
the random pictures were generated at this link i just used a python script to generate 200 images
make sure when you use flow_from_directory it reads the folder in alphanumeric order
so the first folder in the directory will be class 0

qtabwidget	qtimer

the problem in your case is that when the signal is triggered even your mouse is on the qtabwidget so even if you change the tab with setcurrentindex 0 then the mouse event will change the tab back to 1
in your case the logic is change your case a moment later and for this a qtimer is used

client-side	server-side	client-side	server-side
if you are building a solution that runs in a server-side context you should try to use components that have been made safe for unattended execution
or you should try to find alternatives that allow at least part of the code to run client-side
if you use an office application from a server-side solution the application will lack many of the necessary capabilities to run successfully

put	get	put	get
so what you should do is put index 0 to length of the array you are using to hold your model and inside your iaxisvalueformatter subclass hold the timestamp values
so when you override stringforvalue get the timestamp from the stored property
so your subclass should look like this so bottom line is you should maintain one extra array to hold the timestamp value and put normal for loop index as the x value of the barchartdataentry

57327732
post	get

so you have --post ----useruid1 ------postuuid --------postdata ------postuuid --------postdata ----useruid2 ------postuuid --------postdata may i suggest you to structure the data this way -- post ---- postuuid 1 ------ author useruuid 1 ------ desc .. ------ image .. ------ name .. ---- postuuid 2 ------ author useruuid 1 ------ desc .. ------ image .. ------ name .. ---- postuuid 3 ------ author useruuid 2 ------ desc .. ------ image .. ------ name .. -- users ---- useruuid 1 ------ profileimage .. ------ ..... ---- useruuid 2 ------ profileimage .. ------ ..... and when you want to query post by user just query this way ref.child post .orderbychild author .equalsto useruid .add.
and if you want all the post just query this way and in onchildadded .. you get only single post data but this will retrieve all post one by one and continue listening for new ones in realtime so you just get this single post and pass this single post as param in a method to display only single post data in a desired view

57327732
post	get
nd if you want all the post just query this way and in onchildadded .. you get only single post data but this will retrieve all post one by one and continue listening for new ones in realtime so you just get this single post and pass this single post as param in a method to display only single post data in a desired view
also if you want to display the user info you just query the user inside you can create a hashmap with string userclass like useruid userdata and check if you have the data for this user already and if you have this user just get this user instead of downloading this user again and again


57327732
post	get
but if you want to stick with this check this out since you obtain all the childs in post you get objects with key userid and list with post as value
you must iterate over each object with userid and list of post and inside each loop to iterate over this list of post
the code may not be very accurate but this is the logic

folder	directory
artifacts are logged in the directory mlflow or if you prefer in a docker volume
note there s a typo in the cited walk-through article in docker-compose.yml it shouldn t be volumes - . postgres-store var lib postgresql data which would bind a local folder named postgres-store . instead to mount the docker volume postgres_store you should use volumes - postgres-store var lib postgresql data

n-gram	words

the function explode which turns those lists of n-gram per row into individual n-gram per row 3
with the join it s much easier to just rename the column you are joining on here is the detailed approach i hope it helps step 1 generate the spark data frame step 2 generate the list of key words the join

57328555
ready	each
he end result for each zone will look like now we need to create the post_save and post_delete signals and connect everything to the appconfig.ready function essentially we will follow the steps described here django create and save many instances of model when another object are created with a slight twist
i assume that the store_zones_by_distance is created in your_app utils.py you may create the store_zones_by_distance is created in your_app utils.py wherever you want though create the post_save and post_delete signals in your_app signals.py run the store_zones_by_distance on server start and connect the signals in your_app app.py you will not save on queries much with this but you will have a cache ready without blocking any of your endpoints until it updates


57328607
client-side	server-side
i would call them the same as i would in php - scripts and form processor
some other important distinctions when talking about forms processors are client-side vs

although rfc 6532 isn t strictly relevant to the problem implements reading support for it in zf2 is probably the simplest way to solve your problem
this is because 6532 extends the message format to support addresses such as stéph example.com and it does so in a way that resembles common behaviour up through the years

word spacing is also influenced by justification see the text-align property

57330323
division	multiplication
and on at least one common architecture floating point division can be vectorized while integer division cannot so the most expensive operation in your code must be performed more times and higher cost per operation for integer math while floating point math does it fewer times at lower cost per operation
long answer numpy uses vectorized math when available and the x86-64 architecture which i m guessing you re using doesn t provide a simd instruction for integer division
it only provides vectorized multiplication for integers via the pmuludq family of instructions but provides both multiplication mulpd family and division divpd family for floating point

57330323
int	double
hides performance differences the interpreter overhead of performing individual divisions is a greater percentage of the total time reduces relative performance differences since more of the time is spent on overhead increases cost of int operations in general int division is even more expensive on python int s
on cpython int is implemented as an array of 15 or 30 bit limbs with a ssize_t that defines both the signedness and the number of limbs
cpython s float is just a plain object wrapper around a normal c double with no special features

57330323
int	double	int	double
cpython s float is just a plain object wrapper around a normal c double with no special features
increases the cost of int int python guarantees floor division but c only provides truncating int division so even in the fast path for small int s python has to check for mismatched signs and adjust the operation to ensure the result is the floor not simple truncation
increases cost of int int operation specifically for large inputs cpython s int int operation doesn t just cast both operands to float c double and perform floating point division

57331743
braces	reformatting
the most striking problem appears after reformatting your code you seem to assume that indentation determines structure
unlike python c ignores indentation for structure you must use curly braces to group multiple statements into a single block controlled by an if clause do not write this write this instead

the absolute movement you would need to apply to your children object c to move to y is the vector y - c
if you apply this absolute movement to the parent your children will be moved the same amount because children move along with children parent

scylla	cassandra

full disclosure - i work on the scylla project
i agree that if fault-tolerance and availability are your primary requirements you should choose cassandra or scylla as they are best-in-class at those requirements

57332156
scylla	cassandra	scylla	cassandra
details here given your use case if you envision storing multiple tb of data i would recommend scylla over cassandra
cassandra recommends that you store a max of 1 tb per node
scylla has no such limitations - there are users storing 20+ tb per node

57332156
scylla	cassandra
there are other advantages of scylla vs
cassandra in terms of throughput tuning memory management etc
but this data density would likely be the primary benefit for you

57332165
printf	fgets

also could you open the remote debugger and inside the componentwillmount you can put console.log this.props to check if the homescreen is geting the function inside props

57333369
ubuntu	debian

the reason why you are having issues with this is because sql server 2017 2019 packages meant for ubuntu 16.04 have a dependency on openssl version 1.0
while your debian openssl seems to be on 1.1

57333369
ubuntu	debian
while your debian openssl seems to be on 1.1
until we get a package meant for ubuntu 18.04 with openssl 1.1 updates you can follow the steps in additional note of following blog and create links to libssl.so and libcrypto.so for version 1.0 into opt mssql lib path
once the appropriate links are created the connectivity to sql server should work

57333420
hash	md5

you could hash your data then encode the hash with base64 rather than taking the hex digest directly this uses all 26 2+10 62 alphanumeric characters plus + and
your implementation might produce something like this d88cc7dea0fee57975187d4b30950f7b encoding this d88cc7dea0fee57975187d4b30950f7b with base64 reduces the length slightly however if you want to avoid collisions you need to increase the length of the digest so use a hash function like sha512 for instance instead of md5 or even just generate a random number

57333644
prng	random
the set of permutations a particular prng can choose can be different from the set of permutations another prng can choose even if both prngs are initialized with the same seed. see also this question
note that although the math.random algorithm used by v8 uses a state length of 128 bits at the time of this writing no particular state length is mandated by the ecmascript specification of math.random which states only that that method uses an implementation-dependent algorithm or strategy to generate random numbers see ecmascript sec
20.2.2.27

57333644
prng	random

a prng s period can be extended with the bays-durham shuffle which effectively increases that prng s state length see severin pappadeux s answer
however if you merely initialize the bays-durham table entries with outputs of the prng rather than use the seed to initialize those entries it will still be the case that that particular prng which includes the way in which it initializes those entries and selects those table entries based on the random numbers it generates can t choose more permutations than the number of possible seeds to initialize it original state because there would be only one way to initialize the bays-durham entries for a given seed mdash

57333647
prng	random
with 128 bits of starting state you can only generate at most 2 128 different permutations
it doesn t matter how often you use this state call math.random the prng is deterministic after all
where the number of calls to math.random actually matter is when each call would draw some more entropy from hardware random into the system instead of relying on the internal state that is initialised only once the entropy of a single call result is so low that you don t use the entire internal state over the run of the algorithm

57333696
comparator	comparable
update better solution note when using collections.sort it is important to make sure the object type of the array implements comparable
the collections.sort uses the comparator within the object class to sort the elements

57334005
instances	transient
your analogy between a ksql server and a kafka streams program is not 100 accurate though
each query is a kafka streams program note that a program can have multiple instances
also there is a difference between persistent queries and transient queries

57334005
instances	transient
the information about such transient queries is not distributed to other servers
basically a unique query-id ie application.id is generated and the servers runs a single instances kafakstreams program
hence the server program will subscribe to all partitions

57334108
inherited	properties

i think you can create a protocol viewmodel then create different view models who inherited this protocol
then create a function in your tableview cell to assign the values to your properties

57334108
inherited	properties
then create a function in your tableview cell to assign the values to your properties
for me the advantage of using a protocol view model is that you can pass any view models inherited from protocol to your view to assign the value that avoids to expose your data in your view tableview cell in this case


57334398
put	get
put these values together for your time-of-day to make a new localtime
combine the time-of-day with your intended date to get a localdatetime object
store that in a database column of sql-standard type timestamp without time zone

57334476
inline	inlining
the inlining is what one should try to achieve in such cases not only does it save call-overhead but also makes optimizations possible which would not be possible otherway here is a simple example where inlining got running time from o n to o 1
if the code will not be inline then the result depends on the used abi - but most probably the second version will lead to a slightly more performant binary - yet the advantage is quite neglegible in most of the cases
here i m taking a look at 64bit-linux which uses system v amd64 - abi

opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
you are certainly right that the web has moved on since those early experiments in opera i remember downloading the special camera build that had the first implementation of navigator.getusermedia and being very excited
with both google-chrome on android and safari on ios you can now make real time peer to peer video and audio calls in the browser over webrtc
to make that easier twilio has a video api and sdk that makes the signalling connections and overall experience much nicer

57335085

ou can now make push notifications happen on the web and this will work in google-chrome
however apple have been reluctant to add that to safari ios you can do apple on the desktop however apple s not the standard


57335099
for-loop	arrays
for instance if you redefine offset as a one-dimensional arrays then you can calculate all values of mult at once without having to invoke a for-loop mult will become a one-dimensional arrays holding the correct values
we can avoid dividing by zero using the out argument setting the default output to the offset arrays and where argument performing the calculation only where offset doesn t equal zero then to use the mult arrays on the rimg2 row by row you can use a broadcasting trick here i m assuming you want to add one to each element in rimg2 i found this article extremely helpful when learning how to effectively work with numpy arrays since you are working with images you may want to especially pay attention to the section on image feature extraction and stride_tricks
anyway i hope this helps you get started

57335242
for-loop	loops
he easiest thing to do is to get rid of the foreach loops and replace the foreach loops with a regular for-loop
there s a lot of overhead to use parallel threads and when a function is recursive the foreach loops s hard for the workers to really do better on the workers own


57335485
versioning	upgrade

as per the lifecycle release notes the first versioning of lifecycle-viewmodel-ktx the correct artifact for viewmodel related kotlin extensions that contains viewmodelscope is 2.1.0-alpha01
therefore you should upgrade to the latest versioning either 2.1.0-rc01 or 2.2.0-alpha02 both of which include that api

57335932
swift	objective-c
n such cases we can use swift s available declaration attribute to tell the compiler that code using the marked object or function should not compile
for example if you have to subclass nsobject into something that has a stored constant which needs to be passed at initialization and don t want to allow consumers to call init because it doesn t make sense to set a default value for the constant you can make init unavailable to t consumers note unfortunately as of 2.2 this kind of availability declaration is not converted into an objective-c attribute so objective-c consumers will still see the methods and classes as available

equals	compareto
p.s
if you implemente comparable#compareto you should also implement equals because there is contract between them if this is not the case you should make note this class has a natural ordering that is inconsistent with equals
last thing compareto must throw nullpointerexception if current object get compared to null object as opposed to equals which return false on such scenario

57336809
pull	push
it means your repo has commits that are different from the one in your pc local code and you re trying to add more commits changes to a codebase which is different from yours
according to github you can fix this by fetching and merging the changes made on the remote branch with the changes that you have made locally or you can simply use git pull to perform both commands at once in other cases this error is a result of destructive changes made locally by using commands like git commit --amend or git rebase
while you can override the remote by adding --force to the push command you should only do so if you are absolutely certain this is what you want to do

57337185
ant	maven

look into jenkins console output jenkins console output should report where the build is running so called workspace and where testng results plugin attempts to locate the results file the path to the testng results file must be relative to so called workspace and have the syntax of ant fileset if you re uncertain regarding how to properly build the path to the test artifacts - post the full paths to workspace and the testng-results.xml emailable-report.html and we will help you to come up with the correct definitions
in the meantime you could use wildcard paths like so jenkins will scan jenkins workspace recursively looking for the testng-results.xml file in all available locations your install command also looks suspicious normally you should not be putting your test artifacts to the maven repository so you might want to use mvn test or mvn verify instead

16 is a power of 2 so converting a power of 2 to binary is pretty simple each hex digit corresponds to exactly 4 binary digits - and you can rely on this fact as a first step you need to convert the input characters from ascii to numeric values that s easily done in one pass over the input hex string and subtract 48 if the character is between 0 and 9 or subtract 88 if the character is between a and f take a look at the ascii table if need an explanation on why  after that the conversion is straightforward - go over the hex array and for each hex value take a look at the last bit and proceed to the next bit exactly 4 times move to the next hex value and repeat the procedure
something like this and since you seem to be in need to have it ascii representation just pass over the output string and add 48 to each digit

opera	google-chrome

it s not a chrome-specific issue with protocol file opera and firefox display blank page too
when i want to browse html files on my localhost i have to access html files via protocol http instead for instance when i want to see c temp file.html in google-chrome i will make a virtual directory in my local apache host and add this line to systemroot system32 drivers etc hosts 127.0.0.1 temp.localhost now i can see the file in browsers at url

onmousedown	onmouseup
as per unity scripting documentation onmousedown is called when the user has pressed the mouse button while over the guielement or collider
onmouseup is called when the user has released the mouse button
if you want it to capture mouse clicks anywhere on the screen you may want to attach your script to a canvas instead of you player gameobject

setinterval	settimeout

as mentioned above setinterval does not play well with promises if you do not stop it
in case you clear the interval you can use it like it seems that it s settimeout that fits the case

57340008
range	max

there seems to be basically two kinds of things you have to do map inputs that should be handled the same way to contiguous range and then move contiguous range to the right place
max a-x x-b is the only kind of unit that can map non-contiguous range together

57340070
int	chars

you must define the length of the varchar columns like create table aorders id int identity not null createddate date not null billingcountry varchar 100 not null merchid int not null orderstatus varchar 100 not null
from chars and varchar transact-sql when n isn t specified in a data definition or variable declaration statement the default length is 1

post	put
it will not work to put application x-www-form-urlencoded in a content-type header if the actual data you send are serialized as json
caveat you may find code examples floating around that attempt to give the token exchange parameters as query parameters in the url rather than in a post body
discord used to accept this but doesn t anymore

mouse	keyboard
rag the panel outside the boundary of the other panel so that the panel is no longer an element of the other panel and then re-position it using the arrow keys on your keyboard not by dragging the arrow keys into position over the other panel using the mouse
it seems like the panel will only become an element of another panel if the panel is dragged into position over the top of another panel using the mouse


57340455
for-loop	loops

if you want the for-loop to keep going after an error is thrown because of a bad doi you can wrap the curl_download call in try
it ll still throw the error but your loops will keep going

int	double

it is easier to let it as a string then to convert it to an int in this case
another mistake is the operator which is an assignment operator if you want comparison you need to use double equal

57340820
width	height
the problem comes only when you specify an absolute value for height and or width
let s say you ve a widget and you specify width as 450
now it may fit on the bigger screens but on the small screen width 400 points then you ll see pixel overflow error in the ui

57341065
clang	icc

from a practical perspective clang and gcc should be treated as processing a dialect of c which does not allow any region of storage which has ever been accessed via any particular non-character type to be reliably accessed as any other even in cases where the standard would allow such access
conversely other compilers like icc will recognize that in cases where it can see a pointer or lvalue of one type used to form a pointer of another operations on that pointer may affect the original object without regard for whether the standard would require a pointer or lvalue of one type used to form a pointer of another operations on that pointer to notice such things

57341065
clang	icc
onversely other compilers like icc will recognize that in cases where it can see a pointer or lvalue of one type used to form a pointer of another operations on that pointer may affect the original object without regard for whether the standard would require a pointer or lvalue of one type used to form a pointer of another operations on that pointer to notice such things
if no particular portion of the storage within a malloc block is ever accessed via more than one type within the lifetime of a malloc block even clang and gcc will probably allow disjoint parts of a malloc block to be accessed using different types


57341123
llvm	clang++

llvm s main use is to generate cpu dependent machine code from llvm-ir
this llvm-ir is often generated by a compiler of a high-level language clang++ for c++ code or rustc for rust code

post	put

signeduploadurl creates a url for the post http method see the library source code at
you are using that signed url for a put request so the request isn t permitted

57341140
put	get

or you could create your own code to create a signed url for put starting with the library code as an example
signed urls are extremely tricky to get exactly right and creating your own code will probably be frustrating

57341347
pull	push
so git pull upstream master must obtain the complete history of master including any merged branches from github minus whatever pieces you already might have had locally
similarly git push origin must push the complete history of master up to bitbucket
fortunately you only have to do this once

57341386
quicksort	heapsort
f the number of partitions exceeds where n is the range of the input array the number of partitions uses a heapsort algorithm
otherwise the number of partitions uses a quicksort algorithm


57341456
mp3	wav
firefox and edge have different values in the file.mimetype field
for mp3 files google-chrome adds audio mp3 while firefox and edge add audio mpeg
so my filter was filtering our files that don t contain audio mp3 or audio wav mimetypes

57341513
multiplying	subtraction
you can then remove that component by multiplying the unit normal vector by that dot product then subtract that from the circle s velocity vector
the result of that subtraction is the circle s velocity along the plane
that apparently is what you wanted to find

57341630
stateless	stateful
ore details refer to flutter hot reload because stateless widgets do not have a state stateless widgets will be rendered once and will not update stateless widgets but will only be updated when external data changes
whereas stateful widgets have an internal state and can re-render if the input data changes or if widget s state changes


57342048
folder	directory
for that reason the batch file checks first if jrepl.bat really exists in directory of the batch file
next is checked if any file to process exists in source folder at all
then the output folder is created in case of not existing with folder existence verification

57342486
uiview	subviews

so the master uiview would have two subviews- uilabel for your text and a uiview for your bezel
the uiview subviews would be color - light gray the same height as your bottom border that you wanted the same width as your label

57342575
aggregate-functions	sum
you can t wrap the selected column in aggregate-functions
following query will break schema pruning select sum event.spent.amount as amount from event whole schema pruning work is covered in spark-4502 dirty workaround can be also specifying projected schema at load time


57342597

similarly time without time zone is a postgresql type
you don mysql need a type cast at all mysql and postgresql will cast mysql to the column type

addition and subtraction are trivial taking two instructions and using the carry flag
multiplication requires three multiplies and some additions it s common for 64-bit chips to already have a 64x64- 128 multiplying operation that outputs to two registers
division.

57343998
next	except

then you ll see something like this yield next seq and surround it with try-catch statement in this way
not recommended instead of that make your own version by fork the relevant branch def take seq n for i in range n # yield next seq try yield next seq except stopiteration return this will solved your problem

57344149
moviepy	pygame
imagemagick is not strictly required but needed if you want to incorporate texts
it can also be used as a backend for gifs though you can also create gifs with moviepy without imagemagick
pygame is needed for video and sound previews not relevant if you intend to work with moviepy on a server but essential for advanced video editing by hand

57344229
for-loop	arrays
i then added a new line to append to this arrays a new avaudioplayernode at the beginning inside of the second for-loop of the viewdidload function
this gave each item in the arrays a different avaudioplayernode value

he resoucres section in the yaml is not to get the second repo during the build the second repo s for get a yaml template from the second repo

for-loop	arrays
so when your code exit from for-loop sf texture t is destroyed c++ destroy scope variables when exiting some scope and pointer reference in sprite class points to deleted memory locations which cause sfml to have error while drawing your sprites
the solution to this problem is the global arrays for textures which you use
i also recommend adding the global arrays for sf sprites because it makes your code safer

int	double
int operations in ruby will almost never return infinity
an int can be as big as you have memory to hold it
float is implemented as a classic double precision-floating point number with an upper limit of about 1.7976931348623157e+308 and will return float infinity if you go to high

range	percentile
when these two results are multiplied it gives the number of values less than given value in the row of matching specialty which is equivalent to the offset of the column in the range
so the offset function simply navigates to that column and returns the value of the percentile
the below screenshot should help you understand it better

int	chars	int	double

it s very easy to declare and initialize an array for example you want to save 5 int elements which are 1 2 3 4 5 in an array so you can do it in the following way a or b int a 1 2 3 4 5
so the basic pattern is for initialization and declaration by method a is datatype should be in lower case so the basic pattern is for initialization and declaration by method a is if it s a string array if it s a chars array for float double the format of array will be same as integer for example but when you declare and initialize the array by method a you will have to enter the values manually or by loop or something but when you do it by method b you will not have to enter the values manually

clearinterval	settimeout
hen the page loads you should use the javascript settimeout function to call your move function after 10 seconds

57347028
subtraction	multiplication
subtraction is very similar
multiplication must use the identity 2⁶⁴a + b 2⁶⁴c + d 2¹²⁸ac + 2⁶⁴ ad+bc + bd where each of these multiplication returns the upper half of the product in one register and the lower half of the product in another
some of those terms will be dropped because bits above the 128th don t fit into a u128 and are discarded

57347028
x86	mips
blt t0 t1 overflow sparc has control codes like the control flags of x86 but you have to use a special instruction add cc to set them
mips on the other hand requires you to check whether the sum of two unsigned integers is strictly less than one of the operands
if so the addition overflowed

post	get
so i was about to post that the following would improve your error messages but when i tried it i didn t really get much better results
in this case the confounding issue is your use of to get out-of-order each matching which while perfectly legitimate in your parser mixes up the exception handling possibly uncovering a bug in pyparsing
if you replace with + in your clauses_all_and expression you ll see the - operator at work here and in fact this points to a general debugging tactic with pyparsing try out sub-expressions in isolation if complex expressions are not giving helpful exception messages

57347354
integer	unsigned
the effect is undefined if this is not one of short int long long long unsigned short unsigned int unsigned long or unsigned long long
so the result type should be an integer

strcpy	malloc

you don t need the last line strcpy takes care of that for you
in real code you absolutely must check malloc s return value to make sure malloc s s not null

57347409
strcpy	malloc
in particular you ve got the vital + 1 in the call to malloc
strlen gives you the length of the string not including the terminating 0 character but strcpy is going to add it so you absolutely need to allocate space for it
the problem with strcpy -- the fatal problem some people say -- is that at the moment you call strcpy you have no way of telling strcpy how big the destination array is

57347588
for-loop	loops
second your first for-loop is unnecessary
you create a list b with the elements from range n then you loops over those exact same elements again
it would suffice to just have for i in range n and not create b at all

children	parent
imilarly if the child process is non-daemonic then the parent process may hang on exit when the parent process tries to join all the parent process non-daemonic children
docs also don t use while not q.empty the parent process s an anti-pattern which will lead to deadlocks as soon as you have multiple consumers use sentinel-values instead to notify the consumer that no further items are coming


57347984
memcpy	strdup	strcpy	strdup

anyway as you already have to determine the length prefer memcpy over strcpy
what you should do is extracting the repeated recalculation of the string-length into a function let s call the repeated recalculation of the string-length strdup that is the name posix and the next c standard give the repeated recalculation of the string-length

57348088
force.com	salesforce
when an application needs to provide a list of records involved in a parent child relationship force.com uses the mt_name_denorm table to execute a relatively simple query that retrieves the name of each referenced record for display in the app say as part of a hyperlink
this also doesn t make sense unless objid is being used to mean what is called guid in the visual depiction of the table above in the document - the salesforce id of the record

the best way is using a profiler
python comes with a built-in profiler but python a bit cumbersome to use first we profile your program with cprofile and then load the profile for review with pstats python3 -m cprofile -o so57333255.py.prof so57333255.py python3 -m pstats so57333255.py.prof inside pstats we enter sort cumtime to sort inside pstats by time spent in a function and all functions called by inside pstats and stats 5 to show the top 5 entries from here we learn that the most expensive single function in your programm is apply called 8 times - but we don t see from here whether the 8 calls took more or less the same amount of time each or if one took especially long

in your example the values for each parent node are the total for the subnodes
if this is the case then you want to only check those nodes which have no children and are checked

metaclass	abc
nd of course that is only needed if you don t want or can t change the metaclass you already have or if you want your metaclass to be used in other classes that are not using abc - otherwise you can just make your own metaclass inherit from abcmeta itself - no need to create a third metaclass to combine both import abc .. class kindmeta abc.abcmeta .. if on the other hand you are using the metaclass + class construction machinery of python to create objects that are not quite classes like for example the zope.interface package does to create interfaces you have to decide 1 if the zope.interface package makes sense to use that along abc.abc at all and second if the correspondent method in the abcmeta have to be run usually yes if you need the functionality
in that case you have to customize your metaclass appropriately - which may include to force combining the classes with multiple-inheritance even if you could just inherit from abcmeta to prevent the zope.interface package from calling type.__new__ if that is your intent

inline	inlining	inline-functions	inlining
gcc in particular is more reluctant than average to inline-functions it didn t inline the very short functions in this example at -o2 without the inline keyword
without inlining the way parameters are passed and returned is set by the abi so the compiler cannot optimize away the differences between the two versions
the const reference version amounts to passing a pointer so regardless of t1 and t2 you ll pass a pointer to the std pair object in the first integer register

you can use an online spf checker to check the dns lookup count in your spf record online spf checker when spf permerror too many dns lookups is returned during an spf check dmarc treats that as fail since it s a permanent error and all spf permanent errors are interpreted as fail by dmarc

instances	transient
vc will use the exact instances that you have been created if you pass a type to the add method then mvc will create the filter every time the filter needs to
note that the filter s the mvc filter pipeline that creates the filter object not the service provider if you want your filter to be resolved like other dependencies the you should use the addservice method with this kind of registration you can use any lifetime you need with your filter transient singleton ..


57352151
width	height
a disadvantage of this is that the row height increases
you could just as easily delete the line break and or say increase the width of the status history column
if you wish you may keep the archival columns of status history but only one column per set is required

57352263
uiview	calayer
ou can do this by either creating another subclass of calayer for layer and overriding layoutsublayers or if layer is the layer of a view overriding layoutsubviews in your view class
a third option might be overriding layoutsublayers of in the view class because a uiview is always the delegate of a uiview layer


57352574
bytearrayoutputstream	inputstream
once done close out the bytearrayoutputstream and do whatever processing is needed
by doing so the original inputstream does not have to be touched or interrupted in any way
hopefully this helps anyone else that stumbles around with the same issue

57352581
folder	directory
you are on the right track
in order to load different properties based on the environment you can create multiple folder for properties files
let s assume that you store properties files under src main java dev properties.properties create multiple directory like src main java qa src main java dev src main java prod create 1 properties file in each of the paths just like i did at the beginning

57352581
maven	pom.xml
you can use maven profiles to do that
to your pom.xml add right under as you can see i ve created 2 profiles
their ids are dev and prod

57353342
post	put
from docs form_params used to send an application x-www-form-urlencoded post request
maybe you can try using json for put request
in the json part of docs it uses put as well

57353629
for-loop	loops

for an un-expanded glob the condition would fail because the literal string is not a valid file and the failure of this test command along with the boolean or || causes the continue action to the for-loop
since the for-loop does not have any more arguments to process loops exits gracefully

57353793
client-side	server-side
so it did three jobs for you regards to data validation
in database schema this property or field will be required on the client-side you cannot post a request without validated data
on the server-side you can check is data is validated or not

57353858
try-catch	exception-handling
in theory then compilers or the jvm could optimize the try-catch out
in practice i doubt that they do because such code should be rare and not on hot paths exception-handling should never be
it s probably not worth the effort to implement such an optimization

57353866
slug	permalinks
once these kind of urls work i can parse the url extract the company slug and retrieve the related data from the database
i guess i have somehow to transform the query url into a permalinks and on the details page i have to extract the query from the url


57354153
put	get
 don t know what your student class is so i m going to pretend it is this i think something like this will get you close to what you are after the data in the ajax done method will be the contents of the partial view
it isn t clear what you want done with it so i have console.logged it but you could use the jquery replacewith method to put the jquery replacewith method on the page


57354358
post	get
ou can add a file field in your own html form like in get request handler add this tag to your file field if you want to upload only images
handle this tag in post request handler like var imagefile request.getfile re_img


57354622
error-handling	exception-handling
error-handling and testing if the json value could not be parsed or a nesting level deeper than the given or default depth is found null is returned from json_decode
this means that no exception-handling is raised by json_encode json_deocde directly
the json_last_error function helps here

57354683
kombu	celery
you could use some other library to communicate with rabbitmq but since you want to ultimately execute celery tasks you will have celery installed anyway which in turn will install one of its main dependencies - kombu
to communicate with rabbitmq kombu uses either py-amqp or if installed librabbitmq


57354825
maven	pom.xml
your plugin should include a meta_inf manifest.mf declaring the following fields implementation-vendor-id and implementation-title
in a maven project the groupid would go to the former and artifactid to the latter so you don t really have to do anything special
originally pit used implementation-vendor which by default would contain the organization name declared in the pom.xml

57354895
setinterval	settimeout

if the code inside the setinterval takes longer than the time you have set the setinterval will create another process before the function finishes messing everything up
so choosing settimeout is actually better

57355514
cat	tee
note the command grouping is still necessary here to pass the output on through the next pipe
obviously replace cat in the pipeline with whatever you are actually doing
if your input can handle the same content to writing to multiple files you could eliminate the use of tee entirely as well as monkeying with stdout

57355673
pandas	pyexcel

keyerror longitude pandas excel parsing and csv parsing will vary
having said that try to see the difference between both method calls by printing data if your file extensions are proper then i would recommend you to try with other xlsx parser libraries like pyexcel you can both read write using this library

57355705
post	get
o i decided to get the entire list of members in the server instead and filter the entire list of members in the server by bots
speed performance might be a downside as the server gets larger more members hopefully someone post a better solution than mine


57355804
put	get
it is microsoft.extensions.logging.log4net.aspnetcore
here is an example of how you can put it to use in the root of your project place your log4net.config file
an example is and here is a way you can get a logger without using dependency injection as you requested

57355854
post	get

as i understand it the problem is that after the first post you land on a new page where validation may fail and if it does it redirects back to it reloads - which will fail because the posted data from the first step is now missing
this is a common scenario and the standard solution is to use prg - post redirect get

57355854
post	get
his way if the user hits reload on the new page - or if validation on that new page fails - it just reloads with get that new page without resubmitting the post
in your case that would look something like i ve used simplified uris to keep things simple and i may have mixed up your controller methods now your ticketcontroller store method does your ticketcontroller store method validation and assuming everything passes do not just return a view but instead you ll need a get route to handle that get the next page where user enters input route get next-page-form ticketcontroller shownextpage


57355854
post	get
and handle the next data being posted route post next-page-processing datenticketcontroller store
if validation fails it will simply redirect with get back to next-page-form


57356290
hide	show

try this just check if dataalert is empty then hide the div and return else
process and show the div

57356349
children	parent

you could create custom collection to hold information about children
when items will be added to this collection you would set parent property that should be ignored xmlignoreattribute when serializeing deserializing

57356357
folder	directory
to solve this look for your npm home folder where you have installed node-sass then add that path to the path environment variable
you can run npm list -g and the first output line is the path of your global npm sources the directory you need is bin not lib
you might also want to follow this guide to be able to run npm packages commands as root . if you do this you should re-install all your global packages in order to have them all in the same directory

57356417
folder	directory
os.path.dirname provide the directory of given file
it means you can get the folder of you running python file
so you can provide the path based on the folder of you python file

57356444
scheme	racket	lisp	racket
but programming languages which want to talk about programming languages often expose symbols as objects at the language level because this is just obviously useful
lisp and scheme or lisp-family languages or however you want to divide things up are one of the canonical examples of programming languages which are about programming languages
i am not as familiar with scheme standards as i should be i m a racket cl person but takes a string and returns a possibly-newly-constructed symbol with that name which is interned returning an identical symbol each time it is called with a string with the same sequence of characters

57356444
lisp	scheme
traditionally lisp used symbols explicitly in their own implementations a lot but that is less the case now than it was
scheme i think needs no use of symbols in its own description at all other than as objects which are implemented in the language the specification talks about identifiers see the comment to this article by chris vine and the macro system does not rely on symbols
cl is much more traditional and symbols play a bigger role in the description of the language

57356541
width	border-box
ecause of the border use width calc 100 3 - 1px
or box-sizing border-box the second one will put the border inside the element instead of the outside


57356969
google-chrome	firefox

it worked for me may be this help u to find your solution after trying this than also u r getting error read about drf parser important point if u r using google-chrome and if r using for django server and localhost 4200 for angular than because of cors different ports google-chrome does not allow
use this 127.0.0.1 4200 for angular server instead of localhost 4200 and if u don t want to do this use firefox instead of google-chrome this use firefox allows cors

57357171
shadowing	named

this behavior s called shadowing
the function starts at the innermost scope being executed at the time and continues until the first match is found no matter whether there are other variables with the same named in the outer levels or not

57357989
migrate	upgrade
follow the instructions in migrating to androidx
firebase bill of materials bom the problem is the latest firebase and play-services dependencies are migrate to androidx
so one fix is to migrate your project to androidx see migrate to androidx which i prefer because all the new upgrade are using androidx

57357989
migrate	downgrade	versioning	upgrade
so one fix is to migrate your project to androidx see migrate to androidx which i prefer because all the new upgrade are using androidx
or else you can downgrade the firebase-core and play services to versioning before this update


57358104
google-chrome	firefox

looks like browser based issue stackblitz link for me google-chrome shows i would suggest you to look for alternative solution in this case
and firefox shows developer edition 68.0b12 64-bit

57358298
metaclass	subclassing
assuming that you meant for age to be set to none only if conversion fails if you want to go the metaclass route then you can create one that ignores all extra arguments for almost any class by introspecting the __init__ or __new__ method call signature this metaclass will work for any python class but if you were to subclassing in a built-in type then the __new__ or __init__ methods may not be introspectable
not the case here but a caveat that you would need to know about if you were to use the above metaclass in other situations
then use the above as a metaclass parameter on your dataclass the advantage of using a metaclass should be clear here

57358458
int	boolean
where registersuccessfulauthentication best maps to onauthentication authentication authentication httpservletrequest request httpservletresponse response while checkauthenticationallowed is now a private method within concurrentsessioncontrolstrategy which can partly be customized via also there are some setters to configure public void setexceptionifmaximumexceeded boolean exceptionifmaximumexceeded
public void setmaximumsessions int maximumsessions
for more about concurrentsessioncontrolstrategy have a look at the javadocs

57358508
for-loop	arrays

for big problems certainly when you re using a slow but loved language as bash it s better to store your data in a file than use them all in one for-loop
that s because the for-loop holds the entire arrays whereas using the code below parses the file line-by-line

57358779
put	get
his means you can use this to struct your new object with the locations names so even if someday you get location999 this ll still work
i put the if that checks if your new object laready has that property because you want that property to be an array


57358991
prometheus	metrics
es you need both - prometheus collects and aggregates metrics when metrick server exposes metrics from your cluster node for your prometheus to scrape your prometheus
if you have problems with prometheus alertmanger and so on consider using helm chart as entrypoint


57359167
folder	dir

that been said the content of will be moved into replacing the name of the folder from wildfly-17.0.1.final into wildfly
simple example would be as follow create an empty dir and touch a file inside an empty dir then try to do mv dir var lib non_existing_folder dir will be moved as is and replace non_existing_folder

57359178
for-loop	loops

you can use a for-loop or you can do a for-loop shorter and faster with the combo lapply do.call
to have individual plots in environment or do this individually inside loops lapply

57359278
matplotlib	colormap

in the code below you just need to grab the data used for twilight from the matplotlib source on github by following this link
that crates a dict with twilight twilight_r twilight_shifted and twilight_shifted_r colormap

57359689
client-side	server-side
the server-side function should return the value of the currently selected cell
the client-side function should update the html content of the sidebar base on the response


57359691
matplotlib	colormap

you can take the _cm_listed.py file from the current version and copy the _cm_listed.py file to your matplotlib 2.2.3 folder
since the file is version agnostic this should directly give you the additional colormap

57360138
int	boolean

in particular why you should use integer.valueof int instead of new int int caching
this variant of valueof was added in jdk 5 to byte short int and long short int already existed in the trivial case in boolean since jdk 1.4

57360207
nunit	mstest

in the example code if nunit was configured to create a new instance of the class per-test the assertions would succeed
mstest and xunit already do this

57360207
nunit	mstest
mstest and xunit already do this
this is not available in nunit so that example code would need to be updated so that the assertions succeed
here s the discussion

57360222
nltk	stanford-nlp
ost tools that work with penn treebank data support this escaping nltk stanford-nlp and many others
nltk supports this but nltk default ptb-style tokenization assumes the parentheses are separate tokens rather than potentially token-internal output if you convert the parentheses on your own in your input data without inserting extra spaces the default tokenization and the detokenization with work output


57360284
for-loop	loops
i also turned the whole thing into a loops to avoid repetition
this is the part that changed and here is a working snippet this is es6 and not es5 so if you want internet explorer support you will have to replace some with a for-loop and includes with indexof
i hope doing those changes will give you a better understanding of how the code works now and what the problem was

57360473
keras	tensorflow

i got the same error trying to install keras for r
updating to the latest reticulate version from cran and the latest tensorflow version from github solved the problem install.packages reticulate devtools install_github rstudio tensorflow and then library tensorflow install_tensorflow i used conda instead of venvs

57360649
google-chrome	firefox
 good choice is mozilla firefox make sure to clear all your browsing data prior to recording
you will have to re-install jmeter s self-signed certificate after this check jmeter.log file for any suspicious entries if you re behind the corporate firewall proxy you will have to make jmeter aware of firewall you can consider using jmeter google-chrome extension for recording firewall s non-invasive solution and you will not have to worry about proxies and certificates


57360691
prop	classname
the second approach can t work either because the element with the id select in your case is not the element which has the overflow
thanks to the classnameprefix prop you can easily access the dom element of the valuecontainer component which contains all the selected options and therefore has the overflow
classnameprefix if provided all inner components will be given a prefixed classname attribute

57361213
versioning	upgrade
o if you are on 5.6 and want to upgrade to 5.8 you need to follow the guide for 5.6 to 5.7 and then from 5.7 to 5.8
the guides are pretty helpful the guides tell you which package must be updated to what versioning and inform you about deprecated methods which will be removed in the upcoming versioning


57361379
filtering	grouping

but you could also provide arbitrary filtering conditions in the stream allowing more complex constructs than the equals calls of the example
note that the grouping numbers changed for the example e.g to support a variable order of the data items after the report id you can use findall is available in java 9 but if you have to support java 8 you can use the findall implementation of this answer

57361732
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops

your for-loop looks wrong
your for-loop s not looping over an arrays that is just going to execute the body of this loops once

57361826
gam	mgcv
reml or ml smoothness selection wherein the gam is estimated as a mixed effects model with smoothness parameters related to the random effects variance parameters have both been shown to work better than gcv being far less sensitive to undersmoothing
you should ideally be fitting gams in mgcv using or
in most applications of gams fitted using mgcv you wouldn t split-sample your data

57362028
folder	directory
t will show you that create-react-app has not been installed because you are not installing create-react-app on the folder where your project is you just have to install create-react-app in right directory
or you can install it globally with npm install -g create-react-app if you don t want to install it globally go to the folder where your project is and then install create-react-app in the folder where your project is


57362065
automake	autotools

apparently the original problem -- and likely the problem building automake -- was an incorrect appearance that the packages autotools-based build systems were out of date
generally speaking autotools-based packages should be distributed with the autotools outputs pre-built even though technically generally speaking autotools-based packages are derived files

57362244
typedef	struct

don t know if this is what you re looking for but i tried googling for typedef evp_cipher to see what could be found about that type
from this page typedef struct evp_cipher_st evp_cipher looks like evp_cipher is a typedef for struct evp_cipher_st which is seemingly what the function call returns in evp_aes_128_cbc

57362295
prometheus	metrics

prometheus does not support grpc as a scrape protocol so you either need to open a separate http port or use some kind of prometheus push gateway
if you are using spring-boot you can use which will automatically configure the metrics if spring-boot-actuator is present on your cp

57362527
int	chars
every object type should be mappable to an array of chars
in k r c all functions had to return a value - if you didn t explicitly type the function the compiler assumed it returned int
this made it difficult to determine which functions were actually meant to return a value vs

57362638

i dont think you should copy msvcp140.dll into the system folder in case
system32 is a global folder so any change of dlls in this directory can affect all installed applications

pull	push
git fetch origin git fetch upstream git checkout master git reset upstream master git push -f origin master at this point any attempt to create a merge pull request from your fork should tell you nothing needs to be merged

57362923
restrict	shared
there are some more observations i experienced so i want to shared
tf.tensor.get_shape can be used to infer output using the operation that created it means we can infer it without using sess.run running the operation as hinted by the name static shape. for example c tf.random_uniform 1 3 1 1 is a tf.tensor and we want to know its shape at any step in the code before running the graph so we can use c.get_shape the reason of tf.tensor.get_shape unable to be dynamic sess.run is because of the output type tensorshape instead of tf.tensor outputting the tensorshape restrict the usage of sess.run
sess.run c.get_shape if we do we get an error that tensorshape has an invalid type it must be a tensor operation or a string

hebrew	turkish
the regexp does not cover all accents example or hebrew vowels niqqud not equal but using collator the result is 0 equal correct similar for arabic 3
locale sensitivity example take the well known turkish i problem so the result would be not equal using the collator with bad a non-turkish locale using the correct turkish locale so the locale matters 4
why uppercase example in german ß uppercases to ss so ß ss ignoring case but so the result would be not equal but note these are just some examples

imagemagick	pillow

i haven t got time to write this up in python at the moment but if you follow these steps you can do you follow these steps you can do do a morphological closing with a rectangular 5x5 structuring element to get rid of the thin lines around the edge and everywhere else trim the image to get rid of excess white borders around the edges i did you follow these steps you can do with imagemagick in terminal like this convert form.png -threshold 50 -morphology close rectangle 5 -trim result.png and then sneakily added a red border just so you can see the extent of the image on stack overflow s white background in python use skimage to do the morphology - it ll look like these lines in this answer except you will need binary_closing in place of dilation - see documentation here
you can then do the trimming with pil pillow s image.getbbox

post	get
you trigger a webhook via hitting that url with a get made when loading a web page or post made programmatically request

there s lots of examples of how to do this such as this question

57363566
integer	unsigned

i increased the int 250 no you didn t for all integer types that value does not increase the field size only the display width if the field also has the zerofill flag
as the other guys have suggested you have to use a different integer type the only way to increase the effective range is by using the unsigned flag and omitting all negative values but that s technically a shifting of the range not an increase

57364230
inherited	properties

there s no reason to involve any inherited here and setting the prototype of a constructor function so that it no longer inherited from function.prototype is really weird
just assign the static methods as properties of the person constructor object object.assign person utils people

hat can be used for streaming large objects but if the lob is relatively small compared to the amount of memory the node.js process has access to then you can override the default to get and string or buffer depending on whether the lob is a blob or clob

for-loop	if-statement

57364765
children	parent	children	parent
if you want an absolute reference you can make a parent object and rotate this
objects have the same world axis and when rotated or transformed the children suffer the same transformation
you have to meke sure that the posistion in the childre is 0 0 0 as this is the distance respect to the parent position that will be the rotation pivot

57364801
for-loop	loops

the issue here is that the for-loop runs immediately to completion while all the async operations here the settimeout are started
this is because the for-loop does not wait for an asynchronous operation to complete before continuing on to the next iteration of loops and because the settimout callbacks are called some time in the future

57364801
for-loop	loops
this is because the for-loop does not wait for an asynchronous operation to complete before continuing on to the next iteration of loops and because the settimout callbacks are called some time in the future
thus loops completes its iterations and then all the callbacks for settimeout fire simultaneously updating the state at once causing race conditions
also keep in mind that setstate is itself async

57364983
instances	transient
or instances when assigning to interface _addref is called and when that reference goes out of scope _release
initial reference count must be set to 1 because code in constructors can be complex and can trigger transient reference counting which could automatically destroy the object during the construction process before the construction process has chance to be assigned to the initial strong reference that will keep the construction process alive


57364983
instances	transient
hat initial reference count is then decreased in afterconstruction and object instances reference count is properly set for further reference counting
problem real problem in this questions code is in fact that this questions code triggers transient reference counting in afterconstruction method after call to inherited which decreases initial object reference count back to 0


57365016
width	height	width	height
however you ll run into some additional issues because a 100 width video won t take into account different aspect ratios

ut because i want validation beyond just the structure of the json i have to extends reads and implements my own reads
to do step 1 i created the normal way just checking that all the required fields are present and can map to my pq class to add step 2 i created another by extends and by overriding the reads now to validate the json i use pqreads object what is happening above is when my application receives the json 1 my application first gets the body as json from the incoming request 2 then the json i use pqreads object is validated qreads uses pqreads to validate the json i use pqreads object

zipkin	microservices
but there is one exception called zipkin which in turns is not fully opentracing compliant even it has similar terms
if you are ok with opentracing-contrib csharp-netcore hope you are using this library then if you want to achieve no code change in target microservices in order to configure tracing subsystem you should use some plug-in model
good news that aspnetcore has concept of hosted startup assemblies which allow you to configure tracing system

57365758
dictionary	map

although i did not completely understand your messages data structure i made an assumption from your description that it might be a tuple containing dictionary as elements rather than the vice versa which is what your question contains
if that is the case below solution might work you may have to make a couple changes though but the idea looks to work fine map distinct names to a group name and form a dictionary out of a couple like flr345 to drone0 flr33 to drone1 etc go through each element in messages tuple and see if a group name already has a group assigned if assigned just append that message dictionary element to that group else add a couple as new entries

he compiler accepts the syntax but interprets the compiler as noexcept false .. interestingly enough this is also what herb sutter states in the linked article at least one popular c++ compiler microsoft s up to version 7.x parses exception specifications but does not actually enforce sutter states in the linked article reducing the exception specifications to glorified comments finally this answer is more a curiosity throw has been deprecated and also removed in this answer various forms from the more recent versions of the language
prefer noexcept

bokeh	holoviews
this is a first necessary step to being able to have real contour plots in bokeh
a next step would be for someone to write a set of functions that can accept array inputs and generate the multi-polygon data necessary to drive bokeh graphics but this has not been done by anyone yet
if image contour plots similar to pcolormesh or line unfilled contours suit your needs that you can consider using holoviews which can generate bokeh contour plots for those kinds of cases

57366368
folder	directory

i managed to get it working by installing onto a clean vm and then copying the scripts from the installation folder and other files referenced in the scripts onto the iis server and running from there
had to search and replace the db2 install directory within the scripts as the scripts expect a default install of program files ibm sqllib whereas the iis default install of db2 is to ibm sqllib

57366462
maven	pom.xml

maven is a tool that enables a declarative way of managing your project s dependencies
it does that by standardising the way jar and pom.xml files artifacts are shared by projects and uses maven coordinates to declare a project dependency groupid artifactid and version which are then looked up in a large public maven repository of jar and pom.xml files called maven central

57366462
maven	pom.xml	maven	pom.xml
in the case of a private repository you need to include the you private repository so that your maven execution not only looks for artifacts in maven central but also in your private repository
you can achieve this by adding the following to your settings.xml file i noticed your child pom.xml file references a custom parent module
you need to make sure that your parent module is in a maven repository nexus artifactory and that you supply a settings.xml file with the repository settings for the docker container to be able to pull the parent pom.xml

57366597
qtkit	avfoundation
he above item apple shipped the symbols for qtkit on catalina beta 5 but the symbols are nulled non-functional
this means an application will run but will not produce any result if an application is using those avfoundation classes


57366647
prepare	execute

if you want to stick as close as possible to sqlite3_exec then you could use a similar signature with a pointer to the already prepare and filled prepare statement in place of the first two parameters
the function would then need to execute the query via multiple calls to sqlite3_step each time extracting the needed data from the result row sqlite3_column_sometype n passing each time to the callback function and handling the callback s return value appropriately

57366821
super	self

super .with_two_legs human does in fact call animal s with_two_legs but it passes human as the cls not animal
super makes the proxy object only to assist with method lookup it doesn t change what gets passed it s still the same self or cls it originated from

57367147
express	koa

but express is not the only one
and you can choose another one based on your needs check out koa it s an express-lite

57367179
hide	show

it would be a lot simpler to just pass a bool in the constructor of settings then when you create the settings page for your two different code paths pass in the appropriate value hide button - when called from navigate tabbedpage.children.add new settings emailentry.text false
show button - when called from login tabbedpage.children.add new settings emailentry.text true

57367247
toolchain	binutils

the simple answer is it is a failure of the system architects and the toolchain
on linux a failure of the system architects and the toolchain are the folks who maintain binutils and glibc

57367247
folder	directory
rigin-based linker paths are good when you have a filesystem layout like my_app | +-- bin | | | +- my_app.exe | +-- lib | | | +- my_lib.so | +-- share you can move my_app folder around the filesystem and my_app.exe will always be able to find my_lib.so | library my_lib.so
and if the my_app is the root directory then the my_app is a standard linux file system used by distros


57367494
folder	dir

you are eliminating the first layer of security and allowing your app to access your documents folder pictures folder desktop folder music folder contact folder and another 3 or 4 protected folder
attempt 1 run your app and try to browser files with your app on any folder inside your home dir

57367507
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops

i just want to get an element that is in the next iteration using range-based for-loop the answer to your question is simple don t abuse features
the range-for loops is for the simplest case where you want to traverse the arrays one by one

57367561
dns	spf
lso it s just one of the things that customers will need to change in dns
you will need to have your customers update your customers spf records or you will have significant deliverability issues


57367674
chown	passwd
this command also means the system will ask for your passwd to confirm
chown is the command we use to change the owner of a file or folder
we set the -r option to change the owner recursively so we also get owner access to all the files already contained in there

57367716
put	get
ust leave it as it stands route get pengaduan pengaduancontroller index
then just append it to your url when making the request just as you put it in your description and then in your controller pengaduancontroller.php check this section of the documentation retrieving input from the query string while the input method retrieves values from entire request payload including the query string the query method will only retrieve values from the query string if the requested query string value data is not present the second argument to the query method will be returned you may call the query method without any arguments in order to retrieve all of the query string values as an associative array


57367796
width	text-align

make the display inline-block and additionally give the display inline-block a width that is slightly under the remaining space
the display inline-block already has text-align center on the display inline-block though note that this isn t correctly applying in your snippet due to the line break

57367796
width	text-align
t already has text-align center on it though note that this isn t correctly applying in your snippet due to the line break
fixing this up and both changing the display and adding the width will align the text in the center of the remaining space


57367842
apache	nginx
nginx for instance has it s own limit default set to 1mb i believe
apache might have it too
consult the respective manuals for those packages on how to configure them

57368183
16-bit	64bit
i was able to get more speed or more accuracy by messing with the shifting such as trying to not shift all the way down to 16-bit if it wasn t strictly necessary but any increase in speed came at a high cost in accuracy and vice versa
none of the other methods i tested came even close to the same speed or accuracy most being slower than just using the 64bit method or having huge loss in precision so not worth going into
obviously no guarantee that anyone else will get similar results on other platforms

57368187
strlen	strncpy
for null-terminated strings strlen can get you that size and so it works with strncpy
strncpy c s 256
if the const char were just bytes though you d need another way

57368248
build.gradle	gradlew
our error is likely related to the dependency having your error s own gradlew file that doesn t have a proper compilesdkversion
the thread i linked to above has a number of suggestions that have worked for folks the most recent of which is to add this to your android build.gradle with the appropriate version


57368297
put	get
and i used array_push for that. also i used a function to get a child
then i put a function inside of array
i used here for loop

57368297
for-loop	loops
i used here for-loop
i m sure u gonna use foreach loops
try something like this fiddle here output for 2

57368697
subtract	add

here is a good solution i guess it keep track of sum_after_six and subtract it from total when it see 9
if not you can add one additional condition to reset the sum_after_six hope this helps

57368872
ksort	usort

the function ksort will sort the keys of an array since your array is multidimensional the function ksort is sorting the numeric indexes is doing nothing
you will need to compare the keys of each array and for that you can use usort i m assuming you just want to order all items by date

57369012
ienumerable	icollection
you should allow the parameter to be as generic as possible - if you only need collection of elements and their count use icollection
even better ienumerable if you want to only iterate through the list or ireadonlycollection if you want to avoid accidental item change
it will be much easier to write unit tests for this method or override it in the future

57369167
hash	md5

a hash is a one-way function it maps multiple values to one result meaning that you can not find the original value given the result
however databases that store the original value and the hash result do exist and md5 hashs are really bad for security for that reason

57369192
migrate	staging

basically if you want to migrate from serverless function to a server yes you will have to copy those files and start your own express server for a server to be webhook just simply provide a service that can serve post endpoint for your fulfillment create your node.js project install express dialogflow-fulfillment lib and other dependencies create your post endpoint for fulfillment put the link to that endpoint in dialogflow webhook is just a simple http callback
dialogflow will trigger the webhook post endpoint you provided and after the code execution the code execution will send a response back to dialogflow to attach to dialogflow webhook you ll just need to provide your webhook endpoint that s serve by replacing the url part with your endpoint if you develop from your local machine try using ngrok and add a temporary endpoint for dialogflow if for staging or production you ll need a real domain for endpoint simply start from deploying your express server to heroku and add an endpoint for the dialogflow for the credentials part in your local files you can manage your credentials in the local file with environment env or some configuration management

57369222
hash	salt
key thing to note here is - hashing is a one-way function while encryption is not
a really simple and secure hashing algorithm will require a string or any type of data as parameter and that is all it needs to create a hash string or data
as a sidenote however in order to increase the security of algorithm they take other parameters like salt

57369283
ionic	angular
you can see an example of that here which is part of a larger tutorial the concept is that angular provides things called guards official docs example
you use the console to generate one like ionic generate guard guards auth then you get a snippet like this as you can guess plugging in your auth check there and returning true or false protects the url route
to apply this authguard to an actual page you would do something like this in your app-routing.module.ts file

57369443
for-loop	arrays
now let s create a dictionary with those arrays
this can be achieved with a simple for-loop
we can iterate over labels and values in tandem using python s zip function which lets us do the following this results in a dictionary that holds a set of values linked to a set of labels both of which you extracted from a csv file

57369473
grafana	metrics	prometheus	metrics

prometheus + grafana are a pretty standard setup
installing kube-prometheus or prometheus-operator via helm will give you grafana alertmanager node-exporter and kube-state-metrics by default and all be setup for kubernetes metrics

57369473
prometheus	grafana
smtp is usually the first thing setup but i would recommend some sort of event manager if this is a service people need to rely on
although a dashboard isn t part of your requirements this will inform how you can connect into prometheus as a data source
there is docco on adding prometheus data source for grafana

57369473
prometheus	grafana
there is docco on adding prometheus data source for grafana
there are a number of prebuilt charts available to add to grafana
there are some charts to visualise alertmanager too

57369473
prometheus	grafana	prometheus	grafana
to access the api externally you will need to setup an external path to the prometheus service
this can be configured via an ingress controller in the helm deployment prometheus.ingress.enabled true you can do the same for the alertmanager api and grafana if needed
alertmanager.ingress.enabled true grafana.ingress.enabled true you could use grafana outside the cluster as your dashboard via the same prometheus ingress if it proves useful

57369579
setinterval	settimeout
also your usage of settimeout is incorrect - it will just write first letter of your text after 50 milliseconds
you should use setinterval or recursion
your code could look something like

57369668
int	chars
the method write that you are calling writes a chars encoded as the int argument not the string representation of the int which you have expected
so write 32 would write a space chars because a space is encoded as 32 in utf-16
printwriter allows you to directly write strings instead

57369891
maven	pom.xml

since oracle jdbc driver is not in maven repository download ojdbc8.jar and run the below command
add this dependency in pom.xml

57369935
integer	fractions
so let s assume that then for example what might be a little bit tricky in the implementation is to use fractions in the calculations instead of decimal numbers
otherwise you may not receive an integer as the final result
more information including the reasoning behind the formula above can be found here

57369947
post	get

first of all if you post a question here in such a simple language like c please provide a minimal reproducible example like yunnosch said
it will get you more people trying your code

57370191
ubuntu	linux

ubuntu 18.04 java 11 netbeans 11.0 i had the same error as you because i set up library javafx11 using the jars in usr share openjfx lib which are from the ubuntu openjfx 11.0.2+1-1 18.04.2 package
i thought because the same jars were in this directory i could use the same jars but the javafx-sdk-11.0.2 lib directory you get by downloading javafx linux sdk from contains many other library files like libglass.so which are needed

57370252
put	get

if you want to retry a failing request multiple times you should put the request making logic in a separate function and call it as you want
get your route handler to call this function initially and call the same function if it fails

57370418
hide	show
as per the example show on github to use this library you must include the file csi.js in your page header then you need to add the data-include attribute with its value set to the file you want to include on the container element
hide copy code .
hope it helps

57370548
filtering	grouping
orward slashes don t indicate a regular expression t re just literal forward slashes so neither your filtering expression nor your search string will match the intended files
also the parentheses the capturing grouping serve no purpose so you should remove the capturing grouping


57370576
implements	extends

as luca suggested and after some research i came to this conclusion that you should implements a custom service discovery to read from eureka
in order to do that i did the following extends my eurekaservicediscovery class from defaultservicediscovery class of camel-core module overriding the method public list getservices string name of defaultservicediscovery class which is responsible to retrieve services from eureka using eureka rest api to get all the services in the overrided method

57370588
post	get
or at least you will get idea if you have all lat lng .
loop through the list with some delay and then apply animation to marker here is code snippet if you want i can post whole logic


57371675
depth-first-search	backtracking	depth-first-search	backtracking
throughout that process path was only extended whenever more recursion was possible and trimmed in order to backtracking to earlier states
in other words you perform a depth-first-search through your graph branching after every vertice even if there s only 1
the algorithm always first exhausts all possible paths before it backtracking thus append -ing and pop -ing are correct methods to keep track of your progress

57371893
fiddler	charles

many people talks about an alternative called fiddler
i haven t tested it yet but i think is centered in http requests as charles proxy

57371902
instances	transient
he composition root could then decide to inject new instances of components into the graph for instances your dbcontext
when you apply this way of working you won the composition root need to have a transient and a scoped version of your dbcontext any longer


57371998
daemons	systemd
ach microservice is just a regular console app or asp.net core which then can be run on windows as a service or as a daemons on linux
starting from .net core 2.1 microsoft introduced microsoft.aspnetcore.hosting.windowsservices namespace allowing to run asp.net core as a windows service tabs visual-studio or you can use servicebase from microsoft.windows.compatibility for console apps we re deploying mostly to linux systemd so we use an approach of hostedservices


57372020
maven	pom.xml

you can use a combination of maven and your build server jenkins etc and a clever pipeline
have your common dependency as a module and whenever you kick off a build on one of your rest projects the following should happen kick off the build of your common dependency as part of the pipeline downstream job i think deploy the latest version to your maven repository do a maven force version update for your dependency in your rest pipeline using which will update the pom.xml of your rest module push the latest pom.xml of your rest module to git versioning your modules becomes important if you want to manage breaking changes carefully otherwise you can get away with snapshots

57372320
maven	pom.xml

maven can accomplish this task
i want following things when i compile any of the apis the common module should be compiled the maven multi module pom.xml called also the aggregator pom.xml achieves that

57372320
maven	pom.xml
 want following things when i compile any of the apis the common module should be compiled the maven multi module pom.xml called also the aggregator pom.xml achieves that
1 couple the three components in terms of build - api-parent multimodule pom.xml and parent pom.xml also if needed | |____ common-lib jar |____ api-foo spring boot fat jar |____ api-bar spring boot fat jar the drawback of this approach is that the version of common-lib is necessarily the same for the two apis modules that use common-lib


57372363
post	get
your should get the response from your php script within the post request
it is not necessary to make a get request after that
change this to this i would highly recommend to check out the information below

57372501
express	node.js

no express knowledge is not required for learning javascript
express is a minimal and flexible node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications

57372501
express	node.js
in order to use express you should have basic knowledge of javascript and es5 features for node.js
check your package.json for information whether you have installed express as dependency or not


57372730
hide	show

perhaps save it in thisdocument it will hide everything before closing the document
and show everything once the document opens and enable macros is clicked

57372864
get	http-post

i managed to get it working in the meantime and whoever is reading this thread in the future i can confirm that onelogin can now support cisco clusters using a single cluster-wide metadata
but for any other idp the setup is idp requirements cucm only supports nameidformat as transient http-post and http-redirect saml bindings need to be enabled saml specification that allows for the definition of multiple assertionconsumerservice tags needs to be supported operation when setting up sso within the metadata generated by cucm if using cluster wide sso mode multiple assertionconsumerservice tags are defined

57372886
initializer	class-method	initializer	class-method
otherwise public database class-method like create or createifnotexists won t work correctly
if you are wondering why migratedatabasetolatestversion initializer needs the configuration parameter the answer is that migratedatabasetolatestversion is an exception
all other out-of-the-box initializers have equivalent public database class-method or combination of methods

57373441
hive	hdfs

hive cannot extract the schema from the data
in order to read the data from the avro files in hdfs using a hive query hive requires a schema

57373447
client-side	server-side
client-side validation is being nice for your users
server-side validation is an absolute necessity


57373493
client-side	server-side

on the server-side you could refer to the below code
the client-side also is self-hosted

57373521
versioning	upgrade

all server and thick-clients need to be on the same versioning of ignite
there are commercial versions of ignite that allow you to mix versions but even that s really only designed for you to upgrade your cluster without downtime.

57373603
for-loop	loops

issue you have return true in the middle of your for-loop
explanation the return is ending the function completely on the first loops

57373678
hash	salt
for rainbow-tables the hacker must be able to read the hash so the cutting isn t a problem
the only problem he could have would be when the length of the salt would vary
my thought is that you follow your own thought and use bscrypt as seemingly not intended

57373908
client-side	server-side	client-side	server-side
i replaced the space with a in the client-side
later i did the opposite on the server-side
client-side str.replace server-side str.replace

57373914
subclass	inherited

bear in mind that in general any django model subclass corresponds to a database table
inheriting from such a class concrete inherited means that another database table will be created with a one-to-one linkage between rows and that every query will implicitly perform a join in the db

57373937
gson	jackson

if using gson as pointed out by purushotham s answer typetoken can be used
i prefer using using gson as pointed out by purushotham s answer typetoken directly in rest-assured when using jackson the solution is to use the typefactory javadoc source to tell to which type using gson as pointed out by purushotham s answer typetoken should be de-serialized

57374154
lisp	scheme
hat s true in many languages but that s not true in scheme or common lisp some continuations can accept zero or more than one argument or equivalently some functions can return zero or more than one values
where this can happen in scheme is pretty restricted a continuation needs to get exactly the number of arguments that expects and there s only one way of making a continuation which expects other than a single argument it s possible i am wrong about this i m not a scheme standards person


57374444
width	height
width 100
for container and add the style height 100
to html body #root

57374729
folder	dir
pen readfile without read but use read in masterfile.write readfile.read i m not sure if it will need n at the end masterfile.write readfile.read + n to add file name use masterfile.write filename + n dir and file are reserved words so i use dirname and filename the same using with so dirname doesn t need close edit for two started folder a and b
but as before it check sql in subfolders of started folder but not directly in started folder


57375004
sorting	filtering
the sorting approach you mentioned is one such option but if the entire input is a mix of two character this will not be efficient either compared to other approaches
i will also drop the keyword bloom filtering here as for large data volumes it might be a good way to handle frequently seen characters quickly having a separate data structure for frequent keys vs infrequent keys


57375177
build.gradle	gradlew

then define dependencies between the projects in the respective build.gradle files
each project should not matter from what directory you call gradlew in the command line

57375291
inline-functions	inlining

without profiling or other evidence i would rarely bother to inline-functions
inlining is a hint to the compiler which the compiler may well ignore so the effort of inlining may not even be worth it

57375600
folder	directory

you can use os.walk to get all files in folder and subfolders
but if you want to create own function then you need list for directory

57375648
int	double

as a result there is an overflow of the sum stored in the accumulator of the type int
you have to use at least the long long int literal 0ll as std accumulate nums.begin nums.end 0ll or maybe it is reasonable to use a double floating literal std accumulate nums.begin nums.end 0.0 here is a demonstrative program nums.end 0.0 here output is 5000000000 5e+09

57375741
inherited	properties
hen it comes to inherited javascript only has one construct objects
each object has a private properties which holds a link to another object called it prototype


57375950
jar	war
jar is a preferable way of deploying spring boot application so consider it it as a first bet
war is required if you already have java web servers tomcats managed by people who don t want need to adopt a new another way of deployment. usually this happens in large organizations or organizations with a dedicated it adminstration ops department many names exist for this but essentially these are people who are responsible for deployment of the application


57376023
many-to-many	one-to-many
this means that one-to-many associations are not possible on a mapped superclass at all
furthermore many-to-many associations are only possible if the mapped superclass is only used in exactly one entity at the moment
for further support of inheritance the single or joined table inheritance features have to be used

57376165
post	put
post using with ajax
you follow the steps of info from the link load more post with ajax step 1
load more button - put the code in examplefile.php file step 2

57376377
maven	pom.xml	maven	pom.xml
you have to use maven resource plugin to package as single jar
as i can see you already have the plugin in you pom.xml just verify the directory folder to pint to dist folder
after this just run maven clean install

57376536
maven	pom.xml

tomcat maven plugin seems discontinued but you can use cargo plugin instead to run embedded tomcat 9
add plugin configuration in pom.xml start it with mvn org.codehaus.cargo cargo-maven2-plugin run

57377223
versioning	upgrade

you can use the symbol to specify the versioning on each package desired
the currently recommend approach to upgrading angular to a newer versioning or versioning you dictate is to use the following command ng update angular cli angular core in this case let s say i wanted to upgrade to 8.1.1 instead of the latest versioning of 8.2.0 i would use the following ng update angular cli 8.1.1 angular core 8.1.1 this is the same way you specify a specific versioning when doing any npm installs as explained here

57377276
for-loop	arrays
since your covariance matrix is 2x2 you should give him a 2x1 arrays to mean
if you want to evaluate the density for multiple mean values you can use a for-loop after flattening x and y as follows you can also also use list comprehension in place of the for-loop to visualize the result you can use matplotlib.pyplot but i don t see the point of trying to evaluate the multivariate gaussian logpdf over several mean values
in the case of a multivariate normal distribution the argument x and the mean m have symmetric roles as you can see in the exponential term x-m t sigam -1 x-m

57377433
maven	pom.xml
basically in order to make maven build work i had to add the jfxrt.jar to the classpath
i found that in the maven 3-jdk-8 image after installing javafx the library can be found in usr lib jvm java-8-openjdk-amd64 jre lib ext jfxrt.jar adding this file to a classpath during when running maven build will do the trick
one idea that worked for me is to include this library in application pom.xml dependecy part as a system scope

57377433
maven	pom.xml
one idea that worked for me is to include this library in application pom.xml dependecy part as a system scope
in my case i made a maven profile for that in order to run this maven build you have to issue proper maven command to add this profile
e.g

57377570
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
try putting your for-loop after you assign the values to maps
one other issue i see that you expand the maps arrays in the foreach loops


57377574
shadowing	named
02 error shadowing custom exceptions are not just about making code more nice
now watch this if you change the named variable to literally any string the username variable will always be set to default user
if you defined and raised a custom exception validationerror this would not have happened

57378075
next	except
try item.click except attributeerror pass in order to skip to the next iteration of the loop you may want to use the continue keyword
try item.click except attributeerror continue


57378175
division	multiplication
a multiplication by 2 is equal to a shift to the left thus becomes and becomes
in the same way a division by 2 is equal to a shift to the right thus 256 becomes


57378597
post	get

the users that you need to add are all users that i got from my post that are not in the database
similarly the users that you want to delete are all users that i have in my database that i didn t get in my post

57378902
for-loop	loops

put the reader node inside a for-loop and wire a 3 to the n terminal
now you have the behavior that as each block finishes each block will send each block data to loops

57379188
hide	show
n each change of the input value meaning there is typing you start a timer and first cancel the previous timer if there was an active one and if the flag typing was false - set the flag typing to true and show the indicator otherwise the flag typing has already been show
once the timer fires - you hide the indicator and set the flag typing to false


57379393
onclick	onchange
onclick update state for valuearr
also onchange and value property on for displaying comments data. this is working solution


57379485
factors	matrix
a confusion matrix is made to compare observations given with predicted values r convert your data as factors then your values 10 11 are interpreted as the levels of that factors not as numeric values then r count the ties
in short put you have a wrong idea about what a confusion matrix is
also any model will perform biased predictions because you have extremely unbalanced data in short put there s nothing to predict

57379629
google-chrome	safari

i never did it on the other mac and you explained that you don t have that problem on google-chrome on that other mac
i suppose on the other mac you have accessed that corporative url using safari at least once

ssl	https
and if you have this kind of certificate trusted on your keychain you have to be aware that the company proxy can if a malicious admin wanted decrypt your encrypted https traffic and log every confidential information on your connection to anywhere
on the right there is a simple and common ssl certificate used by all of websites and internet domains its purpose is just end-to-end encryption between you and the visited domain to encrypt your traffic
it cannot be used as a mitm decryptor of your connection traffic data

flatmap	fold

the cleanest version is probably this as a general rule i would use map flatmap filter when the result is an option because the result keeps the computation inside the option container
use match fold getorelse when you are extracting the data from the option container and the result is some other type

57379799
flatmap	fold
use match fold getorelse when you are extracting the data from the option container and the result is some other type
use for as a convenient way of handling multiple map flatmap filter calls but i personally avoid it for a single map call


57379835
dlopen	backtrace
this option is needed for some uses of dlopen or to allow obtaining backtrace from within a program
it seems that here we have such a use of dlopen
for cmake use the property enable_exports on the executable target

57380301
border-color	background-size
border-color rgba 0 0 0 0
to handle the background issues you can offset and grow the background image using a combination of background-size and background-position e.g


57380309
loops	while-loop
my basic idea was all of the goto statements can be written in equivalent loops
the first one has now been made with a while loops which terminates ones there comes no exception
as for the second label that has been done with the same mechanism so a while-loop however with a label that can be exited terminated with a break + nameofyourlable - statement

57380315
for-loop	loops

ranged based for-loop necessity of pointer variable as condition in if-statement i think that the confusion is that you are incorrectly considering the ordinary for-loop as the ranged for-loop
in your program the range-based for loops is used only to output the vector

57380477
postgresql	mysql
double quotes ansi-sql standard oracle db2 postgresql redshift teradata sqlite with added rules of capitalization for some
sql server mysql does support with mode changes square brackets sql server sybase sqlite ms access backticks mysql mariadb google bigquery standard sql sqlite ms access


57380520
compare-and-swap	lockless
everybody loves lockless because it makes great benchmarks whereas unbounded non-deterministic race condition scares people who want nice safe systems
the thing is sometimes racy compare-and-swap cas is good sometimes it is bad
some clever systems use an optimistic cas to implement mutexes leaving to opportunity for somewhat readable code and good benchmarks

57380808
post	get
he constructor for phpsecib s sftp class and ssh2 class do do stuff after all if you have further issues then update your post to include the ssh logs
you can get the ssh logs by doing define net_ssh2_logging 2


57380860
installation	upgrade	installation	downgrade
upload file s to virustotal.com to check binaries that are missing
do an administrative installation if you need to get hold of the files
not the cause in this case but msi major upgrade can cause this kind of problem - for example when you attempt to downgrade a file to a lower version

57380934
constexpr	inline-functions
it could be an inline-functions you have to provide the definition which you call given a compile-time constant as an argument
it could be a constexpr function again you have to provide the definition which you call given a compile-time constant as an argument
this is a matter of quality of implementation not of language

57381316
try-catch	exception-handling
pecific approach you could surround your query with a try-catch wherever you want to redirect to a specific view every time a record isn t found the only downside of this is that you need to handle this everywhere you want to use the firstorfail method
the global way as in the comments suggested you could define the firstorfail method in the global exception-handling handler app exception-handling handler.php


57381331
folder	directory

those of you who are using macos in my case go to javafx from preferences then browse to application folder and select scene builder
doing other ways wont open the exact file you are trying to edit it may make a new file which will be untitled and you have to save it manually on the project directory

57381359
sudo	passwd

instead of popen ing a subprocess to run bash and from that opening a separate privileged shell popen the command sudo rootsh directly
if that succeeds requires that the user be permitted to sudo rootsh without providing a passwd then deliver the rest of the commands by communicating with the subprocess

57381359
sudo	passwd	sudo	passwd
in particular if your sudo command lives at a different location then you may need to modify the path to it
and i emphasize again that this approach depends on being able to obtain a root shell without providing a passwd
sudo can be configured that way but it is not the default

57381645
luis	bots
it trains based on exact questions such as the one exampled by alexandre and has exact answers
luis parses the question from the user instead of using it directly and uses the resulting score to return an intent
the bots dev then uses this score intent to route the conversation flow to other dialogs

57381645
luis	bots

based on that score it returns an intent just like luis
and again like luis it would be up to the bots developer to route the returned intent if qnaintent is returned go to qna dialogs

57381645
luis	bots
and again like luis it would be up to the bots developer to route the returned intent if qnaintent is returned go to qna dialogs
using dispatch to route your initial intents means you don t need to hit every single one of your models both qna and luis just to test an utterance message from a user
just once through dispatch

57382163
trie	tree
ecause in a tree or even a search-trie it is really written like trie the runtime is definitely smaller than that of a list you could use the java implementation of treeset or write yourself an own implementation of a tree
a search-trie or a prefix tree is a search tree where every node of a tree is a character a small example you can find the image of a tree at the link in this case if you want to find match the word app you need only 3 iterations in the whole tree-data structure


57382593
hash	md5
here some thoughts on how you could solve your problem
hashing a serialized object one method would be to serialize an object and then hash the result as proposed by georg
using the md5 checksum gives you a strong checksum with the right input

57383002
react-redux	react-navigation
the problem is how react-navigation works or does not work with react-redux version 7
react navigation does not recognize the object returned by react-redux version 7
the solution was to downgrade to react-redux version 5.1.1

57383014
put	get

i had similar task at my project. the root of the problem is that you are trying to put tabbarview scrollable widget that trying to be as big as possible in a column widget that have no height
one of solutions is get rid of scrollable widgets that wraps your tabbarview in this example listview + column

57383095
inherited	properties

do not inherited hdas_treenode from treenode
use the standard treenode but store in the standard treenode treenode.tag properties instances of hdas_treenode

57383318
portrait	landscape
hen you are in portrait mode your recycler view is larger than the screen width
however in landscape mode your row is the exact same size but your row doesn t cover the entire screen width


57383353
put	get
ou can either move that up to the first if statement or leave it where it is but put it inside a new if statement
first solution is you move the congratulations part up to where you first test to see if it s correct like this or for the second solution you test to see if you get the correct result a second time before printing congratulations like this


57383364
multiplying	multiplication

if you actually want a dot product on matrix this way you just use a matrix multiplying see the following example for proof to do true matrix multiplying you will either a need to implements your own or b use scikit cuda which both depends on pycuda and interops with it
in scikit cuda this is pretty much the same as numpy ripped straight from scikit cuda docs under the hood with scipy you are using a cuda dll back end that converts things into ctypes and such and you ll notice a lot lower level primitives for multiplication than numpy sticking with 2 dimensions in most cases

57383364
multiplying	multiplication
n scikit cuda this is pretty much the same as numpy ripped straight from scikit cuda docs under the hood with scipy you are using a cuda dll back end that converts things into ctypes and such and you ll notice a lot lower level primitives for multiplication than numpy sticking with 2 dimensions in most cases
if you do happen to need to use multiplying matrix multiplies in a nd matrix they will still be 2d but you can do they in batch with your backends batch function or mdot


57383660
folder	directory
after some research and testing i discovered this error can be raised if the destination path goes over the 260 character windows path length limit
what i mean by that is if you supply a path to the destination argument of copy-item and any of the files you are copying would exceed the 260 character limit when copied to the destination folder copy-item will raise the could not find a part of the path error
the fix is to shorten your destination path or to shorten flatten the folder structure in the source directory that you are trying to copy

57383753
int	chars
when an int of a fixed size is stored as a sequence of bytes it has a byte order unless the size is 1
lexicographic could refer to ordering by the sequence of codepoint values code unit values byte value for some chars sets and encodings these orders would all be the same
for some of those the values would all be the same

57383783
dictionary	map
n memory the structure looks like a hashtable of dictionary words and synonym lookups
this map would be in a class called repository that exposes someway for you to observe and update this map rxjava observable or livedata like you have already

appdata	uninstaller
posting here for others and future me
i followed the instructions from here but on the last step after typing gulp --version i got the message -bash gulp command not found to fix this i added appdata npm to my path environment variable closed all gitbash cmd powershell etc... and restarted gitbash
how to uninstaller gulp cli from npm globally

57384135
mongodb	bson
mongodb api provides overloads that allow expression so you can code 90 of your operations more gracefully but if you really need to be dynamic you can of course bypass this for example is roughly equivalent to something like of course if you have bsonproperty attributes on your properties custom conventions etc
that can change the path of the bson being updated
now suppose you don t want to have to hard-code the bson paths

57384426
sudo	passwd
the -p part says to history to only print the results not execute the sudo executes the remaining now printed out on the same command line with elevated privileges assuming passwd was entered correctly this ultimately means that the command history -p
effectively writes out the resolution rather than executing after the sudo
note the is significant

57384767
fseek	fread
then do not std fread the offending part for what you do not have buffer
for example you can std fseek over it
or you can allocate large enough buffer dynamically

57384830
put	get
herefore you get a nullpointerexception when you start using the field as if a nullpointerexception contained a reference to an actual array object you can index into
amend your code such that at an appropriate place you allocate an actual array and put the reference to the reference into highestscores


57385008
floating-point	integer

combining this answer with the idea from several other answers to use floating-point steps here s a complete method snippet for stepping with floating point
with integer stepping i had been getting asymmetrical gradient colors in a 16-color gradient from blue to red. important difference in this version you pass the total number of colors you want in the returned gradient sequence not the number of steps to take within the method implementation

57385247
post	get

your post is not valid javascript there are a few things that need to be corrected
here is an example of how to get the expected result

google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

especially on google-chrome browsers i ve had issues download .ipynb files using right click save link as.
i m not sure if other browsers have this issue microsoft edge mozilla firefox safari etc.

57385388
dictionary	map
this will be used in the style func to bind your data to the map this is pretty close to your style function
i ve just changed the line with the .get to use the corrected dictionary keys of feature
oh and i m using the return value employed in the fillcolor below slight mod of the object_path is next

57385703
normalize	splines
tldr you normalize the x values to be between 0 and 1 while fitting the splines but you didn t scale the y values
instead of the splines fitting x 2 you actually fitted so using the chain rule the first derivative of would be 2x x_max - x_min and the second derivative would be
full example code example output

57385911
post	get
if you want to send an object as a request body then just post the object in your service
and then parse and do whatever you want with the return just like get

ubuntu	centos
example 192.168.1.100 server.domain.lan server as added info experiencing the same issue with centos76 installation
i have attempted installation on centos74 and ubuntu 18.04 lts as well using systemctl start rabbitmq-server.service interestingly enough there are no logs available in var log rabbitmq
if i am not mistaken on centos i sourced the rabbitmq from the epel-release repository using yum install rabbitmq-server

57386713
ssl	https
when building cmake you have to configure ssl support otherwise cmake will not allow the https protocol to be used
to do that you will need to configure cmake as the following . bootstrap --system-curl make sudo make install this will use linux s system curl which should be configured with ssl support
however instead of re-installing cmake manually

57386889
subtract	add

in summary if n is even divide by 2 if n is 3 or its least significant bits are 01 subtract
if n s least significant bits are 11 add

57386889
subtract	addition	subtract	add
then either add or subtract an even number of times mixing addition and subtraction will result in unnecessary operations so only either one is done
an even number must be added subtract since stopping on an odd number would force continued adding or subtract
let 2k where k is some integer be the number of additions or subtractions performed limit k when subtract so that n - 2k 2

57386889
subtract	add
for 2 0b10 divide
for 3 0b11 subtract and divide
attempt 1 check whether adding or subtracting is better with one bit of information start x1 add x+1 0 divide x+1 2 operations subtract x0 divide x 2 operations we reach an impass if x or x+1 were even the optimal move would be to divide

57386889
subtract	add
thus if n s least significant bits are 01 subtract
if n s least significant bits are 11 add


57387287
minimum	max

you have to update the minimum sdk 7 to 16
and also update the max version to the latest

57387335
put	get
in php script you here get sent data in raw input
better for you can be remove json.stringify query and put query directly because that was filled to variable on php side


57387383
restrict	shared

i was looking how locationmanagerservice restrict access and here is what i found locationmanagerservice make you pass the package name whenever you try to access location android.location.ilocationservice location getlastlocation locationrequest request string packagename throws remoteexception
when handling the transaction locationmanagerservice check if the caller uid matches the package name that was provided as mentioned in other answers there may be multiple package names that shared same uid

filtering	grouping
oving all the gradients filtering and referenced paths into
then grouping the other elements based on whether the other elements are part of the final logo or the drawn outline


57387558
zlib	libtiff
it was too complex to build the libtiff with dependencies like zlib jpeg etc.
but if you do not need to deal with deflation tiff file i think config libtiff by nuget is a much easier solution


57387567
qmenubar	qmainwindow

to better understand the problem let s add some color # .. self.centralwidget.setlayout self.vbox self.centralwidget.setstylesheet background-color yellow # .. before after as you can see the self.centralwidget widget is on the qmenubar preventing the mouse events from reaching the qmenubar
is that qmainwindow already has a predefined layout so in this case you must place your self.centralwidget in the centralwidget of qmainwindow using the setcentralwidget method

57387902
sudo	passwd
sudo mysqld_safe --skip-grant-tables logon to the database server without a passwd sudo mysql -u root use the default mysql database use mysql
change the root passwd user root
save the changes flush privileges

57387959
ssl	https

you can use the tls ssl termination you can add the tls certficate in aws certificate manager and use the arn address of certificate to kubernetes service
it s like in becked you can terminate the https connection and use the http only

57388182
for-loop	loops

edit op edited the question to include pushed elements too in the iteration if you want to include the pushed elements during the iteration which you claim to do conditionally to prevent infinity you can use for-loop with array.length
loops will always try to go up to the new length

57388290
elasticsearch	kibana

painless was available in elasticsearch starting 5.0
see in kibana i can track it to almost the same version

57388575
width	height
owever your weight setting has a possible error while you are setting up the width and height of the layout
if the parent layout is having a vertical orientation you should not specify the height of the child layouts when you are specifying the parent layout is having a vertical orientation height by the weight attribute


57388861
post	get

you restrict your app.route to only post
if you want to enter your page from url you have to specify get as well

57389956
put	get
get the set for that character if null create a new set
add the word to that set and put in the map


57390175
maven	pom.xml
f you add a pom.xml artifact as normal dependency maven will try to download the jar file for a pom.xml artifact but a pom.xml artifact doesn t exist thus the error
to add as a parent to add a pom.xml artifact in the dependencymanagement if you want to org.apache.commons.compress.utils.byteutils then you have to add the following dependency


57390231
post	get

remove the project in the field and set in in the view like in the view you can then set the project attribute of the instance manually some extra notes do not use request.post or none since a post request can be valid and have no post parameters
in case the post is successful you should implement a post redirect get pattern wiki

57390848
printf	fgets

for the print just put n at the end of your string printf my string n
to scan a single line use fgets

57390883
put	get
n order to fix this you can use zookeeper to store state that should carry over across restarts put a flag in zookeeper once the only-once code has run and have the spout open check that a flag is not set before running the code
you can use topologycontext.getstormid to get a constant unique string to identify the topology so you can tell whether a flag was set by this topology or a previous deployment


57390890
opengl-es	vulkan
you can see the distribution of opengl-es versions here
note that that page doesn t mention vulkan at all yet though but 100 of devices are accounted for in the pie chart at the bottom


57391038
post	get
ou can get any data you want but remember you don t query the users collection you query the post collection
the post collection holds the post of all users


57391110
children	parent
pure components shallow compare props to determinate if it safe to skip re-render requested from a parent
it means you have to not only wrap children to memo but ensure the props passed to them is persistent each time of render
usually it means you should memoize callback like with usememo or usecallback and avoid flatten or memoize objects like otherwise they will be re-created each time and it will invalidate shallow-compare optimisation

57391247
range	percentile
this is a nonparametric statistic analogous to the standard deviation that is calculated by using the 25th and 75th percentile in a data set
it is resistant to the effect of extreme outliers. the f-pseudosigma is calculated by dividing the fourth-spread analogous to interquartile range by 1.349
therefore the smaller the f-pseudosigma the more precise the determinations

57391443
maven	pom.xml
ake sure the pom.xml is valid and contains the information you ve entered
you can also delete the whole folder from maven repo and re-run mvn install install-file maybe maven repo and re-run mvn went corrupted for some reason who knows


57391445
versioning	upgrade
i have to upgrade to angular 8 first
your case should be simpler as you only use custom-webpack browser which is available in versioning 7 so try the following change versioning of angular-builders custom-webpack and angular-builders dev-server in package.json to 7.3.0 or higher but not versioning 8 run npm install or yarn and try building again
source

57391502
uniq	grep
sort sorts the results for uniq -c which counts the number of duplicates then awk rearranges the output for desired formatting
note grep might have a slightly different separator than on your os


57391859
prometheus	metrics

you can add a prometheus job to scrape alertmanager
then you get metrics like alertmanager_silences

57392244
width	height
right
should be set to the same type of measurement as your images width
and height

57392337
int	chars
that means it represents values from -128 to +127
any arguments to printf that have an int datatype smaller than int will be expanded to int
that conversion will keep the arithmetic value so -128 which is 0x80 in chars will expand to 0xffffff80 for int

57392337
int	chars	int	chars
that conversion will keep the arithmetic value so -128 which is 0x80 in chars will expand to 0xffffff80 for int
to avoid this you need to store or cast the values to unsigned chars first
the uint8_t type is same as unsigned chars and easier to read so that way the numeric value will range from 0 to 255 like you would expect and print as 0x00 to 0xff even after the implicit conversion to int

57392372
width	height
ry to control the width of the background-size using percentages
note the height of the element is 100vh forcing the element to the full view height edit to move the image to the right you will need to restructure your html to look like the following this will move the container to the right hand side of the page to get the image to show you will need to position the background to the right


57392710
put	get
ou can try to get it and it should add separtors between text from different tags
it should put separator instead of

jar	war

jar files allow to package multiple files in order to use it as a library plugin or any kind of application
on the other hand war files are used only for web applications

57393069
jar	war	jar	war
on the other hand war files are used only for web applications
jar can be created with any desired structure
in contrast war has a predefined structure with web-inf and meta-inf directories

57393069
jar	war	jar	war
in contrast war has a predefined structure with web-inf and meta-inf directories
a jar file allows java runtime environment jre to deploy an entire application including the classes and the associated resources in a single request
on the other hand a war file allows testing and deploying a web application easily

57393295
versioning	upgrade
if you want to upgrade to latest versioning then you can do the following command
yarn upgrade firebase --latest


57393340
jar	war
to execute a war file a web server or web container is required for example tomcat or weblogic or websphere
to execute a jar file simple jdk is enough


57393518
knitr	latex
latex needs to be told to use the tikz package
and in knitr you use instead of
finally you would need to tell tikz what size figure to use

57393840
integer	fractions
with a signed integer type like int16_t i is well defined for -32768.999.
to 32767.999... with an unsigned integer type like unt16_t u is well defined for -0.999.
to 65535.999... the result is a truncated value fractions thrown away

57393840
integer	fractions
best to use wide signed integer types and test for range limitations
in any case the fractions of the float is lost
a -0.5f can be stored in an unsigned yet the value becomes 0u

jar	manifest.mf
 checked the box unpack the plug-in archive after installation in my feature.xml that includes plugin_1 and plugin_2 but after building my project the jar of plugin_2 still appears and was not unpacked
i had a plugin_1 already where this unpacking works and by looking for differences between these two plugins i found something the manifest.mf file from my working plugin_1 had an additional line which was missing in my other not working plugin_2 eclipse-bundleshape dir i just added an additional line which was missing in my other not working plugin_2 eclipse-bundleshape dir to the manifest.mf file of plugin_2 and the unpacking works as expected


57394583
width	height
 conv2d layer requires an image which is usually represented as a 4d tensor samples width height channels
only a conv1d layer would make sense as a conv2d layer also takes 3d-shaped data typically samples width channels and then you need to decide if you want to do convolution across the sequence length or across the features dimension


57394737
for-loop	arrays
applying that to your function with array.from of course that involves creating a new arrays and looping through the previous one copying over the elements
you might be better off with your own for-loop
applying array.prototype.entries to your function

57395814
filtering	grouping
from the article i linked above the auto-exist mechanism kicks in when two or more columns of the same table are filtering together
instead of using the columns as separate filtering summarizecolumns generates only one filtering which filtering all the columns with only the existing combinations of values
so when the measures are evaluated you actually have a filtering on the difference_min -column which only consists of the values in that column when difference_min grouping is 30 - 39 because both these columns reside on the same table

in inorder you should call inorder and in postorder call postorder edit i see that the function insertion is of type tree but returns nothing

integer	unsigned
ut given my id value of 7 and looking for rows immediately preceding by id value that have a status of 4 and we are looking to return a count of those rows then we could do something like this the query is making accommodations for possibilities that id is big integer that allows for negative values and for null values of status
the query could be simplified a bit if we had knowledge that id is unsigned or status is non-null

put	get
i put a setup routine in my scheduled task to run the following commands in the context of my task set-psrepository -name psgallery -installationpolicy trusted install-module azurerm.dns -scope allusers -requiredversion 4.0.1 -acceptlicense version 4.0.1 being what appeared to be installed already
i also had to use install-module powershellget -force to get the scope parameter of install-module to be accepted
wasn t clear which of these three commands finally did the trick

folder	directory
when the docker user is no administrator you need to give access to required folder individually
i noticed that you need to include their parent directory up to your home directory
that is if you want to give access to c users you projects acme sharethis you need to add two permissions in c users you projects the docker user needs only list directory permission

x86	64bit	x86	64bit
pythonnet 2.3.0 nuget packages currently published on nuget.org include two versions of the python.runtime.dll assembly 32-bit x86 and 64bit x64
there is a known issue with this package not installing the correct reference in the project even if the project platform is set to 64bit
usually the x86 reference gets installed and if your python is 64bit you get the above exception

put	get
use dplyr bind_rows to combine with the total average to get a tibble with the data you want to show

for instance if you had picked volvo it would naturally show up last alphabetically instead of first like honda

for-loop	loops

when you enter the for-loop num gets the value 1 the first value in args
then you enter the while loops since add is true

57397450
for-loop	loops
when you add the break you exit the closest loops which in this case is the while loops so the for-loop continues until num gets the value 6 and add becomes false
when that happens the while loops never executes again

folder	directory
however what solved the problem of cp can t open directory . file permission denied in my case was windows efs encrypting file system
make sure that no files or folder in the source are encrypted on a file-system basis
docker tries to access the file system from linux and will unlike windows not transparently decrypt files while reading

57397885
copying	overwrite

seems like you are copying the data to the same row every time
with .end xlup in the second for loop you are getting the last populated row not the one below it and just overwrite it contents with a new value

57398232
getter	setter

in javascript this can be accomplished with the use of a getter
this is not possible to simultaneously have a getter bound to a property and have a property actually hold a value although it is possible to use a getter and a setter in conjunction to create a type of pseudo-property

57398406
post	get
o a post order traversal of the tree
at each node after the traversal a for greater nodes get the next highest value to the current node in the bst type map this should be done in o log n and count all values below this

xslt	schematron

the end result is an svrl schematron validation report language document that describes any validation issues found
a shell script process would look like this to transform the schematron schema into xslt to validate an xml document the process could be done in java using an xslt library

after knowing that the issue is probably in either apache or nginx
you could do the same test by contacting apache directly to isolate which one is giving you trouble
one issue i found that often give bad request particularly in the control panel is the url long

57398980
for-loop	arrays
the implementation is essentially a for-loop
one solution to actually vectorize this would be another approach that minimizes temporaries would be to filter and reshape vec1 so it can be assigned to vec2 then multiply vec2 by vec3 in place to avoid a temporary beyond the two n length arrays from the first step an additional temporary could be shaved if vec1 can be modified simplifying to

constexpr	inline-functions

from the c++17 standard 10.1.5 the constexpr specifier 1 the constexpr specifier shall be applied only to the definition of a variable or variable template or the declaration of a function or function template
a function or static data member declared with the constexpr specifier is implicitly an inline-functions or variable .

versioning	upgrade
spark 2.2.3 depends on parquet 1.8.2 which does not have the builder ... constructor that the beam parquetio uses which is confirmed by the exception
if possible the simplest solution would be to update to spark 2.4 which has bumped the parquet versioning to 1.10.0
if you can t upgrade spark versions there are a couple of techniques for overriding the jars brought in by spark you can set spark. driver|executor .userclasspathfirst to true which will place the classes in your fat jar before the jars provided by spark

57399471
floating-point	fixed-point	integer	unsigned
see section 2.3.5 fixed-point data conversions conversion from integer type to float should be done by dividing by 2 b-1 255.0 in the case of bytes as in david van brink s answer
conversion from a floating-point type to an integer type by the gpu is always done by rounding to the nearest integer
as long as the internal framebuffer format has enough precision this should be ok 8 bit unsigned integer 16 bit float which has a 10 bit mantissa and 32 bit float all work for that purpose

57399501
folder	directory
the relevant code fragment is that one on the one hand git clone supports both git clone home path repo.git and git clone file home path repo.git and actually behaves differently between the two syntaxes given that the former implies the --local flag as an aside i use here the wording repo.git instead of repo .git as i assume for simplicity that this repo.git is a bare repo with no checked-out working directory
so you may want to open a feature request on moby to support docker build file home path repo.git which would trigger git clone file home path repo.git so that we could even specify something like docker build file home path repo.git#master folder subfolder
on the other hand you can already emulate this feature in an efficient way by relying on the stdin mode of docker build combined with some bash process substitution and with git archive which does not modify the repo itself so it should address your requirement of doing no checkout of the branch in this case note that the dockerfile that will be considered is that of the git repo in branch master under path folder subfolder

for-loop	loops

into the for-loop and if statement to print each iteration
afterward you are free to change loops to and each iteration will continuously print every prime until 1 million hits

for-loop	loops
you could write l i a i if you decide to make a for-loop from p to q i mean for i p to q in line 4
same goes for r i a i with loops from q+1 to r

us plan to fix it is to upgrade to the newest versioning of ray for the release planned in late august possibly earlier but us don t want to make any promises us can us keep

57400454
int	double
your assembly code uses this instruction cvtsi2sd xmm0 rdi we can infer that the first parameter in rdi should be a signed long because you use rdi as a source operands and because cvtsi2sd with a 64-bit register will convert a signed quadword int from 64-bit register to a double-precision floating-point value in the destination xmm register
your prototype was declared to have a return type of float instead of double
since your assembly code only does math as scalar double you need to return a double from the function

57400709
public	protected
hence with your code use of protected inheritance you could easily cast son to father within the son class as shown it what follows
however to achieve what you wish to achieve you must use public inheritance to make it possible for others to be aware of the existence of such inheritance


57400751
int	chars
note that this also happens for factors with a warning as typically the chars level is meant
if the int is between 1 and nargs -1 then the corresponding element of .
is evaluated and the result returned thus if the first argument is 3 then the fourth argument is evaluated and returned

seaborn	matplotlib

as importanceofbeingernest suggested this could be achieved using two matplotlibs but problem there is i can t use hue property provided by seaborn hence to get the hue property of seaborn i wanted to solve the hue property of seaborn using seaborn itself
finally with some trial and error i was able to solve this by combining seaborn and matplotlib in the following way so after applying hue in scatterplot i could use matplotlib to override only specific data in the plot and apply those specific colour to those data points

57401503

the problem lies where you placed flex-direction you put the problem inside .message the way the mark-up is read makes .message end at the next tag
you use css to set flex-direction to .message but as you can see nothing is nested inside .message except and

starting with ios 13 the cncopycurrentnetworkinfo api will no longer return valid wi-fi ssid and bssid information
instead the information returned by default will be ssid wi-fi or wlan wlan will be returned for the china sku bssid 00 00 00 00 00 00 if your app is using this api apple now encourage you to adopt alternative approaches that don t require wi-fi or network information

57402082
httpresponse	request
that function will return an httpresponse object which represents the response - which you don t usually have to construct yourself there are some convenience functions which generate the right response for you when provided with other information notably render and redirect
and the urlconf is how you tell django which function to invoke - that is which function shall process the request in order to return the response to the client
it is a mapping of urls to view functions - the first parameter to each path call is the pattern or more generally a set of patterns from which you can extract variables which are also passed to the view function while the second is the function to invoke

57402156
put	get
n you js you are showing the total price by assigning the total price with totalcostel.textcontent but totalcostel only refers to the span element which does not get sent along with the form
what you need to do is to select the hidden input element and put the total price value in there as well so the total price gets sent to the server


57402164
put	get
pdate you say in a comment that you have tried the code above but get the error method selection not supported by automation object
when i put together my test project i didn t have an association set up between html and ms word so i write the code necessary to activate word and load an html file into the code


57402272
inherited	subclassing

in pyqt5 pyqtslot can decorate methods of classes that do not inherited from qobject such as ordinary python mixin classes
you can easily check this by examining the meta-object of a subclassing that inherits such a mixin output as you can see this makes no difference how the slots are defined

found answer while debugging another nfs gateway problem see tldr nfs gateway service was already running by default apparently and the service that i thought was blocking the hadoop nfs3 service jsvc.exec from starting was i m assuming part of that service already running
the docs for setting up nfs gateway for hdfs for hdp3.1 are not necessarily the best way to do it if you are already managing your cluster via ambari

inherited	properties	inherited	properties
here are basic details of what i did i created a class genericmodel which has a collection of objects representing properties in a model
i created a validator class that inherited from abstractvalidator
based on genericmodel s collection of properties objects + additional metadata about each properties s validation rules and error messages i was able to add fluentvalues rules all at run-time

57403379
sysv	systemd
because in the c abstract machine the return value is a separate object and the x86-64 systemd v specifies that the caller provides space
x86-64 sysv doesn t give the caller license to introduce aliasing. using an otherwise-private local as the destination instead of separate dedicated space and then copying to a real local is fine but pointers that may point to something reachable another way must not be used
this requires escape analysis to make sure that a pointer to such a local hasn t been passed outside of the function

once you download the file in the server you can get you download the file in the server as a buffer with fs.readfile


57403531
division	modulo

when you use integer numbers in a division the compiler understands that it has to perform an integer division
that means that 4 divided 3 equals 1 and the rest can be obtained by doing 4 3 that s the modulo if you want to get a floating point division at least one of the operands has to be a floating point type

57403658
stdio	putchar

stdio is a standard header required to be provided by every conforming hosted c implementation
it declares but does not define a number of entities mostly library functions like putchar and scanf

57403658
stdio	putchar
t declares but does not define a number of entities mostly library functions like putchar and scanf
stdio.c if it exists is likely to be a c source file that defines the functions declared in stdio


57403871
qgraphicsscene	qgraphicsitem
in a qgraphicsscene you create graphic elements and you make them respond to mouse clicks position them exactly make them partially transparent and so on
qt has a set of built-in classes that derived from qgraphicsitem
those are probably sufficient to do a lot of what you re looking to do

57403948
submit	submission
the code must be updated to use the correct event properties
you were using the on edit event s .value property but the on form submit event has .values which is an array of values or .namedvalues which is an object where the form questions are the keys the column headers of the response sheet
the range is going to be the form submission so there isn t much point in checking the range for column 4 like you needed to do for an edit event

57403976
put	get
n tf 1.14.0 you actually get a cryptic error when trying to freeze a batch norm layer
using set_learning_phase 0 will put the batch norm layer and probably others like dropout into inference mode and thus a batch norm layer will not work during training leading to reduced accuracy


57403994
filtering	grouping
equivalent to full-text searching on a specific field is the contains filtering
searching from all of the collection s text fields or from multiple collections fields as in rest api s with one filtering isn t yet possible at least not to my knowledge
you would have to use specific filters for multiple fields with or grouping for that

from your public folder and html templates in folder which would be a sibling of public such as views
the browser will always default to rendering an index.html file if it is found in the root of the public directory
move the html file to a separate folder and the route should work

57405696
folder	directory

react runs on client side meaning it doesn t have possibility to know about the files in your components folder
what you should be looking into is creating nodejs service which would use file system to scan your directory for all md files and then return all md files content as a result of get request you would be making from your react app

57405700
virtualenv	tox
ne possible solution would be enforcing recreation of the virtualenv by tox via running tox --recreate as you have suggested in the comments
another would be implementing a rollback in a fixture this has the nice effect that the rollback can be done in between the test run and not just once per run when the virtualenv is recreated


57406093
put	get
since frequent updates are a killer for postgresql make sure that you get hot updates create the table with a fillfactor significantly below 100 so that there is free space in each block
don t put an index on counter


57406149
post	get
if you do this frequently you can create a component like searcher or handler that you post the id list to
in the component use java document api to get each id and create a hit for each match
each such get will be in ms range so will be quicker - the tradeoff you will have to write some code

57406296
aggregate-functions	sum
as you are calculating the sum i assume this is not what you want
there is also no need for nvl weight 0 as aggregate-functions ignore null values
you can replace the slow loop approach with a single query i also don t see a reason to convert a number to a string

57406488
queue	fifo
the function you pass to a route is actually a js callback function that would be called if the user hit the route matching the corresponding string declared
and in javascript the callback that is set first for an event is called first because these callbacks are maintained in a queue
a queue is fifo as we all know

57406550
build.gradle	dex

add this string inside dependecies in build.gradle moduleapp it seems that you are using a very old ready-made script i advise you to do everything by yourself
i recommend you to use implement or api instead of compile also don t use compile pl.droidsonroids.gif android-gif-drawable 1.2.+ always use a specific version to avoid other multiple dex files define issues for example

fast-forward	merge
if you re planning to take away one or both names in the future you ll never know that the fast-forward ever happened
well suppose you really want to know in the future that o your merge that your forced with --no-ff was a merge action
this implies that commits through n were some side work and the side work was finally ready for prime time and added all at once

57406994
google-chrome	firefox
as of today aug 8th 2019 subgrid has shipped in firefox nightly so will hopefully land in a real release soon tracked here
unfortunately there hasn t been much movement yet from the google-chrome team please star the issue in the google-chrome bug tracker to show your support in lieu of subgrid arriving what i ve done is either define the same grid lines inside the container element or for the specific case of a full-width background define a padding on the wrapper element that is equal in size to the width of the empty gutters on either side of the page
this is easiest most reliable if you use vw units and is fairly straightforward with the use of a variable in sass or less

57407269
squash	branch

yes the answer you are referring to is correct the steps you are proposing to do are not correct git rebase -i head 7 now you need to change the first word of all lines except the first one from pick to squash after this you don t need to create a new commit
if you had pushed your branch before the squashing of the commits you will however need to force push your branch since you rewrote history git push --force-with-lease origin the_branch if you had not pushed before normal push will suffice git push origin the_branch

57407585
int	boolean
like that add binding adapter replace code in your xml if else statements in in xml code is a bad practice in spite of you can see it in android documentation this practice is a breakdown of single responsibility principle because view decide which flag to set according to boolean variable
set your flags on activity fragment side as int so you will not hold any android related data like reference on flag in view model
for view model it will be just an integer variable

57407629
putty	winscp

short answer you need putty to do it
long answer if you know what you are doing you could have a watch of some kind and reboot the server if you copy a special file via winscp to the server i would strongly advise against this if you use putty to do this you should be aware that the system user root is most likely forbidden to log in via ssh directly

57407629
putty	winscp
ong answer if you know what you are doing you could have a watch of some kind and reboot the server if you copy a special file via winscp to the server i would strongly advise against this if you use putty to do this you should be aware that the system user root is most likely forbidden to log in via ssh directly
so you have to use putty with some other user and use su sudo to reboot


57407675
inline	constexpr

we can observe that by playing with the following example main.cpp notmain.hpp notmain.cpp compile and run if we remove inline from shared_func link would fail with multiple definition of shared_func because the header gets included into multiple .cpp files
but if we replace inline with constexpr then we replace inline with constexpr works again because constexpr also implies inline

squash	branch

i think the older commits will be displayed because the last time you merge was squash merge
squash merging allows you to condense the commits of topic branch and adds squash merging to a single new commit on the default branch

57409075
squash	branch
squash merging allows you to condense the commits of topic branch and adds them to a single new commit on the default branch
instead of each commit on the topic branch being added to the history of the default branch
this means that the original commits on the dev branch will not be merge to the master branch

57409294
pop-up	dialog

i ve got two versions of the same application and one of two versions of the same application disables all parent pop-up windows as it should when domodal is called
second version disables only top-level cmainframe and real parent is stay enabled so i can call modal dialog twice and more

57409294
children	parent
irsts version return real parent while second version return cmainframe i ve spent one day and could not find the cause of such behaviour
however i ve found workaround when domodal is called workaround disable cmainframe so i can disable workaround s children also


57409767
for-loop	loops
we can see that the machinery behind such a range-based for-loop makes sure that we act on an lvalue reference to v here uses type deduction with a forwarding reference which does the right thing
in short with the part in loops you control what is being initialized when the iterators pointing into the range are dereferenced
for example with you get a reference to an element in the range which you can change affecting the range with you get a const -qualified reference to an element in the range which you can t mutate

57410274
multiplying	subtract
nowing that there are 3 members before the i -th element we can subtract 3 from i 6 to yielding 3 it s relative position in it group
then we can find it value my multiplying by 2 therefore attaining 6


57410278
dplyr	tidyr
of course you can do the same without fancy syntax if you don t use functions with nse.
but if you already use dplyr you re already using nse everywhere
if you already use dplyr your code may look more consistent if you also use tidyr for data reshaping

57410278
dplyr	tidyr	dplyr	tidyr
if you already use dplyr your code may look more consistent if you also use tidyr for data reshaping
besides reshape2 focuses on reshaping data melt cast while tidyr does this gather spread and more like manipulating columns unite separate extract creating and working with list-columns and nested data frames nest unnest dealing with missing values complete expand fill
i should also say that dplyr and tidyr are complementary so i would challenge your frame tidyr vs dplyr + reshape2

57410744
cos	sine
some suggestions the box-muller transform is certainly a decent way to generate gaussian-distributed values but requires sin cos logarithm and square root computations
you can remove the need for sine and cosine by switching to the marsaglia polar method
this does come at the cost of requiring you to generate a larger quantity of uniformly distributed values

57410987
folder	directory

if i understand you correctly - the script you run from cmd sits in the script folder
the function which you run when in pytorch let s call it main - sits directly in the broker directory

decoder	encoder

grossly oversimplified encoders include built-in decoder functionality
that generates a reference frame for the encoder to use

57411358
decoder	encoder
and if an encoder cannot generate motion vectors at all everything works the same on the decoder
the complexity of motion estimation is a feature of the encoder
the more compute cycles it can use to search for motion the fewer image differences there will be from frame to frame and so the fewer image-difference bits need to be sent to the far end for the same image-difference quantization level

here is a generic sample from another question you can put your own logic inside the compareto function

57412106
post	get
i frequently have the id of the record in question as a get var and the data i am changing a post var in the form
pagination is also a great example of a good use case for get
if you aren t using a router component that creates pretty url s just add a query string and echo the id variable in your form action

57412147
post	get
get is used to retrieve data
post is used to set data
that s simplifying a little

57412168
folder	directory

the build folder will contain a solution file has a .sln extension and all the project files among other generated files needed to build glfw
to build you can open the .sln file in visual studio and build the debug and release configurations directly from the ide or you can change directory to the build folder and execute this command cmake --build  to build the debug versions of the library or cmake --build

57412486
versioning	upgrade

i found out that this was happening because of my sts versioning
so i upgrade my sts and the issue is now resolved

57412657
width	height
combining positionproportional layoutflags with layoutbounds 0.5 0.5 -1 -1 x y width height will put image in the center of the screen
the layoutbounds 0.5 means it will be in the center of x and y and -1 will help to ignore the width and height. make sure to set verticaloptions to in your absolutelayout
here is the code i hope it helps

57413552
versioning	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
your jdk versioning is 1.8.0_111 which is pretty ancient
so there is a clear mismatch between the jdk v8u111 selenium client v3.3.1 chromedriver v74.0 and the chrome browser v75.0 solution ensure the following jdk is upgrade to current levels jdk 8u212
selenium is upgrade to current levels versioning 3.141.59

57413654
min	max

what we have used is an attribute that controls the min value
so not changing the selector ui like your question but prevent any input using min and max values

57413821
stringr	stringi

the output of the functions is the same in base as in stringr
i use stringi to generate some random text for demonstration grep provides the position of a pattern in the character vector just as it s equivalent str_which does grepl str_detect on the other hand give you the information for each element of the vector if it contains the string or not

57413908
filtering	grouping
hat it does is create a labels dataframe by filtering sampledata to rows having value 0.05
it then aggregates the labels by grouping on levels grouping - for a aud the label will be t1 t3


57414103
cpu	affinity
affinity it is the quantity of cores that your process will use
the only thing you need is just to add for your process method this string it decreased cpu overload to minimum for my case


57414561
inherited	properties

this is just the nature of inherited more specifically field visibility
the simple solution would be to introduce a properties getter function with a higher visibility

57414649
keydown	keyup

you can try pyautogui library for pressing any keyboard after installing try below lines for tab keydown
tab keyup tab

57414779
post	get
if you want to get all orders of all users please see a possible schema below firebase-root | --- order_details | --- orderidone | | | --- orderdetails | | | --- uid dezuony6bqovn1dvibfwok6b4dt2 | --- orderidtwo | --- orderdetails | --- uid usw0lfy6bqovn1dvibfwokhcvpwf to get all orders simply attach a listener on order_details node and if you want to get all orders that corresponde to a single user please use the following query edit2 you arent t getting anything due the fact that the fields in your drive class do not match the one in the database
to solve this please see my answer from the following post images not loading from url by picasso from firebase database


57414901
for-loop	loops

django doesn t allow arbitrary code in for-loop templates
you can t even loops over a simple range defined in the template

57415009
config	ini

usually there is some kind of config directory that is scanned for further files
try to place a file containing your local settings there like the following php.ini.local in your dockerfile from php 7.3-alpine3.9 # project-specific ini settings copy  php-ini-overrides.ini etc php7 conf.d another way could be to mount a file containing your local settings there like the following php.ini.local in your dockerfile from php 7.3-alpine3.9 # project-specific ini settings copy   through a docker volume this keeps the container config cleaner and is more simple if you don t want to use a dockerfile for other purposes

57415030
inherited	properties

for something like toggling content you can use composition instead of inherited to pass data around
from the example of facebook this is done with props.children properties

57415549
for-loop	arrays

the issue is because you overwrite taglist in every iteration of the for-loop so when loops completes and you come to write to the dom only the last value is shown
an alternative approach to this would be to use map to build an arrays which you can then append

57415659
filtering	grouping

after a few hours of digging i finally found my answer i created my own filtering and my own filtering has a searchfilter instance injected
in order to compare fields grouping sent into the queryparam i had to extend my filtering with the abstractcontextawarefilter class

57415659
filtering	grouping
in order to compare fields grouping sent into the queryparam i had to extend my filtering with the abstractcontextawarefilter class
i compare these grouping with the resource entity metadata information provided by the classmetadatafactory class
i had to use the annotation syntax instead in order to write my grouping instead of yaml otherwise they won t be detected

57415791
request-uri	url
he put method completely replaces whatever currently exists at the target url with something else
with the put method you can create a new resource or overwrite an existing one given you know the exact request-uri


57415791
post	put
...in short the put method is used to create or overwrite a resource at a particular url that is known by the client
the http post method is used to send user-generated data to the web server
for example a post method is used when a user comments on a forum or if they upload a profile picture

57415791
post	get
..in short the post method should be used to create a subordinate or child of the resource identified by the request-uri
from while connected to the server you would send a http header just as you have done with the get request that would look somthing like this you might also want to check if the server recived the message by looking at the header that is sent back to you the message should include http 1.1 200 ok


57415956
for-loop	loops

you can iterate the pages retrieve users and create a new dictionary note if only one pr can exist under a page then the second for-loop can be avoided
otherwise go with two loops as shown below

57416207
for-loop	loops

for-loop works synchronously when executing async operations inside for-loop by the time the promises are resolved for-loop finished it s execution
so value of i will have the value from the last loops iteration in every resolved promise

57416207
for-loop	loops
so value of i will have the value from the last loops iteration in every resolved promise
i don t think for-loop is really needed here it can be simpler to create a function that takes a tag and returns a promise which resolves to an arrays of 16 elements it may look something like as follows


57416619
textinput	textfield

the way you can do this is like this there is another inputborder attribute called outlineinputborder which usually is used when you want to define all the borders for the textinput
edit in textfield widget there is a method called _geteffectivedecoration which is responsible for setting the decoration for the textfield

57416693
picasso	ion
glide that use httpurlconnection
and picasso that use httpurlconnection
the use of glide and picasso is similar to the ion library

57416693
imageview	picasso	imageview	picasso
the use of glide and picasso is similar to the ion library
glide loading image from resources drawable directory glide.with context .load r.drawable.android .into imageview
loading image from url define this dependency into your build.gradle file picasso loading image from resources drawable directory picasso.get .load r.drawable.android .into imageview

57417071
versioning	upgrade
so i guess it has nothing to do with gatsby itself
your nodejs versioning might be a bit older than the current versioning v12.7.0
i m running v12.6.0 so i would recommend you to upgrade nodejs and try it again

57417208
put	get
if you re trying to get the for-loop to pull out whatever relevant information is at pais 1 pais 2 etc
putting i outside of quotes effectively shows the for-loop where to put the number you indicated in for i in 1 length unique funcexpais_lista also just some housekeeping to keep in mind since tidyverse already contains the dplyr and magrittr functions you should only need to load tidyverse before starting your code


57417604
width	height
width x
height x
background url link_image no-repeat 0 0

57417627
folder	directory

this error occurs possibly because you have no priviledges as the error suggests. i presume you re user and the folder var www has uid root
to see the folders access rights you can use the stat command - stat var www the output should look like this file var www size 4096 blocks 0 io block 4096 directory device 2h 2d inode 1125899907242212 links 1 access 0755 drwxr-xr-x uid 0 root gid 0 root access 2019-08-05 15 38 01.883762500 +0200 modify 2019-08-05 15 38 00.815731000 +0200 change 2019-08-05 15 38 00.815731000 +0200 birth - now you can either change the permissions of the folder or create the folder with root priviledges

57417627
folder	directory
to see the folder access rights you can use the stat command - stat var www the output should look like this file var www size 4096 blocks 0 io block 4096 directory device 2h 2d inode 1125899907242212 links 1 access 0755 drwxr-xr-x uid 0 root gid 0 root access 2019-08-05 15 38 01.883762500 +0200 modify 2019-08-05 15 38 00.815731000 +0200 change 2019-08-05 15 38 00.815731000 +0200 birth - now you can either change the permissions of the folder or create the folder with root priviledges
root priviledges sudo mkdir var www test or when inside var www use sudo mkdir test changing permissions to change permissions of a folder you use the command chown see help for more info the command requires root priviledges as well
syntax sudo chown uid gid folder example sudo chown hackxit users folder since your folder might have other folder inside you can add the -r option to change the permissions recursively

57417743
pull	push
this would require anyone who wants to merge code into master to do so via a pull request
did you commit and push those changes into origin master


57417790
migrate	downgrade

i can see two solutions 1 migrate your app to androidx
2 downgrade the library version most part of libraries are older than the androidx

57417852
google-chrome	firefox

the backdrop-filter css feature has finally shipped in google-chrome 76 since july 29ᵗʰ
unfortunately firefox is still working on firefox expected to be delivered in a q3 2019 release

57417906
switching	screens

what i recommend in this case is switching to a form and handling the submit event
that way not only can a form be submitted by the button by pressing enter but also by screens readers and other devices which understand forms

57418090
implements	extends

create basekointest that implements kointest interface and add the rule to this class
all the test classes that require koin can extends from this class

57418159
nsis	uninstaller

i ve been able to create a patch updater program for my windows app a cli which uses nsis as nsis installer by releasing the app to my personal cdn or some hosting platform and taking advantage of node.js modules like path to replace the binary using a similar procedure to equinox.io with a given version from the cdn and winreg to update the windows registry accordingly
since i ve namespaced my windows registry key the uninstaller still works for the uninstaller

57418449
folder	directory
you therefore need to write a test that verifies that after running the program the files in the excluded folder haven t been touched
those are features or behaviors of a program described at a high level can build a presentation without modifying the original files or can exclude a directory from processing
for those you need to write acceptance tests and robot framework is a good choice for writing those acceptance tests

57419297
crossover	mutation
individuals are simply lists of coordinate pairs a naive crossover can be implemented as a straightforward splice and join of two individuals
this is another random naive implementation this time for mutation
it s simply replacing coordinates randomly with new coordinates

57419325
post	get

the page does a post request for more results
you can do an initial request to get the total result count and a follow up post to get all results

57419513
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
google-chrome firefox safari etc are all going to tell you that env is valid
while only safari older versions support constant in place of env
now it s been deprecated

57419587
prop	each

the issue is quite sneaky when you pass a cell render prop to react-tables the issue ll be treated as a react component
meaning that they ll use like so  see and what this means is that at each render you ll create a new component rendereditable so when the display changes the old rendereditable is unmounted and the new one will take the display place

57419995
for-loop	loops
 tucked it in at the end of the first block of the for-loop but it sounds like you want it based on a condition but you can see how the goto function works so you can adjust how the goto function accordingly
i also changed your for loops to eliminate redundancies


57420723
factors	mean
- you may have the group with that id in your cache but that doesn t necessarily mean it should be returned by the field it may not be favorited
there s any number of factors other arguments execution context etc that might affect what nodes s are returned by a field


57420836
fflush	gets
that fflush method could be anything specific to how you write your records
instead of this being an abstract class the actual output to a database or file could be yet another dependency that gets injected into this one
you can make decisions like that refactor and change your mind because the very first class isn t affected by those changes

57420842
swift	objective-c
the swift way is to use string interpolation like so mylog the value is value also swift doesn t support preprocessor macros in the same way you re used to with objective-c
in swift you can only provide conditional compilation flags and you can only test for existence of those flags they cannot be assigned a value. in addition you cannot create these flags in code there is no #define
these flags must be sent into the compiler s command line ex -ddebug

57421180
integer	unsigned	integer	unsigned
from the laravel docs table- increments auto-incrementing unsigned integer primary key equivalent column
table- unsignedbiginteger unsigned bigint equivalent column
so in your case unsigned bigint unsigned integer

57421203
client-side	server-side	client-side	server-side
if you are building a solution that runs in a server-side context you should try to use components that have been made safe for unattended execution
or you should try to find alternatives that allow at least part of the code to run client-side
if you use an office application from a server-side solution the application will lack many of the necessary capabilities to run successfully

57421206
java.util.date	zoneddatetime
the java.util.date class is replaced by instant
the calendar class or rather its commonly used subclass gregoriancalendar is replaced by zoneddatetime
assuming your calendar object is really a gregoriancalendar underneath you can cast then convert

57421215
maven	pom.xml

the other option is to use in your javafx maven plugin like now regardless the jdk of your ide it will pick the one in that path
obviously this makes your pom.xml less portable

57421342
maven	pom.xml

there is a legacy plug-in for maven to generate intellij idea project files but we don t recommend using it
instead it would be easier to instruct users to open pom.xml file in the ide so that the import is performed automatically

57421404
intersect	contains

you can offset the geometries based on resolution the intersect test prevents effects like this on sharp angles for each each segment of the feature geometry the style function calculates parallel segments set to be 4 pixels apart regardless of the resolution in this case line width and spacing are the same for the styling geometries centered around the original segment if three colors the center style line would follow the original and the outer style lines are offset by + - 4 if two colors each lines would be offset by + - 2 initially the parallel segments are the same length as the original but need to be increased at outside angles or reduced at inside angles so math.intersect is used to find the point where they should join to form a continuous line
finally for each color the completed linestring is used as the geometry for the color s style and an array contains each style is returned

57421439
put	get
n this case we get the ihttpclientfactory and inject the ihttpclientfactory into mysink
if you put a breakpoint on the line when you step into that the ihttpclientfactory will call the lambda in addsingleton and create your logger for you


57421622
assemblyinfo	csproj

i was referencing android specific assembly code in my shared project s assemblyinfo file
i removed android specific assembly code in my shared project s assemblyinfo file and remove this itemgroup which was generated because of that code from my shared project s csproj file

57421985
postgresql	mysql

i was facing the similar issue while i was using postgresql in sails app
i found a workaround below npm install pg in your case install mysql plugin npm i mysql i have created dbconnections.js in the sails app controllers folder then in my other controllers i have used pg plugin to match with the user passed db env through api i.e in my other controller for your case you could follow this to create connection object and follow the below logic to dynamically connect to different dbs now client object will have all postgresql transactions which one could execute client.connect const qry select from person where city newyork

57421985
postgresql	mysql
i found a workaround below. npm install pg. in your case install mysql plugin npm i mysql i have created dbconnections.js in the sails app controllers folder then in my other controllers i have used postgresql plugin to match with the user passed db env through api i.e in my other controller for your case you could follow this to create connection object and follow the below logic to dynamically connect to different dbs now client object will have all postgresql transactions which one could execute client.connect const qry select from person where city newyork
client.query qry function err resp based on the use case we could move the above code to other js file and call in as many controller as we can and this would work with multiple for multiple db connections of postgresql sql in sails app


57422092
int	chars
here are again several creative forms of doing this have an end_of_sentence chars and detect where in the sentence an end_of_sentence chars is
have a branch of your model to calculate this number and round this number to int


57422267
free	malloc
n this case it is pretty clear that a dynamically allocated return value is desired based on the comment whether or not you like this style you will need to conform to it for this exercise since it is pretty clear that the caller will call free on the returned pointer and calling free on a pointer not originally returned by malloc is undefined behaviour and very likely to crash your program
you can free null but that s also a violation of the calling contract which will segfault when the caller tries to examine the non-existent return values c does let you return struct s by value but if you are going to return a struct you and the caller need to agree on the caller declaration the names of the caller members for example


57422283
countif	named	countif	named
lastly use list the pre-defined named as the source for your data validation as shown below
conclusion i think the above solution is probably not very practical especially when there is large volume of data however i enjoyed learning using small to locate a range of data conditionally and using countif to sort text value alphabetically
i also noticed the limitation of offset that it cannot be used for a dynamic range stored in a named as there is no valid starting cell or a range of cells

57422286
put	get

you want to put the values using googleapis with node.js
you have already been able to put and get values using sheets api

57422301
int	double

i used the following code to test a few offset from max here is the output for some numbers max - 0 18446744073709551616 max - 1023 18446744073709551616 max - 1024 18446744073709549568 max - 2047 18446744073709549568 max - 2048 18446744073709549568 max - 3070 18446744073709549568 max - 3071 18446744073709547520 added information yes it is expected that converting an int value will loose some precision if it required more bits that what is allowed by the mantissa of the floating point number
usually with double it is not a problem for usual application as one nee a number bigger than 2 53 9.007e15 to start losing precision when converting to an ieee 754 double

57422531
int	chars

when you cast a string to an int it tries to read a string as if it were a formatted number
but what you want to do is convert the first byte in the string like this caveats haven t compiled or tried this and also haven t investigated how many bytes per chars is returned from encoding.ascii.getstring

57422617
for-loop	loops

to answer the question of how do you add 1 element to an arrays with a for-loop this is an example of one way how you can do it
this would start to loops at index 0 and loops until the last index in the names arrays

57422641
int	boolean	int	boolean
for example when you enter 123 the python interpreter will scan the value and create an object of class int
same goes for boolean
classes like int str bool etc

57422764
range	minimum
if you want to use diameter mode you can use this formula doesn t take into account a minimum size because plotly always considers the minimum size to be 0 when the data is 0
you can t map an arbitrary range to size
the sizemin argument is a clipping argument meaning that any marker whose size would be lower than sizemin is rendered at sizemin the default value of max_size in plotly express is 20 and i ve found that values between 15 and 60 can look good depending on the data and the number of subplots etc

57423068
getter	setter
a getter is a method that gets the value of an instance variable
a setter is a method that sets it
because that makes visit generic

57423539
pull	push
origin is
false in hd1 s answer git pull -u does not exists
git push -u origin develop that last command would have establish a link between the local branch develop and the remote tracking branch origin develop

57423539
pull	push
git push -u origin develop that last command would have establish a link between the local branch develop and the remote tracking branch origin develop
git branch -u origin develop develop git checkout develop git pull


57423633
puma	unicorn

we also deal with this error here is we case change db type from int to bigint mysql table column id when id column exceeded maximum int value 2.1 billion - unsigned integer our app returned this error in some api restart puma server resolved puma server just this simple command puma server took we around 4 hours
if you are using unicorn or passenger 5 or any others for your web server try to restart puma server i think puma server can resolve your issue

57424607
button	checkbox

note but for multiple selections you shouldn t use radio button
go for checkbox

57424607
button	checkbox
go for checkbox
answer 2 issue in your code you re looping on the radio button
if you want some different text on before all radio buttons then you need to loop on a div which will contain the text and icons

57424621
folder	directory
hat way jekyll generates a basic project with empty folder and files
now start by creating your own layout in _layouts my-fancy-layout.html next add some content to your index.html and tell your index.html to use your layout this is your basic jekyll site with your custom layout further steps are reading about jekylls directory structure to learn where each file goes moving complex parts of your layout - like the head or a footer - in their own files in the _include directory and include their in all your layouts taking a look a the variables section of the documentation and use page.name and page.title in your layout by the way i created my personal website that way and my personal website works like a charm


57424768
maven	pom.xml
but it is working when time-out is added inside individual suite-file
result is same when i execute from testng.xml and maven test
i am using testng version 6.14.3 in my pom.xml below are suit files testng.xml suite1.xml suite2.xml testclasses test1.java test2.java test3.java test4.java

57425029
background-image	background-color

for the tests i have set the wrapping widget s background-image property
i also did another test with the background-color property instead

57425029
qpushbutton	qwidget	qapplication	qwidget
 connected the qpushbutton clicked signal to the qapplication quit slot in order to perform an action when we click on the area of the button
i redefined the paintevent method because the paintevent method is needed when using q_object macro alongside stylesheets over a custom qwidget as the documentation mentioned


57425173
scenekit	arkit
hen receiving data from other users integrate data from other users into your session using update with to send arbitrary information between users you can either send to send arbitrary information between users via multipeerconnectivity independently from arkit or use custom aranchors which is the preferred option when your dealing with positional data when a users has placed an object at a specific location
instead of adding objects directly by using something like scene.rootnode.addchildnode in scenekit you create a special aranchor subclass with all the information needed to add your model and add your model to your session then you add the object in the rendered _ didadd foranchor callback


57425316
int	chars
ut the result you re printing is truncated because of wrong format specifier c instead of d for instance if i enter with return aaa i get a value of a which depends on the endianness of the machine and the size of int but let s suppose s s 4 if i use x to print s s prints 0xa616161 which we recognize as linefeed plus 3 a chars reverted byte order because of the machine
if you want to scan an int from user input just use


57425342
libstdc++	libc++
in libstdc++ bits vector.tcc you have the specialization with the preprocessor branch enables the member function for c++11
in libc++ the standard library implementation within the llvm project it s different so here emplace_back is only defined with a standard beyond c++11
you cannot do much about it but i see two options

57425481
for-loop	loops
so what s between the two
is an expression that should evaluate to true in order for the for-loop to be ran
here you have so if i is 0 as you just declared it and vdata.length is greater than 0 loops will not run

57425896
int	chars
he first regexp removes anything not a chars the latter anything not a number to allow you to pad and piece back together
if x contains anything other than letters you ll need to adjust the first regexp good details can be found here - if the first regexp good details contains any int then this will not work


57426167
build.gradle	gradlew

sometimes duplicate classes exception means that one of your dependencies uses implicitly the older or newer with + version of some library you also use in your project to resolve this issue you may add such block of code put your library version after force to your build.gradle file module app you may also exclude some group from your dependencies
for a single dependency you way write tested to work on android studio with gradlew plugin version 3.4.2 and gradlew version 5.4.1

57426231
post	get

when you submit your second form you are making a post request to the url showlimit 123
since you are passing a parameter in an url to show something this should be a get mapping not a post one

57426231
post	get

this affects how your request is processed by the controller since post request parameters are expected in the body not the url
to pass this parameter to the controller use the following mapping and method and change the method in your form to get

57426356
inherited	properties

the ones that are grayed out could have an inherited value or is set by default from the parent
what you could do to edit or modify the ones that are grayed out is simple add a new line of style for the same properties

57426484
httpresponse	request
a django view is essentially a function that processes your request an httprequest object and returns an httpresponse object containing your html page or json document or whatever response is expected
so there can only be one view function processing your request
note that a class-based view in the end is also just a function the .as_view returns the classes dispatch method as a function

57426618
for-loop	loops
using break gives you more flexibility allowing you to terminate anywhere in the body of loops
for example sure sometimes you can put all the logic necessary into the for-loop declaration but that s not always the case
in those other cases break is a useful option to have

57426793
folder	directory
you re running the model in a dirty folder it contains results from previous attempts with a different model
delete your old checkpoints or change training directory


57427108
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
just need to calculate rect of the scene and set obviously using qgraphicsscene setscenerect method
otherwise position of my scene in the qgraphicsview may surprise


57427464
multiplying	subtract
if you re trying to compare 2 number values and sort according to them you can easily return the result of subtract the two numbers
you can also make the method shorter by making a small adjustment to how you handle the asc and desc flag then here multiplying by order simply reverses the sorting if it is -1

my.cnf	mysql.sock
mariadb_config is part of mariadb connector c the default build uses tmp mysql.sock for the socket file if not mariadb_unix_addr set mariadb_unix_addr tmp mysql.sock endif the libraries from mysql_config output were compiled with default socket located at var run mysqld while the libraries from mariadb_config where compiled with socket located in the tmp directory
there are several options to fix that 1 change the socket in your my.cnf file
this needs to be done in section but also in section to make sure that the client tools will work properly

post	get
fter some research it seems it was probably an if-match etag condition failure in the http get request
microsoft talk about how microsoft will return error 412 when this happens in this post regardless databricks seem to have resolved the issue on microsoft end now

client-side	server-side	client-side	server-side
if you are building a solution that runs in a server-side context you should try to use components that have been made safe for unattended execution
or you should try to find alternatives that allow at least part of the code to run client-side
if you use an office application from a server-side solution the application will lack many of the necessary capabilities to run successfully

ubuntu	linux

unfortunately the only way to get that working in the change openssl-dev lib on ubuntu with the newer one and recompile again
however i decide to get rid of ubuntu 14.04 in your infrastructure - speed the planned discount of ubuntu 14 and replace with amazon linux 2

versioning	upgrade

this error occurs with mysql connector j 8 versioning 8.0.11 or earlier and the never released mysql connector j 6 versioning
you need to upgrade to 8.0.12 or higher current latest versioning is 8.0.17 see

button	checkbox
so...build- batch build and activate the build checkbox in the release configuration
when you click the build button the exe with some dependencies will be generated
you can find this file on the debug folder of you project

57430187
ionic	angular
r this feature is not implemented in ionic4 ionic issues 19059 after comparing the ionic code for rendering a checkbox in an alert and any other input element i came to the sad conclusion that the feature you are looking for doesn t exist
at the moment it looks like handler on input in alerts is only supported for checkboxes and radio-inputs there was a pr for ionic3 that added the validators option to alertinputs to provide angular form validation but ionic3 not there anymore in ionic4

folder	directory
secondly you must to careful to run the cmake build stages in the proper location
we can run everything from within the build folder for example to generate the build system run cmake
from the build directory

jar	.war
the jar package is for running is you pc
for tomcat you need to send the .war file
you can simple change the packaging type in your pom.xml . usage - apache maven war plugin

57430936
hash	hmac
he following code implements hmac_sha1 but you can change it to use a different hash function by replacing the hash function and updating the block size
to verify try select to_hex hmac_sha1 my secret key hello world and compare to_hex hmac_sha1 to the hmac generated on


57431233
m2e	pom.xml
furthermore you should not use the maven-eclipse-plugin at all
when you use a recent eclipse m2e plugin in eclipse automatically handles .classpath
the only place you add edit dependencies is the pom.xml

57431304
kannel	opensmppbox
suppose we want all mt messages from esme internal-esme which is connected to opensmppbox to be sent to smsc-id external-smsc in bearerbox
to do this create the smsc-route group in etc kannel opensmppbox.conf now you need to add an allowing rule to smsc-id external-smsc which will mean messages that are defined with the smsc_id parameter and which match the specified ones are allowed to be sent
example in etc kannel kannel.conf now it is necessary to deny in the remaining channels smsc_id external-smsc so add to each remaining channel the allowed-smsc-id and denied-smsc-id parameters allow names to be enumerated with

wildfly	jboss

first of all wildfly has modular class loading structure
in wildfly doc since jboss 7 class loading is considerably different to previous versions of jboss

57431328
wildfly	jboss	wildfly	jboss
in wildfly doc since jboss 7 class loading is considerably different to previous versions of jboss
class loading is based on the jboss modules project
instead of the more familiar hierarchical class loading environment wildfly s class loading is based on modules that have to define explicit dependencies on other modules

57431489
folder	directory
it is takes the file name and path and if you don t give it a path it search for the file in the project root directory
it export the batch file s output in a batch_reports folder in your project folder you need to create that in advance


57431718
range	max	range	min
assuming l is sorted and all elements are positive and the second intervals all start with integers we can use this method i don t know if you want to see if there are any empty range
but the defaultdict prints out empty range if you want too
use this line instead of for a in sorted for a in range min my_ranges max my_ranges + 1 if you wanted the range 0-3 2-5 4-7 this works i suspect there are some details i ve forgotten but hopefully you can twiddle interval_width as need be to make sure my code is doing what you hoped and let me know what precisely you need

57431980
inherited	properties	inherited	properties
second you have to change the backing field type to be compatible with the properties type
in your case is not compatible with because the former does not inherited the later for historical reasons
but the and other collection classes implement both interfaces and since this is what you use to initialize the field simply use it as a field type with these two modifications in place the collection navigation properties will be correctly loaded by ef core

client-side	server-side	client-side	server-side
if you are building a solution that runs in a server-side context you should try to use components that have been made safe for unattended execution
or you should try to find alternatives that allow at least part of the code to run client-side
if you use an office application from a server-side solution the application will lack many of the necessary capabilities to run successfully

57432206
multiplication	modulo
thus for example note that the above function will fail if you pass an even number for p
on edit as user11908059 observed it is possible to dispense with multiplication by the modular inverse of 2
as an added benefit this approach no longer depends on the modulo being odd

57432541
leaflet	ggmap
the basemap functionality comes from leaflet package and is therefore available only in view mode
if you absolutely positively require a basemap in a static map which is a valid use case consider using a combination of ggplot2 and ggmap
2 your loading of nld_muni is needlesly complex

57432735
prometheus	metrics
yogesh s answer gave me the hint to have a look at exporters and i found the other half of the answer here
so on prometheus ui there is a list of exporters and their scraped endpoints status targets
if i call one of the endpoints the response contains a description and the type of each metrics offered by the endpoint

57433040
for-loop	loops

if the condition is true statements inside the second for-loop will be executed
the condition is true statements inside the second for-loop means the condition is true statements inside the second for-loop will execute from statement 1 to n in your case from a to z if the condition is false compiler will exit from second for-loop step 3 once it exit from second for-loop compiler will check for the condition inside the for-loop repeating step 1 here your outer loops variable ch will have the value b and so on a simple trick could be to intialize your ch2 variable outside loops and work with a simple loops

57433338
folder	dir
n the left side you will find pods folder
delete delete now in terminal go into your project dir cd into ios and do rm -rf pods podfile.lock


57433618
package.json	node-gyp
there is a difference between the two commands npm i -g node-gyp npm i node-argon2 npm i node-argon2 this one is installed in your app package
usually you have a package.json file which specifies these dependencies
so every time you deploy the command npm i will install all packages specified in package.json file

57433689
single-quotes	double-quotes
ou ll also need to escape some other special characters like included double-quotes which would end the string if not escaped
here i ve also switched to single-quotes around the reference in case it contains any special characters that d otherwise cause trouble although this will fail if it contains any single-quotes itself


57434366
children	parent
if you dynamically create dom elements go for handler association with the parent element and match children by id class element name etc
example in the below example when button 1 is clicked you see logs from 3 places button specific handler parent specific handler and parent general handler when button 2 is clicked you see logs from only 2 places parent specific handler and parent general handler

dplyr	purrr
with the _at variant you can use strings as arguments in almost every dplyr functions
purrr pmap_dbl is used to map calculation by rows


57434549
width	height

if i understand you correctly what you need to do is 1 this to calculate the width of the text lines
2 set a line height and line spacing 3 get label top frame position add each row of text height + spacing and see if it intercepts the uibutton s frame and in that case truncate the line if line is greater than label.minx position - button.minx position i have never done this myself

57434649
post	get
i ll borrow the accepted answer example to illustrate i oversimplified this i use instead of that answer s older methodology for the sake of illustration
if you use this as-is you ll find your server is probably interpreting the post body as a string and not actual parameters php won t show any variables
you must pass the form header in to get that and do that before http.send http.setrequestheader content-type application x-www-form-urlencoded

57434773
ssl	https

this api is accessible only by tls ssl
the code above works for apis hosted on an insecure http site but strava and most other apis nowadays force https

57434820
inherited	properties
when you inherited from identityuser don t define a key
identityuser already has a key properties
if you want that key to be an int instead of the default of a string there s a methodology to do that already

grafana	kibana

then we can have a tool like grafana to visualize the data
kibana has a built-in dashboard to visualize the cluster health

57435129
folder	directory
his folder is probably generated automatically by unity during build and i had this folder there for some stupid reason
actually having other language directory do not conflict


57435164
dictionary	map

thierrylathuille s answer works only if there are no duplicates in the input list since the answer relies on a dictionary with the list values as keys
if there can be duplicates in the list you should sort the items in the input list with their indices generated by enumerate and map their indices generated by enumerate to their indices generated by enumerate sorted positions instead mapping becomes so that you can then iterate an index over the length of the list to obtain the sorted positions in order which returns

57435433
width	height

if your coordinates are bottom x left your actual gettoprightpoint implementation returns bottom + width
left + height that will be actually outside the object bounds

57435814
put	get
lso since the main container process is what you ve put into this jar every time main completes the container will be restarted
if you re actively developing this i d suggest first trying to get the application work in a non-docker context then packaging i d up


57435865
associativity	operator-precedence
note that the associativity is meaningful for member access operators even though they are grouped with unary postfix operators a.b++ is parsed a.b ++ and not a. b++
operator-precedence is unaffected by operator overloading
for example parses as because the precedence of arithmetic left shift is higher than the conditional operator

57435918
try-catch	exception-handling
 tried to reproduce the exception-handling with different video file formats and out of the following video formats avi mpg mpeg mov mov mp4 m4v flv wmv i noticed that avi mpg mpeg and wmv threw an exception-handling for me every time
better to exclude them before running the method and wrap the method with a try-catch


57436035
scikit-learn	xgboost

i would use scikit-learn s train_test_split which also has a stratify parameter and then put the results into dtrain and dtest
see implementation here a simple xgboost tutorial using the iris dataset

57436073
bash	subshell

unfortunately with bash at least it is not easy to set these options locally
if you don t want to set these options globally the most straightforward solution is to use the function in this more convoluted manner if you want to recover the lightweight syntax or if you really want to avoid spawning a subshell you may hack something along the lines of as a bonus this function is of a more general use

57436181
int	chars

don t use strings in contexts where masm expects a 16-bit or larger int
masm will convert them to integers in a way that reverses the order of chars when stored in memory

57436181
int	chars
ssemblers are inconsistent on how assemblers convert string literals into int
a similar problem occurs in how c compilers convert chars literals like abcd into integers scasd and movsd aren t special nothing special happens with the scasd or movsd instrucitons


57436197
children	parent
hey are children of the div
they are absolutely positioned so they are going to orientate towards the nearest parent that is positioned relatively


57436313
put	get
hether or not this exception will actually get thrown is dependent on what happens during the execution of your java code the method is just letting you know the method could happen and that you should handle this exception in some way
one way to handle the exception is to put this exception inside a try catch block so if the exception gets thrown the program will still continue and the code inside the catch block will execute


57436381
rbenv	homebrew	rbenv	homebrew
instead install rbenv to set up a managed ruby environment that can use any appropriate software version
if you haven t already installed homebrew do that first by running from a terminal
next install rbenv by running brew install rbenv ruby-build

57436512
maven	pom.xml

intellij idea stores generated project files externally for maven or gradle based projects
you should never edit intellij idea stores manually or adjust any content roots and source roots via the interface as intellij idea stores are managed by the build system configuration pom.xml in your case

57436584
setcontentview	findviewbyid

please uncomment setcontentview r.layout.activity_main from your activity
in kotlin you do not need to explicitly call findviewbyid

57436720
int	double

a stdgen isn t an int
it s actually a pair of 32-bit integers but that s an implementation detail what you re looking for is the function which accepts an int seed and creates a valid stdgen oh and the meaning of the error message is that ghc can ghc find a num instance for stdgen that would allow it to convert the literal 3456 directly to a stdgen the way 3456 can be converted directly to a double int int etc

57436742
range	minimum

i think you re looking for setlimits to constrain the view range
you can set the minimum maximum range for the x and y axis using xmin xmax ymin and ymax for instance with and with

57436948
super	self

per jonrsharpe s note i corrected the inhertance invocation to super
init self

57437351
zoo	lubridate
zoo ymd is useful to convert strings of the time 1999-10-22 to a date object
lubridate setdiff is useful to deal with time differences between dates
i recommend you to learn how to deal with date objects and explore both libraries with little examples converting dates seting time differences suming days to reference dates etc

57437382
swift	objective-c
you can only use a swift extension in objective-c if the swift extension is on something that is a class in objective-c
in short there is no way you can use your somefunction in your cgimage extension in your objective-c code


57437502
post	get

for post you should use data instead of params
use params for get

57437921
versioning	upgrade
the following command updates only pip not virtual env python -m pip install --upgrade pip if you think you still need to upgrade virtualenv of course if a new versioning is available
please follow the following syntax without specifying a versioning


57437938
width	height

if you set the width to 50 it will jump down to the second line
it will be even broad as the first element but two times height

57438093
fast-forward	merge
this is because merging bug1 into feature1 in this case produces the same git tree as just bug1 since it s equivalent to a fast-forward just that you indicated you didn t want one
you re essentially creating a merge where one side is unchanged and the other is changed in which case git takes all of the changed components
if there have been additional commits to feature1 that are not included in bug1 then obviously they are not equivalent

57438202
width	margin

instead of width 800px
you can use margin like this or this where the first number sets top and bottom margins and the second number sets the left and right margins

57438399
apktool	zipalign	apktool	jarsigner

apktool d apk_path -o output_folder open the apktool.yml text file alter the versioncode and versionname entries now rebuild
apktool build output_folder next you need to re-sign the apk with the original keystore file jarsigner -verbose -keystore keystore_path -storepass keystore_password -keypass keystore_key_password apk_path keystore_key_name android-sdk build-tools 21.1.1 zipalign -v 4 apk_path apk_out_path

57438427
put	get

remember to put your actual app name in there
the echoes just add a little breathing room to the output then you just have to do something like the script will pass the sqlite command through tack on the semi-colon pretty print the sqlite command with column names and you can use the up arrow to get your last command

57438589
versioning	upgrade
it provides the service which is the proper way to work with cookies within an angularjs application
i ve combined your html and javascript into this snippet which works exactly as i think you re expecting i ll point out that the api changed in versioning 1.4 they added getter and setter
just be aware of that if you decide to upgrade your angularjs versioning at some point in the future

57438944
hide	show

you could instead allow both buttons to be sent to the client but initially hide one from view with css
then in your javascript you can show or hide both buttons as you make changes

57439081
for-loop	loops
you ve essentially manually written a for-loop
you set the starting counter value run loops and then increment your counter
here s the approach i d suggest you ll have to be careful with the comparisons however

57439148
for-loop	loops

you have to parse this.datas in required format so that you can use this.datas in for-loop
the below function getcity recursively loops and finds city value so on ngoninit lifecycle method parse this.datas

57439184
for-loop	arrays

just change the line to and also update the for-loop
your method returns a comparable arrays so you cant downcast to an integer arrays but since the implementation of your numbers are integers your numbers are still treated as such during runtime

57439397
opera	google-chrome
to force a certain icc profile in google-chrome you can pate this into the address bar google-chrome flags #force-color-profile nevertheless many mobile browsers are still not color managed color management uses a lot of processor resources
the wide wide world of gamuts i am answering this old question because i want to address something else if you are using a standard srgb monitor and your color managed browser does not match an srgb image displayed in a non-color managed browser such as older opera then your monitor is way out of adjustment or does not meet srgb
if you are using a wider gamut monitor this is to be expected

57439524
versioning	upgrade
these are not supported
the minimum supported versioning of tcl is 8.5 which is currently on long-term critical-bug-fix only grade support and 8.6 is the recommended minimum for new work
the formal advice is upgrade even if this is impossible for you

57439524
versioning	upgrade
the formal advice is upgrade even if this is impossible for you
you cannot nest those except in a few ancient versioning where it was possible via a bug so you need to find a different approach
the simplest method might be to use one array that holds the name of another array

57439529
realloc	malloc

there are at least 3 considerations that make it difficult or impossible to implement realloc entirely in userland c
interacting with the same data structures that malloc and free use

57439529
free	realloc	free	malloc
interacting with the same data structures that malloc and free use
malloc and realloc are required to return storage that is suitably aligned for any object
until c11 we have not had all the necessary macros to calculate this alignment 100 portably

57439584
for-loop	loops

you have used a for-loop in the fetch foods function inside which is the callback function
so for each loops iteration the callback gets called again and the browser has to send a response again

57439894
submit	submission
since you have a button in your link and it is the first button in the form your form decides that this is the button that will execute on form submission
thus ignoring your actual submit button on the bottom
you can workaround this by giving the button in the link tag a type of button as you suggested

57440043
ssl	https
the reason i m skeptical is bacuse the whole idea of appgateway is to look into traffic and provide protection by doing that
and the only way to d othat is to terminate ssl connection at appgateway level
see here for more information there are two modes for appgateway ssl temination when appgateway makes http not https calls to backend and ssl end-to-end when appgateway uses own ssl certificate to connect to bakend

57440245
ubuntu	linux
y azure pipeline was running on a ubuntu virtual machine
i think something with all the paths need to change in order to make my azure pipeline work on linux


57440839
sikuli	selenium
selenium only support web based application
but you can use sikuli to handle above scenario


57441229
metaspace	permgen
the original metaspace earlier called permgen had 80mb and this grew to 125 as the application chugged
once redeployed intead of returning to 80mb the metaspace on the visualvm profiler showed 170mb in the next redeployment showed 210
this clearly indicated that after another dozen redeployments this is a test server the jvm would run out of ram space to allocation and throw a heap memory

57441361
onchange	onblur
answer now on client side after the input field is filled and then user moves on next input field using javascript event may be onblur make sure check field value is not empty do an ajax call using api created above and whatever response received you can add alert on the page using any dom manipulation library jquery or you can use javascript itself
i would suggest not to use onchange event or on from jquery since this may lead to multiple ajax call for unintended user input


57441599
int	chars
the actual return type is int signed 4-byte binary number to allow for a special -1 value meaning end-of-stream
a java chars is a utf-16 encoded unicode chars
this means that all chars from the basic multilingual plane will appear unencoded the chars value is the unicode value

57441801
for-loop	loops

you are declaring an integer series with this int series has a scope of the elements inside the for-loop
same a possible fix for this is to set the value of series before loops you should always compile your code with -wall to catch such errors

57441809
width	height
checking width resp
height will have the elements fill the available space horizontally resp
vertically

57441886
memcpy	strcpy
use the memcpy function to copy data
in case of character sequences you can also use strcpy


57442052
folder	directory
he scheduled task executing the batch file must be configured to use the account which has the necessary permissions to access all network resources and local directory files which are accessed by the batch file
and it is additionally necessary to access files and folder on a network resource with files and folder unc paths instead of using drive letter k of network drive not existing on execution of the batch file in this environment


57442304
client-side	server-side
to be clear in other words the data is being corrupted server-side and all non-ascii fitting characters there will likely be squashed to the replacement character
no amount of fiddling on your client-side code can fix that


57442419
for-loop	loops

plus you probably have the for-loop error mentioned in the comments above try or instead of
edit seems the vector starts this loops at size zero

57442523
super	extends

for the line the output is null 2 b 2 because the instance fields in your class are not initialized until the implicit super is finished running
in this case since class b is extends your class a the b constructor will implicitly call the super class no-arg constructor a through super where the foo method is called

57442523
super	extends
in this case since class b is extends the class a the b constructor will implicitly call the super class no-arg constructor a through super where the foo method is called
the overriden foo of class b is called and as the foo is overriden in class b now since the super is not yet finished the instance fields of class b is not initialized and is null
so you see the first null 2

57442930
ubuntu	linux

the play below probably does the job that you described i ve tested the job that you described i in ubuntu 18.04 with the data below
the job that you described i should not be a problem to fit the data to any other linux it seemed like a good idea for a simple role

57443240
free	calloc
from the description of the function calloc c11 standard 3 the calloc function returns either a null pointer or a pointer to the allocated space
you may call free for a null-pointer though this does not have an effect
on the other hand you may require a memory of zero size

57443527
folder	directory
this will open your user profile directory c users yourusername
rename the existing desktop folder to something like desktop-old
then go into the onedrive folder right-click the desktop folder there and then select always keep on this device

57443609
prop	each
f layout is a page component gatsby will pass layout is a location prop
you can extract location.pathname apply your logic there if layout is not a page component you can import the hoc location from reach router or simply pass the location props from a gatsby page component to this component from each page


57443881
folder	dir
dir
this trick with call avoids usage of delayed expansion to process also redtag folder correct containing one or more
in folder path

57444310
client-side	server-side
the difference however is added asp.net core hosting and web api and a shared project for common application logic
the template includes three projects a client-side blazor application blazor.client an asp.net core server application blazor.server and a shared .net standard project for common application logic blazor.shared
the blazor server-side project template takes a significantly different approach to how a blazor application is delivered and interacts with the browser

57444770
versioning	upgrade

unfortunately it does not look like there will be a higher versioning than php 7.0 for raspberrys with stretch
here you can see the php versions for current and future raspbian releases searchon names keywords php you will have to upgrade to buster then you will get php 7.3

57445133
hide	show
a function that takes the index of the div.news to be show has the show hide functionalities even the class manipulation for the dots
a class active is used to show a slide div.news so no longer .style.display are used
technically no explicit loops are used no for loops in other words all the looping is done threw the built-in foreach map find and findindex methods

57445188
subtraction	add
we need to add an additional dimension to d and a to satisfy rules of broadcasting
after that just do calculation and sum them along axis 1 step by step increase dimension d from 1d to 2d at axis 0 doing the same for a but at axis 1 on subtraction numpy broadcasting kicks in to broadcast each array to compatible dimension and does subtraction to create 2d array result next it is just element-wise square and subtraction and square
lastly sum alongs axis 1 to get the final output you may read docs on numpy broadcasting here to get more info

57445417
free	realloc

when you call malloc or calloc and the call returns null that means that nothing has been allocated so nothing has to be free and there s no memory leak
the case you have to worry about concerns realloc if realloc returns null then oldp still points to the old memory if any

57445531
post	get

the routes should be post method
as your are hitting a post method type api and you have get method configured express cannot find the signature and return 404

57445728
google-chrome	firefox
not all browsers support this yet just firefox at time of writing
the bug tracker page for adding it to google-chrome is here but this should soon be something you can do with something like column-gap 10px or whatever size you want


57446079
typedef	struct

approach also works it appears that for the current use-case the inner typedef allocator_type is enough to signal that mystruct supports allocator-construction making the specialization of redundant
full listing live on coliru invoking it three times db has 3 elements one two three db has 6 elements one two three one two three db has 9 elements one two three one two three one two three update more complicated in response to the comments let s make s more complicated in two ways the struct constructor will take various arguments initializing various members some of which will use an allocator

for-loop	arrays

you can use the good old for-loop and a little help from the inbuilt array.prototype.some function
you first iterate through each object in the arrays to use the arrays as argument or in this case - search key for the some function

57446214
for-loop	arrays
the advantage of the some function is that when a match is found the iteration through the arrays halts immediately and returns true
we can then use this condition to terminate the outer for-loop

versioning	upgrade

the only thing i can see is you may be using an ancient versioning of unity before unity 5.5 the only members of linerenderer containing position in their name are setposition and setpositions see the legacy doc of 5.4
although i would find it surprising if you were to be on such a versioning it would be in your best interest to upgrade asap as possible

57446617
bids	ssis	bids	ssas
a couple of years ago i made the mistake of upgrading my visual studio from the 2012 bids to visual studio 2015 for sql server 2012
it caused all types of odd behavior with ssis and ssas not to mention any ssrs report i opened would fail when re-deployed to our server
i even tried editing the xml of files directly to correct but that was an exercise in futility

57446663
shadowing	named
aside it s probably not a good idea to use the named attr for an interface because there is already a type in global scope named attr which will either be a named collision or a named shadowing neither of which are particularly pleasant to deal with
i will change the named to myattr from here on
when you construct a you need to pass in a constructor of t objects that you can call with a myattr parameter and the needs to hold onto that constructor to use inside the fetch method implementation

57446744
put	get
but when you do need to put a 0 in a register like add addu and and or with all have a zero in the first byte so that s a problem
you d think you could get 2 just by adding 1 to itself or left-shifting but those all have a 00 as the first byte of the instruction
the first 6 bits are 0 from the opcode and the low 2 bits of the top byte are 0 from the register number of the first source operand

57446804
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc
and the size of the pointer to be re-allocated into the register rdi
the line 4 is a call to the realloc glibc function
here pointer ptr must have been allocated previously by malloc calloc in this case and realloc functions

57446804
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc
ere pointer ptr must have been allocated previously by malloc calloc in this case and realloc functions
in the last line rax contains pointer to the new memory region returned by realloc which is assigned to the pointer ptr notice rbp-0x8 is the location of pointer on the stack


57446804
free	malloc
his function has a lot checks like to check if the pointer is null if so treat the pointer as a simple malloc function to check if the bytes are 0 if so treat the pointer as a free etc
we are interested in the following lines the pointer means that the all the information is being kept internally in the malloc program headers as pointed out previously by sirdarius in the comments every pointer and the size associated with the pointer


57446843
children	parent
this way all it s children that is absolute positioned is relative to this element
absolute positioned elements will always be relative to the closest parent that has a position of relative
if there is none it will default to the boundaries of your browser

57446870
background-image	background-position
background-position center
background-image url s
bg_image

57446923
java.util.date	simpledateformat
java.time the terrible date-time classes in java such as simpledateformat date and timestamp were supplanted years ago by the modern java.time classes
both java.util.date and java.sql.timestamp were replaced by java.time.instant and by java.time.offsetdatetime for jdbc work
unfortunately it seems that firestore has not yet been updated to java.time

57447006
for-loop	arrays

you are using a foreach loops not a for-loop
if this were a for-loop like this then yes you can use i as an arrays index

57447006
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
if this were a for-loop like this then yes you can use i as an arrays index
but in a foreach loops loops variable represents an item of the arrays so your loops should be written like this


57447088
versioning	upgrade

you might be using the older versioning of scipy with the latest versioning of python
you should upgrade scipy to solve the problem by typing below command line

57447178
for-loop	arrays
for-loop if you want to access element from an arrays by index then use for-loop
foreach loops instead of using index you want to iterate through each object then use foreach loops to solve your problem use for-loop or foreach loops you are mixing both loops into one
solution using for-loop solution using foreach loops

57447296
getter	setter
if you expand the object in the console you ll still be able to access the underlying value
the value isn t shown automatically because calling the getter could have side-effects
as far as your other code is concerned you don t need to worry about the getter and setter just use the objects like you normally would

57448246
int	chars

parseint docs say parses the string argument as a signed decimal int
the chars in the string must all be decimal digits except that the first chars may be an ascii minus sign - u002d to indicate a negative value or an ascii plus sign + u002b to indicate a positive value

57448246
int	chars
the chars in the string must all be decimal digits except that the first chars may be an ascii minus sign - u002d to indicate a negative value or an ascii plus sign + u002b to indicate a positive value
the resulting int value is returned exactly as if the argument and the radix 10 were given as arguments to the parseint java.lang.string int method. you can use the try catch syntax for check this


57448746
point-in-polygon	convex
f i got this right this is a point in polygon problem which has well known solutions for either convex or non-convex polygons since you did not specify that
some links are provided below a few notes i don t think you would need this but you may speed up a little you code by first applying your algorithm to get a smaller set of candidate polygons and then apply the point-in-polygon algorithm on this reduced set


57449168
post	get

i did not find any post or comments mentioning this before but this is what happened in my case
a simple workaround could be to pass the user id back to the frontend in a get request store the frontend and send the frontend on post requests as an extra param

57449354
bash	subshell
export flags and your function and run it in a subshell
handle bash error value


57449371
udp	tcp
here isn t equivalent delay buffering mechanism for udp
you haven t said which protocol you re using but if t is tcp you probably don t need to do anything


57449698
width	height
you need to know the image width and height ratio
set the height of the container to 0 and set the padding-top as percentage based upon the image ratio
it will look like the following

57449724
x86	64bit

make sure the data source odbc dsn is set up correctly and matches the bitness x86 or x64 of the crystal runtime used by the app
for example a 32-bit dsn can t be used for a 64bit app

57449801
hide	show
nd in similar way make class display-sm that show element on mobile and hide it on desktop
apply display-lg on grid layout that is to be show on desktop and display-sm on grid layout that is to be show on mobile this approach may seems you long and redundant but this approach provides you liberty to add more mobile specific changes in your layout in future


57450074
folder	dir

open shell in repo folder then install and activate virtual env use symlink to correct python binary for python 3.6+ python3 -m venv lenv source lenv bin activate need to install node to build static just install python package nodeenv pip install nodeenv nodeenv is similar to virtualenv but for managing node
next make node virtual env with nodeenv placing managing node in a nodeenv dir nodeenv lnenv activate node virtual env source lnenv bin activate cd superset assets npm ci install webpack globally globally in this case means node virtual env source lnenv bin activate cd superset assets npm ci install webpack globally globally in this case will go into nodeenv s virtual folder npm install -g webpack webpack-cli npm run build finally build should complete and the files should be placed in superset assets dist

57450727
int	chars

in manual the string in php is implemented as an array of bytes and an int indicating the length of the buffer
it has no information about how those bytes translate to chars leaving that task to the programmer

57450780
hide	show

the changes needed are these - we need to add code to hide menu whenever user clicks outside.
add code to block event bubbling whenever a link is clicked because we need to show the menu on link click for that we just need to pass event into overlay function and add event.stoppropagation .

57450872
folder	directory

then install the required python packages into the same folder
you can do it using the following command this installs the required packages into the specified directory

57451022
for-loop	loops
a simple loops in any of the varied forms it can take is
here s the for-loop version


57451218
org.json	jackson
i know it s an ugly solution but at least you don t need to paste someone s gist in your project
add org.json to your project dependencies
and then do the following the conversion goes as follows xml - jsonobject using org.json - string - jsonnode using readtree of course tojsonobject handles duplicates without any problems i suggest to avoid using jackson and readtree if you can

57451318
fflush	gets

first i would recommend using mpi_win_fence for synchronisation rather than mpi_barrier - this ensures synchronisation in time like barrier but also ensures all operations on the window are visible writes should be fflush to memory
if you use mpi_win_allocate_shared then you automatically achieve what you want - each rank gets a pointer to you use mpi_win_allocate_shared local section

57451370
width	height
you can use vw for viewport width and vh for viewport height
example if you want to have an element with width same as the viewport then style the element like this


57451727
prepare	pdostatement
use different variable for the insert statements
the insert statement has four parameter placeholders in prepare but only three values in execute
use pdostatement fetchcolumn to return one column in a row

57451934
implements	extends
hat you can do however is create an interface ishuntable implements by the required animals you want to hunt and you use that as a type for your method instead of the generic type bound
another maybe less elegant solution is to create another level in your hierarchy called monkeys for example which extends from ape having all the animals extends from ape and you use that monkey type for your method


57452005
children	parent

you should not use match_parent for views which are children of constraintlayout as stated in the documentation important match_parent is not recommended for widgets contained in a constraintlayout
similar behavior can be defined by using match_constraint with the corresponding left right or top bottom constraints being set to parent

57452024
keras	word2vec
it doesn t use word2vec but results in a competing solution
here is a walk-through with tfhub and keras


57452094
for-loop	loops

but by now we ve basically got a while loops anyway this explains loops you saw
the variable i already had the value this needed from code up above so there was no reason to set this in the for-loop header

57452105
for-loop	loops
ny of the clauses of the for-loop can be empty the initial clause may not be needed the test clause can be empty causing an infinite loops that ends either via a break or a return statement or via a direct or indirect call to exit
the test clause can contain any update expression or nothing if the code already updates the required variables in the body of loops if any update is needed at all


57452188
for-loop	arrays
therefore before merging the cells auto filter should be applied one by one using a dynamic arrays
then a for-loop can be applied for each filtered result to paste it separately in ppt slide


57452550
for-loop	loops

you ll want to use a function like this what a function like this does is that a function like this checks if the value occurs within the list 4 or more times using a for-loop and if statements
the way you would use a function like this within your while loops would be like this note that i also added at the end because a function like this was going to end up in a infinite loops

57452839
multiplication	dot-product
umpy implements the blas specification basic linear algebra subprograms numpy are the de facto standard for low-level routines like matrix multiplication for linear algebra libraries
to get the dot-product of two matrices say a and b you can use the following code


57452943
folder	directory
o have it readily configured for your coworkers check in the wrapper to your version control system namely the two files gradle-wrapper.properties and gradle-wrapper.jar in the directory yourproject gradle wrapper
if until now you executed gradle using the command line gradle arguments now to use the wrapper you ll execute  gradlew arguments with the same arguments inside your project folder


57453323
integer	unsigned

the integer overflowed as the max value of a 32-bit integer is 2 147 483 647
converting to unsigned int works printf u unsigned int 2555555555.f

57453551
multiplying	multiplication
this code should be otherwise you ll get this error typeerror can t multiplying sequence by non-int of type float the reason is your code is multiplying a string by a number
you need first to convert the string returned by input to a number and then do the multiplication


57453569
dictionary	map

also the code assumes the only types of nested arrays are arrays of dictionary
for the array this function can be used with map

57453585
lxml	html5lib
ip install lxml flavor str or none container of strings the parsing engine to use
bs4 and html5lib are synonymous with each other bs4 and html5lib are both there for backwards compatibility


57453879
put	get
data is unavailable on android q and higher unreliable on prior versions of android may point to a file that you do not have rights to access in terms of eventually using these images get the _id column from your cursor pass that to contenturis.withappendedid along with your root uri media.external_content_uri contenturis.withappendedid gives you a uri that you can use with your favorite image-loading library to display the image
in terms of your filtering logic include mediastore.image.media.relative_path in your query examine that column to see if it references your name using the same algorithm that you used when you put the image into the mediastore in the first place


57453925
client-side	server-side

you used a client-side application that requires the users to login to access your google analytics data
you should use a service application that allows your app to login and access your google analytics data server-side

57454088
subtraction	add

there might be simpler ways to implement a signed or unsigned comparator than doing subtraction at all
but if you already have an add subtract alu and want to piggyback on that then you might just want an add subtract alu to generate carry and signed-less-than outputs as well as zero

57454124
equals	tostring
which is now invoking the equals method on your people class if you defined one or object#equals if you did not
eclipse is printing out the tostring method after your test fails to give you details of the error which is unfortunately confusing in this scenario


57454184
children	parent
you would then place this path under or above depending on how you want to do this the text within the same parent
here s an example note using javafx 12.0.2 for whatever reason i couldn t get this to work with a pane as the root the children were positioned just out of sight at the top
to work around that i used a stackpane which is why the path has setmanaged false and has its translate properties bound to the layout properties of the text node

onclicklistener	onitemclicklistener
create interface as following - now set a onclicklistener on every item in onbindviewholder . and call listener.onclicked uris.get i i
don t forget to initialize listener object of onitemclicklistener
simplest way is doing it in constructor

57455523
put	get
he solution to this may be to add a stretched rectangle under your treeview with transparent filling just so a control could be under your cursor and then you should get back your valid drop area
edit if it doesn t want to work try to put a stretched rectangle under your treeview before this part in the template and since the basic window template uses adornerdecorator the basic window template s worth a shot to include in the basic window template too where needed


57455596
for-loop	loops

for-loop runs until it has exhausted all the elements in the list
so a clever way to turn it into a while loops is to mutate the list in every line that way you never run out of elements

57455779
super	implements
e pass props into the super method only when we need to use props inside the constructor
the reason why props implements this behaviour is unclear probably for future compatibility reasons as robin pokorny replied to the below question


57455826
inherited	subclassing
changing inherited to fixes the problem
as the documentation says this strategy is a strategy in which fields that are specific to a subclassing are mapped to a separate table than the fields that are common to the parent class and a join is performed to instantiate the subclassing


57455894
folder	directory

dropbox uses move api to rename file folder you can find accurate function api call on official dropbox dev
docs http dot-net sdk movev2async update the from-path to-path value with your updated values it will rename helloworld.txt to foo.txt in path directory

57455929
csv	tsv
in the following i ve assumed the input is actually csv comma-separated values and that splitting by the regex will suffice
if the input is more complex then it would probably be simplest to convert it to some more regular format tsv
invocation it s simplest to illustrate usage from the command line

ada	pascal
this is because c++ evolved horribly over the decades with not much thought to compiler consiquences for it s complex context determined macros and to some degree the so called .hpp hell
ada has similar issues
delphi dialect of pascal was designed from the ground up to be an efficient language to compile

57457168
versioning	upgrade
like you said there s hardly any information on how to upgrade the older rails versioning so the official releases page is your best bet
i d upgrade to each release individually so from 1.1.2 to 1.2.0 then to 1.2.6
then go to 2.0 2.1 etc

57457200
prop	each
it works correctly in both ways by specifying comparator functions in html templates and in typescript files
the issue i see in your code is that you did not set prop attribute on any ngx column
try setting it for each individual column

57457280

to solve bootstrap4 for bootstrap4 official website link or use the easy installation feature in python pip install django-bootstrap4


57457313
width	margin

solution 1 you can set width of the image to change with respect to viewport width and also set the desired max-width of the image for larger screens
set display to block and left and right margin to auto to display your image in the center horizontally

57457416
migrate	upgrade	versioning	upgrade

steps help to migrate change the rails versioning rails 1.1.x to rails 2.0 manually means in vendor folder
run the test case and fix the failing syntax in your code if any then migrate rails 2.0 to rails 2.higher versioning make sure higher than rails 2.3 again run the test case and fix the failing syntax in your code if any then migrate rails 2.x to rails 3 pre versioning now you can add gemfile put all gems into that upgrade your bundler gem

ssl	https

i solved the above problem by dirctly importing the .crt file to java keystore for importing into java keystore keytool -trustcacerts -keystore jdk jre lib security cacerts -storepass changeit -importcert -alias testalias -file opt ssl test.crt by using above command the server certificate will be valdated and connection will be achived but if you want to create new keystore and import .crt to it means use the below command it will create the keystore of type .jks
for creating keystore and import .crt keytool -import -alias testalias -file test.crt -keypass keypass -keystore test.jks -storepass test 123 here keystore password test 123 keypass keypass as some code will validate and if you are using wss https it will ask for keystore truststore configuration then you can use above configuration mentioned in step2 creating keystore and import .crt

draggable	droppable

for drag and drop option you can use draggable js maintained by shopify
draggable documentation droppable documentation

57457964
width	height

you could use the flexbox columns to send the overflowing items to another column and set the width to the width of the container to hide the overflowing items if you want to achieve this by plain flexbox css properties like you mentioned in the question
the only difference is that you won t be seeing the yellow background of the gridcontainer but you can set the yellow background of the gridcontainer in the enclosing div like in the picture below but it will adapt to the height of the child divs.

57458056
put	get
this works across the internet as well get the mic device id arrecord -l streams to port 8080

57458063
filtering	grouping
et s start by telling git that we want to run the gui.cfg file through a filtering called undocamerawindowsize by adding this line to .gitattributes then we implement the undocamerawindowsize filtering and tell git that we want to run it before the gui.cfg file is staged by defining it as a clean filtering here we re using sed to run a regular expression and replace the matching text with another string
the command itself is notice how we re using a capturing grouping to match the camera number which we then reference in the replacement string with 1


57458606
maven	pom.xml

you trace shows that you use liquibase-maven-plugin to execute clearchecksums goal the jdbc url in application-dev.yml is read only by your java application not by maven liquibase plugin
you must configure maven liquibase plugin also in pom.xml in the url property of liquibase-maven-plugin

57458694
post	put	put	get
these are the options according to the docs so you could use from what i ve been researching you could then put the image into firebase storage using storageref.putstring your base64 string substring variable base64
i m not sure if this is enough to get you fixed up but i thought i would post what i had found anyway


57458755
hide	show

first off using on error resume next is one of the worst lines of code one could write in vba since it only hide errors
it doesn t show you what is wrong with your code or perhaps your assumption in your code are wrong

57458952
vim	kate

according to the issue on there sourceforge tracker website there is currently no way to add vim keybindings to texstudio
you can use other vi supported ide such as vim-latex or kile which uses kate as editor

57459265
maven	pom.xml
you can then navigate into the directory that has the pom.xml
and finally execute the maven command


57459365
typedef	struct
in the second example you make a typedef saying that the boo declaration is now the same as your struct so you can create variables using that boo afterwards
in this case no variable is created at the time of the struct declaration


57459461
strncmp	strcmp
strcmp will compare all characters in your strings until a terminating null-character is reached or characters differ
strncmp will only compare the first n values in both strings
also you should add break after printf bye to leave the loop

57459515
hide	show
our pdf related stuff is done too quickly promise resolves and loader hide so your pdf related stuff works as follows show loader creating pdf took several milliseconds hide loader when you use settimeout you put off the promise resolving for 8 seconds
so loader is show for 8 seconds


57459763
int	chars

this is due to endianness and different int and string encodings
you should not treat chars as integers

57459807
google-chrome	firefox
while google-chrome and edge were asking for absolute positioning and left 0 for .optgroup before .optminus before classes
and content for .optgroup before and .optplus before classes firefox was asking something different
below is the full css

57459889
maven	pom.xml
the analysis itself is complicated and has different depths so i guess that calling clean alone will not make maven analyse the dependencies but calling clean install does so
note that the analysis of the pom.xml only happens once not again for every goal phase
generally your approach cannot be recommended

57460344
versioning	upgrade
see there are several issues with consuming .net standard libraries that were built for those versioning from .net framework 4.6.1 projects
for .net framework projects that need to use such libraries we recommend that you upgrade the project to target .net framework 4.7.2 or higher
actually referencing to an assembly that targets .net standard 2.0 in .net framework 4.7.2 projects and higher is the official recommended way

57460379
folder	directory
for example to tmp or var www .

solution create directory sudo mkdir var www your_project sudo chown your_user www-data var www your_project modify your_project.ini modify nginx server block uwsgi_pass unix var www your_project your_project.sock

57460379
chown	sudo
solution create directories sudo mkdir var www your_project sudo chown your_user www-data var www your_project modify your_project.ini modify nginx server block uwsgi_pass unix var www your_project your_project.sock
restart uwsgi and nginx sudo systemctl restart your_project_service sudo systemctl restart nginx and it all has to work now

range	max

this is my suggestion def validate_number message for i in range 4 try return int input message except valueerror print not an integer
try again. print max try reached

57461037
put	get

you can use git checkout to put back the deleted files into your working directory
assuming you already know which commit deleted the files you can say where commit-ish is a reference to the commit in question references that commit s parent deleted-path is the path of the file or directory that you want to restore for example assuming a12b34 is the sha-1 of the commit that deleted the foo directory you would say git checkout a12b34 -- path to foo in short this commands tells git to get the files in the specified path as they were before the commit that deleted they and put they back in the working directory

57461467
width	margin
with the current definition the first and last columns would use 1 5th of the screen s width and the center column 3 5ths
another variant would be to set the first column to a fixed with of 210 leaving a bit of margin for your label
then the other columns would take 3 4th and 1 4th of the remaining space

57461585
versioning	upgrade
since you are using debian you can find how to update to the latest php versioning here
update your system with sudo apt upgrade -y add the repository sudo apt -y install lsb-release apt-transport-https ca-certificates sudo wget -o etc apt trusted.gpg.d php.gpg update and install php


57461867
ifttt	zapier
you could access your gmail account through outlook office 365 business or forward emails from gmail to a new outlook office 365 business email account in order to effectively do this using ifttt
alternatively you can try another integration app like zapier which still has gmail triggers such as the one you are looking for
however there are limits to how often you can run an applet zap under a free plan each month

57462086

since you are behind a proxy there are alternatives to download the dataset download the file at put the downloaded file inside use keras.datasets.imdb.load_data normally
if you get errors about pickle then look at how to fix #39

57462146
versioning	upgrade
you should upgrade to at least 1.7.14
the current versioning is 2.1.8
you can set the metricscollector on the underlying rabbit connection factory

inserting one record at a time into hive will result extreme slowness
as your doing regular insert into hive table change your flow querydatabasetable puthdfs then create hive avro table on top of hdfs directory where you have stored the data

57463189
int	boolean

also it would be nice to validate if the input is an int before running int age because int 3.14 or int foo will get you an error
for checking if a string could be represented as a valid positive int you could use this in this case is_valid is a boolean storing if is_valid is valid or not

orange	lda

importantly it also assigns words to topics so orange would have a high loading into the oranges and related stuff topic and a low loading into the cars topic - since the color is probably discussed less with cars and articles about orange logistics are likely rare
implementation very rough guideline assuming what i am assuming about your project mainly that this is what you want and that you have the original documents also that the split into three dataframes does not matter this is one way to go about it take your documents and run lda on your documents write some code that takes a word as input and then returns some say 2-5 topics into which this word loads and say the top 10 words from within this topic

57463888
lda	topicmodels
it uses lda packages lda or topicmodels there are others that have this functionality
side note the acronym lda is the reason i found this post by accident...

noexcept	throw

if that s not a concern you can explicitly declare your destructor to be d noexcept false which would allow exceptions to bubble out of the destructor if the destructor wasn t triggered by some other exception causing stack unwinding
note that even though your destructor s technically legal your destructor s generally considered a bad idea to throw uncaught exceptions in a destructor since your destructor makes your class largely unusable in any context where a handleable exception might be throw

first you need to create the temporary folder correctly
using the hadoop user run the following commands you might want to remove the current content of the tmp directory

57465039
multiplying	subtract
when you subtract 2.0 the result isn t 1.51 as you would expect
the best thing to do is to multiplying the users input by 100 and then do integer math rounding the original result to ensure it is an integer


57465300
folder	directory

in my case it was because i had another folder that contained xampp and all another folder that contained xampp s files htdocs php e.t.c
like i installed xampp twice in different directory and for some reason the configurations of the other one was affecting my current xampp directory and so i had to change the memory size in the php.ini file of the other directory too

don t use std ofstream in write
use std ostream

57466100
integer	fractions
so actually one could come up with a implementation where a fractions aniso setting could make a difference
but i always thought this value should be an integer of multiple of 2
in practice most gpus do use some scheme where the limit actually is a power of two

57466241
hash	salt
unique hash parameters are generated for each firebase project
these may be viewed in firebase console authentication users select password hash parameters from the drop down in the upper-right hand corner of the users table
firebase scrypt parameters algorithm - scrypt base64_signer_key - the public key of the signer base64_salt_separator - the separator to use when concatenating the hash with the salt rounds - the blocksize parameter which fine-tunes sequential memory read size and performance

57466282
superclass	subclassing

ricardo here is an instance of class knight having hp 3 therefore if you want the value of hp to be 5 then you should override a method in the knight class calling the superclass method
alternately you can avoid re-declaring the hp variable in the subclassing

57466287
folder	directory

note that the web.config file should be placed in the root folder of your project
if the web.config isn t working for you you might want to try setting the web.config isn t working for you manually for iis open internet information services iis manager in the connections pane go to the site application or directory for which you want to add a mime type

57466416
put	get
right now you have only that one div two once you include your loading ng-template will get put onto the row
something like this should otherwise work this would put each child div within the scope of the row flex layout but this is not what you actually have
so that the components are direct children of the controlling flex

57466458
subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication
ii the precision of the result of addition and subtraction is implementation-defined and the scale is the maximum of s1 and s2
iii the precision of the result of multiplication is implementation-defined and the scale is s1 + s2
iv the precision and scale of the result of division are implementation-defined note that the behaviour of mysql is also allowed within these rules

terminate	timeout
share will naturally terminate once it has no subscribers left but in the service you re ensuring one subscriber always exists
just do this instead in the logs you ll see that the timer emits 4 times then stops after the timeout unsubscribes
you could just as easily unsubscribe in ondestroy hook or use the destroy emission method

maven	pom.xml

check properly settings with version of your project in eclipse and version of your runner for maven
i have reproduced the same issue with maven-compiler plugin but using version 3.8.1 failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins maven-compiler-plugin 3.8.1 compile default-compile on project testname fatal error compiling my pom.xml was to clarify in project i m using java 11 and intelijidea but logic i think the same for eclipse

folder	directory

that is the getreadabledatabase has been coded historicaly as a hack to get around the no ent error due to the databases folder not existing when an app is installed
i recommend not actually doing this after the check for the database existing but as part of the check using something based upon - private boolean checkdatabase context context string databasename does not open the database instead checks to see if the file exists also creates the databases directory if the file does not exists the real reason why the database is opened which appears to result in issues the code above was taken from a pre-populated database does not work at api 28 throws no such table exception which is a little more comprehensive

prometheus	metrics

i personally monitor my fleet of spiders with prometheus
prometheus is a monitoring solution for numeric data that collects metrics from web services

57468199
prometheus	metrics
 personally pass these two metrics to prometheus number of times spiders are scheduled number of items successfully yielded
i currently cannot monitor things happening inside the spider with prometheus because i run my spiders out-of-process but running scrapy inside an existing python process is possible with the push gateway approach you will send the data directly from an existing python process so you have access to all data from within your scrapy processes


57468430
queue	fifo
for more information see fifo queue logic in the amazon sqs developer guide
standard queue provide a loose-fifo capability that attempts to preserve the order of messages
however because standard queue are designed to be massively scalable using a highly distributed architecture receiving messages in the exact order they are sent is not guaranteed

57469722
subtract	addition

you never applied truncate to the remainder calculation you just summed the truncated numbers and subtract the truncated numbers
every addition in the sum includes a possibility of a small precision issue and the subtraction introduces another and truncating the results will cause serious problems because an error that reduces the value even a little will cause a huge error when you truncate

57469827
put	get
so on subsequent iterations is always true and you leave the loop before adding to p_cost
put after open tariffe_cursor
but i don t think you ll ever get 11 as a result

57469855
spaces	linefeed
e use extended regex syntax search followed by maybe some spaces and any number of newlines or linefeed and replace by the captured
result is the captured will remove the newline and trailing spaces when there is nothing after the last output produced test 1 2 3 41 test 5 6 7 8800 test 9 10 test 11 12


57469894
keras	tensorflow
the other problem you have is that the last tf.where on the return line returns a -1 which is not a vector which tensorflow expects
i haven t tried the function with keras but in my activation function tester this code works
as i said i m new at this so to vectorize -1 i multiplied the x vector by 0 and subtracted -1 which produces a array filled with -1 of the right shape

57469931
filtering	grouping
i think the problem can be mathematically described as follows - filtering dataframe to minimize number of rows such that sum of all columns is 1
selected rows are called primary grouping and every other row should be a subgroup of a primary grouping
a column gene can belong to only one primary grouping

57470213
typeerror	traceback
in fact flask route cannot return dictionary
code output typeerror typeerror dict object is not callable the view function did not return a valid response
the return type must be a string tuple response instance or wsgi callable but it was a dict. screenshot as the traceback indicates route s return type must be a string tuple response instance or wsgi callable

57471058
prop	each
this will optimize how vue re-renders the table
if your items array has a field id that is guaranteed to be unique across all rows of data then set the prop
filtering also needs to serialize each row s data into a single string of all the rows values so it can take a bit of time if there are many fields or deep nest fields

treemap	linkedhashmap
treemap - stores keys and values in a naturally ordered way and contains only unique keys
linkedhashmap - stores keys and values in the order of keys insertions and contains only unique keys
the appropriate data structure for such requirement will be a map

57471171
folder	directory
t recognize folder path my initial reasoning is that h5py.file path doesn t handle the standard subfolder path as its argument load_model neunet.h5 has no issue but load_model subfolder neunet.h5 will give the same error
in a nutshell my solution is to simply put whatever .h5 files into the working home folder for in my jupyter notebook which is the place you create the .ipynb file
you could use print os.getcwd in jupyter notebook to see where is your current working directory

57471249
prop	each

bootstrapvue provides the prop tbody-tr-class for applying classes to rows which accepts a string class name an array of class names or a function
what you want to do is use the function syntac to inspect the data on each row and return a class based on values in the rows data the function is called for each row

57471282
width	margin

by wrapping each of the items that we want to be on the same row in a you can then make it so each element will take up half of that row s width
this will also account for the margin of the items

57471282
width	margin
his will also account for the margin of the items
the important parts here are this make it so each row element s width is 100 of it parent object in this case it is the container element


57471282
width	margin
you then just need to set the width and the margin on the .div-content and on .div-list width 50
margin 0 10px
the snippet below shows this in action

57471429
post	put

why not trying this simple approach and in your javascript if you don t want to use ajax you can manage your cart items all on client side using an array of objects let s name it cartitems once you need to submit or post the page you have all the already selected books in cartitems array
to add this javascript code to your view choose one of the options put this block at the bottom of your view and copy the above script inside the tag section scripts copy this javascript code inside a newfile.js and add a newfile.js to your view you may decide to bundle a newfile.js

57471569
width	margin
otice how i set up the flex containers width to be 1oovw - 1em then set the margin to 0.5em and auto
this will create an even margin around all the elements once we add a 0.5en margin on 0.5em and auto


57471857
post	get	post	get
since not all clients support get with body post is allowed as well
if you really want to use a get request from spring resttemplate to transfer a body you need to replace and extend the requestfactory
you can find an example for exactly your case in this blog post

folder	directory
you should start the setup.exe with -r switch record to create a setup.iss file in the c windows folder
then you have to copy the answer file to the install directory


57471969
for-loop	loops

the numelements is a std size_t type which has no begin and end iterator defined which is defined for standard containers and user-defined types not for primitive types which are required for a range-based for-loop
therefore you need either a classical for-loop or simply a while loops secondly as songyuanyao pointed out derived class must have a default constructor for the makevector to work

57472332
inherited	properties
any properties on its prototype goes to __proto__
since all objects are inherited from object there is a chain till global object


57472486
dictionary	map

second this makes original data entries of the form __duplicate__x 42 impossible to store without extra handling as would entries like 4 1 4 2 4 3 4 4 because in a generic case you have to decide how to handle non-string repeated values and if you map them those to a string you mask the string versions of those keys
even if your data is restricted to the first of the data item pairs being a string it would be better to create a dictionary like class or subclass dictionary that way you can keep a list internally of the duplicated keys and handle those in a special way cq

57472641
maven	pom.xml

both answers above are correct - just wanted to add that if you are looking for fast and easy path and you are using maven then flyway is probably the most convenient way to operate

folder	directory	folder	directory
this directory exists in the local domain library application support to save data for all users and in the user domain library application support to save data per user
there is a convention to name the custom folder in application support with the bundle identifier of the application but this is not mandatory
while the application support directory is created implicitly your app is responsible to create the custom folder

57473440
folder	directory
while the application support directory is created implicitly your app is responsible to create the custom folder
ns filemanager provides an api to get the application support directory without hard-coding paths
if your app is sandboxed you must use this ns filemanager api anyway

57473443
qobject	qpointer
e i think the best is to define as qpointer to point to the obj and test null each time using the obj so when the ui obj get destroyed the pointer set to null directly qpointer provides guarded pointers for qobject
you can use the obj to hold a reference to your dialog and when your dialog is deleted the pointer set to null directly qpointer provides will be set to null automatically.


57473638
prepare	execute
inally having prepare your statement you don t need to pass your statement to the execute method
you should however look at using bind points in your sql and passing your actual data items to the execute call


57473940
srp	principles
n fact doing so would violate a software engineering principles known as single responsibility principles or srp for short
functions such as boxplot return the data because functions such as boxplot perform two functions and thus strictly speaking violate srp functions such as boxplot compute a statistic and functions such as boxplot plot it


57474101
put	get

it is important to put all the messages you send to the user into a datastore db cache etc so that no data is lost due to an unsuccessful message transmission
mark no data as sent only if you get a successful ack from the user

postgresql	mysql

sql standard as i explained in this article the sql 2008 standard provides the following syntax to limit the sql result set select title from post order by id desc fetch first 50 rows only the sql 2008 top-n records clause is supported in oracle since 12c sql server since 2012 and postgresql since 8.4
sql server while sql server supports the sql 2008 top-n standard syntax you need to provide the offset clause as well select title from post order by id desc offset 0 rows fetch first 50 rows only on older sql server versions you can use top select top 50 title from post order by id desc oracle 11g and older versions prior to version 12c to fetch the top-n records you had to use a derived table and the rownum pseudocolumn mysql and postgresql 8.3 or older traditionally mysql and postgresql use the limit clause to restrict the result set to the top-n records select title from post order by id desc limit 50

maven-assembly-plugin	maven-shade-plugin
to create an executable fat jar consider using one of the following plugins maven-assembly-plugin this plugin adds all dependencies inside the final jar
maven-shade-plugin this plugin adds all dependencies inside the final jar and executes shading renaming


57475720
filtering	grouping
since the regex contains an alternation with a capturing grouping in each one of them will always be empty upon a valid match
a generic solution for this is to filtering out a none value from the two item tuple and you may do that using a lot of approaches
one way is to concat the two values the syntax is ok here as we can only have a string or none in the match.groups

ocaml	sml
ocaml relies on module abstraction to do all the hiding that is necessary
notice that this site does not mention this facility in sml


57476308
viewdidload	viewwillappear
ote viewdidload would be a more appropriate place to add your line because note viewdidload is only called once when the view is created
viewwillappear is called anytime the view appears so the view can be called multiple times for instance in a uitabview viewwillappear is called every time the user switches to that tab

getter	setter

so a good idea is to put the sorting mechanism into the getter of the public property
or the setter when resetting the public property something like this so whenever your public property is called your public property will sort the private property and return the collection that way

range	max	range	min

unfortunately there is no way to directly get the range from an qabstractaxis - i suppose this is since the type of for the range qabstractaxis might be qstring qbarcategoryaxis qdatetime qdatetimeaxis or qreal qlogvalueaxis and qvalueaxis
you might try the slightly unelegant solution to the qabstractaxis to the various derived axis types and then directly read the min max properties from the downcast type

versioning	upgrade

i had the same issue with chrome versioning 76.0.3809.89 i was using a hybrid app although when i closed a hybrid app totally it shouldn t be working in the background and then tried again it worked
to fix the same issue with chrome versioning 76.0.3809.89 you must upgrade your chrome to 76.0.3809.111

for-loop	loops	for-loop	loops
however you can probably make the r code faster by avoiding dynamically growing vectors inside loops
in a for-loop that is almost never necessary since you know the size of the resulting vector beforehand and can use and
however in this case one can go even further and formulate the problem in terms of matrices and linear algebra avoiding the explicit loops altogether created on 2019-08-13 by the reprex package v0.3.0 note that i am including the redefinition of pi only to reproduce your desired result

57477383

just print directly
you would save memory and the last for-loop
inside your second loops you first perform a linear search and then if nothing is found you use std lower_bound which has logarithmic complexity

i m going to draw your scenario to make it easier to talk about master v a--b--c d--e--m--f--g feature now let s assume for the sake of argument that you want to squash commit g which happened after the merge into commit e which happened before the merge
as ibug pointed out in the comment the easiest way out since you own the branch is to simply do the squash and then redo the merge since by default the interactive rebase will drop any merge commits in the selected range

s ibug pointed out in the comment the easiest way out since you own the branch is to simply do the squash and then redo the merge since by default the interactive rebase will drop any merge commits in the selected range
however if you really want to keep m where it is you can try to do an iteractive rebase with the --rebase-merges option git checkout feature git rebase -i --rebase-merges d from the documentation with --rebase-merges the interactive rebase will instead try to preserve the branch structure within the commits that are to be rebased by recreating the merge commits

ionic	angular
if you follow the auth0 quickstarts you should be choosing native mobile app if you are deploying to app stores and single-page app if you are deploying the web version of ionic
from there you can pick cordova for native or angular for spa
these should give you instructions that implement oauth flows which do not require your client secret

#pragma message another solution is to put all deprecated macros in a separate header file and use pragma
you could combine this with #ifdef and such #pragma message this header contains deprecated macros all compilers unreferenced label use an unreferenced label this does not work for constant expression macros and requires you to compile with -wall to get a warning

57479299

mousemove	mouseleave	mousemove	mouseenter
you need to use find when attempting to select child elements from the this reference
secondly mousemove doesn t accept multiple functions
assuming you re expecting to add remove the class on mouseenter mouseleave you could use hover instead along with toggleclass better still you could use css alone to achieve this the above is assuming the .collapsible__content--expanded is just hiding showing content

57479964
put	get

if you put this list using flux#fromiterable each item in the list will sort of become a mono and the flux will emit that item when available
since you have a blocking call that returns an entire if you put this in a mono the subscriber will get the entire list in one big emit

57479964
put	get
ince you have a blocking call that returns an entire if you put this in a mono the subscriber will get the entire list in one big emit
if the subscriber is a really big list the subscriber can put strain on the subscriber because the publisher might emit one giant list of say 1 000 000 items in one big chunk

sin	sqrt
then replace with the actual sqrt function so math.sqrt 1 for example where we are simply inserting the group between the parenthesis

justin was right - my mycontroller getdata method was actually using a post method and in my fetch handler a post method was attempting to always fetch non-get requests from the network - hence the failure when offline
i just changed the request to a get request and my service worker fallback logic got the data from cache

i may have gotten a thing or two wrong in translation but you get the idea
in the future post a more minimal example
the union of the two datasets from the separate databases is not central to the problem you were trying to ask about

versioning	upgrade
t s a little tedious but it gives you full control of what versioning each package is set at
i will usually create a feature branch in git something like feature upgrade where i ll update the packages npm i nestjs common latest nestjs core latest .. try it out there then merge that branch into master or whatever your development branch is

for-loop	loops
if you have written the number of persons to the file you can read this number first then use a for-loop
otherwise use a while loops reading one record per cycle until eof and count the number of records
solution using a while loops note this code is untested

int	double

javascript numbers are always 64-bit floating point unlike many other programming languages javascript does not define different types of numbers like int short long floating-point etc
javascript numbers are always stored as double precision floating point numbers following the international ieee 754 standard

57483136
hide	show
so and of course you can replace .removeclass hiddendiv with .show and addclass hiddendiv with hide
also note that using the below code as i mentioned above might cause all the divs to show for a few milliseconds before hiding
so by you can have the hiddendiv in you html by default then only remove the first one when the page loads to conclude i honestly do not see the reason why you want to have all your results div in one page

57483426
for-loop	arrays

to go with what romanperekhrest is saying inside the for-loop you have this means that your overwriting response each time
to get around this one way is to make an arrays called responses and append the response to it like this

57483486
width	border-color

add an inset border to your scrollbar and set the width large enough fill the entire element
set border-color inherit on your scrollbar

57483506
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	arrays
from my understanding you are breaking out the components of the string into an arrays based off of comas
if you know how to use regex you could just code that into a for-loop food for thought
anyways here it is this will return an arrays of arrays of characters that represent each element

57483699
datediff	difference
you ll need lag and datediff to get the number of minutes between tran_date and the previous row
then basically a running total on the evaluation of whether or not the time difference is greater than 30
so you know when to reset your numbering

57483872
inherited	subclassing
n particular b is not a subclassing of actually no such class even exists after extends
on the other hand javascript s inherited prototyping is quite unique and very different from c++ and so we can we expect everything to work


57483888
folder	directory
essen points out in a comment on the question the homeshare environment variable is defined if and only if the user s home folder is configured to reside on a remote computer via a drive letter mapped to it reflected in homedrive typically configured via active directory but possibly also locally via lusrmgr.msc
conversely this means that if the home folder is configured to be a local folder as the home folder is by default homeshare won t be defined


57483954
for-loop	arrays

you also could loops through your code with a for-loop and use an if condition that only will capitalize the first letter if it s lowercase
the key here is showing what type of character splits the characters of the arrays you want to capitalize and then rejoin the characters into a string separated by that same underscore character

57484002
post	put
t various places put the following debugging code and you may also add the different critical variables using a comma separator in the var_dump function you also should consider using better variable names because the following debugging code is more confusing to debug than the following debugging code needs to be
the variable names are not consistent even within a single if then loop for example in the second function you mention data and then post


57484039
int	double

first of all this will help you find the issue here you can see this string 0.45991480288961 can not be converted to an int
so you need to convert this string 0.45991480288961 directly to a double

57484144
integer	unsigned
customer_id is a 4-byte integer
if you don t anticipate more than a few thousand use a 2-byte smallint unsigned

factors	mean

for inline aggregation keeping same number of rows of data frame consider ave for full aggregation collapsed to factors groups consider aggregate aggregate
a + b + c var mean

57484386
prepare	execute
the problem can be treated as dot product between 2 vectors the account and the multiplier
this is the code for getting better run time performance another optimization step you can prepare the conversion of accounts from string to int array in advance
i recommend to run multiple threads that will execute this task

maven-shade-plugin	pom.xml

i had the same issue failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins maven-shade-plugin 3.0.0 shade default on project error creating shaded jar invalid loc header bad signature in my case i had jar with the same version and name of one dependency that was included to another dependency
and i checked it using lifecycle commands of maven so i deleted this jsoup-1.11.3.jar and regenereted this jsoup-1.11.3.jar via another library after adding in pom.xml that contains this jsoup-1.11.3.jar also

for-loop	arrays
therefore your variable axes is a 2d arrays you need to access the individual axes using
alternatively i would rewrite your for-loop like so


57484951
subtraction	addition
associativity doesn t matter with addition because as you may remember from grade school math addition is commutative and associative -- there s no difference between a + b + c a + b + c or b + c + a but see the note at the end of my answer
but consider subtraction
if you write 100 - 50 - 5 it matters whether you treat this as or left associativity means that the first interpretation will be used

57484972
associativity	operator-precedence

note that associativity only really makes sense for nestable infix operators such as binary + or
for operators such as function call or the unary ones associativity is rather pointless in general second line operator-precedence affects parsing not order of evaluation

57485268
children	parent

attr actionbarsize additionally delete this attribute as it doesn t have any effect note that constraintlayout does not support match_parent for constraintlayout children
if you want match parent behavior you should combine a dimension of 0dp with left+right or top+bottom constraints to the parent

57485571
unixodbc	iodbc
sing the simba odbc driver you might need alien to install the rpm file sudo apt-get install alien sudo alien -i simbaathena-1.0.5.1006-1.x86_64.rpm note you must have iodbc 3.52.9 3.52.10 3.52.11 or 3.52.12 or unixodbc 2.3.2 2.3.3 or 2.3.4 installed
i used iodbc with ubuntu 18.04 64bit and installed ubuntu 18.04 64bit via sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev you can check if you installed the simba athena odbc driver is installed with dpkg -l | grep simbaathenaodbc the code to use the odbc


57485756
for-loop	loops

so the way you have it structured you aren t pausing the for-loop at all
you re just creating an async function and executing an async function over and over in each iteration of loops and nothing is paying any attention to the promise that the async function returns

57485804
pull	push
then you either submit a pull request for the original b and if this one gets merged you can pull that changes in the submodule or change the submodule to your own fork
with the second approach you will also be able to push future changes


57485812
put	get
this way you get a more stable gradient because you increased your virtual batch size
finally you can calculate the approximate memory usage using the solution of this answer by zfturbo that i put below

to put that in perspective even at the slower speed of 71ns it means you can call datetime.utcnow 14 000 times for a cost of only 1 millisecond
at the previously faster time of 25 ns hopefully they will get this performance back you can call datetime.utcnow 40 000 times for a cost of 1 millisecond

you can install the beta versioning via pip


57487321
children	parent

if a had three children one input one output and one to be determined you have not yet defined a rule for what would happen to the to be determined child
let s look at another example we find that b has two children that are both to be determined so we make b bidirectional and propagate this to this to be determined offspring to end up with if i understand the rules correctly this bidirectional status is then propagated to every undetermined node in the rest of the tree without the need for additional traversal so the algorithm is visit every node starting from the root node if every node is a leaf remember the node is status move up to the node is parent and give its parent provisionally

57487321
children	parent
only an undetermined node can have undetermined offspring so you know that you don t have to visit the children of nodes that weren t undetermined
the rule you mention in a comment where a node with three children that are input output and undetermined would mean the undetermined child becomes bidirectional is indeed an additional rule
but at the point where you ve visited all of a node s children the details of how you combine the children s states into the parent s status can be easily modified to include any additional rule

57487321
children	parent
ut at the point where you ve visited all of a node s children the details of how you combine the children s states into the parent s status can be easily modified to include any additional rule
if you decide that the undetermined child must become bidirectional you d then propagate the parent s status to undetermined offspring of the undetermined child and if i understand the rules correctly from that point on every undetermined node you find in the rest of the tree would automatically become bidirectional

public	protected
t can access protected and public variables from iherited classes as well
if the function itself is public anyone can call the function itself


57487682
public	protected
public inheritance allows triangle to have these functions too but since they are actually at the polygon level it doesn t have a problem
this doesn t compile with the error protectedpoly is a protected member of polygon you are running into this situation
that link explains that problem and its answer far better than i could so i ll leave it right there

57487684
int	double
std pow for double only handles reals
1 - 2.01655 is of course negative so your equation only has real results for int values of x
i think you ll find that int values of x generate a result and non-integer values are generating nan

57487728
folder	directory

incase if anybody ran into issues like this userstorage spi wasn t displaying because of meta-inf services folder
t s provided in the documentation but t isn t clear in src main resources create a folder structure meta-inf services create a file called org.keycloak.storage.userstorageproviderfactory the whole thing is the filename in meta-inf services directory

57487793
swift	objective-c

as far as i can tell from experimenting swift functions closures can t always be passed to c functions compiled with a c compiler and taking compatible blocks
however a c compiler works fine if the same functions are compiled as objective-c

57487866
for-loop	loops

instead use a regular for-loop and then you can just return value to both end the for-loop iteration and to establish the resolved value of your promise chain
a regular for-loop gives you significantly more control over the program flow than a .foreach loops

57487961
cdr	cons
his is a list of two elements where the car of the list points to the list 1 2 and the cdr of the list is 3
we can go ahead and draw the boxes for this layer and since the car of the last layer just points to the list 1 2 we can fill that in now the second argument to the append function is also a list containing only one element so that single element is the result of cons 4 cons 5 which is just the list 4 5 so we can finally finish we box diagram by pointing to the list from the car of the last cons cell

prop	each
o solution is to define unique form as a component prop at runtime instead of in reduxform config and of course remove this value from reduxform config this way all form instances are independent
since now all form instances are independent of each other you don t have to define field names this way  you can do it like this

innodb	myisam
you need to rebuild the indexes after adjusting the setting and a server restart by using repair table tbl_name quick
if you cannot control the server configuration you could switch your table to innodb which uses a significantly smaller stopword list
some additional notes the fulltext index uses a minimum word length by default 4 for myisam and 3 for innodb

for-loop	loops
because i have to use one index number for this and about 7-8 other actions that have to be preformed simultaneously each instance my solution cannot be lapply based but has to be a part of a for-loop and generate one matrix at a time
it does save using a dedicated loops within such a loops and therefore i think worth sharing

for more information about saving and restoring models in tensorflow please see the save and restore tutorial
alternative neater way to save a keras model now since you are using a keras model it is perhaps more convenient to save a keras model with model.save model_path.h5 and restore a keras model as follows update generating a single .pb file from the .ckpt files if you want to generate a single .pb file please use the former tf.train.saver approach

that means that the factors might be different
the size + 0.0 uses sqlite s capability to do implicit conversion based on leading numeric digits

57493258
floating-point	fractions
the problem actually occurs in earlier operations
converting a numeral in source code to a number adding numbers and other operations introduce errors when the exact real-number mathematical value is rounded to a value representable in floating-point
javascript uses ieee-754 binary64 which has a 53-bit significand the fractions portion of a floating-point number

57493258
floating-point	fractions
javascript uses ieee-754 binary64 which has a 53-bit significand the fractions portion of a floating-point number
this means any number with a magnitude of 2 52 or greater does not have any bits that can represent values less than 1 they have no fractions portion
so when any number 2 52 or greater is converted to a javascript number the result is an integer

57493399
versioning	upgrade
test would then be used to prove that the steps described in the upgrade path work as described

there are a lot of potential vulnerabilities with hashing schemes which can be prevented that way including susceptibility to brute-force attacks or dictionary attacks mathematical issues resulting in a weakening of the hash function with md5 and other issues
specifically md5 even with a salt or multiple rounds is trivially insecure so that even good passwords can be broken by just brute-force in seconds
you should never store passwords hashed with md5 anywhere

width	height	subtract	add
orgive my drawing hope it s clear you want to know x which is what you ant to add to the width of your rectangle b is your angle 45 which in js and in radians gives math.pi 4 you know dx and dy which are the coordinates of how much you dragged a is the angle of the dragging z is the distance now these are the useful rules to know pythagore s theorem and basic trigonometry pythagore says because of the square triangle you have so in js trigonometry says that that gives in js cosa is the inverse of cos for the same reason you have the inverse of cos means that last thing to know is that to get the height instead of width you will use sin instead of cos
additional problems the coordinate system is upside down for the y axis in trigonometry when you go up the coordinate system s positive on a screen this is usually the contrary - needs to negate dy to have the right angles when the vertical distance has been calculated with the right angles you need to negate the result when going up because you actually subtract height to the rectangle in the picture the mouse could be below the horizontal line in which case you need to subtract the angles instead of adding instead i recommend you draw the mouse and use a - b instead of a + b

subtract	add

your first query is subtract 16 days which may take you into the previous month and then adds six months to that
your second query add six months which seems to be tripping you up at month end as other have pointed out

57494497
subtract	add
o you could combine both calculations in a case expression if the original date is after the 16th day of the month then subtract 16 days leaves you in the same month so you can then add six months to that
if the original date is on or before the 16th then subtract 16 days would put you in the previous month which you want to avoid i think

google-chrome	firefox
ts contents are after calling tensorboard c some path to my_graph note do not use backslashes only forward slashes can be opened in google-chrome
backslashes fails with firefox and internet explorer


57494735
filtering	grouping
an aggregation query with no grouping by always returns exactly one row
if the table is empty or all rows are filtering out then the aggregation functions -- except for count -- return null -- which can be transformed to a value using coalesce
such a construct makes me worry

57494949
post	get
f the id is 0 then the id is 0 is not associated to a specific post
you might make use of the function to get the attachment parent haven t tested but seems to be what you are looking for

width	height
so the width flex-grow combination is a clean workaround
the demo below covers the issue answered above plus height issues ndash
aspect ratio and vertical scroll ndash

57495341
post	get
et s assume you want to get id
i will add new hook for storing id setting it after post method is completed and displaying it


57495448
sequence	permutation
also as you mentioned overfitting may arise through through repeated sequence structures
this synthetic permutation data should be as generated as randomly as possible
one can use the sample method in the python random library

57495526
int	boolean

use filter + any since all non-zero int are truthy in python calling any directly on your dataframe results in the correct mask
since you want an integer output we can use a memory efficient view to view the boolean mask as a integer type

57495628
filtering	grouping
after that you can filtering grouping by that count
for example you can find active grouping with the following query and inactive grouping


57496302
folder	directory

and inside the folder you may define the sourcedir which will link to your android folder of the project
like so so suppose the folder is called something else you can replace the sourcedir with the link to your android app src directory

57496475
for-loop	loops

in fact since the code already lies inside a for-loop assuming it iterates the same number of times as rows you have in your tag number column you likely won t have to use a separate for-loop
i would recommend first changing these two lines to and then moving that entire block aside from var name of variable declarations above the for-loop so that the code runs faster the code won t have to do a .getrange or recalculate the date every time the loops iterates like so then finally down where you previously had those declarations you can place something similar to the following using variable names that work for you of course this is just an example this will use i to iterate through each row in the first and in this case only column and if you change the other variable names below accordingly will use those in the name for each new document you create

57496482
put	get
ne way to do this is to put another widget inside the scroll-widget and then use a vertical layout to add the spacer
another widget inside the scroll-widget will also help if you make the scroll-widget resizable otherwise the rows will start to get squashed if too many are added


57497117
inject	interceptor
fault tolerance is implemented using interceptor
for interception to happen the method needs to be on a cdi bean you need to use inject to inject your bean somewhere and then you need to call the method on the instance that was inject
in particular interception does not happen if you create the instance of your class using new you call the annotated method from within the same class as far as testing whether your circuit breaker is working the easiest way is usually to call the method and check that the metrics appear

57497319
folder	directory

if you just want to upload an empty folder though you can t
from the git faqs currently the design of the git index staging area only permits files to be listed and nobody competent enough to make the change to allow empty directory has cared enough about this situation to remedy the change

57497319
folder	directory
you can leave it empty or fill in the names of files you do not expect to show up in the directory
so now knowing this add an empty .gitignore or what i like even better is to add a readme explaining the purpose of having an empty folder
then from the root of the repo run git add folder_where_i_want_to_upload_another_folder git commit -m added files and folders git push origin master

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari

the best way i found that works tested in firefox and google-chrome on mac is to paint the image with opacity 0 like this bit the image s still not 100 reliable
in safari the image flickers quite much still

57497367
persistent	transient
you should only use a singleton or transient lifetime if you have a good reason to do so
for a singleton that s stuff like managing locks or holding data that needs to persistent for the lifetime of the application neither of which applies to the concept of a repository
repositories should be entirely disposable

57497595
accessor	properties
the compiler will then make no assumptions about which strings are valid keys and which are not essentially saying that any properties accessor is defined and will return a foo
if you want to enforce that only the one and two keys are defined for your object then you can strictly define the properties of your dictionary

put	get
hat won t put t in a database but you would have the information you need
you can also run the updatesql command before running the update command to get the sql that would be generated


57497739
for-loop	loops

there are no reasons to redefine the class page tk.frame multiple times in a for-loop
what you should probably do is create instances of that class inside loops

57497933

128bit	64bit
there are two major problems with decimal data type on high-performance computations clr treats this type as a regular structure no special support as for other built-in types in is 128bit while you cannot do much about the first issue second looks even more important
memory operations and processors are extremely efficient when operating with 64bit numbers
128-bit operations are much heavier

57498706
decimal	ieee

the solution that we have adopted in my company fintech domain is to use a wrapper on top of intel decimal floating-point math library
a wrapper implements the ieee 754-2008 decimal floating-point arithmetic specification providing 64-bit floating-point decimals

57498846
sum	coalesce

in both tables i have a unique column titled phone_number if phone_number is unique in both tables then group by and sum make no sense since the left join result can only have one row per phone number
all you need is probably coalesce for the right table to convert null to zero

propertygrid	linklabel
further tab press on them will select the next selectable control inside or outside of the strip
propertygrid when you press tab on this control it selects the property label then editing area and then if there is a edit button selects the edit button and then selects the next control
linklabel receives tab in case it contains a link area otherwise will not receive tab

children	parent

when you extends a class and overwrite a method you are saying a class s a children responsability to implements the functionality
so you can t access the parent function outside the children class

nexus	artifactory
first a few assumptions 1
we re publishing to nexus
artifactory should be similar but shown here is what worked for nexus. 2

57499473
nexus	artifactory
artifactory should be similar but shown here is what worked for nexus. 2
nexus requires credentials to publish
this complicates issues hence we override the publish task to directly supply credentials. 3

57499526
post	get
workaround option 2. keep using aws classic elb and you get to keep using acm you ll just need to add configuration to both the classic elb in the form of annotation of the lb service + add configuration to the ingress controller
so that both use proxy protocol or x forward headers i recall another stack overflow post covering this so i won t repeat it here


57499582
stdout	stderr	stdout	stderr
note you aren t actually using any powershell besides an implied invoke-expression i think you might be dealing with stderr vs
stdout when i invoke reg.exe in that fashion from powershell i get no output to the text file
this is because the text i was seeing was an error message contents of stderr from reg.exe not the output contents of stdout from the command

57499582
stdout	stderr
this is because the text i was seeing was an error message contents of stderr from reg.exe not the output contents of stdout from the command
when i passed proper parameters to it reg query hklm software microsoft c users foo documents foo.txt it wrote the contents of stdout to the text file instead of the screen
here is an article that explains it better than i just did

realloc	malloc	free	malloc
if ptr is a null pointer the realloc function behaves like the malloc function for the specified size
otherwise if ptr does not match a pointer earlier returned by a memory management function or if the space has been deallocated by a call to the free or realloc function the behavior is undefined
if size is nonzero and memory for the new object is not allocated the old object is not deallocated

i only loaded that video once on safari but according to web inspector it loads different sections of the video to reduce the load on your computers memory

57500069
action-filter	onactionexecuting

one quick solution is to put action-filter into effect. as you might know an action-filter is an attribute that you can apply to a controller action -- or an entire controller -- that modifies the way in which the action is executed
more details see documentation here in this case you need to override onactionexecuting method is called before a controller action is executed so that prior to execution you can decide to redirect or not based on the return value

systemctl	cgroups
ere is what my docker image looks like while i m testing after that i use docker run to run my container locally and start systemd docker run -v run -v sys fs cgroups sys fs cgroups ro -d container_id i then exec into my container and run the onboard script sudo sh onboard_agent.sh -w xxx -s xxx after it s done you sometimes need to wait about 5 minutes for the missing folders to appear
to trigger this to happen sooner you need to run this command my understanding is this command will restart the oms agent and this command requires systemctl


57500370
builtin	isinstance
ou may accidentally override python s builtin list type
use isinstance for type comparison instead of isinstance can accept a tuple of classes to compare against so here s the reformatted program going even further you could simplify the code by converting the code to a list if it is not a list and processing further


57500774
sorting	grouping	sorting	grouping
to restate your problem you are specifying a single eye sort list in your sorter function but you really want a different eye sort list depending on the hair grouping
so your eye sorting list ...has this output brown blue hazel green .
and that s the same sort order used within each hair grouping

57500786
width	height
ll of the divs that will hold your content need to be 100 height or width of the parent depending on the direction of scroll
you will also need to keep track of the height of your parent containers this is if the window is resized you can correctly figure out how many pixels the window is until the next container


57500883
atoi	strtod	atof	strtod
that s the main problem i see with your current approach
when parsing you should not use atoi or atof since they don t check for errors
use strtoul and strtod instead

57500901

he solution required both the use of mixins and placeholder selectors and is a little messy
if we set up we placeholder selector styles then we can let mixins do the rest of the work for we


57501033
width	height
 for image height multiply screen width by of the screen width i want my image to take by height width aspect ratio
works nicely but it will be necessary to dynamically define the of width screen you want my image to take to make my image work good responsively and for various orientations


57501102
prometheus	metrics

in other monitoring solutions metrics are pushed to the service
when you configure code to export to prometheus an endpoint must also be created to expose other monitoring solutions metrics

57501151
children	parent

you cannot control the z-index in relation to the z-index in relation to its children children because its children are contained so in a sense inherit the z-index
but you can make its children go behind its children parent by setting its children z-index to -1

57501151
children	parent
ut you can make the children go behind the children parent by setting the children z-index to -1
or you could apply overflow hidden on their parent so that the green bar is hidden when larger if that suits your needs


57501392
rest-assured	hamcrest

with rest-assured you could also do chained assertions inline with the rest call like so given .spec myrequestspecification .contenttype contenttype.json .body mypayload .post my-api-path this returns response .then but this returns validatableresponse
important difference .statuscode 200 .body notices hassize 0 any applicable hamcrest matcher can be used .body errors hassize 1 .body errors contains myerrortype.unauthorized.error

57501495
for-loop	arrays
by evaluating when i equals 0 it access outside the bounds of the allocated arrays
it looks like the code meant to have the for-loop start from 1 as you correctly tried
indeed then is also wrong

57501722
subtract	add

it s difficult to answer this based on the current level of detail but if the smaller value is always subtract from the larger and both are never null you could handle it this way using group by select id max value - min value as new_value from your-project.your_dataset.your_table group by id from here you could save these results as a new table or save this query as a view definition which would be similar to having this query calculated on the fly if the underlying data is changing
another option is to add a column under the table schema then run an update query to populate it

57501764
put	get
ull this code uses a custom put that takes input as int int string to create the and store this code into the map
this code also has a get int int that you can use when you need to get the original string back


57501906
children	parent

i ended up fixing this just by generating an id and populating that to the children once persisted works fine
i also fixed the list update a bit to make sure i entitymanager.remove children that no longer are part of the list versus just removing children from the parent

57501990
post	get

when you use the assignment operator the assignment operator is done after the post increment operator
as such you get this when you are using the post increment twice in the same line it is not increased after the line is completed but after the instruction is completed the instruction being i++

57502162
setinterval	clearinterval
his clearinterval isn t correct because you need pass the return value of setinterval to it not a function
it does helpfully imply that you have a setinterval somemeadow.growaplant somewhere though and that s where the issue is


57502289
aggregate-functions	coalesce
select with an aggregate-functions like max always returns a single row even if the underlying table has no rows
the value is null in this case that s why you have coalesce in there
but if you call setval with 1 the next sequence returned number will be 2 not 1 since that is considered to be called already

57502401
interpolation	splines

interpolation with polynomials of large degree is prone to diverging oscillations this is the so-called runge phenomenon
consider using splines piecewise polynomials of low degree

57502577
postgresql	mysql

something like this select trunc date_part day current_date - users.created_at 7 as weeks_ago if we subtract two date or timestamp in postgresql we get an interval ddd days hh mi ss we can use date_part to extract just the ddd value
note that the first argument day is a string enclosed in single quotes not a keyword since the mysql expression appears to be counting weeks as intervals of 7 days we can do the same thing in postgresql divide by 7 and take the integer portion

ubuntu	debian
there are also arm32 versions of the debian and ubuntu images
debian is the default os used by the .net core docker images
asp.net core chooses the debian stretch-slim as the base image and this provides the asp.net images with the smallest os foot print possible

57502736
accessor	properties
ou can however make it a private mutable properties and provide access to it via a properties with a different name with just custom accessor and no backing field as follows note that the setter now references myage and not field
this is called a backing properties and is useful for example when you want a properties to have a different public type than a properties privately stored value


57502740
put	get

you have to tell the computer what to put in the legend
then you will get the computer for example if what you are plotting are two columns s1 s2 from a pandas dataframe df then this is what you would do to get the plot and legend

57502790
for-loop	loops
ou can use for-loop and if else to skip more elements but it may be easier to use while true or and manually change index and use it to get values
or use enumerate with if index condition continue to skip loops for some indexes

maven	pom.xml
all i can say is that it seems to be working for me
add frontend-maven-plugin to your project the frontend-maven-plugin tool can be used by maven to download and install node.js with npm within your vaadin project
open the maven pom.xml file within your vaadin project

57502853
maven	pom.xml
open the maven pom.xml file within your vaadin project
add the following block inside the element of that pom.xml
of course you can tweak this text to use the latest version numbers

subtract	add
the fix is simple
if you go forward just subtract one days before adding anchor
if you go backward add one day before subtracting anchor you go forward to monthend so just subtract one day before adding anchor

57503516
sorting	filtering	filtering	grouping
you would have to work out your own routine logic for sorting based on number of grouping members
the replacedata function lets you silently replace all data in the table without updating scroll position sort or filtering and without triggering the ajax loading popup
this is great if you have a table you want to periodically update with new updated information without alerting the user to a change

57503568

x86	64bit
ieee fp uses sign magnitude with a sign bit at the top of the bit-pattern in c c++ yes you need to type-pun with a union or memcpy
all c implementations on x86 x86-64 that expose 80-bit floating point at all use a 12 or 16-byte type with the 10-byte value at the bottom
beware that msvc uses long double double a 64bit float so check ldbl_mant_dig from float.h or sizeof long double

mp3	wav
internet explorer 9 supports mp3 audio and mp4 audio and video. webm audio and video files can be supported by installing the webm components from the webm project
the following table shows the required settings for your web server to host these files correctly. microsoft edge updates introduced wav support
reference audio element | audio object you can see that .aac format is not in the list but sites like mdn and caniuse shows that it is supported

57504322
mp4	h.264

i also tried with audio type mp4 which also did not worked
it also can be possible that it is some kind of bug with ie browser or issue is related with h.264 format

57504695
pyenv	virtualenv

i would suggest using pyenv i have been using pyenv and is working well for me
some of the handy features of pyenv are pyenv allows installing multiple version on python easily pyenv allows switching python version with one command in global shell or folder level pyenv also allows creating virtualenv using virtualevn extension

to avoid this issue use the laravel base_path helper which will provide an absolute path
require_once base_path vendor setasign fpdf fpdf.php
require_once base_path vendor setasign fpdi src autoload.php

57504809
folder	directory

i am assuming that when you say you run foo natively you are in the folder more
to solve your issue you simply need to import all classes everywhere in relation to your issue position from the root directory because the entry point is in main.py

57505047
uinavigationcontroller	uipageviewcontroller

i m not sure uinavigationcontroller is the correct container controller to provide what you need
you might find that uipageviewcontroller is a better choice i think uipageviewcontroller will provide the natural swipe gesture you are looking for out of the box although uipageviewcontroller s quite an opaque class with some quirks of uipageviewcontroller own

57505047
uiviewcontroller	uipageviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uipageviewcontroller

to go the custom route either with uinavigationcontroller or the more flexible customisable uiviewcontroller custom presentation you are on the right track with uiviewcontrolleranimatedtransitioning and the other numerous associated protocols
in case you are in a hurry that route will take you quite a long time to implement so maybe a simple uipageviewcontroller implementation will have to do for the moment

57505155
pandas	xlrd
ere is my solution firstly import pandas as pd import pandas as pd read in filename using pd.read_excel if you have your data in a spreadsheet and set the index to locality by specifying the index_col parameter
at this stage if you get a no module named xlrd error install a no module named xlrd error using pip install xlrd


57505157
strsplit	substr	grepl	substr

1 base r an option is sub from base r to match the - followed by characters and then replace with blank or capture as a group or with regmatches regexpr or using trimws or using read.table or with strsplit 2 stringr or with word from stringr or with str_remove 3 stringi or with stri_extract_first from stringi note grep grepl is for detecting a pattern in the string
for replacing extracting substr use sub regexpr regmatches in base r data

57505206
folder	directory
he opt directory is special because opt bin is in the path and opt lib is in ld_library_path
so if you place the pre-built library files like libstdc++.so.6 into the lib folder of your lambda layer you can then reference the pre-built library files like libstdc++.so.6 from your running lambda function


57505836
put	get
its enough that someone somewhere will forget to put this finally block in some controller - the things will start breaking. the memory leak also can come if the stringbuilder won t be cleaned up
so the data will get accumulated more and more for all thread that pass through the leaking controller
if for some reason the bl spawns gets executed in another thread the code will break

57505930
overwrite	preserve
econd use simon s trick to pull the simple select query corresponding to this new table and overwrite the existing table structure so that all grouping and ordering info is lost

folder	directory

there are plenty of examples on the web to get a recursive list of files and folder
you should avoid nesting loops try to use a recusrive function call or an iterative way list all the files and folder in a directory with php recursive function

57507201
post	get	post	get
as you haven t posted your routes i can t give you the complete code solution but it would look something like changing the following from this route get test22 test22controller store
to route post test22 test22controller store
note the difference between the two is just using the post method instead of the get method

57507269
int	chars

the case is when the maximum value of an int type with rank lower then int is promoted
so the case happens on unsigned short unsigned chars and chars when the case is unsigned on a platform

57507269
int	chars

when ushrt_max is greater then int_max then unsigned short is implicitly promoted to unsigned int type
similar when uchar_max is greater then int_max then unsigned chars is promoted to unsigned int type

57507269
int	chars

and when chars on a platform is unsigned and uchar_max is greater then int_max the same happens to chars
_bool will always be converted to int

57507269
int	chars
t touches the exact problem - chars + chars can be int or unsigned int depending on if chars is unsigned and if chars can hold larger values then int
even if i defined a 31bits in a struct as bit field it still fit a signed int


57507394
folder	dir
n project level you will get a dist folder with the following contents dist lib absolutelayout.jar dist readme.txt dist stackoverflow1.jar i named my project stackoverflow1
so to run my project from the command line you can do and if you want to move the .jar around for example move my project one dir above you can run my project in the following way you cannot do my project in the following way this will give you the reported error java -cp dist lib absolutelayout.jar -jar stackoverflow1.jar the trick is that if you use the -jar option the classpath will be defined only via the entry class-path inside the manifest file of stackoverflow1.jar


57507424
int	chars
enables keypad for default window if you are still having trouble getting it to work make sure you are using an int datatype with getch
the function prototype for getch is int getch void
if you are using a chars datatype for the return value of getch then it will not be large enough to fit the return value of special chars and you will get garbage values back

for-loop	loops

the for-loop assignes the strings found in to it s variable i
at the end of loops you add 1 to this string which is not allowed as the python interpreter can not implicitly cast an int to a string

int	chars
when you take int input you get an int as your input
if you want a string representation of an int as your input don t read into an int
read into a buffer that can hold a string of chars

harfbuzz	freetype
there s actually a bug in one of the dependencies that s installed alongside freetype when using pacman on mingw64
it s either harfbuzz graphite2 glib2 pcre or wineditline
thankfully the library can still be built from source without these being installed

printf	strstr	printf	strtod

you should use printf instead if the delim_str contains embedded characters the resulting format string may cause undefined behavior when passed to scanf
a safer approach would use strstr to locate the delimiter string in the input and split the input into substrings passed to strtod

inherited	properties

there is some lifehack using union all deprecate sql endgine to inherited constraints and identity too
when an existing identity column is selected into a new table the new column inherits the identity properties unless one of the following conditions is true - the select statement contains a join group by clause or aggregate function. - multiple select statements are joined by using union. - the identity column is listed more than one time in the select list. - the identity column is part of an expression. - the identity column is from a remote data source.

post	get
here is a post that explains how to troubleshoot imagepullbackoff
you can run this command to get more information about a pod s container image kubectl describe pod pod_name when pulls are being slow you could ssh to node and run docker pull image_name this will test performance of image pulling
also you can use imagepullpolicy this could improve the performance

instances	transient

if you know exactly how you want to compose each class you can compose each class manually and register those instances with the container
that s especially easy if the classes are registered as singletons as in your question but it can apply even if each class are transient or scoped

inherited	subclassing

you might use inherited to represent different kinds of decks poker deck pinochle deck etc
deck itself would have methods for things like shuffling but each subclassing would construct the card objects appropriate for deck itself

prng	random
for example using prng means the internal state of the generator will change
there are no internal locks and you have to serialize access to the prng
and regarding the random number generator wei dai original author of the library recommends using a separate generator for each thread

int	chars
ook at class chars method public static int codepointat chars a int index and class chars overloaded versions that should help you
also when i work with chars set related problems i found class chars very helpful to use a utility that converts string into sequence of unicodes and vise versa the output of this code is u0048 u0065 u006c u006c u006f u0020 u0057 u006f u0072 u006c u0064 hello world the library that contains this utility is called mgntutils and can be found at maven central or at github this utility comes as maven artifact and with sources and javadoc

many-to-many	one-to-many
if the connection is one-to-many - use singular form
if the connection is many-to-many - use plural
meaning that in this case we should use plural and use somecategories instead of somecategory

for-loop	arrays

you can t have a for-loop outside of methods and if you move t inside a method then you d be declaring local variables so private wouldn t be allowed
instead use an arrays see how to convert number to words in java for implementation of numbertowords

so modify your view like this to have client-side validation and in your controller you may set html.enableclientvalidation false
to false to enable server-side validation
hope this helps

57513764
int	chars

you don t need to create a int array for checking the frequency just initialize a boolean array of size of tab which is by initialized to an array of false values
now in the inner loop compare the chars by lower-casing the chars as you want to check irrespective of the case you can also avoid using three loops by using a set simply convert the array of chars for each row in a of lowercase if the value is repeated the resulting will be of size less than the array as set does not contain duplicates output samsung apple blackberry alcatel jolla

rsa	aes
in practice rsa is almost always coupled with a symmetric cipher such as aes to encrypt larger ciphertext
rsa in itself certainly doesn t distinguish between words and sentences
rsa - the cryptographic primitive - operates on numbers

57513954
exponent	modulo
if you want to use textbook raw rsa with very small key size for practice then you can encrypt any kind of number as long as it is smaller than the modulo
kind of obviously you run into immediate problems if your number is too small 1 to the power of the public exponent is still 1 after all not very secure
now how you split your message into small enough components and how you convert to from a number is entirely up to you - as long as you can reverse the process obviously

switching	screens
add splash screens to accommodate the larger screens sizes of the latest ios devices
the easiest way to do this is to switching to new launch storyboard images there is more information on how to do that in the documentation of cordova-plugin-splashscreen
you may also have to update cordova-plugin-statusbar to the latest version if that is included in your project

57514668
put	get

you d have to iterate over entry set of x s entries and put y s value corresponding to x s values
there s always a chance when the value is not present in y and might return null so for such cases you can default to some value using optional.ofnullable on y s get method and handle the default later

floating-point	integer
you can leave percentagetaken as an integer and then use 100.0 instead of 100 to get a floating point value
and also make sure you are saving the result into a floating-point datatype if you are concerned about the cents portion of the value
i d also change paybefore to a floating-point datatype so the user can enter in the exact amount including cents

57515777

superclass	subclassing
if the interface contract is not at all relevant to the full hierarchy then implement only in the applicable subclassing
if yes i assume it is then go ahead and implement in the superclass
however you may not be able to compute profit and salary in the store class with the data points available

57516230
filtering	grouping
it will do if you are only interested in the clean data frame this should filtering out all mistakes and all error reports
from you sample data i get the impression that only the column nb is relevant but if not you can grouping by more identifiers


57516845
folder	directory

when you set a path header search paths library search paths you can define a path to one of parent folder and set recursive will be added to the end of the path
for example you can defile a path to a include directory or more over to a build directory with recursive parameter instead of

57516866
plot	heatmap
we can split the histroy column and then created rowid and id column to plot the data as a heatmap
if we want to plot the data as facets by true and false in the survival column we need to create the rowid separately as true and false for survival
data

57517082
for-loop	loops
but instead of trying to figure out how the variables work your code will be simpler and faster if you use a cursor for-loop like this ... procedure p_listar_cliente as begin for clientes in select id name address salary from cliente loops dbms_output.put_line clientes.id || || clientes.name
end loops
end p_listar_cliente

57517463
client-side	server-side
introspection queries can be used client-side just like any other query
depending on what implementation framework you re using server-side you may have to explicitly enable introspection in production
your client can query the possible enum values when your app loads -- regardless of how many times the schema changes the client will always have the correct enum values to display

57517484
int	chars

if you wish to take the contents within your text file and convert your text file to your text file int values you can use the ord function and if you wish to get get your text file data types you can use type function
the ord function returns the number representing the unicode code of a specified chars

you don t submit the form with php although it s also possible
but what you talking about is simple html form submission against ajax form submission

57517608
submit	submission
but what you talking about is simple html form submission against ajax form submission
in first html case you have form like this when you press the submit button - your browser stop executing current page scripts and immediately forward you to script.php url
so because of that you can t show popup messages or doing anything else because you going to totally new page

57517839
filtering	grouping
there s an open issue for aggregate functions with grouping by so this sort of attempt will fail too no matching shape found. error slick does not know how to map the given types
so until those issues are resolved or someone posts a work around luckily simple single column filtering expressions can be equivalently implemented with the more primitive case statements
though not as pretty it will work

57517863
for-loop	loops

the main issue is in your if-else statement of the you for-loop here unless you enter monty login will always be false as it s reset when ever the name doesn t match
better to set it outside loops and only change it when you need to for example.

filtering	grouping
and you should use where not having for filtering second case don t use for table alias the same name you use for column eg dept but use t_dept select max t_dept.avg_sal min t_dept.avg_sal from select dept_id dept avg salary as avg_sal from employee e where dept_id in admin it grouping by dept as t_dept
and you could use where for filtering do the fact that these values are not calculated but are available in the rows content


57520388
folder	directory
the solution was a combination of suggestions i found on the internet - given that the directory you want to share is below your user directory create a new user in windows - dockerhost no email address needed only user name and password grant reading rights to the first folder below your user directory c users yourname development right-click directory in the file manager select the security tab make sure to have added the dockerhost user there and grant at least reading rights
do the same for all the folder up to the folder you want to share in the docker desktop settings go to shared drives select your probably c-drive reset credentials then share again check the checkbox and click on apply and when prompted for a user name and password enter the user name you created dockerhost along with the password
now when running something like docker container run -p 80 80 -v c users yourname development docker_examples usr share nginx html --rm nginx it should work

countif	sumifs
break down in two parts 1 the sumifs part is used to check for all criteria from op and return the full sum of matched rows even for the 1 chance of sister accounts 2 as the above always returns a positive value we need to multiply it either with a 1 or -1 in relation to debits or credits
therefor we can use countif to check if with those same criteria there are any debits values
note this will just test if there is any debits and will multiply the full sum at once

57521153
floating-point	integer
the depth buffer should be of a floating-point format either float 32-bit or half 16-bit
in your 3d to 2d conversion algorithm the resulting x- and y-positions should be of type int or short uchar would limit the resolution to 256x256 while the resulting z-position should be floating-point
this way when two points have similar z-positions of lets say 3.4 and 3.2 the closer one can still be drawn properly while if you would use an integer data type the points would both have a depth of 3 and the on drawn lastly will dictate the pixel color

versioning	upgrade

if you look at the ddl there is limit on size of value that is indexed in myisam tables this default size is also dependent versioning of your mysql now ideal way to create such table is not to use course_name and course_grade as a primary key but rather you should use a uuid or auto gen id and then put a unique index on a combination of course_name and course_grade
in case you still face an issue with that you can also try different fixes mentioned in threads referred in this answer upgrade to higher mysql versioning 5.7+ referrences #1071 - specified key was too long

strictly what you wanted but please read further def to_int string try return int string except valueerror return false but in my opinion it should return none instead of false
boolean can be treated as ints sic etc

57523660
int	boolean
boolean can be treated as int sic etc
so i recommend using def to_int string try return int string except valueerror return none it will help you avoid some strange bugs not mentioning that it simply sounds better
return false when there s a complimentary case when true can be returned as well

for-loop	arrays

declare two variables as indices in the for-loop
here you are the program output is 10.0 7.0 50.0 1.2 4.2 6.8 8.9 7.9 8.6 2.1 3.2 4.7 8.9 0.8 in fact you need not to define a second arrays

57524304
for-loop	loops

try using a for-loop instead of a foreach
this will then set the name property using indexes rather than spitting out the same name for each item in loops

57524758
for-loop	loops

if you need help understanding classes here is a link to the docs for python one other note is that your update_list function definition is inside your for-loop
you probably aren t trying to constantly redefine that function so best practice would be to move that outside loops and just call it as needed

57524786
versioning	upgrade

chart.js stopped using iframe in versioning 2.7.0 released almost 2 years ago at time of writing

for-loop	arrays
f you want to print all the div s use this code and as pointed out in ankur sinha s answer if you want to select all the div s that have only class name then you have to use select like this but if there are multiple div s that satisfy this property use this just to continue ankur sinha when you use select or even just soup this forms a arrays so that s why i used len to figure out the length of the arrays
then i ran a for-loop on this and then printed the select function at i starting from 0

o if i subtract a from the length of the string that will give me the string with a chars removed
so it doesn t just work for 3 t works for all positive int except if the length of the string is less than or equal to a in that case t will return a negative number or 0


57525383
next	except

it looks like the lsb pattern is periodic with period 2 10 repeated the next bit is periodic with period 4 1001 repeated and presumably the bit before that has period 8 10010110 repeated
this is somewhat similar to the normal representation of course except that usually the repeating patterns are 01 0011 00001111 etcetera

57526290
for-loop	arrays

you can also use a for-loop or a foreach with references to add this to every person based on some formula if you wish
this is somewhat in bad taste however as arrays make terrible data structures there s no predefined information about what data can be in what data what can be done with that data and so on

57526333
range	max	range	min
turns out that math is really simple to do when we have just min max
this got the range where i wanted

57526361
super	abstract

as i ve already written in the other question super should be called with the class name which is custom_maintenance_notify in your example or because you re using python 3 you can simply use super without parameters
and even if you want to override mail.thread s mail.thread s an abstract model or interface in other languages methods you don t have to inherit again last but not least try to stick to the odoo naming convention

udp	tcp

in current keycloak docker image 6.0.1 the default stack is udp
according to this version 7.0.0 will default to tcp and will also introduce a variable to toggle the stack jgroups_transport_stack

57526845
folder	directory	folder	directory
there should be also be a folder in there with the name of your mediawiki
solution 1 exporting the tables of your mediawiki database make a copy of your entire opt lampp directory somewhere safe
uninstall xampp sudo . opt var uninstall and remove the dir rm -rf opt lampp reinstall xampp use the same version you used previously copy your backed up versions of ib_logfile0 ib_logfile1 and ibdata1 into opt lampp var mysql from your backup copy the entire folder backup lampp var mysql mywiki into the newly install xampp dir opt lampp var mysql start xampp - everything should work

57526975
pull	push
you mention both pull and event
events are by nature push systems - the event is pushed to your code
however there are some systems that produce asynchronous results via an event so i assume that is what you re dealing with here since you specify the data is pulled

57527038
post	get
however post requests are a different issue
i needed to do a similar thing with all requests not just get and all i can say is that there s not straightforward solution at least not one that i ve found and i ve tried everything short of writing my own network driver
i ve tried so many methods shouldoverrideurlloading shouldinterceptrequest custom loadurl and posturl etc. and none of them give a 100 solution

57527038
post	get
so here s what i ve learned if you only need the headers in the get requests that s trivial
simply create an implementation of webviewclient and override shouldoverrideurlloading like this if however you need the headers in other requests specifically post requests there really isn t a perfect solution
many answers tell you to override shouldinterceptrequest but this is unlikely to help

57527075
implements	extends

you can achieve what you want by implements a custom matcher
the matchers jest has can be extended by using the extends method

57527113
dns	spf

i was having a similar issue for the node or subdomain you need to be more specific and know the text of the dns entry you are requesting
a dmarc dns entry is a txt entry as is spf and dkim

57527196
filtering	grouping
if header can be absent then you can filtering header rows using also you can easily test regex for extracting columns even without creaating table like this result 002|michael|57-d costa rica in this example query returns three grouping separated by |
in such way you can easily test your regular expression check if grouping are defined correctly before creating the table with it


57527277
for-loop	loops
at the end of your loops you have where your state that your buffer is 69 long
before the for-loop you have here you use a size of 100 so it works if you first use the above input directly after starting the program


57527581
tidyverse	purrr

the newest tidyverse pattern for iterating over rows is using which works well with spatial objects including the geometry column in sf objects
so something like this to return a bounding box and a grid layout for each row if don t want to use purrr map lapply can be subbed in

57527688
post	get
you can prevent that by filtering before the update like but updating a specific record is usually done differently you usually pass the primary key in the url
so the urls.py looks like then in the view we can pass the item to update to the form in case of a successful post request one usually redirects to a page
this is the well-known post redirect get pattern wiki

57527988
persistent	transient
this property shouldn t exist in the first place an entity shouldn t be in charge of creating daos
but if you really want to stick with that design you need to tell jpa that dao is not a persistent property
that s the role of the transient annotation

57528233
pyenv	virtualenv

i use pyenv to manage my python version
pyenv install 3.7.3 pyenv local 3.7.3 check my python version create the virtualenv with virtualenv python -m virtualenv  then activate the virtualenv source bin activate check your python version you may need to remove the previous virtualenv rm -rf bin

57528817
queue	fifo

use a queue instead of a stack for storing the numbers
stack s are first in last out while queue s are fifo

57529293
put	get
i think you would get the functionality you re looking for without the restrictions of using an alert
you could put a disabled textarea in the modal so that the text couldn t be accidentally changed before the copy paste


57529739
post	get
or a description of http archive format refer to to get valid examples you can export valid examples from zap via the following api endpoints - gets the message with the given id in har format messageshar baseurl start count - gets the http messages sent through by zap in har format optionally filtered by url and paginated with start position and count of messages - gets the http messages with the given ids in har format
if you re sending post data post data ll need to be properly url encoded


57529755
for-loop	loops

you can achieve the output with little change in for-loop
just create new object in start of loops and in list at the end of each loops

57529837
scikit-learn	xgboost

an update to glao s answer and a response to vasim s comment question as of scikit-learn 0.21.3 note that fit_params has been moved out of the instantiation of gridsearchcv and been moved into the fit method
also the import specifically pulls in the scikit-learn wrapper module from xgboost

57530134
mvp	presenter
so if your application is very small and you want to follow no new architecture patterns or have 0 understanding of those use mvc but i highly recommend not to follow mvc in this time
mvp - as mvc applications become difficult to maintain and test applications transitioned towards mvp
model view presenter tried to resolve the problems of mvc and moved business logic to presenter

57530365
children	parent
there is no css selector that can access a parent
there are selectors for targeting children and siblings though
here is a simplified standalone prototype showing how the tilde selector can be used to target siblings

57530554
qobject	qabstracttablemodel	qobject	qabstractlistmodel

you have the following errors you have the following errors in c++ it is not necessary to use q_declare_metatype or qregistermetatype so that the models can be accessed from qml just register the models can be accessed from qml as qobject in q_property the same happens in pyside2
in a model that has 2 columns and n rows the models can be accessed from qml cannot be a qabstractlistmodel so you must change the models can be accessed from qml to qabstracttablemodel

57530730
for-loop	loops
if you re not able to find a non repeating character fast enough the index i will exceed that of check.size exiting the for-loop even though there may be a non repeating character left in the string
to remedy this i would simply use a while loops instead


57530929
margin	height

margin 0 auto property is for block level elements in case you want to center any block level element inside a block level element
1 the block level element that you want to center should have a defined height otherwise margin 0 auto won t work

57530929
margin	text-align	margin	text-align	text-align	height
1 the block level element that you want to center should have a defined height otherwise margin 0 auto won t work
2 you can center inline-block or inline elements using text-align center in parent container as parent treat child element like text
in your case you have defined the #container div as inline-block so margin user-defined auto

57530929
width	margin	width	text-align
in your case you have defined the #container div as inline-block so margin user-defined auto
won t work as it is no more block level element although you have defined a width but it won t work
try to use text-align property in parent.hope the question is answered

put	get
as the mit license would put it the software is provided as is without warranty of any kind express or implied it is much faster than the approach unless you have a cpu with a branch predictor which you likely do
in that case it s slower or maybe equally fast but not faster uglier less portable and will likely get you killed by a psychopath


57531613
client-side	server-side

your razor code runs server-side before the client has even received the page
long and short if you want to update the value you have to do it via client-side means namely javascript you can t use something like asp-route-offset at all because the offset is coming from the client and can t be used to generate the post url

57531679
crypt	hash

the crypt function returns a pointer to a static data buffer
that means that each time you call crypt that static data changes so hash points to a buffer that changes on each iteration

not the best solution but this works when i open the project under the android folder i am able to run the gradle sync
the project is when i am opening the project from a top level directory i run into the issue

57531939
for-loop	loops
s has been stated in previous answers comments you are re-declaring and initializing to zero the index variable in the while loops which causes that only the first zero arrays position is updated when displaying the arrays to the console you will be displaying the arrays content 8 times since you have a for-loop counting from 0 to 8 and then have the foreach loops interacting over the arrays
you should have only one of the loops i hope this helps

57532485
folder	directory
t basically does the same thing as the other answer but via a gui and you don t have to manually remove all files directory one-by-one
just drag vs code from the applications folder into app cleaner then app cleaner will find all the related files for you and then you just have to click on the remove button

dictionary	map

create a new dictionary by swapping key with values of list
next map df.a with the swapped dictionary

57532684
dictionary	map
next map df.a with the swapped dictionary
note i directly use keys of your dictionary as values of h instead of g1 g2 ..
because i think it is enough to identify each group of values

57532709
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

google-chrome will usually ignore errors and carry on
safari is probably a different problem - filters can only be referenced after safari ve been defined firefox s a bug - so if you move that defs section directly beneath the svg the svg should work in safari

57532835
versioning	upgrade

this is an issue with the included versioning of sqlite on centos 7 being quite old
here s how i solved it iirc upgrade the centos 7 system install of sqlite to 3.29 by compiling it from source

57532921
setinterval	settimeout	setinterval	settimeout
also there is no reason to create an endless chain of closures by recursively calling settimeout
you can achieve the same effect with an external setinterval call.
if you use settimeout at least get rid of the useless closure and call settimeout starttime 500 directly

57532988
post	get
if you checkout the np.pad documentation you can see available options or see the end of this post
with the wrap option you get a result like this though i suspect the phase is a mess so you should make sure this meets your needs

spaces	delimiter

here we re converting newlines in the output of grep into spaces
update as has been pointed out in a comment xargs also takes a newline delimiter stream and converts a newline delimiter stream to space delimiter by default so the above could be written like this

57533148
post	get

the problem lies in that you are doing a post request and if the person making use of your web page refreshes it it does what it is supposed to do resubmit the post request
hence there is no way of preventing this issue from happening what you could rather do is changing the way you obtain the values from a post request to get request

57533382
int	chars
hat strictly leads to undefined behaviour the value being printed is not representable as both int and unsigned int and hexadecimal formatting assumes unsigned int but you usually get what you see
you could use hhx to print the value being printed as unsigned chars if your system supports c99 format strings


57533446
nswindowcontroller	nsviewcontroller
f - you are using nsviewcontroller as in ios... - you want to use logic in a nsviewcontroller derived class instead of in nswindowcontroller is useless setting delegate in windowdidload or awakefromnib  i need nswindowcontroller in a multiplatform ios os project so you must set nswindowcontroller in viewwillappear
even if nswindowcontroller will be called even on resuming from background


57533604
zlib	system.io.compression
there are other mathematically equivalent ways such as checking for negatives with 2 the builtin system.io.compression namespace is lacking in a number of ways
for one it doesn t even support decompressing zlib data which is what your byte array holds
the best way is to use a third party package on nuget instead

57533926
versioning	upgrade

i used to have the same error with robo 3t 1.2.1 i updated the robo 3t versioning to 1.3 and the robo worked again which uses the mongodb internal client 4.0 but as stated on their website their only recommend up to mongo 4.0
robo 3t 1.3 brings you support for mongodb 4.0 and scram-sha-256 an upgrade mongo shell support for importing from mongodb srv connection strings among many other fixes and improvements

57534121
ciimage	cifilter
cifilter is not thread safe
you cannot form a chain of filters on one thread and then render the resulting ciimage on another thread
you should confine yourself to small images and do everything on the main thread and render explicitly using the gpu

57534691
rsa	aes
this works also note that you need to call the .read method of random
apart from that that is not what rsa is meant for
if you want to encrypt data using rsa you should use rsa for key encapsulation only and encrypt the data using a symmetric crypto system aes

57534968
implements	extends
thus this is not a general workaround to solve all cases
if you still want to check method overrides for the project entities consider the following steps this is just one possible solution compute transitive closure of the implements relation

interpolation	splines
if what you need is a continuous 2nd derivative then you re indeed after a cubic splines which is nothing but a collection of cubics on successive intervals hence piecewise which are matched up to the 2nd derivative
depending on whether you want interpolation match the data points exactly or fitting your data contain the signal and some noise and you want to extract the former you are after either cubicspline or splrep bspline


57536278
spaces	delimiter
your output appears quite regular where the values to be formatted after removing all spaces always start at position ten and consist of 32 characters so i used those features
removing the spaces allows one to return the 16 pairs of values as an array
textjoin can then join that array with a space delimiter

57536394
int	double	int	double
__begin is an iterator to double
you should not use datatype unsigned int to store these values

i might have some additional ways to achieve what you are after. i used the deviceproperties of the unified device model to get this information. this can also be achieved using the setupapi. using the setupapi you can use the setupdicreatedeviceinfolist function to get a handle to a device information set containing info about all devices or the devices belonging to a setup class of your choice

margin	height

if you remove this line on hover the divs no longer jump margin -11px 0px
so the divs should be update to fix the partners hover as well i recommend also removing the same margin style as before setting the height to hover and rather than a fixed height use something like height auto with padding 20px 0

57536660
margin	height
o it should be update to fix the partners hover as well i recommend also removing the same margin style as before setting the height to hover and rather than a fixed height use something like height auto with padding 20px 0
please see my example below for the new classes new css codepen link here update the fix if you want to stop the top section pushing the partners div down you will need to set a fixed height for the container around it to account for the extra height on hover

this failure was obvious in the c users your_user_name appdata roaming npm-cache _logs files once i realized to look there

57537487
range	minimum

if the pixel values range from 0 to 255 and you want the pixel values to be normalized between 0.0f and 1.0f you should just divide the pixel values with 255
so you should have instead of this is because if your pixel value is at instead of this maximum it will be 255 so if you divide by 255.0f the result will be 1.0f and if your pixel value is at the result minimum so it is equal to 0 if you divide with 255.0f you will get 0f

57537528
width	height
so you two options 1 add a height and width constraint to each collection view
2 set distribution of the stack as fill equally if you want the collection views to have the same width
pd watching your design i think you should use three tableviews instead of collectionviews

57537570
odoo	qweb
so you can do it like this according to the example from odoo orm api documentation filtered returns a recordset containing only records satisfying the provided predicate function

hash	salt	salt	md5
i can think of two possible workarounds that may help 1 in addition to the md5 + salt method opencart will also accept a plain md5 hash password as well
you could add a couple lines of code in to customer library to convert those passwords to plain md5 hash like this
note the exact placement and syntax depend on your opencart version which you did not provide

so basically it s for bash nerds who want to use typescript for small scripts that would be a pain to write as bash scripts
i m still baffled that ts-node doesn t cover this case and i d rather not have to futz with temp files that might get left behind and waste space if there s an error but so far this covers my use-case
besides i ve got that cronjob that deletes everything in tmp that s more than 31622400 seconds old every night so stray temp files can t eat my whole system.

57538357
for-loop	loops
looking at the outer for-loop which is the block containing this output we see so what this means is that for an input of n items loops will always execute exactly n times
in this case n is 4 so loops executes 4 times but the list is sorted after 3 iterations
ok so we ve found the problem

57538357
for-loop	loops
he first is to use a different looping condition such as setting up a while loops to execute until loops is sorted rather than looping a specific number of times
however this particular code seems like a school exercise in which case this particular code s possible that you re required to use the for-loop syntax as part of the exercise constraints

he fill_byte 0xa5 is written over all malloc d memory as we receive the fill_byte 0xa5 and is written over everything that we free up during a clear_pool

mp3	ogg	mp3	ogg
i recommend using the ogg format instead of mp3 as ogg does not add any silence to the start of the track
switching to the ogg format certainly made an improvement but there was still a small pause between loops
incidentally just converting from mp3 to ogg won t remove the silence automatically

int	double
i used floats and int here to demonstrate that it will work with those limitations but you could use double to gain accuracy

57540248
rank	max
efine mutation and breeding functions could actually be quite hard and i think it s off-topic here but in the end your program steps should look like this generate first generation somehow trying to come up with different functions that pass the simulation even if badly iterate the fallowing breed couples of functions coming up with new functions that have some of both the parents mutate the previous generation functions to make even more new functions run the simulation with each new function and rank both the parents with the fitness function use some sort of discrimination to pick only the best functions for next breed mutation steps
you can actually set this discriminant at each iteration so you can control your population for example if too many specimen pass you ll find yourself with a lot of computation to do probably useless so you can make it more difficult to make it to the next gen by rising the required fitness on the other hand if you find that results aren t getting better between iterations maybe you are locked in some local max and should lean the requirements so that more different specimen are allowed to spawn and they may lead to better future solutions

bash	subshell
hile gnu awk provides asorti to allow sorting the contents of an array in this case since it is just the output you want sorted a single pipe to sort after your awk script completes is all you need and since a single pipe is a single pipe of the output you incur no per-iteration overhead for the subshell required by a single pipe
if you want to avoid a single pipe altogether if you have bash you can simply use process-substitution with redirection if you have gnu awk then asorti will sort a by index and you can place the sorted array in a new array b and then output the sorted results within the end rule

maven	pom.xml

to copy the java source into the main jar file you can use resouces copy-resources please note however that this is not the standard approach to provide java sources with maven and should only be used for very special use cases
the standard approach is to enable the release-profile which uses the maven-source-plugin to create a secondary -sources jar containing only the sources defined in the maven super pom.xml

int	double
since c++11 the standard function std pow has a specific overload for int numbers
in that case your arguments will be converted in their double s representation
is there any way to catch overflow ... yes the standard function already provides a mechanism for error handling

put	get
use this function to convert your collection to the json you want and this is same way to get total amount
just put an foreach and add each amount to a variable that initialized with 0
and there is other ways like change toarray function in your resource collection

strcpy	strncpy

removing nullbytes x00 from shellcode is only necessary if you are using functions that depend on a trailing x00 such as strcpy which copies the c string pointed by source into the array pointed by destination including the terminating null character and stopping at that point
however strncpy copies the first num characters of source to destination padding it with zeros until num characters have been written to destination

children	parent
this way we can answer the following in good enough time if the need be given a parentid fetch all or a subset paginated or lazy load of it s children
given a childid fetch it s parent
as the fetching could be slow i would rather recommend a paginated load

57543762
range	min
be careful at the left or right end of list b however so you do not get an index out of range error
note that this is probably faster than using the min function or any other linear search through b

vim	emacs
i m pretty sure that somebody will once have difficulty with which is obvious for you
i currently write from my laptop with not a very large screen and have only one window in vim but i write in conformance with pep 8 which says limiting the required editor window width makes it possible to have several files open side-by-side and works well when using code review tools that present the two versions in adjacent columns
pep 257 recommends docstrings which will work well with emacs fill-paragraph

if you do so you should be explicit about your types insert into testmap sensor_id timestamp value values 1 now r

post	get
parameters in this case are included in the soap request payload
since you don t have a web service then your server likely doesn t support the post method on the http request which is likely why you re getting the 405 method not allowed error
if you have an extension of xml in your url then the xml data provider will do a get request and include the parameters in the query string of the url for example

get calls only needed the access-control-allow headers whereas for options calls i also needed to manipulate the statuscode because axois.post is calling first with options-method before sending the post
if options return statuscode 405 the post will never be sent
this solved my problem

instead it might run with the current directory set to the root folder of the whole project
you can get the value of the current working directory by running and printing the return value of new file . .getabsolutepath

floating-point	fractions	fractions	radix
using the cast workaround with the code in the question yields note that a static assertion is required to ensure that the floating-point radix is as expected for this kludge to operate
the code should also include documentation explaining this bad idea the binary representation for the fractions ⅓ ends in an infinite sequences of 01010101
when the binary for 4 3 or 7 3 is rounded to a fixed precision it is as if the numeral were truncated and rounded down or up depending on whether the next binary digit after truncation were a 0 or a 1

57548123
onchange	onkeyup
where as onchange event occurs when the element loses focus
use oninput or onkeyup instead as you want the hash to update as the content of the passwordcheck box changes remove the listener from the from
pass the updated value to sha1 function by using event.target.value instead of global msg variable

57548433
multiplying	multiplication
hanks to that we can multiplying the values by multiples of 2 depending on how far along multiples of 2 are on the so your example if we sort it like that becomes next we ll create the multiplication depending on where the values stand on the column axis
we can then multiplying them which outputs and if we want to get the inital order of the dataframe we flip the values which outputs finally we put it back in a dataframe i think this might be a bit convoluted but each step should be clear


57548518
versioning	upgrade
sing the versioning in the standard helm charts repository you can say something like # i am requirements.yaml - name redis versioning 9.0.2 repository the important detail here is that your application and its redis will have the same helm release name -- if your application is ignoble-hyena-myapp then your application is ignoble-hyena-myapp will be ignoble-hyena-redis-master
you can set this in your deployment yaml spec using templates because of the way kubernetes works internally even if you helm upgrade your chart to a newer image tag it won t usually touch its redis

check if sidenav have the background-blend-mode property and removeit


57548666
setinterval	settimeout

a couple of things to consider would be avoid using setinterval which can produce jumpy animation behavior if the interval callback takes longer to execute that the duration of the interval of itself
instead use settimeout if inter-frame delays are needed consider using window.requestanimationframe to update the progress bar s animation

sorting	filtering
note about third step segment s1 is considered to be below another segment s2 if orientation of s2 which endpoints are taken in ascending order by x coordinate with both endpoints of s1 is not counterclockwise s1 is never on the left side of s2 if we are moving on s2
time complexity notes since in the beginning of the d c algorithm we are sorting points lexicographically by x and then by y building of the sub-triangulations convex hull will be o n no sorting is needed where n is the number of points in both sub-triangulations
we can use containers with o 1 lookup like hash tables of sub-triangulations edges and filtering out in o n

57548818
implements	extends
hat i advise you in your code is to not use any wildcard and possibly even remove e extends lselement.
i don t see what your code brings you you can implements what you want with only a move generic type that you carry in all your classes as this is the only thing that is generic in your dijkstra

post	get

here is how i think it can be done but without api we do need to click on the latest post first and have the cors allow extension first a set interval in the browser console then ajax to request the page that contains the post number and then a regex to extract the cors and an if condition to compare the results then if the number isn t changed make the number isn t changed retry again after 45 sec .
and when the number gets changed we do a .click action on the next button to get the next post then fill the text bar with the comment then .click action on the post button

filtering	grouping
f you want to see the total transactions per day as implied by your column headings just add in parttran.sysdate and grouping on you want to see the total transactions per day as implied by your column headings
however be advised that you want to see the total transactions per day as implied by your column headings is much more common to break these out by trantype to see how the materials are being used accounting for net quantities and filtering out transaction types that are innocuous but this goes a little beyond the scope of the question

width	height

for the x position make sure layout is set to 0 for min an max width textpainter.layout minwidth 0 maxwidth 0
for the y position you have to substract the height of the text itself here is an example code to use this function call _drawtextat a offset 20 20 canvas

57549142
ienumerable	ilist

i suspect the main problem you are encountering is the fact that indexing into ienumerable is not possible
i would guess that ilist may be a more appropriate interface for the items which would allow greater control over the items in general

if you prefer to inject factory method directly via function scalamock has support for mocking functions

for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
another problem you read in 20 values into an arrays
therefore you dont need 2 nested for-loop
one loops which counts to 20 is enough to do that task

57551178
keras	tensorflow

you probably need to pass argument to reduce_sum function in order to keep the dimensions with length 1 otherwise the shape of out would be batch_size whereas the dense layer expects batch_size n update the input of keras layers must be the output of other keras layers
therefore if you want to use tensorflow operations you need to wrap tensorflow operations inside a lambda layer in keras

swift	objective-c
for more information the relevant swift code is on page 10 with a small error corrected below of the session s pdf
i imagine that you ll still have to follow the typical real-time audio rules when using this no allocating freeing memory no objective-c calls no locking or waiting on locks etc.
a ring buffer may still be helpful here

57551394
subobject	instances
d and c are bound to the d and c subobject of e respectively
you start the lookup for the setter set_c in the d subobject of e
this means that the instances of b it will find and associate the setter with is that one that resides in the d object

57551560
inherited	properties
because bindableobject is abstract class also implements inotifypropertychanged interface so you can use bindableobject implement notification function
i want to declare bindableproperty inside viewmodelbase i don t know why you want to declare bindableproperty in viewmodelbase if you want to do this you must inherited bindableobject class
getvalue bindableproperty and setvalue are used to access the values of properties that are implemented by a bindableproperty these methods are adstract bindableaobject method

57551560

oncreate	findviewbyid	setcontentview	findviewbyid
looks like your activity set the content view to the activity_display_message.xml layout in your setcontentview in your oncreate function
hence the findviewbyid will only find the references from that layout only
the circleimageview is defined in a different layout which is not inflated in your activity and hence while you are doing findviewbyid r.id.circleimage

57552053
hive	hdfs

you can create a hive table on top of this folder read data from that table
you can write a simple logic in spark to read this folder with multiple files and write this folder to another hdfs location as a single file using reparation 1 or coalesce 1 and read data from another hdfs location

imageview	fresco
y issue was that i couldn t use a placeholderimage in a simpledraweeview which is a part of fresco library of facebook if you didn t knew
but since an imageview is not much complex like a simpledraweeview and as the workaround worked with simpledraweeview even though i haven t tried an imageview with an imageview an imageview might surely work with an imageview too


57553453
for-loop	loops	dictionary	map
in python a for-loop over a dictionary object iterates over the keys
thefore l1 will contain the following string values during the iterations key3 key4 map sub since these are all strings l1.sub is nonexistent and therefore the third loops is never executed
now to fix this you need to think about what the data means

57553514
vsts	tfs
when azure devops tfs then re-attempts a new build and to write to recreate the files that already exist it fails and the above error is displayed
the best resolution is to log in to the agent machine manually navigate to the affected directory file in this example c vsts _work xxx xx .tmp and delete the file folder in question
removing the offending items will effectively clean slate the next build definition execution which should then complete without issue

57553536

folder	dir
if you for example have a folder where each child folder is a mounted network drive you could easily collect all those folder and the run your walk in parallel for each

it would work only if all or most of your network drives share the same mount point parent

if the second div is non floated the blue div will remain full width and only the text will float around the red one

i can t speak with authority on couchdb setup but can share some of cloudant s experiences on the topic

57553933
disk	ram
loudant s db nodes all have large amounts of ram as this gives the erlang vm room to breathe once the number of requests each node needs to handle grow
in terms of ssds a well-configured couchdb system should be able to saturate the erlang host s disk io and for this reason we run cloudant on bare-metal with local disk

folder structure should be standard you can also use docker to create the zipped linux compatible library and upload docker in aws lambda layers
below are the tested commands to create the zipped library for aws lambda layer create and navigate to a directory write the below commands in dockerfile and exit by ctrl + d you can provide any name for the image run the image specify the package which you want to zip in requirements.txt and exit by ctrl + d you can try using correct file structure python lib python3.6 site-packages here but i did not test it yet navigate to the below directory create a zip file you should be able to see a layers.zip file in aws1 folder

it gets destroyed at the end of the expression
the destructor fflush the buffer into the log so that you don t have to explicitly call a fflush function you may add endl there as well if you wish


57554347
margin	height
if you want to have vertical margins based on the height you can simply put an empty div with height x
to emulate a margin
remember that for percents to work well all dimensioning in the hierarchy should be in percent too chrome may sometimes add extra rules for things to dimension well when it s not the normal behaviour so i wouldn t myself base my styling on chrome only

57554447
ostringstream	std

the simplest approach is to return a temporary proxy from the first - this can either log your stream for the duration and unlock on destruction or simply build a local ostringstream and flush a local ostringstream in a single call again on destruction
holding a lock while logging isn t great for performance although a local ostringstream s better than your existing log method which should use std lock_guard for exception safety

57554447
ostringstream	std
olding a lock while logging isn t great for performance although t s better than your existing log method which should use std lock_guard for exception safety
building and discarding a temporary ostringstream is probably better but if you care about performance you ll need to benchmark and may well end up requiring something more elaborate per-thread circular buffers mmapped files or something

prop	each

to set the min and max values of an input use jquery s prop method

pillow	wand
here are some ideas.
method 1 - use pil pillow instead of opencv pil pillow can write dpi information into png files
so you would step 1 - convert your bgr opencv image into rgb to match pil s channel ordering step 2 - convert opencv numpy array onto pil image step 3 - write with pil as fred mentions in the comments you could equally use python wand in much the same way

57555123
imagemagick	wand
so you would step 1 - convert your bgr opencv image into rgb to match pil s channel ordering step 2 - convert opencv numpy array onto pil image step 3 - write with pil as fred mentions in the comments you could equally use python wand in much the same way
method 2 - write with opencv but modify afterwards with some tool you could use python s subprocess module to shell out to say imagemagick and set the dpi like this magick opencvimage.png -set units pixelspercentimeter -density 28.3 result.png all you need to know is that png uses metric dots per centimetre rather than imperial dots per inch and there are 2.54cm in an inch so 72 dpi becomes 28.3 dots per cm
if your imagemagick version is older than v7 replace magick with convert

following is the way to do that if you want to dynamically allocate array which is reside in the heap memory then you could do the following you have to call malloc to allocate memory in the heap
call free when you re done with array otherwise it will lead to memory leak


57555724
google-chrome	firefox
to change preferences in google-chrome visit google-chrome flags
firefox supports this since 57 version
also this can be called only from a handler of some user action

setinterval	settimeout	clearinterval	settimeout
causes sinon to replace the global settimeout cleartimeout setinterval clearinterval and date with a custom implementation which is bound to the returned clock object
support for this seems also be available without sinon.js in lolex fake settimeout and friends collectively known as timers
useful in your javascript tests

57556004
keras	tensorflow
please check out issue in tensorflow github repository unable to use featurecolumn with keras functional api #27416 1
there you will find useful comments about tf.feature_column and keras functional api
because you ask about general approach i would just copy the snippet with example from the link above

57556178
purrr	broom
broom tidy summarises key objects from statistical ouput into a tibble
purrr map_df applies function to each element in this case a column and returns a tibble
example results

57556479
put	get

you would put your game in a lazy_static with a mutex around it
every invocation of the game_loop it will try to get the lock on said mutex and then perform game calculations

57556624
for-loop	arrays
then using range i will make a list from 0 to the length of my arrays
and then with the for-loop we will iterate through the newly created list
here in my case since my list contains 10 dataframes it ll go from 0 to 9

57556653
implements	extends
imagine there is an interface idostuff and there is a library that extends idostuff
you have a class myclass that implements idostuff and somewhere someone uses the extension method against the interface
it looks like this

57556749
int	chars

as you can see from the error message postgresql expects that you call function inserttest int unknown unknown unknown unknown int int int
all parameters of type chars varying are not regarded as such and therefore the inputs will be cast to unknown

57556872
next	except
for example consider a stateless web service that displays a list of results with a link to the next page
when the user clicks that link we want to run the exact same query except that the iteration should start where we stopped on the previous page.


57557056
ssl	https

thanks ibnpetr is true what you say the config.php doesn t need any configuration for additional ssl now this work it
the problem is that the intermediate organization that issues the certificate does not automatically recognize it in the operating system as if it is chorme or mozilla and validates it in this case you need to enter the entity s certificate to the entity s list to validate the entity s certificate if the entity s certificate is given if you do not have the entity s certificate we check that with the wget command https if there is an error you have to do the entity s certificate manually as i said before

57557246
width	height
then use css styling width 400px
height 300px on your canvas
now you ll be able to create sharp half-width lines so long as the device you re drawing to supports the higher resolution

57557249
hash	md5
not knowing your potential number of unique log messages and their length i somewhat doubt that the memory footprint of your cache would be significant if you just stored the message strings directly
if you wish to use checksums nevertheless i d recommend the builtin hash instead
md5 is a cryptographic hash function hence rather costly compared to hash

57557249
hash	md5
md5 is a cryptographic hash function hence rather costly compared to hash
the time required to hash a byte- string scales with its size
using timeit we can time short portions of python code

57557624
jobs	cron
django and postgres use read committed isolation level which means that queries in your cron job will see new objects once the transactions have been committed
i ve added comments to your code to explain the issue you can avoid the error by using list to force the jobs queryset to be evaluated at the beginning of the script


57557713
bmp	png
png
bmp or any of the other common image formats the type of image format will also influence the number of face images or fingerprint images you will save
for example

57557713
bmp	png
for example
bmp images may take more space than
png or

57557885
filtering	grouping
fter that you are able to filtering whatever you want within the where clause
the resulting records the relevant assessment objects can be grouping with json_agg aggregate function select json_agg assessments from -- query from above s where session_id in 3 and section_id in 4 and subject_id in 9 -- only one subject and student_id in 2 or select json_agg assessments from -- query from above s where session_id in 3 and section_id in 4 and subject_id in 8 9 10 -- more subjects and student_id in 2


57558517
do.call	lapply
ote the use of vapply instead of lapply sum expects an atomic vector we can t pass a list in your second function you can capture .
and work with the captured variable for more complex arguments roland s comment is a good alternative modify the function arguments as a list and pass good alternative to do.call


57558646
hash	salt

technically you can find a user if you know the username and the passwort hash
however since the hash usually is salt with a random salt you can t find a user by username and plain text password

57558828
gradle	ivy
if you are not using a dependency management tool i would recommend using maven gradle or if you are using ant
ivy
if you are using cucumber through another project you should use the groupid and version that project recommends

57558829
getattr	subclassing
bar will be found in the wrapped b so this returns a bound method self being the wrapped b not the wrapper def __getattr__ self name if hasattr self.wrapped name return getattr self.wrapped name i m not sure what you re trying to accomplish here
it seems that subclassing or adding the behavior directly to the class may be preferable to doing this
it is said that you have to be twice as clever to debug code as to write it

57558932
sudo	passwd

in my case didn t have the right autentication permission for root user. i knew that because logged to database just only tipying that sudo mysql so once logged into mysql i typed that select user authentication_string plugin host from mysql.user
and saw the value auth_socket in the plugin column of root user. so i typed that alter user root localhost identified with mysql_native_password by passwd

57558966
minimum	max
ou could also give input a default value of which would allow the client not to provide the input argument at all while still relaying the min and max default values to the resolver
if however your intent is to provide the minimum and maximum values to your client in order to drive some client-specific logic like validation drop down menu values etc then you should not utilize default values for this


57558978
pull	push
n tfs 2015 through tfs 2018 update 2 the exempt from policy enforcement permission allows users with this permission to perform the following actions when completing a pull request opt-in to override policies and complete a pull request even if the current set of branch policies is not satisfied
push directly to a branch even if a branch has branch policies set


57559028
union	distinct

you can here make a union of two queries that are never evaluated individually like since qa and qb are lazy querysets we never evaluate these
the query that will be performed is select mymodel.a from mymodel where mymodel.a like query union select mymodel.b from mymodel where mymodel.b like query the union furthermore will only select distinct values

57559326
put	get
xample i used type as an extra get parameter to define that the template should not be rendered then you can use the env callback to render the template in example i used an async loader
you can use new promise to load both the model and the view and afterwards check with promise.all to put both together and render the template


57559791
min	max

generally setting a min isn t fully supported in most modern browsers but looking at the css 4 spec
there are functions for max and min

57559791
min	max
there are functions for max and min
example alternatively you can use a css preprocessor or perhaps even a post processor to min the value from the calc


57559829
ready	each
ou re using a-la-carte if you re importing vuetify from vuetify lib the downside of a-la-carte is that you need to manually import each vuetify component you want to use to make this less a hassle you can either use vuetify-loader vuetify-loader will automatically add those imports for you if you set vuetify-loader up correctly
globally load components you use a lot normal mode if you import vuetify directly you import vuetify directly ll automatically load all you import vuetify directly components for you and is ready to use without further configuration


57559851
urdu	arabic
rabic letters are used to write pashto farsi urdu and few other languages
the letters that were used in arabic farsi and may be a couple more languages were assigned different codes for each form of the a couple more languages letters

versioning	upgrade

this message can appear although there are valid replicaset members available if you re using a deprecated versioning of the mongodb driver as mentionned in thanks brasskazoo for pointing this message out
you should check your versioning and upgrade if necessary

57560367
ready	each

i haven t ready the full question but it sounds like the 0xa5a5a5a5a5 value is a symptom of bit decompression similar to bit rot
basically the laminated structure of 0xffffffff 0b11111111111111111111111111111111 starts to peel apart and the 1 s drift away from each other

pyinstaller has been used successfully with aix solaris and freebsd but is not tested against aix solaris and freebsd


57561150
for-loop	arrays

we create another for-loop starting at the current index and end at current index + interval which will allow us to assign the value in your case 1 to those indices
we also check to see if the current index we re looping through is greater than the data length - 1 to ensure no arrays index out of bonds for non-even arrays sizes

healpy	matplotlib
if you re just interested in plotting lines on a different projection i recommend you check out matplotlib s projections
for healpy please find a quick example below


57561528
children	parent

basically the autolayout was not adjusting the superview s height that held all the children views which had the gesturerecognizers
so even thought the labels were still visible the labels weren t receiving the gestures because the labels were outside the bounds of the parent

57561607
for-loop	loops

you can only use a for-loop in functions or procedures using language plpgsql
sql has no for loops

57562103
subclass	inherited

this answer will work with the assumption that for some reason you really need or want to have toytruck be a subclass of truck
as mentioned in the question and reiterated in the comments the issue is when your subclass inherited methods your subclass does not need

57562103
inherited	subclassing
s mentioned in the question and reiterated in the comments the issue is when your subclassing inherited methods the issue does not need
actually the issue is more severe than having a class inherited methods the issue does not need


57562103
lsp	principles
as mentioned in the comments this risk is what is captured by the liskov substitution principles lsp a solution that respects the lsp would behave correctly even if an instance of truck is substituted by an instance of any subclass of truck
for a solution that does respect the lsp aim for a design where truck defines methods that apply to all subclasses then write subclasses to incrementally add more specialized methods based on the services you need
for example you could have both toytruck and gasolinetruck as subclasses with addgasoline only defined in gasolinetruck

57562528
punctuation	words
you can also use the tidytext package
the unnest_tokens function will automatically strip punctuation
you probably also want to get rid of stop words which you can do with something like this see here for more

57562564
move	drag
click on togetexistingitem button and then try this demo drag outside block 304 305 306 into grey box
it will change values try to move other blocks which were already added 301 302
the value of recently added blocks wont change

57563617
for-loop	loops

you should create a list outside of the for-loop
then in loops you append to that list

57563705
width	font-size
and do not mention any width for
also you don t have to reduce font-size so drastically for mobile resolutions
i have not reduced it at all

57564036
post	get

luckily there is a great python example for making a post request to iap in the python-docs-samples sample repo
if you copy that script into your repo and get your client id using the same steps for nodejs this script this script should trigger the dag just as nodejs did

57564059
matlab	simulink
this will give you a results object that you can easily query to control the exit code for your matlab
if you were to run your simulink test files thus that should do the trick
you can modify this additionally to save off the testsuite or testcase as you like

57564118
short	base
ou can just include them the way them are btw because you are not using any other table to base your months on you will only get months with counts for months which have issue s in them
to overcome this you could use another table which keeps all months and any data you want to have for each month days in it short form yearly quarter holidays etc and left join issue_month to said table and group by the main months table


57564132
post	put
r if you specify additional pre- and post conditions the problem with is that you would assume that the following catch will actually catch all the exceptions but that is not the case and the case happens only if you wait or await for the case
simply put the case is way more complex to do the case properly


57564531
build.gradle	gradlew

it would be great if you please share the build.gradle that s failing to build
please apply the plugin for allprojects if it s a multi-module gradlew project

57564845
int	double
this is true regardless of whether the call is made directly or through a function pointer
for a practical example consider the x86 platform int values are returned in the eax register so the compiler has to generate code to fetch the return value from there
double values are returned on the floating-point stack so the compiler has to generate code to fetch the return value from there

57565237
tax	shipping

we can set the flattax to be inclusive by adding the following to we shop.yml and flushing the site cache silvershop model modifiers tax flattax exclusive false by checking the src model modifiers tax flattax.php we can see what the config settings are for the flattax class
we can also change the flat tax rate and the name of the flat tax like so silvershop model modifiers tax flattax exclusive false rate 0.20 name vat by checking the src model modifiers shipping simple.php we can see what the config settings are for the simple shipping class

57565237

57565731
hide	show

you want to hide the rows from 28 to 37 when the checkbox of a27 is unchecked
when the checkbox of a27 is checked you want to show the rows

57566136
udp	tcp

since udp datagrams are typically less than 1500 bytes to avoid fragmentation and in all cases are 65507 bytes since that is the maximum datagram size the udp protocol supports you can always make your receive buffer 65507 bytes long or smaller if you want to save a bit on ram usage
for tcp the udp protocol is stream-based so the amount of data written in to your recv-buffer by a given recv call is unrelated to packet sizes

57566286
dplyr	tidyr

using dplyr we can create a column with row_number to get the common words in each id
we use tidyr separate_rows to separate words into different rows filter only those comments which occur in more than 1 row group_by id and create a comma-separated string

57566333
client-side	server-side
web browsers cap the number of simultaneous requests around 6 10 from this post so if you can perform a request a get a response in 200ms you re still looking at a full minute of client-side requests
if instead you built a server-side solution to aggregate the data you could query your custom endpoint to retrieve larger chunks of data at a time
if that isn t an option for you then either way the browser request limit will probably be your bottleneck

57566342
junit	mockito
there is no need to declare a class implementing the interface and overriding interface methods as an intermediary it works directly on the interface
junit test demonstrating all the aspect-introduced features please note that the classes above just use system.out.println no logging framework
thus the test uses for injecting a mockito mock in order to verify the expected logging behaviour

57566366
for-loop	arrays
s the only way you could delete sub_array is inside the block scope sub_array was declared which is the for-loop if you do delete sub_array then will be a dangling pointer a pointer that points to a freed or invalid memory block and dangling pointers are evil
what you should do about arrays and sub_array is when a freed or invalid memory block and dangling pointers are not needed anymore you first iterate through all elements of arrays deleting each one of a freed or invalid memory block and dangling pointers and after this delete arrays itself


57567175
submit	submission
triggers - form submit this way you can process the exact values from the form and use the same function you are using now
instead of fetching the last row values you can fetch the values from the form submission using this


57567223
qthread	qmainwindow

since you are creating a pyqt5 application i guess your best bet is to use a qthread for the blocking part and emit a signal every time new data is generated
one way would be to make randomdatageneration a subclass of qthread and implement run to use the thread you could subclass qmainwindow and create an instance of randomdatageneration in there

57567223
qthread	qmainwindow
one way would be to make randomdatageneration a subclass of qthread and implement run to use the thread you could subclass qmainwindow and create an instance of randomdatageneration in there
subclassing qmainwindow has an additional advantage that you can move the gui setup and the signal-slot connections in there as well the main part then becomes


57567533
sudo	passwd

the correct way is to login to my-sql with sudo privilege
enter your database passwd and then updating your database passwd using where new-password is your new database passwd or what you want once this is done stop and start the mysql server

57567627
jobs	cron
freeze partition method 3 - you can check this project link this tool is of very easy clickhouse backup and restore with s3 support easy creating and restoring backups of all or specific tables you can write youre queries and cron jobs support of incremental backups on s3
simple cron script for daily backup and uploading method 4 - binary copy of data directory
for non-replicated tables stop the server rsync scp etc.

57567672
post	get

prerequisites it would be best if you can describe how you install your flutter or dark sdk in your post
otherwise please ensure the you followed the instructions here suggestion when you are trying to create a project try to run the following for flutter flutter packages get for dart pub get packages

57567695
for-loop	arrays
so the memory allocated to he arrays remains same
other issues the first for-loop in deleteelement should run till j length - 1
the for-loop creates a local variable i which shadows the i variable in outer scope so the outer i is never updated and always remains 0

folder	directory
ee this document the rootdir directory should be the path of the item which is being executed
i can only find the xx.targets file in custom_build_rules folder so i think this document will try to find the win_bison.exe under that path


57568954
button	checkbox

if you are using google tag manager you can use datalayer.push to push to an array which can be used to differentiate the clicks based on the interaction. approach is described here google analytics custom dimensions in your particular case you could have the datalayer configured to add the different key values for the different report components and then the trigger will be configured to fire when the download button is clicked
for example on each of the checkbox you could have you d probably better having an array to store this info

57569243
subtract	add
to calculate the layer center you take and distances from the left top corner of the document to the top left corner of the layer and add half of the width and half of the height
and then to calculate the deltas you subtract layer center coordinates from document center coordinate
here s the code

i would just send it with post as a json object and then parse it on the server side
to get only needed data

57570634
asterisk	pbx

it is not clear why you cannot use the twilio number for both a twiml application and an elastic sip trunk connected to asterisk
just don t assign that particular number to your elastic sip trunk and you should be able to assign that particular number to your elastic sip trunk to your twiml application for inbound calls and use a when you want to forward the the call to your asterisk pbx

57571616
free	malloc
hen you allocate memory with malloc the system will search for a valid unallocated memory on the process heap and if the system finds return a pointer of the system malloc essentially returns a virtual address
after the process ends the process vas will be automatically free by the operating system so that memory is no longer valid or allocated in that matter


57572844
button	checkbox
y adding a boolean column and then adding the column to a grid either explicitly or by relying on the grid s setting the grid s will gain a checkbox column that manipulates the value of the bool on the row
the user can then tick the boxes as per the boxes wants and press a button


57572924
int	chars
ref for colors the format of an rgb value in the functional notation is rgb followed by a comma-separated list of three numerical values either three int values or three percentage values followed by

fflush	gets
s jasonharper had said in the comments any empty or nonetype tiles were essentially being pushed over to the right and any named tiles in a row were fflush left
so for example if our map looked like this originally |en|en|fg| |st| | |en|fg|en|en| it would now look like this in the game |en|en|fg|st| | |en|fg|en|en| | to resolve the issue with mapping the issue with mapping comes down to simple spacing indentation of the world_dsl once again pesky python spacing gets the better of me

the format type combination gl.red gl.unsigned_byte specifies a normalized integer format
the full range of the integral data type is mapped to the floating point range 0 1 for unsigned normalized integers such as unsigned_byte unsigned_short unsigned_int and to the range -1 1 for signed normalize integers such as byte short int
in webgl 2.0 respectively opengl es 3.0 there is the possibility to specify the image format by the combination gl.red_integer gl.unsigned_byte which specifies an integral pixel format and corresponds to the internal image format r8ui see webgl 2.0 - 3.7.6 texture objects gl.teximage2d gl.texture_2d 0 gl.r8ui 3 2 0 gl.red_integer gl.unsigned_byte data

57574256
put	get

given how interfaces work you can t just explicitly put in the property name in datatextfield
you have to use some reflection or another means to get the value

57574370
getter	setter	getter	setter
mine was slightly different in that my backing field was a different type an enum with the public getter and setter converting to and from string
tldr - the the fix for the original problem should be to change ageyears agemonths from properties with getter to simple methods public int getageyears public int getagemonths
note having conversions in field getter or setter is problematic as ef3 will change behaviour and by default write directly to backing fields skipping any of the conversions

serializable	deserialization

i ran into a similar problem when i had to serializable arbitrary the only way i managed to do this so far was to use the jsonobject jsonelement api and combining the jsonobject jsonelement api with the implicitreflectionserializer the major downside is the use of reflection which will only work properly in jvm and is not a good solution for kotlin-multiplatform
then to serializable you would use note this reflection based serialization is only necessary if you are constrained to use if you are free to use your own dsl to build the responses then you can use the json dsl directly which is very similar to mapof if however you are constrained to define a data type and do serialization as well as deserialization you probably can t use the json dsl so you ll have to define a serializer using the above methods

57574838
submit	submission
so i had to wait till the xcode 11 gm release or submit it from xcode 10.3

for-loop	arrays
obviously you want to detect if some cell in a 2 d arrays contains some data
looking at you for-loop the first part of a for-loop uusally initializes the running variable used in the for
but does nothing

57575279
public	protected
but there are great advantages in terms of code styling
a beginner in php might not know that functions are public by default
also it makes sense to always add visibility to functions otherwise you have different code styles for private protected functions and public functions

ow you are choosing to show and hide elements will impact this issue
some ways to hide an element simply make an element not visible via css while other ways cause the elements to be removed from the dom


57575725
gtable	cowplot

this hack expects the gtable cell containing the plot panel to be in the 7th row 5th column of the gtable object which is based on my understanding of how ggplot objects are typically converted to gtables and may not survive changes to the underlying code
code modified version of cowplot align_plots utilising the above modified function with cowplot package s plot_grid alternatively we can define a modified version of plot_grid function that uses align_plots_modified instead of cowplot align_plots

crossfilter	dc.js	crossfilter	dc.js
caveat all this said there aren t very many good reasons for using dc.js with unaggregated data
the library only shines when there are interactions by filtering the charts and filtering will only work if the data is aggregated with crossfilter
it will probably be easier to learn another charting library since you aren t using any of the functionality that makes dc.js special

57576417
for-loop	loops

57576639
implements	extends
ater rust will likely extends those existential types and allow this at a module level which is currently allowed on nightly guarded by the type_alias_impl_trait feature finally you are asking why the syntax is impl foo rather than trait foo
this reads well as a type that implements foo

the only module that you re installing is gulp but with the global option -g so the module will not be installed in the current directory
try installing your modules locally for example by adding this line to you dockerfile run npm install fs and you ll see that the node_modules folder is created

int	double
to get a floating-point result from dividing two int s you need to convert at least one of the operands to float or double
so instead of 9 5 write 9.0 5.0 9.0 5 9 5.0 or 1.8 which gives you a double or 9.0f 5.0f 9.0f 5 9 5.0f or 1.8f which gives you a float

ou re using a get request and trying to get data off the request body but a get request only has params not a body
either change not a body to a post or change your data to req.params.address


57577678
put	get

i faced the same problem and find out the same problem was because of res.redirect in put
change res.redirect path to res.redirect 303 path in put and delete if you want to redirect to get address you should pass 303 as first parameter

folder	directory
sorry i forgot to mention images and styling before
here is old structure src index.html images sass js models views config.js index.js -- single application controller assets iso-language-codes.js below is the new proposed structure grouping iso stuff no longer under js folder images and sass styling under a common resources folder
you can think of the directory in a way that would be easy to distribute to multiple servers or even services

57578997
botframework	bots
botframework catches all errors so you wouldn t may not see them in the typical azure app service logging
vinodkumarg is also correct that you can see the errors generated by in or you actually should be able to see this in log stream application logs i added this to my bots in testing in output in log stream application logs our current recommended approach is to use application insights
you can use sample 21.corebot-app-insights as a guide

inherited	properties
every function gets a default prototype properties and this has a constructor properties equal to the function itself
because to inherited from transform the default prototype is overwritten
when you did that the default prototype object which had the constructor got overwritten with a new object

57580191
inherited	properties
when you did that the default prototype object which had the constructor got overwritten with a new object
if you check the documentation for classical inherited you have missed a step in creating this inherited
you need to set the constructor properties to the original function

57580266
integer	unsigned

6.3.1.4 states when a finite value of real floating type is converted to an integer type other than _bool the fractions part is discarded the value is truncated toward zero
if the value of the integral part cannot be represented by the integer type the behavior is undefined. 61 and then there is a non-normative foot note explaining the above text 61 the remaindering operation performed when a value of integer type is converted to unsigned type need not be performed when a value of real floating type is converted to unsigned type

57580386
post	get

based on this post on the apple support forum it appears that you must enroll in the apple developer program to become an identified developer
this will get you a developer id certificate from apple that will cause your app to be recognized by gatekeeper as having come from an identified developer

57580456
expander	grid

as maciek świszczowski said you need to properly align your expander and put the contents inside the context section of your expander
also assuming you want your expander to fill the entire left section i would recommend you use a grid to hold it all like so example here s what it looks like i put a blue background and some text in your expander and just a red stack panel in the second column in order to make it really clear

57580529
put	get	put	get
put code that is repeatedly called into a function
for example into a function do_stuff session that accepts the session - object to get the right context. that way you only have to maintain the function and every call to the function reduces your maintenance workload
put all your id-strings like into a dictionary with a speaking index

57580689
hash	md5	salt	md5
postgres when hash a password as md5 salt the password with the user name then prepends the text md5 to the resulting hash
ex md5 +md5 password + username in bash in powershell so finally our alter user command will look like alter user username with password md5d6a35858d61d85e4a82ab1fb044aba9d
relevant links note i will only link to the latest versions of the docs for older it changes some but md5 is still support a ways back. create role the password is always stored encrypted in the system catalogs

57580746
copying	overwrite
your problem is that you are copying entire rows when you probably only need range a5 j1000
pasting an entire row will overwrite any formulas you have in columns to the right of j

accessor	properties
to get the latest unread message for a user you would add this to the user model this assumes the message model has a sender properties which you d probably want to be the relationship between user and message
number of unread messages is not a relationship just a raw number so you could add an accessor now you can access these within code like this

width	height

an example of setting up a struct as a component to be used in our navigation items could be something like the following when the aspect ratio is set only the width needs to be set on the frame on the container view
our could also set a property in the navlogo to set width and or height from property dependency injection

57583251
affinity	processors
 maskable interrupt occurs whose affinity specifies that it can only be handled on that processors
in this case that processors will not handle the interrupt until an unmaskable interrupt occurs to wake up that processors and the if flag is cleared to enable handling maskable interrupts


57583251
interrupt	wakeup
the interrupt latency for any interrupt including unmaskable interrupts can be in the order of hundreds of microseconds if all the processors that are supposed to handle the interrupt are in a very deep sleep state
on my haswell processor the wakeup latency of the c7 state is 133 usecs
if this is an issue for you you can use the linux kernel parameter intel_idle.max_cstate in case the intel_idle driver is used which is the default on intel processors or processor.max_cstate for the acpi_idle driver to limit the deepest c-state

ocaml	utop

in fact ocaml is often used as a target language for various higher-level languages and theorem provers like coq ott and f so it is used to compile a machine generated code which usually comes in plenty
back to your example i would suspect that you re either running utop in a folder with lots of files or your .ocamlinit file is running some slow computation or you re not describing us your experiment in full

57583574
int	chars

you re casting a string to an int with int var and python will give you a type error if the input always type string isn t a numeric type
you can use isdigit to check if the input is of numeric type str.isdigit return true if all chars in the string are digits and there is at least one chars false otherwise

direct3d	directx
when you create a directx 11 device on any modern versions of windows you can pretty safely assume there s some direct3d adapter there depending on your minimum direct3d hardware feature level
with directx 12 you really need to check as it s quite possible that you have both a dx11 and a dx12 capable device on your system
see this blog post for more details on creating a directx 12 device

57584635
folder	directory
his puts the folder in version control so when this gets cloned to heroku the folder is there
you will also probably have to edit your .gitignore file so this doesn t ignore the tmp pids directory


57584812
post	put
ll your post 14th dates come first all your pre dates would be tied as 2999-01-01 then mysql will use the second clause to sort out the ties so simply put the second clause s because nulls came first and the first case when converted all the pre dates to null putting the ties at the top of the results however the second clause s not particularly self explanatory why you might have a magic date of 2999 in your query and in cases like this i ve always preferred to have a more explicit ordering
if you make a coarse sort effort first using something that sort before each other like integers then it s more obvious that you intend the post 14th to come first without the next developer needing to remember and realise that nulls come first output will be like 2019-06-14 --sorted by 0 then date 2019-06-15 --sorted by 0 then date 2019-06-16 --sorted by 0 then date 2019-06-13 --sorted by 1 then date 2019-06-12 --sorted by 1 then date 2019-06-11 --sorted by 1 then date as a general technique you can add any number of whens to your case with different integers to sort more puts all the gold activities first sorted by date then all the post 14th ones etc


57585009
udp	tcp
if no listener exists or the connection is somehow blocked the initial tcp handshake will fail already even before any data were sent
with udp this is different the initial connect does no communication to the target at all but just sets the target address on the local socket
if the connection works will only be seen later if data sent from the client will actually arrive at the server

57585054
folder	directory

it s possible you came across this issue but actually spring cloud config server acknowledges that the local copy in the config server can get dirty for example folder content changes by an os process for this a force-pull property can be set to true as documented here
also as system temporary directory tmp can be modified by os processes you can specify exactly where you want to put the checked out repository using spring.cloud.config.server.git.basedir as documented here

57585135
sorting	grouping

here is a much more concise way of writing the order by clause the first sorting level places records on or after 2019-06-14 first followed by earlier records second
then within each of those two grouping we sort ascending for the later records and descending for the earlier records

when python code outputs array or list of arrays and you haven t imported array from array and did only numpy imports and operations code can not out put any array but numpy arrays or lists with elements having numpy arrays only
as we make type of element check by print type network.weights 0 we get output class numpy.ndarray so it is in fact a list of numpy arrays not a list of standard arrays

throttling	throttle

answer to this surely depends on what you relate throttling to
if you are thinking to throttle data returned by api based on role for some time you could achieve this simply by using spring-boot cache

57586079
throttling	throttle

so might have to tune it according to your need but this is first answer to your controlled throttling

set variables xnow to xfinal and ynow to yfinal

57586476
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops

in a range based for-loop the difference between and is that element is a copy of the elements in the container while element_ref is a reference to the elements in the container
to see the difference in action consider this example this example will print 23 443 16 49 66 5 5 5 5 5 because the first loops works on copies of the arrays elements while the second actually modifies the elements in the arrays

57586537
hide	show
so you can tell tasker hide scene in xnow ynow

set variables xnow to xfinal and ynow to yfinal

57586991
for-loop	loops

you mix the for-loop behavior in a coding language c and in a hardware descritpion language vhdl
in a coding language if you write a for-loop processor will execute the content of loops several times in row sequentially one after one

57586991
for-loop	loops
in a coding language if you write a for-loop processor will execute the content of loops several times in row sequentially one after one

udp	tcp
the media traffic runs over udp typically and mediasoup uses random ports
a turn server which is configured on udp port 443 may help in some cases. the other problem is udp being blocked which is easy to reproduce with a local firewall
mediasoup supports something called ice-tcp which will allow media to run over a tcp connection

many-to-many	one-to-many
those two are probably related trough a one-to-many relationship
here you should do something similar but you ll need a many-to-many relationship
the simplest way of doing it would be to create a new model for example categoryvisited with 3 fields user_id category_id and count

maven	pom.xml

i ve encounter the same issue when implementing jacoco for a maven project unfortunately i m afraid that the only solution is adding a new child module to a maven project
you should put in the only solution is adding a new child module to the maven project dependecies to your 3 child modules and the report-aggregate goal so you should have something like below configuration in your parent pom.xml you should add child4-aggregator module as the last module to be runned

57590329
rank	max	rank	max
if you need all records with max create_time use rank or dense_rank
rank will assign 1 to all records with the latest create_time if there are many records with the same time
if you need only one record per id even it there are many records with create_time max create_time then use row_number instead of rank

57590483
typedef	struct	typedef	struct
add this before the declaration of cursor_str typedef struct menustr menustr
all this does is to tell the compiler that there will be a struct called menustr in the program but that it will be defined later on
also consider using a typedef for the function pointers

maven	pom.xml	maven	pom.xml
long answer when you put an artifact in a maven repo you have the artifact files may be an aar for your android libraries and a pom.xml file
the pom.xml file describes also the transitive dependencies of the artifact
currently you can t specify a parent dependency or a specific maven repo to be used this one is under development

57591647

dictionary	map

you can use built-in pandas function to accomplish this task -- and the dictionary where you want to get the elements from i edited your dict_elements to have int instead of str for the keys and this can become a one-line with built in pandas function one thing to note is that values that do not match a key in the dictionary will remain as-is in the original dataframe
you can use a map function instead to have values that do not match a key in the dictionary will remain as-is in the original dataframe appear as nas if you d rather have that behavior

their use is otherwise exactly like that of the final keyword in java to state that a specific reference can only be assigned to once that a method cannot be overridden in a subclass or that a class definition cannot be subclassed
use the typing.final object to mark an global or attribute as final documenting that the value will never change once assigned to use the typing.final decorator to mark a method as non-overridable subclasses can t define a different implementation or a class as non-inheritable you can t create subclasses from the class final class finalclass this class can t be inherited from class someclass final def final_method self subclasses can t define a different final_method implementation also see the mypy documentation on their use which covers such details as to what ways of assigning the value of a final attribute are acceptable

build.gradle	gradlew
specially in a project with many modules before trying the other answers run  gradlew assembledebug from the terminal inside android studio and android studio should fix the issue without having to alter your build.gradle

ccordingly you need too make sure that all the data files are in same or sub-folder of the folder with app.r
basically - project_dir | - app.r | - data | - treemap_master.rds # for above structure use read_rds data treemap_master.rds as per your post i ve made sure that all of all the data files use relative paths that the app.r file is inside the directory containing all my files is probably where you went wrong

swift	objective-c
the code behaves like this this is a kind of misfeature of how swift bridging works here
it would be much faster if the swift compiler would just call the objective c method -objectforkeyedsubscript

superclass	subclassing
more important since teacher and student have common state name and surname at least probably more it makes more sense for person to be an abstract superclass instead of an interface
consider this instead now if you need to add a new person subclassing there s no extra work to do
if person absolutely must be an interface consider using a default interface method this is sub-optimal because it still forces you to provide separate implementations for setname and setsurname in each implementing class when clearly the state is shared and you need only one implementation

57599883
accessor	properties
the solution is to add a private properties to the class so that any username -like object must also have that private properties now if someone does the following typescript will complain since is missing the private is_nominal properties
there is however a somewhat simpler and imho cleaner way to add a private field make the value private and add an accessor

inline-block non-replaced elements in normal flow if width is auto the used value is the shrink-to-fit width calculation of the shrink-to-fit width is similar to calculating the width of a table cell using the automatic table layout algorithm
roughly calculate the preferred width by formatting the content without breaking lines other than where explicit line breaks occur and also calculate the preferred minimum width by trying all possible line breaks
thirdly find the available width in this case this is the width of the containing block minus the used values of margin-left border-left-width padding-left padding-right border-right-width margin-right and the widths of any relevant scroll bars the shrink-to-fit width is min max preferred minimum width available width preferred width note how the content is used to define the width

inherited	subclassing
another approach is to simply recommend that users subclassing the models that the app provides using multi-table inherited
unfortunately this will introduce unnecessary overhead with the extra database queries required when accessing the instances of the subclassing
best case is that this amounts to an extra query or two in a view dealing with a single instance

integer	unsigned

you should stick with std_logic and std_logic_vector an other post is presenting the differences when to use std_logic over bit in vhdl i think your problem comes also from the fact that you are putting an integer into a std_logic_vector
you should use the conversion functions to_unsigned arg natural size natural return unsigned std_logic_vector arg signed or unsigned return std_logic_vector which leads you to

folder	dir
an error message is output and execution of batch file is halted before exiting batch file execution on destination folder could not be created successfully
it is possible that destination folder is a subfolder of source folder
for that reason a command line with dir and findstr is executed by for in a separate command process executed in background started with comspec c and the specified command line appended to get all file names to copy with filtering out all file names in source folder tree starting with folder path being equal target folder path

57606421
folder	directory	folder	dir
for that reason a command line with dir and findstr is executed by for in a separate command process executed in background started with comspec c and the specified command line appended to get all file names to copy with filtering out all file names in source folder tree starting with folder path being equal target folder path
so executed by for is for example dir searches in specified directory c old and all its subdirectories because of option s for non-hidden files because of option a-d-h attribute not directory and not hidden matching the wildcard pattern any file name and outputs found in bare format just the file names because of option b with full path because of option s
this output by dir is redirected by started cmd.exe in background to findstr which searches just at beginning of all lines because of option b for a literal interpreted string explicitly specified with option l for search string specified with option c on which each backslash is escaped with one more backslash and outputs inverted result because of option v which means all lines not starting with the search string

this output by dir is redirected by started cmd.exe in background to findstr which searches just at beginning of all lines because of option b for a literal interpreted string explicitly specified with option l for search string specified with option c on which each backslash is escaped with one more backslash and outputs inverted result because of option v which means all lines not starting with the search string
note a source folder like c old temp and a destination folder c old results in not copying any file
in other words the destination folder can be a subfolder of source folder but the source folder cannot be a subfolder of destination folder

57606421
spaces	delimiter
a file folder name can contain one or more spaces
for that reason option is specified in double quotes to define an empty list of delimiter which turns off line splitting completely to get assigned each full qualified file name completely to loop variable i

select-object	get-wmiobject
ow to use this can be found on microsoft documentation link for your particular case powershell alternative would be following wmic memorychip get capacity get-wmiobject -class win32_physicalmemory | select-object capacity wmic diskdrive get status model get-wmiobject -class win32_diskdrive | select-object status model commands in wmic are usually derived from wmi class names but | select-object status model commands in wmic s not really rule of thumb
with powershell you are accessing wmi by | select-object status model commands in wmic s real class name instead so you may need to seek for other classes if needed undisputed advantage to powershell over wmic is that output is an object and you can easily continue working with the output while wmic returns a string only that you eventually need to parse for example if used inside scripts and that brings another benefit of output formatting - you can easily reformat any output for example to as you mentioned json just pass your command through another pipe into commandlet convertto-json and you will have your expected output

implements	sealed
the rules for implements idisposable are considerably simpler for sealed types compared to unsealed types you don t need the boolean disposing parameter
then implements dispose like so while the root cause of your problem is the fact that your esri.filegdb library s dispose method is not idempotent a dispose call should never throw objectdisposedexception - it should always be safe to call a single instance s dispose multiple times
i m assuming that your database library also exposes finalizers destructors that incorrectly call .dispose or .close methods which then cause the objectdisposedexception

int	double

57609645
int	double
since the int value you provided in the argument list is only 32 bits half of the bits in the double value will be unknown
the printf function will then print the invalid double value
if you re unlucky some of the unknown bits might lead the value to be a trap value which can cause a crash

57609645
int	double
prints 2147483639 the printf function fetches the next argument as a 32-bit int value losing half of the bits in the 64-bit double value provided as the actual argument
exactly which 32 bits are copied into the internal int value depends on endianness
integers don t have trap values so no crashes happens just an unexpected value will be printed

stdio	fflush

this allows stdio to save system calls to do the actual writing and so be more efficient when transferring large amounts of data
on interactive applications this is not applicable as no output would be done if you don t force the buffers to fflush before any input is done so when the output is a tty device something that stdio can know from the file descriptor associated to standard output then it switches to line mode buffering and that means that printf will fflush out the buffer when 1 printf is filled up or 2 when a newline n character is found in the output

57610655
int	double
 conversion is an operation whose input is one type and whose output is another type but has the same value or as nearly the same as is possible in some sense as when we convert a double 3.5 to an int 3
in some cases a conversion does not require any change to the bits an unsigned 3 and an int 3 use the same bits to represent 3 so a conversion does not change the bits and the result is the same as a reinterpretation

for example the way the skins work change around versioning 1.24 iiric
also be sure to create a renamed copy of your 1.14 localsettings.php and create a fresh one during the upgrade via the installer the old one will cause a multitude of exceptions

int	chars
the standard function is described in the hyperspec whereas the one in emacs lisp is slightly different in particular there is no secondary return value parse int from the substring of string from start to end
string may be surrounded by whitespace chars chars with syntax
other non-digit chars are considered junk

57612097
int	chars
other non-digit chars are considered junk
radix is an int between 2 and 36 the default is 10
signal an error if the substring between start and end cannot be parsed as an int unless junk-allowed is non-nil

57612488
spaces	delimiter
1 unpivot donor name 2 split attribute column by spaces delimiter or by first 4 characters we d need the year value later
make sure there are no leading or trailing spaces in header names
3 remove attribute.3 column leave attribute.1 column though in case the same donor has data that spans several years someone else in this example 4 pivot back

57612922
getter	setter
then in your code you can call a few things to note i have replaced field references with getter setter fruit.flavor becomes fruit.getflavor
this is good practice as it hides the necessary state from the caller and allows you to perform logic when the getter is called
human is abstract

57613132
ngmodel	ngfor
the one i found involves the use of ngfor
in particular when binding ngmodel to the iteration variable this kind of pattern will trigger the same cryptic error


57613248
setinterval	clearinterval

you should replace by the setinterval method offered on the window and worker interfaces repeatedly calls a function or executes a code snippet with a fixed time delay between each call
it returns an interval id which uniquely identifies the interval so you can remove it later by calling clearinterval

57613295
maven	pom.xml
no plugins
maven comes by default so you should press two times the shift key and write maven
then import the maven project .pom and the bar cames automatically after selecting the pom.xml

57613404
google-chrome	firefox
f that s still the case you could make a separate install of firefox and edit the hardcoded values google-chrome devtools modules devtools client shared components throttling profiles.js inside the omni.ja with appropriate experience you could extract the code used to implement throttling and run the omni.ja in the browser console in google-chrome context
at first i suspected the network.http.throttle preferences were responsible for this but that s a completely separate thing related to throttling in background tabs the most sure-fire option is to make your own build of firefox but that requires setting up and a non-trivial amount of system resources


57613664
hash	md5
hp has a function specifically designed to avoid this hash_equals i would also advise against md5 as this hash_equals s quite a weak algorithm that is not sufficient for passwords
using a free online tool this hash_equals is ridiculusly easy to reverse those hash using lookup rainbow tables that contain a large number of hash and their plain text equivalents which can be queried within seconds


57614217
put	get
if you follow that you will get real non-superficial understanding of what is going on
if you want a model that works well on translated digits you can use larger images 40x40 then put the original 28x28 image into a random position and train your network on that
then you should have a model that can recognize a digit no matter where you put it

57614319
stdout	fflush

my advice is the following 1 use a stream explicitly rather than implicitly for instance prefer fprintf stdout enter two numbers n
fflush stdout

57614580
java.util.date	zoneddatetime	simpledateformat	zoneddatetime
a zone has a name in continent region format such as america montreal or africa tunis
converting normally you should avoid using the terrible date-time classes such as java.util.date and simpledateformat that are now legacy
always use instant offsetdatetime and zoneddatetime

57614791
decimal	ieee
his example depends on vhdl -2008 which includes support for decimal based bit strings which are 0 left filled
for earlier revisions of the vhdl standard without the prefix length the expressions assigned to q would require some legerdemain similar to what air78 has shown here with ieee package numeric_bit instead of numeric_std and you can see we had some verilog aficionados creeping into the vhdl standardization process for -2008 the second way is to make only sel dependent on an element type of bit to_bitvector is defined in ieee package


57615265
for-loop	loops
so you need to declare your initialization of before the for-loop
also your if condition is executing in each iteration of loops
since you are using the if condition within loops

57615268
mousemove	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup

the mousemove misfiring in firefox due to overflow hidden looks like bug 620513 bug 1352061
as for achieving this effect without relying on the bug teemu correctly notes that usually this is done by listening mousedown on the element and when that fires stop listening mousedown and start to listen mouseup and mousemove on document

57615310
disk	ram
the decoded data may exist in memory before being writtten to disk
i know that i m supposed to download large files in chunks instead of keeping it all in ram until finished no but giving each php process ridiculous amounts of memory is not the right way to solve the problem either

versioning	upgrade
 just upgrade my app to use cordova-plugin-firebasex which has an extensive cocoapods and dependencies installation
you can turn these permissions off before you install cocoapods into your project by putting a permissionsconfiguration.xcconfig in the root of your project - you can read more about this here this surprised me when the new versioning of my app was rejected with 7 permissions key string missing from info.plist file

int	double
consider passing a primitive data type int float double etc
output is value before calling method 10 value inside printnum method 20 value after calling method 10 int num 10
- this allocates the memory for int in stack of the running thread because it is a primitive type

hadoop	ambari
cloudera manager will display a warning but still function so will ambari
as others already said having uniform jdk version across all nodes and specific per-os hadoop native libraries is more important


57616938
integer	unsigned
an enum is just an integer so you could compare that with a variable of integer type
suppose there s here the the first enum constant will have the integer value 0 the next has the value 1 and so on
this means you can compare one of the enumeration constans to a variable of integer type and where the so called usual arithemtic conversion rules dictate how the values are converted in the various cases of whether you re using a short int an unsigned int and so on. so if you have you re also just doing

57617094
for-loop	loops
you can use strip filter to remove any space and tabs from the start and end of string just to be extra sure
string filters for your particular scenario you don t need the limit 1 inside for-loop because you don t know that first object will contain the tag
so you need to iterate over all the objects and break out of loops if condition is satisfied

post	put

i m not sure if i should bring this question back from the dead but i had the same question a bit ago and i figured out the problem solution so i ll post it here python msfrpc works with python2 throws authentication error with python 3 the problem was that msfrpc was originally written in python 2 and therefore the prefix of b in the msgpack rpc responses from the metasploit host was ignored but the problem is required in python 3 to indicate that the literal should become a bytes literal instead of a unicode string type
for some more info here s a link to a post that helped me figure the problem out the corrected code i posted in the link above works fine you just have to put a b in front of the strings returned from the server to tell python that the 0 s and 1 s in the responses are bits bytes and not unicode code points but really a better solution is to use the msfrpc module written by dan mcinerney which in addition to indicating bytes instead of http.client uses the requests package

57617697
int	double
use double float to correctly compute avg because int will truncate the result
and the second operand of division operator needs to be 3.0 instead of 3 to avoid int division


57617869
plot	heatmap

the trick here is to create images of each plot and render images of each plot on the same axis
as per the example given in the documentation this obviously uses random data which you will have to replace by your own heatmap and tinker with the transforms etc

versioning	upgrade

width	text-align

assuming you want all three elements on the same line you ll want to turn your elements into inline-block elements with display inline-block and then float the final element to the right if you want one element on the first line and then two elements on the second line you ll want to give each element a width of 50 float the second element to the left and float the third element to the right
optionally you can also text-align the third element to the right

57619694
width	text-align
this can be seen in the following if you want two elements on the first line and then one element on the second line you ll want to give each element a width of 50 float the first element to the left and float the second element to the right
optionally you can also text-align the second element to the right
you ll also need to overflow the container

alerting rules allow you to define alter condition based on prometheus expression language
sample alerting rule one possible way to solve your problem is add one extra label like enablealert in metrics

57620027
for-loop	arrays

in functions like this you should ask the caller for the length of both arrays in and out and use that as a max index when accessing them both
as pointed by rishikesh raje in comments you should also change the exit condition in the second for-loop from to as it will generate another buffer over-read when as it will access out by a negative index

instead whenever adding a new table into a join and you see the rows double up ask yourself what is it you really want out of a new table and either restrict it so you only get what you want or grouping aggregate it up so the info you want is condensed to single identifiers and doesn t cause your rows to double triple etc up

rtp	sip
the missing part that you are looking for is a piece of code that re-assemble decode and play-out the rtp flow of packets into voice samples
for the sake of simplicity consider the wellknown g.711 or pcm codec because all sip phone support this codec. you need to implement a playout buffer logically an infinite buffer but a ring buffer with wrap around is ok
the packet itself contains audio data in small payload of 20ms duration

57621777

from a pragmatical point of view you may do that in several ways you collect all the udp rtp packets in a capture file and use wireshark to do the hard work

versioning	upgrade
e did a similar upgrade from 1.5 to 2.1 and it took we two weeks to complete it
if you really must use spring boot 2 and hibernate 4 you could always force exclude the new dependencies in your dependency manager but that would 1 defeat the purpose of using newer versioning and 2 generate similar amount of work as if you were refactoring your code to support new versioning anyway


57622076
int	chars
something like dt_wstr 2 datepart yy getdate 2 will error due to a truncation error datepart will return a 4 digit int which can t fit in a wstr of length 2
therefore you have to put the value in a string of length 4 first and then right 2 chars


57622267
instances	transient
nexpected results you are expecting your service to adhere to your service specific life time but in actual fact your service really just the same instances every time due to the nature of the singleton
to answer your question using my understanding a transient injected into a singleton while inherently not correct will still function fine as a singleton lifetime is short and runs of little risk of breaking state whereas scoped guarantees a lifetime across a single request think some sort of request caching as an example there is no way that scoped can honor that lifetime while being injected into a singleton

int	chars
actually you may even try this code with your regex but note that matches any chars but and while matches an optional - 0+ digits an optional
and then 1+ digits thus matching negative or positive float and int numbers
here matches two or more repetitions of s and the lambda expression in the replacement gets rid of the first and last and and splits with to get the list of numbers that are cast to float and then summed

get_permalink is the function that gives you the link to the post page inside the loop you are currently

maven	pom.xml
sensible resource filtering for application.properties and application.yml including profile-specific files for example application-dev.properties and application-dev.yml or use the spring-boot-dependencies bom using the bom is the way to go when you would not like to inherit from the spring-boot-starter-parent pom.xml
you may have your own corporate standard parent that you need to use or you may prefer to explicitly declare all your maven configuration
you would still keep the benefit of the dependency management but not the plugin management

you can try clearing every other post on the left side so that they don t get stuck after post taller than others

it is perhaps not an optimal solution when you want to scale things to smaller viewports

for-loop	loops
this behavior with assigning multiple strings to multiple loops variables is the reason why for-loop variables are case sensitive in comparison to environment variables which are interpreted case insensitive by cmd.exe

there s a good chance your connection will not be secure as the ssl certificate is not recognized
you can use mkcert to create a valid https certificate
to use that type the following commands install chocolatey a package manager set-executionpolicy bypass -scope process -force

postgresql	mysql

postgresql is correct
in fact your query would fail with the most recent versions of mysql as well -- using the default settings

57625759
min	max
in fact your query would fail with the most recent versions of mysql as well -- using the default settings
just use an aggregation function select min f.created_date as time_sec sum f.value as value to_char f.created_date d as metric from ck_view_fills f group by to_char f.created_date d
you should have used a similar construct in mysql regarding min -- or max

57625798
atexit	main
the only notable difference is the crt goo that c++ added at the end of main
it is calling atexit and various other clean-up that c will do too but perhaps outside the application code
still there will always be overhead in c++ because it has to call constructs and clean-up destructors of objects with static storage duration

57625872
webchromeclient	webviewclient

replace default webchromeclient with your custom customwebviewclient as below webview
.setwebviewclient object customwebviewclient then create this custom webviewclient whenever your webview fails to load page this custom webviewclient calls onreceivederror callback there you can show error layout

57626584
elasticsearch	kibana
if you need more accuracy in security like by using roles there is few plugins that can be added to manage permissions elasticsearch mapping and settings tuning are really important concepts to fully understand before going on production with it and that s no that easy to get how everything works quickly
clustering and horizontal scaling is very flexible and easy to set up the suite tools kibana beats etc .. are a very convinient way to gather logs expose key data etc .
search features are extremely advanced you can really do amazing things when you master a bit how full text search works fuzzyness boosting scoring stemming tokenizer analyzers and so on ...

57626824
int	chars
pic being an 8-bitter has 16 bit int
with that cleared up we can note that each of these shifts is wrong is of type chars or uint8_t if you fix the code to the appropriate type
this is a small integer type

57627000
int	chars
this may cause some errors so it s best to read the column as a string and then turn those literal chars to int
this step was not necessary in the first case because gsub returns chars


57627058
mousemove	mouseleave	mouseup	mouseleave

some of the answers to the older questions mention the right way to mirror mouse events from one canvas to another unfortunately it s not enough to just dispatch mousedown mouseup and mousemove events on target canvas
the reason is that when mousedown event is fired on canvas fabric.js immediately removes mouseup and mousemove listeners and reattaches them to document instead i m guessing because it wants to continue listening to those events even after the mouseleave the canvas

57627452
put	get
nd the path to the files is stored in subdir if you run you ll see that you get all your files
so now instead of the print statement put the command you want to read the files and store the content to a variable you should read files with the path subdir+ +file


57627461
put	get

is the intent to put all the name fields into a 1-element array containing an object
this jolt spec puts them into an object at the name field ...and this spec puts them into a 1-element array at the name field i don t see any other place in the input to get an index into the array so i just used 0

57627564
folder	directory

you could just create a folder named index.php to achieve the same result but i think what you are referring to is sites using model-view-controller mvc framework type
i am not very familiar with the concept but basically the file called is index.php and the following directory are in fact parameters passed to the script

57628015
for-loop	loops

your for-loop will iterate only two times because you zip list with all mondays with list that contains only two elements that means as well that you will check only two first mondays of this year as well
this for complicated loops is not necessary

57628067
background-repeat	background-size
f you want to show the entire image while still filling the container you ll probably be better served by background-size contain
do note however that if you also use background-repeat no-repeat with this the image will not fully fill the image parent if the image their dimensions don t match


57628245
for-loop	arrays

at the end of the for-loop it becomes invalid
you save it pointer in coord_p and write its pointer to your arrays but those pointers are all invalid afterwards

57628275
queue	fifo
when device comes online priority of data transfer like offline data will have more priority than online data etc. fifo
so the data that has been queue earlier when the device was offline will be uploaded first once the connection with iot hub is restored the iot edge device syncs again
locally stored messages are delivered in the same order in which they were stored

57628521
width	height
so what you need to do is fix height and width of the image although there are ways you won t have to do this
than simply do control the width for smaller screens using css media queries


57628588
int	double
if you say int i
c allocates enough memory for one int
if you say c allocates enough memory for 10 double s

57628596
for-loop	loops
he idiomatic approach is to use a for-loop instead for i in range 1 10 that said if you do use a while incrementing the value at the end of the block is more common
this is because the block s arguably easier to recognize what the end points of your loops are


57629104
scikit-learn	xgboost
it is a boosting method hence it performs better than random forest which is a bagging based model. you can use the xgbclassifier from scikit-learn for your classification problem
xgboost has a tendency to overfit on small data
but since you mentioned you have a big dataset you can give it a shot. if it overfits try tuning the paramaters such as max_depth min_child_weight

57629272
for-loop	arrays

here i changed prepend to append or this where i changed your for-loop to run in reverse order while retaining prepend
either one of these should reverse the order of the items in your arrays as these are printed to the dom

57629272
for-loop	arrays

this is assuming that your existing code correctly prints only 4 items i didn t see where you specified that it was printing more than 4 items except where you set items.length as the conditional in the for-loop which i m not doing in these examples
also i don t know what the structure of your items arrays is but if the objects in that arrays have a date or timestamp property then you can sort the arrays by that property first before running your for-loop that way you can be certain of the order of your items

57629312
onmousedown	onmouseup

you could use onmousedown -method to detect when player starts to drag the card and update the card positions according to mouse position
when the drag ends the onmouseup -method is called

57629852
lan	localhost
2
local area network lan server if you want to set up an apmonitor local server in windows or a local server in linux such as on your business lan then you can change the default server location and still run with but with the server option changed to the local server address
the address 127.0.0.1 is localhost if you are running the server on the same computer where you are running the gekko client

57630101
pull	push
ongodb docs i suggest using the pull operator to delete specific elements from an array or use pop for the first last items
or you can get the user tasks array and splice it then push it back using operator


57630139
minimum	max
vectors to ensure that you reach the target with the minimum of elements you can improve the order of element
your target is t_1 ... t_c if you sort the t_j s from max to min you get the more importants columns first
you can sort the vectors by number of 1 s and then by the presence of a 1 in the most important columns

57630164
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
you re doing a strict string equality here
with the default comparison mode option compare binary that s a case-sensitive equality test
you want a case-insensitive partial match the operator won t cut it

57630197
onclick	onmousedown	onclick	onmousedown
onclick does this
onmousedown doesn t allow the user to hold the mouse down and instead will immediately trigger an action without any recourse for the user
onclick is the standard by which we expect to trigger actions on a computer

57630197
onclick	onmousedown
onclick is the standard by which we expect to trigger actions on a computer
in this situation call event.preventdefault on the onmousedown event
by default onmousedown will cause a blur event by default and will not do so when preventdefault is called

57630197
onclick	preventdefault	onclick	onmousedown
by default onmousedown will cause a blur event by default and will not do so when preventdefault is called
then onclick will have a chance to be called
a blur event will still happen only after onclick

57630416
stdout	stderr
ou get output in stderr but i guess your stderr is redirected someplace you re not looking for example if you re using php-fpm+nginx then stderr is often by default redirected to nginx s error log either check your stderr or redirect stderr to stdout by adding at the end of the command
for the record here is what i expect you are getting in stderr it s what i get in stderr when running it curl 6 could not resolve host mozilla curl 56 openssl ssl_read ssl_error_syscall errno 104


57630618
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
ote the placement of aria-required true and very importantly the relationship between the arialabelledby attribute on the fieldset element and the id on the legend element i ve tested radio button fields with these tips and code incorporated and these tips and code work well in the following browser reader combinations google-chrome jaws firefox jaws google-chrome chromevox edge nvda mac google-chrome chromevox mac safari voiceover and will probably also work with opera nvda mac opera voiceover
in the process currently of expanding testing to include opera which seems to be quite strong in accessibility.


57631119
ionic	angular

find more about ionic lifecycle events here if your use case lies in the subcomponent of a page then you can t use ionic lifecycle event directly instead use viewchild to access your component method to be called with page event
updates if you are populating the child components as response to http you can try using angular lifecycle event associated with the component ngafterviewinit then check if given component index is the desired index scroll given component index into the view

57631239
for-loop	loops

i m not sure there s a decent way to vectorize this so i m going with a straight for-loop solution
despite for loops being non-ideal in r from a speed standpoint this seems to scale well to millions of data points

57631472
post	get
change route get receive mycontroller receive
to route post receive mycontroller receive


57631580
put	get
then open the form once it is in the explorer find the button and look at the methods events of that and view the code
from there you can put break points and you just have to attach the debugger to w3wp.exe
make sure you go into the options under the dynamics 365 menu and find debugging and make sure to uncheck load symbols only for items in the solution or your break point won t get unless it is something in your project

57631754
folder	directory

i ended up solving it like this i added a new folder to our project called useddlls and added a .gitignore inside of that copied all of the dlls our needed into that folder and set all dll references to point into that folder
so now our just copy the dlls our need into that directory when our need that directory

57631844
swift	objective-c
there is a different way to test for speech support on a device using isavailable for swift or available objective-c you can tell if the speech recognizer is available
since you marked your question as objective-c i can show an example of this in that


57631949
for-loop	loops

in the for-loop when you find a customer id with a higher frequency save the id in a variable
after loops finishes print that variable

57632079
for-loop	loops
his value can be solved for in -15 10 x + 2 y -- -14 10 x + 2 y_min so simply solving for y gives us us next line of code note each time us iterate x in us for-loop a new starting value of y will be calculated
finally us need to loops through values of y that still satisfy the inequalities given


57632292
min	max
it won t
there are three cases the current head before popping could be the min value
the current head before popping could be the max value

57632735
free	malloc
when using malloc function always use free function to free memory
when using new operator always use delete operator to free memory
never mix the pairs

57632804
abc	subclassing

in this case the following should work for you class myabstract abc def get_current print current def get_state myabstract.get_current abstractmethod def get_time pass you can just imagine that you have a little invisible staticmethod decorator hanging above get_current that marks it as such
the problem with this is that now you don t get to change the behavior of get_current in subclassing to affect change in get_state

57632879
viewdidload	viewdidappear

the first thing i noticed is that you said viewdidload is not called for vc2
please see if viewdidappear or will appear is being called instead

57632879
viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidload	viewdidappear
please see if viewdidappear or will appear is being called instead
viewdidload is only called when the view loads initially when it wasn t there before
viewdidappear should fire always when the view is brought into the user s screen

57632890
integer	unsigned

you can construct the integer from a string however this will construct the literal at runtime
if you want to have this be constructed at compile time you can use the user-defined literals provided by boost multiprecision the type of an integer literal in c++ is at most unsigned long long int or some larger type if the implementation supports this

57632954
int	double

the version of std reduce that you are calling you can clearly see that the return value uses the same data type as the init parameter which in your case is being deduced as an int which is why the result is an int
to make the return value be a double instead simply change the literal 0 to 0.0 in the init parameter return reduce execution seq cbegin coeffs cend coeffs 0.0 ...

57632958
int	double
per cppreference.com you ll see the following or in your case thanks to remy lebeau for noticing so the type of the init value determines the type of the output value and you are passing an int literal 0
try passing a double literal instead 0.0


57632974
luis	bots
f you ve done your reading you should see that dispatch works like this your bots calls only the parent dispatch luis app only the parent dispatch luis app looks at only the parent dispatch luis app intents to see if any match any of only the parent dispatch luis app connected child apps luis or qnamaker if only the parent dispatch luis app matches luis only the parent dispatch luis app returns the top intent from that child app
if only the parent dispatch luis app matches qnamaker only the parent dispatch luis app returns the top intent from that child app and your code should call qnamaker i have a sneaking suspicion that your luis apps aren t laid out correctly


57632975
x86	64bit
ou have to uncheck x86 32 bit for intel processors otherwise google play store expects that you provide an x86_64 64bit intel processors
don t confuse intel processors with arm processors armeabi-v7a 32 bits and arm64-v8a 64bit


57633260
stdout	stderr
2 without directives as above exec returns the captured stdout of the executed command
using puts will print the returned stdout to the tcl process stdout
stderr will cause exec to return a tcl error which will be handled in the wish tk way

57633334
pthreads	fork
that can be done with the unix standard function fork
multithreading can be done using pthreads posix.1c standard extension or openmp
recent versions of openmp also support accelerator offloading which is what opencl was designed for

57633517
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	openbsd

i m on ubuntu so i ve probably got the version that came with ubuntu
when i nc -h it says this openbsd netcat debian patchlevel 1.187-1ubuntu0.1 when i run man nc it says this -f pass the first connected socket using sendmsg 2 to stdout and exit

57633793
dplyr	tidyr

there is no gather function in dplyr
you need tidyr gather

57634034
width	height

possible solutions build your own widget using row and columns flutter is an open soruse project edit the original widget and submit the original widget or use the original widget your self here original widget code paint over the original widget use a container stack and the bottomnavigationbar size to move the container this is what i used here screen record step 1 inside myappstate add globalkey variable step 2 assign the globalkey to the bottomnavigationbar bottomnavigationbar key _bottomnavigationbarkey .. step 3 inside myappstate add _bottomnavigationbarsize variable step 4 inside myappstate add _getbottomnavigationbarsize method to ask the framework for the bottomnavigationbar size step 5 inside initstate at addpostframecallback call _getbottomnavigationbarsize method to tell the framework to calculate the size after the frame drawing is done step 6 warp the bottomnavigationbar widget in a stack widget step 7 add an positioned widget after bottomnavigationbar step 8 set the positioned widget left property item width bottomnavigationbar width dividend by the pages count 1st item offset 0 item width 0 2st item end 1 item width item width 2st item end 2 item width 2 item width container offset item width multiplied by the _selectedtab index step 9 add an positioned widget after bottomnavigationbar positioned .. child container ..
step 10 in the container set the height property to bottomnavigationbar height container height _bottomnavigationbarsize.height ... step 10 in the container set the height property to bottomnavigationbar width divided by the pages count child container width _bottomnavigationbarsize.width _pageoptions.length ... step 11 in the container set the height property to black with 26 opacity

57634457
int	double
so this is the double value is converted into int as a has int type
a floating point value converted to int is rounded towards zero so 4.775 becomes 4
so the answer is 5

57634667
range	max

you can make a fake column to group distances within a range per 100 units
i first set any distance that has a value of 0 a value of 1 then divide by 100 and round up using numpy ceil that gets a range of integers for example anything between 0 and 100 kilometers would be grouped together a value of 1 in the fake column after that i groupby city and the fake column take the max index of the score in each group and locate the max index of the score in each group back in the orignal dataframe

57634775
floating-point	integer
texelfetch indexes the texture by integer texels rather than by floating-point texture coordinates and that is available to webgl 2.0
but really it s not that hard to make texture fetch from integer coordinates so long as you use nearest filtering and provide the texture resolution to the shader via a uniform
textures contain one or more images

57634809
folder	directory
or a one-file bundle this is the path to the temporary folder created by the bootloader
so you bundle the files pyinstaller would extract the files pyinstaller in a temporary directory something like


57634921
put	get

a treemap would work to put the stuff in sorted order by keys
to get the output

57635012
put	get
owever you are more likely to get that by reading or writing lots of different files see point 1 and your sleep 1 is most likely too short for a spindown even with the most aggressive power-save settings
having said that if you are worried about your hard drive there are two simple solutions put a copy of the file into a ram file system and read a ram file system from there


57635186
httphandler	httpcontext
from docs choose is a combinator which takes a list of httphandler and forms another httphandler
as you see httphandler is a function
so you can mock httpcontext and try to call webapp with httpfunc parameter fun _ - none

57635209
tensorflow	tensorboard

i am not sure why are you passing a tensorflow session.graph object to a pytorch summarywriter object
here you can find some basic example of using tensorboard to write graphs and scalars etc

57635340
jar	manifest.mf

the javassist artifact is dependent on jar and the above jar is marked as optional in the pom of javassist and the package com.sun.jdi.connect which is unresolved in your example belongs to the above jar tools that i mentioned
when trying get the transtive dependencies of embed-dependencies maven-bundle-plugin doesn t mark the packages of those transtive optional dependencies as optional in manifest.mf file and it is trying to resolve the dependencies when the bundle is installed

57635642
folder	directory

when you are clone git clone git will automatically create a new folder
so in your case you create a new folder and run git init command that creates .git file in your directory

57635642
folder	directory
so in your case you create a new folder and run git init command that creates .git file in your directory
then you have cloned from git which eventually creates a new folder which has happened in your scenario
you don t need to create a new folder for it

57635909
client-side	server-side
if you are handling a large dataset then you should prefer server-side filtering
the reason being that client-side filtering might result in a number of issues
for example the client might show previously cached data to the user even though things on the server have been updated

57635909
client-side	server-side
in short if your dataset is small you can go on with client-side filtering
but to always be safe i prefer server-side filtering


57635983
php-di	pimple
in order to achieve that php-di uses php s reflection to detect what parameters a constructor needs
if you use a factory method to create the container you can disable autowiring and the strange behaviour stops but i guess a better solution is to learn how to use autowiring properly i had overlooked all these details because my code was originally written for slim 3 which used pimple as hard-coded default container
i had wrongly assumed they would work similarly but albeit being container solutions both libraries are quite different

57636139
for-loop	loops

the way you go about deleting the rows is wrong because you use a for-loop with a pre-cached length but when a row say i is deleted then the row i+1 becomes i and the length changes
a correct way to solve this problem is to use a while loops without caching the number of rows and incrementing the index only when you don t delete a row

57636242
submit	submission

you will need to use jquery submit event on that get s triggered whenever the form is submitted here the key is the method call event.preventdefault
quoting from the docs jquery s submit event fires prior to the actual submission so we can cancel the submit event by this call on the event object

57636377
versioning	upgrade

my problem was fideloper proxy versioning
when i upgrade laravel 5.5 to 5.8 this happened just sharing if anybody get help change you composer json fideloper versioning fideloper proxy 4.0 after that you need to run update composer that s it

57636416
maven	pom.xml
once you implement option 1 get rid of those thread.sleep as it s a some form of a performance anti-pattern go for explicit wait instead check out how to use selenium to test web applications using ajax technology for comprehensive explanation and code examples
it s better to use a dependency management solution like maven which will automatically detect and download your project transitive dependencies
a relevant pom.xml file would be something like

57636636
16-bit	64bit

the original code may work fine if it is compiled in 16-bit mode because in calculation 16-bit lengths is used by default without specific cast
please also keep in mind while you are migrating your code from one platform to another or change the compile option from 16-bit to 32-bit or 64bit some of your code may not work properly

57636683
filtering	grouping
.where y y.count 1 this will filtering elements which are duplicates
.select z z.key select will create new enumerable which contains keys from grouping elements


57637185
maven	pom.xml

maybe the problem with maven
either update or add maven-compiler-plugin plugin in your pom.xml

int	chars
9
internally these symbols as int are stored for example in ascii as numbers 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57
the standard 5.3 chars sets guarantees that .

57638123
inherited	properties

i suspect the reason you are having this issue is your annotations id and generatedvalue are not inherited
if you define properties id in contactperson you will have a generated id and will not be a problem anymore

57638537
post	get

the bug lies in the way you pass in parameters for the requests.post call loop.run_in_executor executor requests.post params headers the requests post request expects keyword arguments for additional parameters such as headers as it seems from the function header
now unfortunately the loop.run_in_executor call only accepts but not keyword arguments see documentation which makes it slightly more tricky to get it work correctly

57638813
folder	directory	folder	directory
create a symlink inside the web directory of the frontend and backend
for frontend ln -s home username html yii2app uploads home username html yii2app frontend web for backend ln -s home username html yii2app uploads home username html yii2app backend web and then just use them like below either on frontend or backend windows10 for those working on localhost with widows10 os want to take advantage of the symbolic links can use the mklink utility on command prompt which take the link name as the 1st parameter and the source folder as the 2nd
mklink d c xampp htdocs yii2app frontend web uploads c xampp htdocs yii2app uploads note d is used for creating symlinks to directory

scatter	graphing
personally i don t really see the spatial relation in the case of the scatter plot and so using 3d surface help me to more easily understand the graphic
the main idea is the same than the accepted answer but we have a 3d graphing of the surface that allows to visually better see the distance between the points
the following code here is mainly based on the answer given to this question

57639075
folder	directory
indows provides you three data folder that you should use when writing your program so that windows works smoothly after publishing user data roaming user data all user data you can acess the above folder in .net application using the environment.specialfolder environment.getfolderpath environment.specialfolder.localapplicationdata environment.getfolderpath environment.specialfolder.applicationdata environment.getfolderpath environment.specialfolder.commonapplicationdata as per your given code try this this way you will be able to publish your program and your program will still work smoothly without hard-coding the path as you were doing previously
if you don t specify a complete path and just the file name .net looks into the working directory of the executable which in this case is bin debug


57639771
shapefile	geojson
you need all parts of shapefile not just .shp itself
that is why it works with geojson
you just need to pass it with zip

57639859
for-loop	loops	for-loop	loops
if you want to execute the instructions inside the for-loop until a certain condition is met in this case you should use a while loops
the bug is that the previous condition is never met because file never change while running the for-loop
thats why you are having an infinite loops

57640239
for-loop	loops

move the declaration of to the outer for-loop
alternatively you can also call the clear function off of map at the beginning of each iteration of the outer loops

57640315
for-loop	arrays
the for-loop you have written will run the body of code when the conditional written is true
here you have an arrays of max size 3
the conditional makes mx iterate up to any number less than or including 3

57640465
folder	directory
n my case i have ibm jdk with oracle jdk too but for eclipse to pickup added below lines in eclipse.ini file in eclipse directory and oracle jdk worked
-vm c was9dev java 8.0 bin javaw.exe path to your java folder has to be replaced in above example hope oracle jdk helps


57640484
oncreate	findviewbyid	setcontentview	findviewbyid

in your oncreate method there isn t setcontentview r.layout.activity_dashboard
before the methods findviewbyid which return null

57640600
for-loop	loops

you are taking input inside a for-loop
loops runs 5 times and in each iteration it asks for a std string

57640643
button	checkbox	button	checkbox
don t use an unbound checkbox use an unbound textbox formatted to look like a hyperlink
textbox properties controlsource displayashyperlink always if the form is in single or continuous view use a command button
then you don t have to be concerned about checking unchecking a checkbox

57640688
printf	fgets
o in first iteration printf statement prints robin s then in second iteration it again tries to read 7 character i.e printf statement prints ingh 7 character and then again it tries to read 7 characters but there are only 3 char including n if it is so printf statement prints ro now the below code segment since you have called puts twice it prints ro twice
from the manual page of fgets fgets reads in at most one less than size characters from stream and stores size characters from stream into the buffer pointed to by s


57640903
minimum	max

determine minimum and maximum temperatures and corresponding dates here s code that reads the data and determines the date on which the minimum temperature was recorded and the minimum value and the date on which the maximum temperature was recorded and the maximum value
on my mac the output i got from the reading code was day temperature 13.00 - 21.00 on 02-08 day temperature 4.00 - 32.00 on 09-07 day temperature 0.00 - 15.00 on 02-16 day temperature 7.00 - 10.00 on 03-01 day temperature 0.00 - 12.00 on 02-24 day temperature 9.00 - 16.00 on 02-12 day temperature 19.00 - 47.00 on 10-09 day temperature 17.00 - 43.00 on 08-01 day temperature 10.00 - 43.00 on 08-01 day temperature 19.00 - 40.00 on 02-08 day temperature 13.00 - 49.00 on 09-28 day temperature 8.00 - 49.00 on 06-10 day temperature 1.00 - 4.00 on 02-07 day temperature 8.00 - 48.00 on 05-01 day temperature 10.00 - 13.00 on 09-17 day temperature 9.00 - 33.00 on 11-27 day temperature 17.00 - 25.00 on 02-02 day temperature 18.00 - 49.00 on 02-17 day temperature 5.00 - 19.00 on 02-20 day temperature 5.00 - 24.00 on 01-08 day temperature 9.00 - 10.00 on 11-28 day temperature 5.00 - 9.00 on 12-02 day temperature 8.00 - 31.00 on 07-04 day temperature 12.00 - 28.00 on 11-26 day temperature 18.00 - 62.00 on 10-21 day temperature 11.00 - 39.00 on 10-06 day temperature 17.00 - 64.00 on 03-14 day temperature 9.00 - 40.00 on 01-27 day temperature 15.00 - 63.00 on 04-18 day temperature 8.00 - 20.00 on 08-03 min temperature 0.00 on 02-16 max temperature 64.00 on 03-14 there are two entries for the minimum temperature the first is selected

mutators	setter	mutators	getter

the part confusing me was the terms accessor mutators and properties along with the as though it s some magical improvement alias over just making the field public
accessor method to access a private field in c# both getter setter mutators method to change a private field just a setter properties same as an accessor in c#

57641172
google-chrome	firefox
his matches how google-chrome has worked for a good while pre google-chrome 74 and should be highly web compatible
this is an intermediate stepping stone to firefox 69


57641172
google-chrome	firefox

this matches how google-chrome 74+ and the the spec now work
firefox is worth pointing out that this typeerror exception will come from the absence of the navigator.mediadevices object in insecure contexts or if callbacks are used the absence of the deprecated navigator.mozgetusermedia function

57641309
division	modulo
nteger division x 10 gives us 1234
then us can do the modulo and get the ten s place x 10 10 4


57641370
stdout	fflush
his can be due to stdout buffering
there are probably a few ways to change this behavior but one quick way to test this out is to change the c executable to force a fflush right after the c executable prints out the randomly generated number


57641441
factors	matrix
y a factors object
ignored if x is a matrix
we can reshape the datasset into a long dataframe and specify the y column as the key column

57641475
filtering	grouping
then aggregate here is a db fiddle
the filtering on this is a little tricky
the inner subquery correctly identifies the grouping

57641647
hash	md5
look at well known hash algorithms like md5 or sha1 for examples
a hash is a computation and not a search
a hash table is a data structure that combines hashed values as the index for finding a previously stored value or storing a new value

57641760
implements	extends
one additional suggestion
in your original code i believe you implements a listener by implements the interface in a private class
good idea except you should extends the adapter class for the given interface

57641879
implements	extends
o basically with a decorator the crow inheritance hierarchy setup looks like this a perhaps more suitable decorator pattern example might be where a birdrepository is responsible for abstracting the database operations relating to some birds table birdrepository implements irepository and where loggingrepository is a decorator that also implements irepository but also wraps an irepository instance in this case a birdrepository to add this case own functionality - something that might look like this a method that is given a irepository object cannot and absolutely should not know whether this s given a plain birdrepository a loggingrepository wrapping a birdrepository or a fakerepository that encapsulates a collection instead of access to a database table - and this polymorphism is the entire point
this s one way to extends a type without using inheritance that vba can absolutely leverage without bastardizing the pattern too much


57641969
width	height
add below constraints to this view. leading trailing top and bottom constraints all values are zero . add equal height equal width to main view which contains scrollview
for equal height set priority to low
this is the important step for setting content size . height of this content view will be according to the number of views added to the view

57642228
post	put

ah of course right as i post the question i figured out the answer
i think this is what others had put for answers on similar questions but instead of deleting this i ll post what i did to fix the problem in case the problem helps others

57642268
virtualenv	conda

i would suggest creating a virtualenv
the reason for creating a virtualenv is that a virtualenv will leave the conda base environment alone and you will have an environment to use opencv that has the necessary dependencies

57642268
virtualenv	conda
he reason for creating a virtualenv is that a virtualenv will leave the conda base environment alone and you will have an environment to use opencv that has the necessary dependencies
also in a virtualenv particularly if you mess a virtualenv up you can just delete a virtualenv and you will staff have a perfectly working base environment


57642280
inherited	properties
o answer your question the inherited properties sets a css properties to inherited the value from the inherited properties parent
a div tag by default is a block level element so setting anything to inherited below a div tag by default will also set a div tag by default to display block


57642405
calloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
so instead of doing this returntype func params do this you may also want to change malloc calls to calloc calls
calloc zeroes out memory which can help in debugging
change malloc ... to calloc 1 ... here s an example combining code fixes from joshua s post and mine list.c test.c output 0 4 8 12 one last note you may consider creating a header file that defines these structures and functions and remove the structure from list.c

57642538
for-loop	loops	for-loop	loops
the for-loop above is iterating over acpi apm and xml and we re currently working on acpi
during this pass through loops you should only be working on acpi not also trying to work on apm and xml
that s the point of having a for-loop there

57642715
range	minimum
in that case also include to avoid points from the neighboring range showing up
if you data are sparse you may need to determine the minimum and maximum values differently than simply picking the first and last x-values
instead you should pick the correct datetime values

57642715
subtract	add
for this case you can expand the range by adding half a unit to the maximum and subtract the same from the minimum
you may also need to add one such amount to the intervaloffset
here is how i set up the points

57643231
elasticsearch	kibana
so the first one will have a value of 1546344630124 and the second one of 1546344630123456789 this isn t giving you the expected sort order
in elasticsearch there is a parameter for search numeric_type date_nanos that will cast both to nanosecond precision and thus order correctly added in 7.2
however that parameter isn t yet used in kibana

57643282
build.gradle	gradlew
finally after many trying i figured it out just follow the tips copy your signature keystrok that you use to release inside yourproject app gradle.properties modify values related to your own key app level build.gradle inside android app level build.gradle inside buildtypes 5
finally this command mac . gradlew clean assemble_your_favor_release win gradlew clean assemble_your_favor_release where _your_favor_ is your optional favor if you are not using any favor just simply use assemblerelease instead of assemble_your_favor_release


57643397
hide	show

to hide opts.css display block
to show you may customize opts.css display block as you wish

57643480
nuspec	csproj
ssembly values doesn t get picked up when you pack using nuspec
assembly values only gets picked up when using pack on csproj file


57643555
for-loop	arrays

in your for-loop don t put rather use arr.length
try with this the reason is you are using multi-dimensional arrays

57643885
folder	directory
o change all the file permissions to 644 inside the directory path to directory for more reading chmod - understanding folder file permissions 0 no permission 1 execute 2 write 3 write and execute 4 read 5 read and execute 6 read and write 7 read write and execute folder permissions read be able to read folder contents write edit folder data
delete or create new files folder inside folder contents and etc execute able to run execute the folder contents


57644391
profiling	debugging

it is not easy to answer your question without having the results of the profiling and how you did compile
for example if your run the program on msvs 19 in debugging mode it will be extremely slow

57644550
lodash	underscore.js
consider using the throttle function from underscore.js or lodash.js instead of inventing your own because those ones are highly performant and guaranteed to work across a wide variety of browsers
here is a simple example of sticking an element to the top of the screen on scroll throttled with lodash
i m using a 25ms throttle which is about the maximum amount i d recommend for keeping things looking smooth where you won t really notice the delay in the element sticking unsticking as you scroll past your threshold

57644704
client-side	server-side
it s the entire document or nothing
firestore client-side sdks always returns complete documents
unfortunately there is no way to request only a part of the document with the client-side sdk although this option does exist in the server-side sdk s select method

57644731
freebsd	linux
the linux variant redirects stdin as well as stdout and stderr if the input is a terminal and if the output and stderr are terminals
the freebsd variant redirects only stdout and or stderr
the is a terminal test is based on the c language isatty function which does the same thing as

57644734
int	chars

you can also set different velocities by setting floats or int that change every time the pawn or actor moves
for example you could connect random location nodes to a set max walk speed node for your chars changing the rate of speed they walk at and where they are walking hope this helps and answers your question blueprints

57644878
implements	extends
to derive a class you have to use the keyword extends
if you want to derive from an interface you have to use the keyword implements
saying your code should look like this and by the way you should always use an uppercase letter for the first letter in the name of a class or an interface beacuse of the java naming convention

57645146
getchar	strncpy
anyway these lists are very small because they are alternate definitions for the same acronym so this really should not be an issue
there are other problems the file contents should be allocated with an extra byte for the null terminator c must be defined as an int for the value eof returned by getchar to be handled correctly
strncpy is a false friend if the string does not fit in the destination array the copied portion is not null terminated and if it fits the rest of the array is set to 0 which is inefficient

57645146
memcpy	strncpy	strcpy	strncpy
strncpy is a false friend if the string does not fit in the destination array the copied portion is not null terminated and if it fits the rest of the array is set to 0 which is inefficient
use strcpy or even memcpy if you know the string length and the destination array is allocated to the proper size
fflush stdin

57645350
put	get

i had the same problem because i didn t put the props in the curly braces
so if your code is similar to the above one then you will get this error to resolve this just put curly braces around the props

57645786
int	chars

under the constraints of the question the answer would be 12 provided an int is 4 bytes
chars 9 - 12 would be written to the bytes of one of the int variables and the terminating null byte for the string would be written one byte past that potentially into the function s return address

57645816
sum	coalesce

oracle has a convenient function nvl2 that does this simply select empid empname sum tax as total_tax max aadhar as aadhar_value nvl2 max aadhar y n as aadhar from emp_workout group by empid empname
it is like coalesce but it takes three arguments -- the value to test the value to return when not null and the value to return when null

57646785
build.gradle	gradlew
the solution was to add the dependency as google outlines below open the app-level build.gradle file for your app and look for a dependencies section
add the line above which instruct gradlew to pull in the latest version of the mobile ads sdk and additional related dependencies
once that s done save the file and perform a gradlew sync

57646898
prometheus	metrics
hen i verified that the kafka-exporter metrics are getting to prometheus
if the kafka-exporter metrics s not there you can t advance further


57647020
context-bound	implicit
the concurrenteffect timer context-bound says that there are two instances declared somewhere concurrenteffect f and timer f _ if i understand that correctly
to be specific it has to be declared inside the implicit scope
the only bit of mystery to me is why we have to have that applicative implicit

57647113
printf	atof

always use the printf family of functions for this
even if you want to get the value as a float you re best off using snprintf to get the rounded value as a string and then parsing it back with atof i say this because the approach shown by the currently top-voted answer and several others here - multiplying by 100 rounding to the nearest integer and then dividing by 100 again - is flawed in two ways for some values it will round in the wrong direction because the multiplication by 100 changes the decimal digit determining the rounding direction from a 4 to a 5 or vice versa due to the imprecision of floating point numbers for some values multiplying and then dividing by 100 doesn t round-trip meaning that even if no rounding takes place the end result will be wrong to illustrate the first kind of error - the rounding direction sometimes being wrong - try running this program you ll see this output x 0.01499999999999999944488848768742172978818416595459 rounded with snprintf 0.01000000000000000020816681711721685132943093776703 rounded with round then divided 0.02000000000000000041633363423443370265886187553406 note that the value we started with was less than 0.015 and so the mathematically correct answer when rounding this program to 2 decimal places is 0.01

57647113
int	double
ven if you want to get the value as a float you re best off using printf to get the rounded value as a string and then parsing it back with atof i say this because the approach shown by the currently top-voted answer and several others here - multiplying by 100 rounding to the nearest int and then dividing by 100 again - is flawed in two ways for some values it will round in the wrong direction because the multiplication by 100 changes the decimal digit determining the rounding direction from a 4 to a 5 or vice versa due to the imprecision of floating point numbers for some values multiplying and then dividing by 100 doesn t round-trip meaning that even if no rounding takes place the end result will be wrong to illustrate the first kind of error - the rounding direction sometimes being wrong - try running this program you ll see this output x 0.01499999999999999944488848768742172978818416595459 rounded with printf 0.01000000000000000020816681711721685132943093776703 rounded with round then divided 0.02000000000000000041633363423443370265886187553406 note that the value we started with was less than 0.015 and so the mathematically correct answer when rounding this program to 2 decimal places is 0.01
of course 0.01 is not exactly representable as a double but we expect we result to be the double nearest to 0.01


57647498
put	get
ou can create several instances of several instances of them for each db at startup then put several instances of them into map as values and keys of that map would correspond the possible flag values of your dto
in that case you would be able to get particular transactiontemplate in you service from that map at runtime and use service from that map


57648048
post	get	put	get
it is solely based on exploiting the unsafe http methods like post put and delete
therefore get or head verbs don t need csrf cookie


57648287
loops	if-statement

you set ordered to false initially and then to true at the start of the while loops
this is fine but then in the if-statement you set sorted to false

57648296
decoder	encoder
the protocol methods init from decoder and encode to encoder are synthesized
pasteboardpropertylist you have to decoder an instance and create a new one with the standard initializer


57648869
maven	pom.xml
but in the github source code i find out that this goal is executed in the test_compile phase only specifying a phase as a target will run the other previous phases in order not directly specifying a goal
in fact this how maven works
it is defined in your spring-boot pom.xml parent hope this help

57649409
apache	nginx
he details of this would depend on which web server you are using eg nginx apache etc
for apache this could be done using the redirectmatch directive if your websites are hosted on separate servers just make sure that the website.net server has the redirectmatch in the website.net server config


57649516
int	double

an int cannot contain decimal points or fractions
change it to double and you will be fine

57649924
mouseover	pointer-events	mouseout	pointer-events

this is the default behaviours of the eventlisteners mouseover or mouseout
if you want to ignore children you will have to either set the css property pointer-events none on children or check whether the cursor is inside the parent element in your event handler however for your use case reveal an element when parent is hovered css is more suitable

57650024
minimum	max
he minimum and maximum indices at a node can be easily obtained from the values of the minimum and maximum indices at a node descendants
the indices calculation would be more complicated if we were looking for the longest substrings that occur at least k times because then the distances of all descendants indices had to be considered not just two that are the farthest apart by considering only prefixes p that satisfy i min + length p i max we make sure the p starting at s i is short enough to not overlap with the suffix s j


57650035
multiplying	add

multiplying cy z c + y z mod c when c is the base of your representation like decimal then this is how multiplication can be done manually
it s the shift and add method . in c -base cy is a single shift of y to the left adding a zero at the right

57650390
console.readline	console.writeline

you only need the following here is the deal console.readline returns a string the deal console.readline returns true or false if the deal console.readline can parse a string to an int
the loop will continually loop while console.readline cannot be parsed to an int as soon as it can the loop condition is not met and execution continues to the last console.writeline

57650648
int	chars

first we define int variadic template to store sequence of indexes pushing int to seq creating sequence now we can make sequence of compile time int meaning that
still we need something to store selected chars in array but using compile time representation which is variadic template parameter with chars next we something to extract selected chars into chars type wrapper is a type that contain we string literal

57650667
subtract	add

subtract a so now it s in 0-25 subtract 7 and mod 26
then add a again so it s back to a char

57650731
ienumerable	iqueryable
i am seeing this pattern repeated on different projects where you have a dataaccesslayer that works with your repositories and return iqueryable
so you can execute filters on the database side easy but when you are done with your data and want to pass it to your applicationlayer businesslayer you return an ienumerable
so you have the control if you want to execute queries with filter on the database side or you can bring your entities into memory executing the tolist and filter them on memory

57650746
versioning	upgrade
sqlite added support for window functions in versioning 3.25 released in august 2018
prior to that versioning the exact same syntax error you re seeing would be thrown when trying to use window functions
you can check the sqlite versioning used by python by running this in the interpreter import sqlite3 sqlite3.sqlite_version if the versioning that is output is older that 3.25 you ll need to upgrade your sqlite library versioning

57650922
int	chars

my suggestion is to scan input first as string then see if it can be phrased as int or double returns true if string test contains only digits and float point
thus if there re other chars in test the matches will return a false

57650922
int	chars
if not you might need to iterate through string chars and use isdigit to make judgement
same can be applied for int after changing the regex to aka without float point
then

57650993
vsts	tfs
hen you buy vsts users starting at 6 month those same users have a tfs cal and can connect to any tfs in your organization
if those same users also need tfs extensions like test manager or package management or if you need additional private pipelines for your team you can purchase these through the visual studio marketplace


57651008
vsts	tfs

57651436
put	get
eliver any such commits to the server that serves that git repository as the submodule so that other people can get other people
this is why you wanted to put the submodule on a branch in step 1 the submodule s easier to push a branch than to do the push from a detached head


57651624
capitalization	uppercase
- below i am importing same component appcontrolinput with a difference in ui capitalization
in the first case ui is lowercase while in other ui is uppercase
import appcontrolinput from components ui appcontrolinput

57651968
hide	show
but x86 decoding is so hard that it takes multiple pipeline stages to some to simple find instruction boundaries and then feed groups of instructions to the decoders
only the initial fetch-blocks are aligned and buffers between stages can hide bubbles from the decoders if pre-decode can catch up
show the details of core2 s front-end 16-byte fetch blocks same as ppro pii piii feeding a pre-decode stage that can scan up to 32 bytes and find boundaries between up to 6 instructions iirc

57651977
maven	pom.xml
maven properties does mention a dot
notated path in the pom.xml will contain the corresponding element s value
for example is accessible via that would explain the recursive expression cycle error message

57652336
post	get
or you can test it with hosted agent
update according to the error log we could to know you are publishing the project and delete the one .dll file in the post build event
if you check the log you will find msbuild get the files from the folder obj release package packagetmp bin rather than bin folder

57652486
symfony	silex
which means you shouldn t use it anymore for new projects
they recommend you to use symfony 4 instead
silex was really good and fast maybe faster than symfony 4 for simple requests requirements but sf4 may bring some new stack and benefits to our applications

57652744
next	except

.then callbacks returned value will be populated to the next .then callback parameter no matter if you return or not return anything from it
there isn t a way to break a .then chain except for throw inside .then callback which will jump to the catch block

57652926
jar	.war

method main is an entry point for standalone applications so if you want to use spring boot standalone application usually if not always packaged into a jar - then yes you should use main method
if you work with web applications however you work with web applications don t have main method the artifacts are web archives have extension .war

57653259
swift	objective-c
asically objective-c or swift which will let you find the uiimage then you can wrap the uiimage in objective-c nsattributedstring memojistrong nsattributedstring alloc initwithattributedstring image
swift this will let you add the uiimage as a string to whatever you need to add the uiimage to you can find a little more for the image - string if you want to save the uiimage for an image and the poster for some credit to get me this far


57653295
filtering	grouping
if you want to use single socket to filtering these you can use setsockopt with ip_recvdstaddr to get the sender s and receiver s address with wsarecvmsg and recvmsg api s
by this you can filer these messages as per your multicase grouping


57653343
client-side	server-side

a few options for you using service workers client-side the client can cache the data for you automatically but you have to set it up and be careful to expire it with the session etc
using httpruntime.cache you can build out your own in-memory caching solution server-side if you re not ready to build out a redis or couchbase cluster at this time

57653660
int	chars	int	boolean

the real problem is the implicit conversion from bool to int which is followed by a second conversion to double
boolean were added lately to the c++ language and never really considered semantically different from a number just as there is no true chars type

57653697
ssl	https

service workers as part of pwas do not need special ssl certificates to work
service workers simply need a working secure connection https

57653697
ssl	https
they simply need a working secure connection https
there are many hosting platforms offering already a ssl certificate out of the box
of course it depends on your requirements and constrains about hosting providers

57653766
unification	inference

ideally you d just be able to write but the paths there are not uniquely determined in the middle so unification won t solve t
luckily there s another cheap way to find t out let me first fix some definitions our current goal is supposed to answer what happens when we reduce luckily we can rephrase that expression in a way where inference will do what we want

57653971
ssl	https

post x509 certificate signed by unknown authority curl --data ds curl 60 peer certificate cannot be authenticated with known ca certificates more details here curl performs ssl certificate verification by default using a bundle of certificate authority ca public keys ca certs
if the default bundle file isn t adequate you can specify an alternate file using the --cacert option if this https server uses a certificate signed by a ca represented in the bundle the certificate verification probably failed due to a problem with the certificate the certificate verification might be expired or the name might not match the domain name in the url  if you d like to turn off curl s verification of the certificate use the -k or --insecure option

57654165
virtualenv	tox	virtualenv	conda
by default tox creates isolated environments using virtualenv and installs dependencies from pip
in contrast when using the tox-conda plugin tox will use conda to create environments and will install specified dependencies from conda
this is useful for developers who rely on conda for environment management and package distribution but want to take advantage of the features provided by tox for test automation

57654729
min	max	rank	max

join the tables and group by rank a_id to get the min amount of each group see the demo
depending on the intervals and the rank maybe the logic which is not clear enough could be to use the opposite sign in the on clause and max instead of min see the demo

57654729
min	rank	rank	max
epending on the intervals and the rank maybe the logic which is not clear enough could be to use the opposite sign in the on clause and max instead of min see the demo
both queries for this sample data return the same results | rank | a_id | amount | | ---- | ---- | ------ | | 1 | 115 | 720 | | 2 | 115 | 360 | | 3 | 115 | 180 | | 4 | 115 | 180 | | 5 | 115 | 135 | | 6 | 115 | 135 | | 7 | 115 | 135 | | 8 | 115 | 135 | | 9 | 115 | 135 | | 10 | 115 | 135 |


57654825
implements	extends
s they act similar to abstract classes in the way that you can specify abstract methods but you can still implements others you can do something like just to point out its not exactly the same as extends two classes but in some cases like the above example the above example can solve the situation
i strongly suggest to analyze your design before jumping into using traits usually your design are not required and you won t be able to nicely implements inheritance for example you can t use protected methods in traits


57654907
codeblocks	mingw-w64
the compiler toolchain in codeblocks needs to point to msys2 migw64 or mingw32 directory
something like this c msys64 mingw-w64

express	node.js	post	get
ext we need to create a route in this express app to handle the post request sent by twilio when a mms is sent to your twilio number
this code saves the inbound image you can get the url of the inbound image with req.body.mediaurl0 and waits a few seconds this code below uses native promises for this for the image to save in the same directory as your node.js file


57655526
union	distinct
f you wish to limit the distinction to a single or a few columns due to other columns not being distinct then one method to do this is to wrap the union in a sub-query and group by the sub-query by the columns you wish to be unique
here i wrap the union in a sub-query give the union an alias then group by the desired unique column if you have more than one column you d like to include in the distinction list then group after then group by such as group by user_id city


57655664
put	get
then we get the following code y is a variable of type which is initially bound to a box created in the outer scope
the subsequent assignment to a new box works because the of type is coerced to which can then be put in the box by automatically dereferencing the first borrow
this coercion is required because the variable x can only be assigned values of the same type

fast-forward	merge

fast-forward you are merging with a branch where you only have commits ahead and no commit behind
auto-merge git successfully applied with the patches constituting the changes introduced by the commits all the changes for each commits merge

versioning	upgrade

my problem seems to have been caused by an older versioning of npm
i upgrade npm cleaned out the modules folders and rebuilt and an older versioning of npm worked ok

57656574
for-loop	loops
the equivalent non-enhanced for-loop is the following one the second arrays access results in a different outcome than the expected one
you need to rewrite loops to get the expected result


57656708
bash	zsh
on zsh the first dash is used to terminate option processing
so as asatsi answered you can print - with echo - - - on bash single dash works just fine
from the z shell manual echo -nee arg .

57656787
union	distinct

you can use union instead of union all
if we use union we will end up getting only distinct data

57657087
for-loop	loops

you have to convert the int object from your for-loop to a str object because if a in b only works for a and b as an string str object
and you have to remove one return from loops

57657087
for-loop	loops

assume that you pass the string python3 into the method has_digits then the first for-loop iterate over the numbers 0 to 9
so during the first loops r is equal 0

57657197
int	chars	int	boolean

reason for the error is you are checking for int value in string
so change if r in string to if str r in string also there is no need for else inside the loop as it will return the false if the first chars is not a digit so you will not get correct answer you can change the first chars to something like def has_digits string for r in range 0 10 if str r in string return true # use boolean return for better use return false though this is correct way and you will get your results but learn about list comprehensions and generators

prepare	execute

the easiest way is going for jmeter templates feature from jmeter s main menu choose and click create open http s test script recorder and click start prepare postman for recording
on settings page set proxy host to 127.0.0.1 and port to 8888 execute the request in postman jmeter will capture your request and store your request under the recording controller postman uses specific authorization header which cannot be recorded and replayed

57657544
next	except
otice that after we move a number we always end with so we ll do the space in the next inner iteration
we can optimize this ending up with what looks like omg s method except that he missed the while loop too it is important to understand why this is still o n even though we ve added an inner loop each iteration of the inner loop fixes the position of exactly one number after which we will never move a number again

prometheus	grafana
n particular if you take an otherwise harmless grafana dashboard and change its time range to the past 1y you ve suddenly brought everything to a halt
its used to be that this would kill prometheus with oom


57658844
put	get
his might not be a good solution if you have memory limitation but the only other solution i can think of is looping through the original structure each time you want to get a node until you find the selected id in a given node which would be cpu intensive
maybe a node would look something like this if you just need n.attrib you could also just put that in your mapped_nodes

websphere	ibm

if i understand your question correctly you want to pause and resume the flow of messages from a jms queue into websphere application server
one way to do this is using mbean operations on the message endpoint as described in this ibm knowledgecenter topic

57659271
fast-forward	merge
git will perform a fast-forward when two things are true 1 you haven t told it not to by giving the --no-ff option 2 the checked-out branch is reachable by parent pointers from the commit being merge in
that is if git knows due to the commit graph that every change in the current branch is also in the target branch then a fast-forward would produce the right result so will be done if allowed
for example if i have master at o is reachable from feature at c meaning that every change that was ever made to master is already accounted for in c

57659598
int	double
for a single sexp target the rcpp option i ve used is if you want to check without using rcpp there are some caveats as mentioned here int and logical na both stored as int is equal to the minimum value of int -2147483648
for double you could directly use what rcpp uses namely r_isnancpp . equivalently the isnan macro could be used
for complex numbers you could check both real and imaginary parts with the double method from above

57659713
versioning	upgrade

the error likely has something to do with incompatible typescript versioning
first of all you should not upgrade directly over several major versioning

57659753
inherited	properties
using a means the object could be of type a or any sub-type of which there are an infinity not just b or c inherited here helps you inherited all properties of a into b and c that is where it s usefulness ends
using b | c also enables you to use type guards to access properties which are not common to both b and c you can t access specific fields by default unless you perform some sort of check to see what is actually in obj at run-time play


57659811
width	height
gives you 100 width
you can set any height you want on the iframe itself
then set height 100vh

57660564
int	chars
for each tr find and store the number of stars in a variable find and store the number of required stars in another variable create a variable that contains the check-mark symbol perform a comparison between the number of stars and the number of required stars depending on the result of the comparison show a corresponding message and put omit the check-mark into the check-mark container notice the parseint which turns the text of each td into an int and it is necessary to perform the comparison correctly
otherwise you would be comparing text chars not numbers rory s solution is correct


57661185
put	get

put this inside the ondatachange function code
you will get the correct results

57661249
textview	imageview
since there is angle and radius defined imageview s position relative to the textview is fixed
for now you could just suppress the lint error by adding to the imageview
better to report this in issue tracker under actually something similar lint error occurred to me when using parcelize which is reported here

57661728
junit	testng	testng	jbehave
n two words you need to find reporting agent at their github organization which depends on your testing framework junit testng jbehave and integrate your testing framework junit testng jbehave into your project
here is example for testng framework


57662186
for-loop	loops

for condition #3 strings in python are iterable meaning you can pass over condition #3 strings in python in a for-loop
each element in loops is a character in the string

57662186
int	chars
wo things to note you need to convert the chars to int first using int
you can two things to note you do 4 + 0 but you can do int 4 + int 0 you ll need to exclude - from your sum as well using if


57662533
google-chrome	firefox
in case anyone else needs this
as antonina mentioned in google-chrome the console has an application tab that has references to all the service workers used by the browser
firefox does not have the tab or at least my version does not

the subnet will have a route table verify that subnet is attached to an internet gateway with destination 0.0.0.0 0 otherwise add one by referring this link
post this step check that your security group has an ingress rule for port 22 from your ip select my ip from drop down
you will not get connection timeout error if these two steps are configured properly

57662951
swift	objective-c
if you create a new objective-c project you will find that the main function in main.m calls uiapplicationmain
in a typical swift project the uiapplicationmain attribute attached to the app delegate tells the swift compiler to generate equivalent code a main function that calls uiapplicationmain in appdelegate.o
i might be missing some fundamental understand of threads or run loops but i hope that someone can give some insight

if any views have the needsdisplay property set draw those views by sending drawrect messages
go back to step 1

57663264
width	height

i have solved it by adding a layout guide that is constrained to the width of the scrollview from the outside
also when you add constraint for the width you are left with intrinsic constraint for the height and that would change aspect ratio of the image

equals	tostring
econds.equals 0 does not actually cause tostring to be implicitly called
instead seconds.equals 0 simply calls the equals method for the second class


57663821
equals	tostring
use if value is accessible from outside the class or create a getter and use
if you did want to compare strings you could use seconds.tostring equals 0
this would explicitly use your tostring method to convert your instance to a string

57663821
equals	tostring
this would explicitly use your tostring method to convert your instance to a string
you then call equals on a java.lang.string object which actually uses string-equality logic


57664066
for-loop	loops
one way to do that would be to move the definition of x before the for-loop
then after the assignment in loops body you have the old x values in x when entring loops again


57664077
decoder	encoder
this is because the algorithm deals with the binary representation of data rather than whatever presentation you are using it as
for this reason any binary string can be encoded however when you decoder you have to be exact about the result type
it would be a worthwhile exercise or kata if you would to create your own base64 encoder and decoder

57664161
int	chars
although you may have a nullpointer exception in your code
when you attempt to access a.get 0 the value will return null as there are no int in your arraylist
also generally class files are named with uppercase first chars

versioning	upgrade
...implies that the chromedriver was unable to initiate spawn a new webbrowser chrome browser session
your main issue is the incompatibility between the versioning of the binaries you are using as follows you are using chromedriver 75.0 release notes of chromedriver 75.0 clearly mentions the following supports chrome versioning 75 presumably you are using chrome 76.0 release notes of chromedriver v76.0 clearly mentions the following supports chrome versioning 76 your selenium client versioning is 3.5.3 of 2017-08-29t12 42 44.417z which is more then 2 years older
so there is a clear mismatch between the selenium client v3.5.1 chromedriver v75.0 and the chrome browser v76.0 solution ensure that selenium is upgrade to current levels versioning 3.141.59

folder	directory
based on the paths involved i would guess that your program is named test.cpp but there is also a folder named test on your desktop so when the linker tries to create the final application it can t because the file it s trying to create is a directory
renaming your input file or removing renaming the test folder should solve the problem if that s the case

after wasting quite a bit of time chasing wrong leads... make sure especially if you are importing a iconset generated from the likes of say that you dont put the assets.xcassets in a xamarin subfolder eg under resources because the pathnames in the associated generated contents.json catalog file wont match
if you do so by mistake then the icons dont get picked up by application loader when you attempt to upload your app resulting in errors about required icons that otherwise appear to be perfectly present in your source tree

the range maximum - minimum has to be a multiple of the step value
step count precision based in this case you set how many steps you ll need between minimum and maximum values allowing you to specify the precision of its values
the resulting value is taken from the ratio between the current dial value and the dial maximum the number of steps multiplied by the range between the minimum and the maximum and added to the minimum like before

but that doesn t seem to be the answer you seek and that s less fun

57668513
erlang	elixir

doing the same thing with elixir is only slightly more complicated we need to create a mix project with a bit of extra configuration and such to tell mix to put together an escript file
so let s start with the project s s probably overkill to even use mix for this simple example but i m assuming you ll eventually want to do something more advanced than this simple example next you ll want to add an escript option to your mix.exs like so and finally your lib eip.ex module and now we just need to build it eip.py will need a slight adjustment to point to this new elixirified ping pong ipc thingamabob unfortunately this doesn t entirely work the same results happen even when using a more direct port of the erlang version replacing io.gets with io.get_line and with which means something specific to elixir s stdin handling in general is causing elixir s stdin handling in general to prematurely believe elixir s stdin handling in general s reached end-of-file

when you want to remove all pages of a given user scan the set of the user to get the page ids of the user and delete these pages

you should not put flex 1 in child views it might take whole space of the screen when you define flex 1
so i guess you should get your device height first using this

57669885
children	parent
his will isolate the event to only the triggered execution-block and this children while also ignoring any events from the parent markup
so now when you toggle the parentswitch the parentswitch triggers the parent div s onclick handler stopping any parent events from executing like the expand collapse


57669972
post	get

after further investigations i found out that the server is working properly while on client i need to change this line to apparently despite what stated in other post here on so not specifying the multipart header doesn t cause the server to be determined automatically
note also that if you omit the boundary setting you will get a boundary not found error from busboy on the server

put	get
or example if your code was 94100101140001 then you can add your code was 94100101140001 with 10 16 and get this thus your code becomes fixed-width and can be hard-centered
if your code is not subset c and contains text then in pseudocode you do in case of your code your code will produce then no matter what text you put into your code your code ll always be fixed length and so will be positioned consistently


57670380
for-loop	loops
you should also define your model outside the for-loop right before it
only the training should be in the kfolds loops


57670484
mouse	keyboard
the error is thrown because the module keyboard uses dict for hook unlike module mouse and you can t use list as keys
you can solve this by using lambda keyboard.hook lambda _ keyboard_events.append _ there is more simpler way to do this without using hook but its only for module keyboard use start_recording and stop_recording 1 start_recording to enable the recording of keyboard events
it doesn t take a callback and you can record once at a time

maven	pom.xml
it s the parent pom.xml of org.telegram telegrambots 4.4.0
if you look at maven repository you will notice that only 4.4.0.1 is available - 4.4.0 is missing and that s what gradle complains about
i didn t check jcenter but i guess it s missing there as well

57670674
postgresql	mysql
they have a couple of examples of how to use a service mysql postgresql redis or if you were using another docker image the docker service will have the same hostname as the docker image name eg tutum wordpress will have a dns hostname of tutum-wordpress and tutum__wordpress for more info refer to the details about hostnames
there are also details about running the postgresql in the shell executor if you were so inclined and there is a presentation on testing things with gitlab ci and docker

folder	directory
n empty directory in git will not not be tracked only files are tracked
however adding an empty folder in overleaf is fine and will be reflected in the overleaf project structure


57670970
folder	directory
edit for other custom directory i don t think that you can just pass a path to the intent like the one
i don t think that there is a reliable way to open a folder in android
using fileprovider test edit try instead of just parsing the uri if you are using fileprovider which you should use geturiforfile

57671082
virtualenv	conda

the problem is that keras for r creates keras for r own virtualenv called r-reticulate and pillow is missing in there
you also have to find out whether keras for r used conda or virtualenv to create such environment

57671401
int	double
in practice this means float passed to printf gets implicitly converted to double during function call
small int types passed to printf get implicitly converted during function call as per int promotions most likely ending up as int
other types passed to printf do not get implicitly promoted during the function call

57671477
tabcontrol	tabitem

it s because of the way the tabcontrol handles the adornerlayer
they are obviously not preserved when the tabitem is switched

57671536
put	get
i m not sure why you have put two mousearea since the first will be overlapped by the second completely and you will never be able to go to serversetuppage
this also touches another problem you might get if you ever grow away from only displaying a red of yellow rectangle most probably today
- and implement another mousearea that new one will overlap the one to switch tabs

57671537
post	get

i figured it out with the help of the post of tituszban i generate a list of days i have in my list of shifts
then i loop over all my shifts and split all my shifts up into a list of single datetimes for each day i then create an empty list create one datetime object each for beginning and end of the given day add beginning of the day filter my list of single datetimes of shifts to match given day and loop over this filter adding single datetimes to my list using pairwise iteration i can create new tuples and add my list to off_times list in the end i get a new array of tuples containing my off_times

versioning	upgrade

i had this error when upgrading a sitecore site to versioning 8.2
as part of the upgrade i had to create a secondary reporting database and run a rebuild on the reporting database

57671718
implements	extends
nother way to extends library classes to add methods would be to define extension functions properties on the library classes but you ll need to repeat some stuff and you won t be able to store state there
if you do need to store state and you don t want to re-implement all fields manually you can also use the delegation mechanism create a single class implements your common interface and provide an instance of this class when creating your custom extension classes for the lib

client-side filtering is never a good idea
as a general rule of thumb you should prefer server-side filtering

57671925

google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome apparently has hardcoded mappings for application pkcs7-mime which are used when the os doesn t provide info on the mime type
firefox does not so i think in your case it shows the extensions configured in the os
if anyone s curious here s the entry point the hardcoded values and the code that queries the os on windows . check what s in hkey_classes_root mime database content type application pkcs7-mime on your system

put	get
or that we can utilize dictionary s fast lookups here we try to get element from the dictionary by key x.dept
if we don we find anything we put the item to the end of the list otherwise we use the value from the dictionary for sorting


57672384
free	malloc

your os won t report exactly what you have allocated free when looking in the taskmanager or top so i wouldn t start worrying about memory consumption in that program unless t increases over time
gnu has an extension in the form of function called malloc_stats that you can call to report malloc free statistics from within a program

rtp	rtcp

solution rtp or media inactivity timers timeout create a timer and terminate the call after some interval if you are not receiving any data from the network
rtcp bye - msg handling make sure your server is supporting rtcp protocol

57673852
try-catch	exception-handling
let me quickly quote the important sections using a throw statement inside a finally block breaks the logical progression through the try-catch-finally
in java finally blocks are always executed after their corresponding try-catch blocks and are often used to free allocated resources such as file handles or database cursors
throwing an exception-handling in a finally block can bypass critical cleanup code since normal program execution will be disrupted

57674079
tibble	mapply
you need parentheses required if you want the result to be a tibble .
if you want to work harder in base r you can do this with map or mapply or in tidyverse


57674312
int	chars
his is assuming the -n argument will be followed by an int value to indicate how many chars are to be read
if the number of chars to be read from your file is 3 it would be called on the command line for example as programname.exe -n 3 this results in the arguments of being populated as so yes the c main signature will accommodate 1 to many arguments but that does not exclude the c main signature from being used to create a program that will accept only 2 arguments


57674397
tablelayout	margins

to support ie11 with auto-placement i converted grid to tablelayout every time i used the grid layout in 1 dimension only
i also used margins instead of grid-gap

the answer as partly explained in the post is that matplotlib s text sets posx and posy to infinite if the coordinates are np.nan
this doesn t get noticed at the moment that you re plotting it but only when grabbing the frame to the writer object

57675204
google-chrome	firefox
onfigure google-chrome browser however i would rather recommend to use mozilla firefox as mozilla firefox has separate proxy configuraiton to use jmeter as the proxy to wit proxy host localhost or 127.0.0.1 proxy port 8888 configure jmeter to use your corporate proxy this way configure google-chrome browser will use jmeter as the proxy so jmeter will be able to intercept and record requests and jmeter will use your corporate proxy in order to access the internet
an easier option could be using jmeter google-chrome extension in this case you will not have to worry about proxies and ssl certificates


57675329
folder	directory

it s a subjective question but i would treat it unavailability as a fatal error the same as i would do with a temp folder that is inaccessible due to security permissions
i ve seen the security error when an asp.net application failed to generate temporary files xml serialization assembly in the following circumstances running under an account without a profile so no account-specific temp directory did not have permission to access the windows temp folder

57675520
serializable	deserialization
even when new properties gets serializable deserializatin will only work for server side properties
unless some custom deserialization will be provided
in all scenarios using datatable is not good idea at all as abraham qian already pointed out

57675578
folder	directory

best solution for the above would be to go through the migrations folder and check why is django trying to create a model that already exits
first go to the migrations directory like myapp migrations do a grep on your table name on those .py files

57676035
put	get
when ub isn t visible to the compiler at compile time you get sane machine code
the machine code has to work for the no-ub case and even if you wanted to there s no way for the asm to detect what types the caller used to put data into the pointed-to memory
glibc is compiled to a stand-alone static or dynamic library that can t inline with link-time optimization

57676035
inline	inlining
glibc is compiled to a stand-alone static or dynamic library that can t inline with link-time optimization
glibc s build scripts don t create fat static libraries containing machine code + gcc gimple internal representation for link-time optimization when inlining into a program
libc.a won t participate in -flto link-time optimization into the main program. building glibc that way would be potentially unsafe on targets that actually use this .c

57676035
inline	inlining
that is pretty much safe even when inlining with current compilers because i think they don t currently treat that implying a path of execution is unreachable
but anyway the strict aliasing is already a showstopper if you ever let this inline
then you d have problems like the linux kernel s old unsafe memcpy cpp macro that used pointer-casting to unsigned long gcc strict-aliasing and horror stories

57676053
build.gradle	gradlew
here is how build.gradle may look unfortunately i cannot guarantee that your src main jni android.mk will work correctly on your windows machine
also make sure that you use compatible versions of ndk and gradlew plugin


57676067
folder	directory
he get_file function i tried returns a gfile which in this case is a folder in unix folder are also files
in order to get the files within the directory path we need to call enumerate_children_async on we gfile returned by the get_file function


57676181
width	text-align
you can use text-align left instead of float
or you should declare the width of the parent element and use float
it may work

57676210
daemons	systemd
the main point about connecting to a remote daemons is to create a tunnel to the systemd
you can see examples of how to do that here i use an ssh tunnel that i setup to point to my remote docker daemons
here s the command ssh -fnl localhost 23750 var run docker.sock remote-user remote-server you then need to set your docker_host variable in vscode preferences to localhost 23750

57676289
iboutlet	ibaction
connect iboutlet for button in class file as iboutlet weak var btncheckbox uibutton
in your class file in viewdidload set image for selected state as btncheckbox.setimage uiimage.init named name_of_image for .selected create ibaction for in class file as then connect ibaction to your button s touch up inside event from interface builder


57676302
noexcept	throw
that being said i can also not see anything wrong with declaring noexcept in this case
generally one should be cautious not to declare any library api noexcept as this potentially restricts implementators
in the case of std complex however the wiggle room for implementations is so narrow that it is fair to stipulate that no exceptions could be throw

57676302
noexcept	throw
in the case of std complex however the wiggle room for implementations is so narrow that it is fair to stipulate that no exceptions could be throw
my guess is that std complex predating noexcept there was never enough of a reason to add noexcept specifiers retroactively


57676397
coalesce	nullif
my suspicion is the second possibility -- that null is really null
if so coalesce will not work directly
if this is the case you can use nullif or a case expression

57676404
range	max

i am not sure why the code above selects the range between columns e and j for march
for me the code above worked with the exception that i exchanged the second parameter in max function for 0 because of the offset you make later

57676677
keras	cntk	cntk	tensorflow
cntk another possible backend does not support cast to int
if you always plan to use tensorflow as your backend to keras casting to int will always work

when you get comfortable with that i d recommend using workers but that is a bit of scope creep so i won t cover that
if you would like to know more on how to wire this up check out the blog post i wrote and copied from for this answer here
i also have written an entire series on database deployments with octopus deploy which you can find here

57676956
google-chrome	firefox

according to the discussion about this google-chrome bug google-chrome has a hard limit of 500 peer connections and closed connections are also included until they are garbage collected by the browser
it seems like firefox does not have the same problem

57676978
int	double
after this use a for each loop the following will show you how to do that easily then you can use read write row cell column etc and use the i int counter to go through each row
an alternative to the above is to set the excel scope then read the entire sheet to a datatable which i find easier if you are just doing database manipulation also i also would like to double down on llya kochetov s suggestions of the academy and also the uipath forum which is incredibly helpful


57677266
multiplying	add
for this reason i ll offer a condition-less function-less technique which can be execute in a foreach loop
code demo output my technique manufactures the appropriate keys from the values by dividing by 10 truncating the decimal same effect as floor making a 3-way comparison via the spaceship operator returns -1 0 or 1 multiplying the -1|0|1 by 10 adding 90 and finally concatenating an s
the ++ means add 1 to the current value of the element with the corresponding key

57677354
viewdidload	viewwillappear	viewdidload	viewdidappear

probably because the locationmanager is getting deallocated when viewdidload completes
also i would consider possibly moving to viewwillappear or viewdidappear

57677447
domxpath	domdocument
from now on we are able to access xml elements with dom functions
for better handling i m using the domxpath class
of course it is also possible to determine the xml nodes with the domdocument class

57677595
put	get
as you know the order of the entities is important. in my example the text2dentity textfront is put before the text2dentity textback in the hierarchy
so without changing your render environment we get something like this i added a red sphere to test a little deeper
i found a solution using a forward renderer and without working with a depth buffer

57678121
range	minimum
he following solution assumes the same table structure as the original result table with the exception that b1 c1 and d1 contains minimum age shown in column 18 26 and 46 respectively and that the table header starts in row 2
to construct the new column headers enter the following into b2 then copy across to c2 and d2 to calculate your result values enter the following into b3 then copy across to columns c3 and d3 then down to row 4 view alternative solution using dynamic age range result parameterized


57678254
int	chars
when you print an int - you get an int number
when you print chars - you get an ascii chars
- is not printable chars

57678319
sorting	grouping
 suspect the first is because all columns change when grouping is applied and the second is because the grouping column is moved to the left by default as when we create a new column and grouping by it it ll be moved to the left too
you may notice that sometimes after making changes to either column 1 or the new column you re not able to apply any sorting to any sorting


57678573
versioning	upgrade
this is consistent with the behavior of the -u flag for module dependencies
this prevents unexpected downgrades from pre-release versioning
the new version suffix upgrade explicitly requests this behavior

57678573
versioning	upgrade
the new versioning suffix upgrade explicitly requests this behavior
latest explicitly requests the latest versioning regardless of the current versioning


57678709
ienumerable	ienumerator
t might be that when you updated the model of the razor view from ienumerator to ienumerable that visual studio failed to recognize this change
so use ienumerable like this as i think you already correctly tried then just try debugging the app and the app should work also try restarting visual studio and razor intellisense should correctly recognize the use of ienumerable


57678846
openssl	libcrypto
your list of all the ciphers is not nearly all
it is the list given in the syntax help which is ciphers that can be used as command names and on a build of openssl that deleted idea from the build as some strict-free builds do because of past issues over patent status debian
this is only a subset of the cipher algorithms supported by the enc command much less libcrypto

57678846
openssl	libcrypto
this is only a subset of the cipher algorithms supported by the enc command much less libcrypto
in versions through 1.0.2 or openssl list -cipher-algorithms added space or openssl enc -ciphers in 1.1.0 up for the complete list
note this list is actually the algorithms and modes supported by evp but not all are supported by commandline enc

57678971
qpushbutton	qobject
the qpushbutton has a default horizontal size policy minimum by default
maybe if you set the minimum width using this function setminimumwidth int width might fix your problem. also don t forget to call this every object that inherits from qobject should be shown with this func .show . here is all the flags for qsizepolicy will help you understand what is going on in layouts layouts work a lot with qsizeplicy flags
unless you don t want the layout you have to specify the position and the size in this way and the same thing for your buttons

57679267
migrate	upgrade

using flask migrate 1- you need to add manage.py that will handle the migration
2 - run the following after you make a change in models.py in the development mode usually you need to run these two commands one by one after you make a new change on the model python manage.py db migrate python manage.py db upgrade in case of this error when migrating target database is not up to date python manage.py db stamp head python manage.py db migrate python manage.py db upgrade steps to fix errors with migrations folder this could happen if you updated db manually for some reason or some other kind of problems

put	get

also i ll put code examples in objective-c because i m still learning swift first if you re going to be doing a lot of scripting in your app it may be worth your while to switch over to scripting bridge
scripting bridge is a cocoa interface for applescripting other apps so to steal an example i found elsewhere if you want to get the name of the current track in itunes you d do something like if you want specific code for spotify i ll have to install that app

57679548
put	get

it would be easier for me to help if you had also included the output of dput occu that way i could use your data but you put enough for us to help
anyway it looks like a good option for tidyr spread this will get us into columns

57679908
oncreate	onnewintent

mount the common directory so that can accessible for both containers

57679951
newtype	either
if you want to redeclare that you can this will work like inheritance if you pass either instance through an interface
that is if you pass a newtype then newtype.f will be called
however you have to pass an interface you cannot pass the embedded struct to get the behavior of the enclosing object above only the originaltype part of n is sent to the function f and originaltype.f will be called

57680223
folder	directory
he default root import path is qtdir qml you can simply copy paste your plugin modules into this folder so that the qml engine can find and load the qml engine
or a more common practice using qqmlengine addimportpath note that you should always use module namespace imports to import your c++ plugin module import my.cppmodule 1.0 using directory imports to import a c++ plugin module is a undefined behavior currently import my cppmodule might fail


57680511
hash	md5
but now you need to share how you calculated the hash in a way they can repeat
see here for how to actually compute the md5


57680580
nuxt.js	vue.js
important - forgot what you know about vuex module in vue.js app
using vuex in nuxt.js is a bit different
solution - nuxt.js lets you have a store directory with every file corresponding to a module

57680833
int	chars
i recommend a couple of small changes for efficiency it is more efficient to convert the carid to an int once and then use an int comparison when walking through the inner loop
it is more efficient to use a stringbuilder to collect the chars because otherwise the string manipulations were repeated converting to and from strings automatically under the covers
the other answer uses map but what you have to realize is that map is running a loop inside itself

57681033
clearinterval	settimeout

you should probably use cleartimeout instead of clearinterval
as settimeout creates a timeout object which is what you are using

57681033
setinterval	settimeout	clearinterval	settimeout
as settimeout creates a timeout object which is what you are using
versus using setinterval which then you would use clearinterval


57681176
for-loop	loops

i would expect the for-loop to run only once this is the correct expectation...with one addtion the for-loop will only run once per function call
if draw is called more than once then one addtion the for-loop will execute loops every time you call the function

57681533
for-loop	loops

i think what you re asking for is how you can remake the inner generator without putting the calls to create the inner generator in the same line as the for-loop
i think the easiest way is to simply move the line defining generator2 into the outer loops your current code was not working for a large number of reasons

57681734
build.gradle	gradlew
i am pretty sure that some plugins i m using have incompatibilities with newest gradlew
i ended up with success build having the following versions gradle-wrapper.properties file build.gradle file edit as we want to use 3.2.+ versions now that isn t a reliable solution
what i ended up doing is creating a new ids.xml file and overriding all the values that have been conflicting

57681773
put	get
owever i ve still not been able to pull from the dynamic module resources r but i ll offer a workaround in answer to my own question until i find an example or get a better answer
you can put your image files in the assets folder of your dynamic module instead and then pull and convert your image files as follows


57681898
pug	ejs
ejs is one option
there is also pug handlebars mustache and a ton of others
the other option is to render static html and write some client side javascript to fetch raw data from the server

57682128
int	chars
ps your current code will break with null or any chars whose int value is greater than 255
lots of kooky unicode chars out there.
i seem to recall hearing that several dead and fictional languages are now in unicode ancient egyptian jjr tolkien s elvish klingon etc to say nothing of the cjkv range chinese japanese korean vietnamese

57682244
typedef	struct
ou need a typedef so you can refer to a typedef without saying struct first
or change work.c to use struct


57682500
csv	tsv

now if you append _export csv to the query string the browser will download a csv file containing your data
supported export formats are csv json latex ods tsv xls xlsx yml

submit	submission
because input type image fires a default submit action
otherwise here is a sample script that stops form submission whenever you click a image input
hope my code will help you

57683014
subclass	inherited
well imagine you wrote a method like this should the compiler allow this to compile or not
if you have a burning desire to implement operator overloading for certain types of vector3 you have to subclass it that would work
note that i had to change struct to class as you can t inherited a struct

57683024
post	get

matching the data from your post to the price of the matching instance in the queryset will show that your price is different and update the instance aka reverting back to the original price
consider the following scenario user 1 get inventoryview user 2 get inventoryview then post user 1 post inventoryview queryset is re-evaluated so even though you haven t changed an data matching the price against the instance the logic on the backend would say that you changed the price to 5 even though the data wasn t modified from the original get request

57683455
post	get
there are other post here which go into more detail of how to export mpmediaitem asset data which you should be able to easily search for
ios limits you to accessing only files contained in the directories of your application or application group sandbox so don t expect you will be able to get just any data from the device


57683511
int	double

for any one curious i have loaded the whole record as blob in an int table and parsed and loaded an int table from an int table
escaping the double quotes seems to be impossible as of now

57683566
filtering	grouping
irst we get a set of all the combinations of id and date then filtering the input for each combination
for each grouping we then copy date and id over to the result and reduce the entries to get the average


57683743
children	parent
 parent reaps a parent children using wait 2 waitpid 2 or similar
capture waits for a parent child to end so it doesn t leave any zombie behind


57683756
prometheus	metrics

a challenge with this tightly-coupled approach is that customers also use prometheus datadog azure aws etc
for metrics and zipkin jaeger stackdriver and others for tracing and customers should require flexibility in the systems tracing and customers use today and may use tomorrow

57684024
subtract	addition

the result of subtract sub- classes of datetime will always return a datetime instance
it becomes obvious when taking a look at the implementation for __add__ self other in the datetime module as __sub__ self other essentially just forwards the computation to the addition function when subtract a timedelta instance from a datetime instance the key here is that the _add__ function creates a new timedelta instance and then uses the .combine function to create a new output

57684336
versioning	upgrade

the default versioning of nuget running in the vsts pipeline was not the latest one
so to resolve this issue there is a nuget versioning installer task which you can run as part of your build step to upgrade the versioning of nuget running in your build pipeline besides if update nuget versioning not resolve this issue please check the sdk versioning on the build agent is same as your local you can use the task use .net core to update the sdk versioning

57684651
versioning	upgrade

reason being the latest versioning 0.60.x is never stable as compared to a versioning 0.59.x behind
it could be latest versioning is introducing a framework upgrade components introduction remove etc

57684717
superclass	subclassing
you want to supply an additional argument to the superclass __init__ method invocation
if you want to accept more arguments to your subclassing __init__ of course do put those back in.


57684883
subclass	inherited

then we call super subclass inside derived.method which leads back to where we were hence the recursion loop
the problem is only visible when you have other classes that inherited from a class which uses incorrect invocation

stateless	stateful

quick example screenshot for your reference please notice on business central kmodule definition of session are by default stateless which is expected
q2 not really as described in the drools dm manual a stateless session reference is not persisted stateful so what will happen is that your request will be handled in a stateless manner because your request s indeed a stateless session

57686469
for-loop	loops

when you want to compare if an integer is divisible by a number then you should use the remainder operator so here s the code also notice that there is no need to write that 2nd for-loop as it isn t necessary at all and a bad practice if you can do the task using a single for-loop
also as mentioned is the answer of the question a for-each loops is better performance wise than the regular for-loop so using a for-each loops would turn in into

57686772
put	get
i have a work around which my work for you
as for rest api best practices you should not put optional path parameters
it should be either in query params or request body for non get requests

57686875
client-side	server-side
client-side provides a certificate to represent the identity and encrypt the communication
in your binding configuration on the server-side only the username password credential is required
the certificate provides message security by encrypting the soap message with the public key

57687286
simulation	sampling

not very elegant but try this if you then make a test and do twice the simulation for the same demand vector by setting and plot the result you should get a straight line
this means that you are doing dependent sampling and re-using the same tech matrix for each demand vector and for each lcia

57687378
put	get

the agent uses powershell behind the scenes it looks like your it put some security in the computers that blocked running some powershell scripts maybe only it from remote
try to run it in your powershell i guess you will get this output constrainedlanguage if yes try to switch it to fulllanguage if it doesn t help maybe it s also blocked so you need to talk with it that will change it or try to change the registry like explained here or set the environment variable __pslockdownpolicy to 0

57687994
ready	each

you ll need to run updatecustommarkers when the map is ready somehow though you ve copied our demo you re missing this critical line chart.events.on ready updatecustommarkers
with that in place this critical line chart.events.on ready updatecustommarkers should work each time whether on your site or the cms

57688001
keras	tensorflow

in the keras documentation for model.fit the following is stated y numpy array of target label data if the model has a single output or list of numpy arrays if the model has multiple outputs  if output layers in the model are named you can also pass a dictionary mapping output names to numpy arrays
y can be none default if feeding from framework-native tensors tensorflow data tensors

57688414
noexcept	throw
to override that default you ll have to explicitly annotate the destructor as noexcept false -- or simply stop throw there and use some other mechanism to signal the problem
it looks like an assertion against programming errors anyway so terminating immediately is probably just as good as throw an exception


57688488
stdout	stderr
f the close method correctly handles the cleanup example of execution shortened by holger in the comments output on stdout close called output on stderr exception in thread main java.lang.exception usual failure at main.main main.java 4 example of execution with an exception thrown in the close method suggested by holger in the comments no output on stdout
output on stderr


57688666
msdeploy	webdeploy
the tricky part is to extract the msi package somehow which you can do easily on a windows machine you ll find the files in c program files iis msdeploy v3
once you install mono and obtain msdeploy.exe just call the command this lets you sync copy the contents of mnt c data with the test web site in iis on example.com with webdeploy enabled


57689012
sudo	passwd
here are commands to install properly
sudo apt-get install wget ca-certificates add the gpg key for the repository
sudo wget --quiet -o - | sudo apt-key add - add the repository during installation process you will be asked to enter an email and set up passwd

57689019
keras	tensorflow
o distinguish training and evaluation modes of the batch normalization layer you need to feed the learning phase state of the keras engine see different behaviors during training and testing on the same tutorial page as given above
this would work for example like this i tried this in tensorflow 1.12 and tensorflow 1.12 works with models containing batch normalization


57689510
min	max
min 2015-06-12t00 00 - the ticks start from the beginning of the day
max 2015-06-13t00 00 - the ticks end at the beginning of the next day
as long as the dataset you provide is correctly sorted in sequential datetime order then you should get a result like in this snippet

57689822
inherited	properties
o some class x may inherited from myclass
but your extension provides implementation of myprotocol properties of if some class x is myclass and not some class x s descendant


57690323
decimal	roundup
yes with 13 decimal but you are using roundup so it gets rounded up to 20
if i change format in that column to show a lot of decimal you will get this so is not a whole number and that tiny part 13 decimal
makes excel to round up to 20 instead of 10

57690671
int	chars
so somewhere along the lines you must have tried to insert an invalid numeric value into one or more records in your table and now it can t be selected due to it having invalid syntax like spaces between digits or disallowed non-numeric chars
make sure you are storing numbers as int when you are declaring data types as well


57690980
spaces	delimiter
o fix this you need to take delimiter into account
assuming this is always a spaces


57691009
folder	directory

will drop you in a shell inside an empty folder when you run the container hence the error
also specifying a workdir creates the directory if a workdir doesn t already exist your run mkdir home elasticsearch and run cd home elasticsearch instructions don t work as you d expect and are merely adding useless layers to your final image

57691103
hex	binary
the is a binary and operation to ensure only the single byte ascii representation of the key remains as for some operating systems cv2.waitkey 1 will return a code that is not a single byte
ord q always returns the ascii representation of q which is 113 0x71 in hex
therefore if the user is pressing the q key when cv2.waitkey 1 is evaluated the following will be determined

57691360
pyenv	virtualenv

you can use pyenv pipeline plugin
the usage is very easy just add you can add pip install whatever in your steps to update any virtualenv you are using

57692270
virtualenv	tox	virtualenv	tox
to install tox so it is available choose preferences - project project_name - project interpreter choose the relevant interpreter in the right-hand pane or create a new one
the controls for adding packages to the virtualenv are near the bottom see screenshot
click on the + symbol and a new screen will appear where you can install tox

57692319
submit	submission
that s not the case for post links link submit buttons
one of the use of ajax there are many is to perform post requests without user interactions or without form submission
ajax is xmlhttprequest and is a specific way of doing http requests using the javascript engine

57692663
build.gradle	gradlew
my gradlew build was failing every time
just found this solution add annotationprocessor org.projectlombok lombok in your build.gradle
this worked for me

57692713
client-side	server-side
well you should send your credential through a tls finally encrypting the password on the client-side is pointless for some because of tls but i find it eventually more secure as long as it can t be easily reversed see client-side encryption
another question that would answer partially yours. however it is pointless to decrypt a password on the server-side
it would even decrease the security of your process

57692895
squash	branch
t should be obvious that github s squash and merge feature destroys other people s history by completely rewriting other people s pr branch
i won t sit here and tell you that squash and merge is intrinsically evil i m sure it has it uses


57692912
put	get
ou get a new stream every time a request is made
so the typical way to watch a request is to put a php script at the url that a request is being made to


57693133
glibc	newlib
 think the problem is that mips-linux-gnu is not a meaningful target for newlib because that implies using glibc and newlib doesn t want to depend on glibc
i might be wrong but i think you need to something like a mips-elf cross-compiler to build newlib i m not sure about the target triplet so check the target


57693232
dictionary	map
a plain js object with dynamically added properties is not really a general purpose dictionary anyway
the true equivalent in js is the map but that also does not support replacing the comparison operator for keys
your approach is probably the best option

57693318
versioning	upgrade

i m using a later versioning of crm crm 9.0.4.5 but otherwise had the same problem
the only difference being that i was importing an organization that needed upgrading - the existing organization was a copy that i had previously upgrade

57693318
versioning	upgrade
hilst that does seem to be how deployment manager works that check seems to be bypassed if it also needs to upgrade the solution
perhaps a later versioning of deployment manager will fix that so using deployment manager delete the existing organization


57693830
factors	matrix
 wrote this simple function to get characterization factors matrix for the product system i will generate in the montecarlolca
the product system uses a temporara sacrificial lca object that will have the same a and b matrix as the montecarlolca


57693851
versioning	upgrade
 001 where you upgrade this pseudo-version number every time you make a change to a css file 001 002 003 004.
should be done in every html file of the site this time august 2019 the css file versioning number update no longer sufficed nor did some of the simpler measures mentioned here work for me or i couldn t even find access to some of t on a borrowed android phone


57693878
children	parent
so here is what you need to do pass triggermodal as props to the children call it when you want to close the modal
so here is the change in the parent
and in the child

57694241
cpu	processors
the whole camera application runs on nvidia tx2 with ubuntu 16.04lts
the nvidia can controllers creates interrupts on main cpu which interfere with the camera application that runs interrupts on the same cpu cores
also i have seen that 2 cores denver processors out of 6 were not working

57694241
affinity	processors
also i have seen that 2 cores denver processors out of 6 were not working
i have activated all cores and moved affinity the can0 and can1 interrupts on these newly activated cores
now i am not lossing frames so no error in the processing loop anymore

57694290
paas	deis

reading your requirements it looks to me like you require more a type of own paas on top of kubernetes rather than kind of scaling service
there are couple of existing solutions out there check deis workflow

57694422
ssl	https	implements	extends	implements	extends
assuming that you have exposed web application running on k8s cluster ingress resource might extends l7 network features for the target application service like load balancing ssl tls termination network traffic routing etc
for that purpose ingress controller has to be implements in k8s cluster thus all http https requests will be routed and processed according to specified rules inside ingress object
go further and searching for nginx ingress controller gives you an opportunity to adjust or extends some significant functionality of typical ingress controller via annotations and apply oauth2_proxy as external authentication provider to handle user request identification on ingress object as described in kubernetes dashboard example

57694442
children	parent
for many-to-many there are potentially multiple parent and multiple children
in this case you need a third table that is nothing more than a list of parent id s and child id s
keeping that in mind let s take a look at your data structure

57694494
inherited	properties
owever if no certificate key password is supplied no certificate key password inherited the keystore password
so in this case a working set of properties would be


57694674
entities	entitymanager
he problem is the use of the entitymanager s clear -method
the problem detaches all doctrine-managed entities so doctrine thinks that all doctrine-managed entities are new and saves all doctrine-managed entities to the db


57694844
for-loop	loops

i believe the first mistake is in misusing the for-loop variable. you has defined item as your for-loop variable but in the isinstance and append you are using i
also when you pop the element from list you are changing the positions what disturb loops

57694844
for-loop	loops
also when you pop the element from list you are changing the positions what disturb loops
the for-loop starts with the element 0 first element in your code case the number 1 when the program ends the first iteration it will now take the element 1 second element but as it has popped the first element now the fist element is the letter a and the second is the number 2 what will make the program ignore an element every time it iterate
i think that the code you want is something like that

57694971
int	chars
so replace 20 with 4
2 replace c to d to see the int values
otherwise you will see useless chars symbols

57695166
implements	extends
now hooks allow you to implements state in functional components
the boilerplate generated by create-react-app doesn t import component from react anymore cause only class based components need to extends from component and app is now a functional component
nothing changed really it s just another way to write your components

57695471
subscript	superscript

it looks like you re storing the formulas as plaintext without any super- or subscript text
there s nothing built in to firebase or android to automatically detect formulas and then turn it into superscript subscript so you ll have to do that yourself by entering the text correctly

57695492
nunit	mstest	xunit.net	specflow
-- specflow is a behavior driven development test framework for c# and nunit is acting as the runner.there are other runner as well xunit.net mstest v2
specflow is using the nunit to run the features in parallel
think of selenium as separate library which has nothing to do with parallel execution

57695921
prop	each
this prop should be given as an array of css colors or as a string corresponding to one of the built in color scales grayscale qualitative heatmap warm cool red green blue
victorylegend will assign a color to each symbol by index unless they are explicitly specified in the data object
colors will repeat when there are more symbols than colors in the provided colorscale

57695939
put	get
then i came up with a timestamp pattern to put into the 3rd box because i don t think there is a default pattern which will match the log entry but if anyone knows a default pattern that does please correct me and named it timestamp timestamp d d- d d d d d d d d. d d d now i created a final grok pattern using the custom timestamp pattern and a few default patterns that are commonly used and put it into the 2nd box clicking the go
button at the top we can now get your desired output you can change the name of id1 and id2 if needed if everything looks good just create the custom pattern following the logstash documentation and use the final grok pattern in your grok filter and everything should work


57695961
margin	height

ul has default margin
change that margin to 0 and give height the solution

57696426
namenode	hdfs
namenode maintains the metadata
however when we partition it creates different directories on hdfs
this ultimately helps when you want to query the data with conditions on the partitioned column

57696472
post	put
core serializers.py core views.py then you would just inherit from the mixins and your put request would just have to point to api v1 my-model bulk_update updated mixins that don t require extra viewset action for bulk operations submit a post request to the list view with data as a list
in get_serializer there s a check to ensure that only post requests can be accepted for bulk operations
if it s a post and the request data is a list then add a flag so the id field can be added back to the validated data and your listserializer can handle the bulk operations

57696909
stdout	stderr
lternatively try stderr instead just in case it s an output stream buffering issue
that extern function definition is likely to cause halide to error out because it doesn t reply to the bounds inference query and erroring out calls abort by default which would swallow things printed to stdout


57696927
viewmodel	dotvvm
ou can use all dotvvm features in the markup control you ll just have to explicitly declare how data from the viewmodel should be passed if you want to use data bindings
a minimalist markup control may look like this then a minimalist markup control must be registered so dotvvm can find a minimalist markup control in dotvvmstartup config.markup.addmarkupcontrol tagprefix cc tagname mymenu views mymenu.dotcontrol


57697050
google-chrome	firefox
for long strings add .repeat 300 to the test string the faster is answer 1 followed by the second and the third
note the above is true for browsers using v8 engine google-chrome chromium etc
with firefox spidermonkey engine the results are totally different check for yourselves

57697182
folder	directory
so notice that if you were trying to delete a file that was in the localapps folder you should use instead rm localapps logo.jpg but this is always assuming that the relative path to your image is localapps logo.jpg
you can also change directory then delete the file like this cd localapps rm logo.jpg


57697193
public	protected
accessibility of data members members of a java interface are public by default
a java abstract class can have class members like private protected etc


57697305
post	put

in your case you should see the whole logs i tried your code and there is more info below the error you post which means you should add a after your baseurl and then you will see another crash says missing either get url or url parameter
it because get url is blank in movieapiinterface.getmovies i recommend you change your baseurl to and put popular into get annotation

57697948
decoder	encoder
the original transformer architecture does not parallelize the decoder
only in the encoder is the sequence of tokens processed in parallel
for a detailed summary of the transformer architecture and training testing process you can see this article

57698650
maven	pom.xml

option 1 another way to do it is to build the first project as a jar without maven in this case your jar is usable by the first project as a jar when you run maven for the first time
your jar will need to be added as dependency in the pom.xml

57698751
google-chrome	firefox

in ie you can see even focus by this command document.getelementbyid bets-stake-amount-1 .focus and in firefox you cannot get focus or cursor in at all
also google-chrome no change after focus but this command document.getelementbyid bets-stake-amount-1 .focus can show focus after entering by tab or mouse click

57699047
spaces	delimiter
this requires determining those characters that may be in the file but would not be considered part of a word
characters such as n t spaces - etc
should be considered delimiter and can be used to extract the words

57699157
put	get

it s easy for attackers to put a few more zeros on the limit causing the server to do exponentially more work
conversely once you get above a few hundred objects returned from this service the extra work of paging http requests will always be a small percentage of the total work performed and keeps clients honest

57699386
children	parent

you can set the width property of the children to fit-content
doing so will make these elements take up only as much horizontal space as these elements need and is available within the parent

57699702
background-image	background-position

use css property background-image url your image path imagename.jpg
background-position center

57699702
background-repeat	background-position	background-repeat	background-size
background-position center
background-repeat no-repeat
background-size cover

57699784
put	get

this will put your cursor in drawing mode to draw an oval
after running you may have to click on the slide once then your cursor will change shape and you can draw an oval sub drawoval application.commandbars.executemso shapeoval end sub other commands to substitute for shapeoval shaperectangle shapeelbowconnectorarrow shapestraightconnectorarrow get the full list in excel spreadsheets from microsoft office 2016 help files office fluent user interface control identifiers look for the powerpointcontrols.xlsx file and search the first column with shape there are 173 shapes in the menu so you have a lot of macros to write

57700170
mouse	keyboard	mouse	keyboard
it removes removed mouse click events that are not preceded by a mouse down on the same element
a keyboard hit is never
the preceding mouse down was the focus click - in my strange case

57700235
width	height

use this by id name document.getelementbyid box .setattribute style width 100px
height 100px

57700255
background-size	object-fit
hen stretch your image to the full height and width of its parent and use object-fit cover to make your image fill your box
this will have the same effect as on a background-image with the background-size set to cover


57700277
spaces	delimiter

to remove your extra spaces i would just do something like
with the delimiter the delimiter is specific to the situation

57700309
post	get
i will post here how i solved the problem in order to avoid painful hours to other people in the future
it seems that ids which are auto generated from the database auto-increment of mysql in my case and hibernate don t really get along if the main goal is to obtain high performance
for this reason i have decided to reconsider the database structure and change the primary key of the datumcountry table from something which can be known by hibernate only performing a query against the db to something which can be known by hibernate without hitting the database

57700357
puts	gets

for your updated totally separate question which replaced your question about disassembling a .o semi-related unexpected value of a function pointer local variable mentions the fact that the linker transforms references to puts to puts plt for you in a non-pie because that lets you get efficient code if statically linking but not in a pie
libc gets mapped more than 2gib away from the main executable so a call rel32 can t reach it

57700421
int	chars
e first get the possible unique values with  note that you can directly reference columns in j without needing  we can reshape that to wide format to get something like this the next 2 lines simply transform values into int setting na to 0 and 1 otherwise
afterwards this idiom is applied which is like a nested join in this case the join is done based on id so all the rows where it matches between dt and unique_wide have the values of non- id columns updated with what is present in unique_wide  also note that is useful to select columns based on a variable holding a chars vector


57700496
folder	directory

if you use mingw then you should use the libstdc++-6.dll found into the folder of this compiler
mingw bin folder should be the place to search for mingw bin folder on your computer if you copy this file in the same directory as your executable you copy this file in the same directory as your executable should be ok.

57700768
width	height
etting the element s width and height to 0 did not work either
so the element s has to be at least 1px in width for this to work


57700903
versioning	upgrade
bout 3 months ago i upgrade to the newer versioning and shortly after could not understand why the above behavior was happening
once i reverted back to the older versioning the older versioning started working correctly again and after failing 5 times is moved to poison queue and never ran again


57701112
int	chars
a simple fix would be to use either a string an int or a short instead of a chars
edit it works for single digits because you used a chars literal not because chars are also bytes in c++
that was my mistake

57701124
put	get

yes you can totally put more fields called git commit extra headers in there
more fields called git ll show up with git cat-file -p but the only way i see to get more fields called git in there in the first place with the standard git client is by editing the git source and recompiling

57701552
range	max	range	min

one solution is to use opencv normalize to stretch the image to full dynamic range 0 to 255
here are two output results depending upon the min and max stretch limits

57701552
range	max	range	min
ut we ned to clip the results to this range and then scale the results to this range 0 to 255 before saving as uint8 for output if the min and max values are outside the range of 0 to 1
the first result is stretched to min and max of 0 to 1 the second result is stretched to min and max of 0 to 1.2 in order to make it even brighter image min and max 0 to 1 min and max 0 to 1.2


57701603
windows	wow64

according to my test if you make a request to second url with default header you will be forbidden to access content i guess server think you are web spider under user-agent python-requests 2.xx.x .so just change headers user-agent to be the value e.g mozilla 5.0 windows nt 10.0
wow64

x86	64bit
sually the 32 bits version is used to design and the 64bit version is used for the final compilation
i also use vtk activiz c# on visual studio and activiz c# on visual studio works fine when my program is targeting x86 platforms


57702343
swift	objective-c

i ve found that it doesn t like swift tests
try switching to objective-c

57702817
inherited	subclassing
ote in python-2 the syntax for super is different than python-3 and you must also supply the subclassing player and the instance self as args
i tested inherited with super player self .__init__ name in this sample repl.it using python-2 and repl.it also works


57702892
folder	directory
error enoent no such file or directory open s globle_express views layouts main.handlebars answer
enter image description here rename your layout folder and do layouts the folder structure of expressjs should be like this


57702935
versioning	upgrade
different versioning of oracle have a different internal jvm so you could upgrade the jvm versioning by upgrading the database
if you upgrade to 12.1 or later you would be able to choose between two different jvms though it is an either or choice-- you can t have some code using one jvm and some using another
a java stored procedure can t use an external jvm

57703000
html2canvas	jspdf
and about your second query jspdf has addhtml and addimage older versions of jspdf functions to help you generate pdf
addhtml take in raw html code as input while addimage takes image as input which can be positioned on the pdf page. addimage requires additional libraries such as html2canvas for image generation


57703034
for-loop	loops
it does not suspend the current goroutine so execution resumes automatically
this suggests that what happens is that you may break out of the for-loop of one go routine but immediately enter the for-loop of another go routine
thus the cpu is still busy running a lot of for loops unable to take a breath

57703073
put	get

update i put a better solution at the bottom
you can achieve this by using method or function fields to allow a parent to get data from a parent child

57703243
next	except
here is currently as of 2019-08-29 and as far as i know no way to directly get the number of registered users in a firebase project except through iterating through all of them and counting them manually
the fastest way to do this would be by using we have to use iterator_count here because auth listusers returns a generator that behaves differently than the usual array instead of fetching all the users at once it will fetch the next batch only when we need the next batch


57703474
height	border-box

the issue is because you have applied 100 height to your .modal element and also applied 100px padding on top for the same
one solution is to apply box-sizing border-box to .modal or try height and padding in percentage so that the sum wont exceed 100 or rather than applying height try setting bottom offset

57703634
submit	submission

jquery on click event is getting triggered first as onclick index.php so remove index.php and submit the form then index.php will work.or if you want click event to be trigerred you should return true
or you can submit form using jquery using .submit and after submission the form you can use location.href

57703858
folder	directory	folder	directory
to add the reports folder use the following steps
log onto your tfs server open a command prompt as an administrator navigate to the c program files microsoft team foundation server 1x.0 tools directory enter the following command entering the appropriate values for each parameter
tfsconfig addprojectreports collection teamproject patrick template agile this command will create a report site and folder

57704090
versioning	upgrade

this is because of spring and cloud versioning not compatible
the versioning of the parent should be an upgrade one or the same as cloud versioning

57704117
put	get

i have one way for problem solution but you need to put your css in .php file under style tag
php code for get server url put your css at top of in .php file base_url

57704415
versioning	upgrade
you can upgrade the versioning over there
also make sure to remove or replace versioning numbers in api calls in your code


57704427
inherited	properties
just fyi you can also use self.menu_set.all
see below for the model change in the serializer change the serializer inherited to modelserializer
you shouldn t need to change anything else unless your properties name in models.py is different to the serializer fieldname sources in rest framework serializers

57704637
versioning	upgrade
please first upgrade your build agent versioning to latest
as you can see in this link system capabilities do not support vs2019 with prior build agent versioning
then you can try follow to jessehouwing s suggestion to install a newer versioning task

57704637
versioning	upgrade

details refer this question missing last versioning 2019 of visual studio on tfs build configuration caution this may cause issues when upgrading to another server versioning at a later stage may require newer versioning of the azure pipelines agent and can put you in an unsupported state
you can clone the azure pipelines agent tasks repo build tasks repo locally and then use tfx-cli to upgrade the built-in tasks in your server

57704710
post	put
but api interface should not be changed
with that being said i would include status into post object returned by api
then updating status is just patch if you want to update only status or use put if you are replacing entire resource

57704905
int	chars

there is no need for the 02_restart_nginx command you can remove that one as of aug 19
i tested this on beanstalk env with node.js running on 64bit amazon linux 4.8.2
overall though it looks a bit hacky you may want to consult with amazon-web-services support for the official way to customize nginx.conf

typedef	struct	typedef	struct
reference in c in this case there are two options the first is to omit both typedef and struct_name_t in which case to declare a struct you will need to actually include the struct keyword struct struct_name struct_instance
or you can use a typedef to declare a struct_name_t type that you can use struct_name_t struct_instance
in either case if you wish to declare a pointer to a struct inside of the struct you must use the first syntax with the keyword struct

rom the official documentation your image will be named after the following scheme gitlab supports up to three levels of image repository names following examples of image tags are valid registry.example.com group project some-tag registry.example.com group project image latest registry.example.com group project my image rc1 so the solution to your problem is simple - just build individual images and push individual images to gitlab container registry under different image name
the following config should give you an idea and you should be able to pull the same image using in later pipeline jobs or your compose file provided that the variables are passed to where you run your compose file

int	chars

some problems with your code the while condition is wrong condition should be after the while you are left one byte before the last newline so you should go forward 2 bytes to be precise lseek returns an off_t not int so you should do as a consequence other variables that you use to do comparisons should be off_t too and most importantly the return type of the function too
is wrong to compare a single chars you can just do

decoder	encoder
f you re concerned about performance you could write something like this that decoder the singleton object the singleton though and in our desired representation our have a wrapper
we can accommodate that with a single extra line at the end this will fit right in with a generically derived instance for our updated item class import io.circe.generic.auto._ io.circe.jawn.decode case class item id long name localizedstring and then the customized encoder is a little more straightforward and then this approach will work for any number of dynamic fields like this you can transform the input into either a or jsonobject and work with the key-value pairs directly

if you use standard xcode groups to organize your files in project you will eventually find out that you use standard xcode groups to organize your files in project creates mess in your project root folder on a disk
xcode groups folders exist only virtually while on the disk you will see plain list of created files in the root directory and that can potentially lead to some possible uncomfortable situations and even risks

versioning	upgrade

i found the answer the composer-rest-server was not updating as the answer was still following versioning 0.0.1
which was the older versioning that did not have queries the solution is to change your versions to change 0.0.1 to 0.0.2 in your package.json and upgrade the network by following steps and relaunch your composer-rest-server use this if you are stuck somewhere composer archive create --help composer network --help composer network install --help composer network upgrade --help

git-rebase	undo
ut let s look at each assumption reset to the correct commit in general you could actually have started with something like you would still want to make your replacement commit from o and not from the current master head  or else your squashed commit would implicitly undo the changes from y
that is you want to end with and not if you instead want to end with then you really need to be looking at a git-rebase instead of a reset  so the reset command could be something like or if you know how many commits are on the branch git reset --soft head 3 or if you know the specific has for o already you can just use that

you could map output_dir to dictionary which will be evaluated later

it looks wired that you mapped to whole dictionary and mapped to one field again

57713565
spaces	delimiter
fter all variables got expanded the resulting strings are passed as arguments to the executed program where arguments are delimiter by unquoted spaces on the command line
therefore in your examples is equivalent to cqlsh 00.000.00.00 -u user -p password -f command.cql which is equivalent to cqlsh 00.000.00.00 -u user -p password -f command.cql the shell will call the program cqlsh passing the shell 7 arguments 00.000.00.00 -u user -p password -f command.cql quoting correctly is very important nevertheless because of how shells handle variable expansion most importantly by this rules this for bash but should be applicable for most other shells too strings in single quotes are not subject to any variable expansion and get passed literally strings in double quotes are subject to variable expansion the final result of the expansion will be passed as one string to the executed program unquoted variables will be expanded on the command line and the resulting command line then gets executed most of the time the end result of enclosing variables in double quotes and passing them unquoted is the same but it may be different depending on the value of the variable especially when containing spaces characters in this case the result will be passed as multiple strings to the executed program instead of a single string

imagemagick	mogrify
ust in terminal command prompt on windows magick image.png -background rgb 68 114 196 -gravity south -splice 0x40 result.png if you want to splice 10 extra onto the top instead use magick image.png -background rgb 68 114 196 -gravity north -splice 0x10 result.png if your imagemagick is older than v7 use convert in place of magick in the above commands
if you want to do all the images in a directory go into a directory and make a new sub-directory for your results then use mogrify if you want to use opencv and python you can do this


57714202

in this case defining your own shared folder can be very helpful

57714734
for-loop	loops

the better way is to call the method and set the method to a local variable and then use the method in the for-loop
the method is not ideal to use the function call inside the for-loop condition since each time the method is evaluated and the same function will be called for each loops iteration which will impact the performance

57714855
int	boolean	equals	compareto
second the signature of returned value is different. equals has a return of boolean meaning you only have true or false being returned from the method call
this will only tell you directly if they are the same or not with no extra information the compareto method has a return of int which is a magnitude of the difference between the comparison of the input type
the comparison can not be between different types

multiplying	add	multiplying	add
sandybridge has 1c throughput so you d need to get the job done in 2 pmuludq insns per multiplying on average to compete with scalar

57714970
int	chars
so basically every int or chars value that is not 0 will be contextually be converted into true while 0 will be converted into false
note that this is how c programmers use conditionals as c does not have a boolean type they use int to return true false values instead
also note that the conversion is not implicit but is rather a contextual conversion there is a large difference between them

filtering	grouping
ou can work around this if desired by grouping the records by id and setting an appropriate aggregating function for all the other fields that you want visible for example you can set the summary type for the user notes date field to min or max depending on whether you want to see the first or most recent date when that string was entered
that string will also mean you re filtering out any records where that string is not found

ne possibility to get around this limitation is to write your own small command-line interface as a wrapper for the application
for example let s say the target application looks like this then you could write your own wrapper class as follows put this on the classpath and execute this instead passing this the command-line arguments that will control the behavior as desired notes this does not require modifying the source code of the original application but the exact details of how to accomplish this will depend on the design of the application in the jar

if you want it to find all the positions where that chars exists just remove that break. there are better methods of doing this look into just using abcde .index a this works

hen we use the term libraries we are normally referring to the classes that are located in the libraries directory and described in the class reference of this user guide
you can read more on creating and using libraries creating libraries codeigniter 3.1.10 documentation after placing the newly created class in the term libraries folder to use just simply load the library within your controller as shown below if you wish to receive several arguments within you constructor you have to modify you constructor to receive an argument which would be an array and you loading initialization would then be slightly different as shown below then to access any of the functions within the class simply do that as shown below i hope this answers your question if you have further question do leave a comment and i would do well to respond to you have further question


57719418
for-loop	loops

variables declared with let are not visible accessible outside let scope which explains the error raised by the console.log that is outside the for-loop
it also explains why loops runs three times and prints 4 the explanation is that the i inside the for-loop block the one declared as is different than the i in loops header due to the invisibility that comes with the let keyword the i in which is inside the for-loop block is not visible in the they re different and so the one inside the for-loop block is not affecting the one outside in the header

57719479
for-loop	loops

ecmascript 2015 has a particular clause 1 to cover what a for-loop does when what a for-loop has a variable defined with let in the control structure
my reading of what a for-loop is that what a for-loop is specifically designed to provide a separate environment record for the variable within loops body so that what a for-loop value in a loops iteration will be seen by nested functions used as call backs - and in the process obviating the need to capture the value of a loops variable in a closure

you might consider creating a function that calls the negateimage or addsephia outside of loops
you may also save the length of the dataarr rather than re-calculate on each iteration make sure not to implicitly create global variables too - declare the i in the for-loop


57719667
for-else	break

you can use the for-else construct to continue the outer loop if the inner loop did not find a valid pair
otherwise break both the inner loop and the outer loop to get out of both loops once a valid pair is found

57720102
vuejs	vue.js

also the vue.js gets created using the mode value of process.env.node_env variable
you can have more details of this from the production deployment docs from the vuejs site

put	get
et s do consecutive numbering and try to get python and julia to display alike so if you want things to print similarly on the screen you need to swap first and last dimension sizes reverse the order of dimensions on the arrays between julia and python
in addition since julia concatenates the arrays when you put the arrays in the same brackets but python just nests python arrays in greater depth you need to use np.reshape on python or reshape on julia to change the arrays to the shape you want

stdout	fflush	stderr	fflush

buffered outputstreams are being written to two separate output s without flushing stderr and stdout
print your message print the stack trace and then fflush and you will see the behavior you expected

57720641
post	get	put	get
after the installation of xampp you place your php files inside the httpdocs wwwroot folder of your xampp and get post put delete from instead of .
then your php code should get executed from the php server

children	parent
m unit em an em is equal to the computed font-size of that element s parent
for example if there is a div element defined with font-size 16px then for that div and for that div children 1em 16px


57721015
for-loop	loops
but i suggest you to do not include inside for-loop
do this instead since your foreign key is inside ore model instead one to many relationship which means 1 user has many ores so you need to loops every ore on each user
if that so you need to change your view using annotate then in your template

57721241
dictionary	map
you essentially are looking to map a state to an action
dictionary are perfect for this use case
create a dictionary mapping where the keys are the states and then action is the actual function

subclass	abstract-class

precisely to force you to create a subclass because it s the only way to capture the generic type
it s written in the very first sentence of the javadoc that you linked to this generic abstract-class is used for obtaining full generics type information by sub-classing

57721576
subclass	superclass
i just wanted to demonstrate the principle of action
you can try this for yourself on other classes ideone demo output as you can see creating the anonymous subclass preserves the type information about what the concrete generic type of the list is at runtime
a typereference does much the same has a generic superclass and from this you can get the type

57722051
post	put
procedure to make array from tree do level order traversal if root has a value put it in array else put -1 in array repeat until all nodes been traversed pseudocode now you can reverse the algorithm to construct a tree from the array and after that you can do post or in whatever you need
procedure to make tree from array create root 1.1 put root in a queue traverse i-th index from array 2.1 if array index
-1 create node on left 2.2 else put null on left traverse i+1-th index from array 3.1 if array index

57722051
put	get

-1 create node on right 3.2 else put null on right continue until queue becomes empty pseudocode now you could able to make a tree from the array you have
and can traverse a tree to get in or post order traversal

57722073
multiplying	division
s-is the result of the division itself before multiplying may not be whole number and since in python2 is by default int-division the decimal part gets cropped and you get the wrong results
there are couple ways to fix that pick your favorite change the order in the equation instead of use that way you are guaranteed to get whole number after division change the type of the first part of the equation to float to force float division use python3 instead of python2 as python3 uses decimal division by default use from __future__ import division to activate python3-like division edit in general at least in python _ import division to activate python3-like division edit in general at least in python is advised not to use recursion if possible as _ import division to activate python3-like division edit in general at least in python is not efficient and you may run to problems like recursion limit

otherwhise i hide the button


57723127
for-loop	loops
hen in the other process # kill our friend xargs -a tmp stress.pid kill another option might be to put both the stress test and the for-loop in the same script like this sample output another option is to communicate via the filesystem so here s a particularly ugly solution based on that
in the process that is repeatedly reading from mmc put a test inside loops to see if a file exists and break out or exit if a file does in the other process simply create the sentinel file when you want to signal the sentinel file to stop using touch tmp stop ugly but effective


57723483
int	chars

you can use string.valueof int whatever to make the int into a string
then use string.charat int index to get the chars at indices 0 1 and 2

57723526
viewmodel	caliburn
i noticed also that when i toggled the visibility of the grid in code-behind the event didn t get fired but when i bound the visibility dependency property to a property in my viewmodel it worked
seems like another bug in caliburn
i think it s usually good practice to place events and bindings on controls inside the usercontrol rather than the usercontrol itself

57723549
youtube	vimeo
when embedding youtube or vimeo add and in vimeo also to the url like this if you re working with youtube and still have issues use iframe api and play the video using javascript when using an iframe and youtube video remember to use embed url not standard video url youtube video manager is here i can never find the youtube video manager in the ever changing interface
recommended solution register on vimeo upload your video go to video settings find embed tab and set up your embed video embed your iframe this one does autoplay and loop

57724410
google-chrome	firefox	folder	directory

so to change your start page original name is about home make usercontent.css file inside google-chrome folder
after all your directory tree should look like this home --user-- .mozilla firefox --something--.default google-chrome usercontent.css then to change about home style use this code inside usercontent.css google-chrome should work perfectly and i tested google-chrome but if anything happen i would be happy to help you update userprofile directory on windows is and mac os

57724490
filtering	grouping
so to allow for this we have to use so jinja2 uses an empty list when grouping isn t defined instead of throwing a dict object has no attribute error
the omit part is similar to the default omit filtering where ansible simply omits the option from the task
lubo s problem is a little simpler so using just default omit filtering should work

57724824
opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
ote that the part pseudo element and the corresponding part attribute currently only work in google-chrome and opera
firefox will support firefox in version 69 but first you will have to set layout.css.shadow-parts.enabled to true in layout.css.shadow-parts.enabled about config page which makes me doubt that layout.css.shadow-parts.enabled will be very useful for regular users using firefox so i hope mozilla will turn mozilla on by default very soon


57724895
mongodump	mongoimport

mongodump is good to dump the whole db
if you just want to work with one collection try to export the transaction collection with mongoexport like mongoexport --collection transaction --db mydb --out transaction.json and import it with mongoimport --collection transaction --db mydb --file transaction.json . if you are restoring a full dump and it fails with a certain collection then you can do the restore without the offending collection by using the following flag --excludecollection transaction

57725056
for-loop	loops

since you only fix the product node in the for-loop and then traverse down to the attribute s twice once to check and once to retrieve the value you cannot make sure that you only get values of color attributes
your query says for every product that has one or more color attributes return all attribute values. one easy fix is to just iterate over attributes instead of products if you also need the product reference you can use nested loops you can also replace the where with an xpath predicate and make the whole expression shorter

57725347
versioning	upgrade

the summary is- the principal and mirror server instances must be running on the same versioning of sql server
while it is possible for the mirror server to have a higher versioning of sql server this configuration is only recommended during a carefully planned upgrade process

57725347
versioning	upgrade
while it is possible for the mirror server to have a higher versioning of sql server this configuration is only recommended during a carefully planned upgrade process
in such a configuration you run the risk of an automatic failover in which data movement is automatically suspended because data cannot move to a lower versioning of sql server

he readme for the connector doesn t seem to mention an operation to put logs into cloudwatch but if cloudwatch has a rest api for cloudwatch -every aws product has it- you could use aws product in your application
this kb article shows how to get the logs from cloudhub


57725926
inherited	properties
so viewcontext in aspnet core doesn t inherited from controllercontext like in the older aspnet mvc framework
instead viewcontext inherited from actioncontext which is more generic term
due to that fact there is no inherited controller properties on the viewcontext object but rather you can use actiondescriptor properties to get the needed value

57726515
post	get
ou are using a post
if the 302 status code is received in response to a request other than get or head the user agent must not automatically redirect the request unless the request can be confirmed by the user since this might change the conditions under which the request was issued


57726523
int	chars
int itself is a reserved word for a type
in this cases for simplicity and understanding we use some basic chars like t or r as the generic type if you really keen to use generics for other functions


57726584
prometheus	metrics
rometheus does contains any kafka messaging middleware to ingest metrics actually prometheus is more like scraping metrics pages or to expose metrics
here a document talking about prometheus data export that can maybe help tuning your queries


57726703
inherited	subclassing

both route and routeprefix are not inherited because inherited is set to false as shown below you can read more about inherited here
you will need to decorate your subclassing again unfortunately

you can do this by using xts and zoo package
no need to use quantmod

57727569
children	parent
then you can use top left right and bottom properties to put children to specific coordinates
also you need to set position property of the parent component to relative


57728034
arraylist	linkedhashmap
however if you are passing collection classes object directly to your parser and want to maintain the order then you need to use linkedxxx or arraylist for list interface
in your case as your are using you should use linkedhashmap implementation
this has very good explanations of collection framework

so if you do not specify which items you want in the post method then you get all of them
the same goes for get


57729835
sorting	grouping
the relevant parts of its package.json are the api docs are a bit vague about the meaning of the grouping attribute last a grouping property defines sorting and grouping of menu items
i infer from the behavior that a word like bookmarks establishes a grouping of menu entries separated from other grouping by a horizontal rule and the number suffix controls ordering within each grouping


57729880
for-loop	loops
ou can dedupe the 1st and 3rd for loops with a single for-loop setting all truckdriver values to 0 initially
this also allows removing the last else case as truckdriver is already 0 you can remove the branch as always false since you iterate i while extracting the check makes your code longer in # of lines but shorter in character count and much easier to read lastly as you yourself mentioned the if statements and the then clauses are very similar and can be reused inside a for-loop

what you ll want to do is put the timestamp as a value in another metrics that has all the same labels and no label label on either

57731444
for-loop	loops
inner for-loop never executed since you have to get the length of the object to loops through

filtering	grouping
his query will give you records of count per each continent the 2nd query means performing distinct and count on whole table but not grouping note after filtering population
this query will give you distinct unique continent but count is independent of grouping and is of whole table


57732331
free	malloc
now whenever you require memory the custom malloc function for shared memory shoud hold the logic to provide memory efficiently
custom free function would free the shared memory released by program along with adding that chunk s in free list

57732712
cpu	processors
the instruction set architecture defines the machine code of the processors and the processors s behavior given certain states and instructions to execute
instructions in machine code are strings of binary digits which the cpu interprets aka executes
in machine code there are no assembler directives labels variable names etc..

57732956
range	max
is still ambiguous as you might have more than c1 values which have the max c2 in the table it could have been implemented to return more than one row but this is not how sql was designed
when you use aggregate functions you specify group by to select your range where a single value of the aggregate function is returned for each range
the way to get the result you want is like this

57733600
fgets	fread
after all fread and fgets probably use read
one way would be to split all the posix stuff into separate libraries the user has to link -lio or whatever to get read and write and other functions and then have fread and getc use some alternative read function so they work even without -lio
the approach in glibc is not to use symbols like read but instead stay out of the way by using alternative names like __libc_read in a reserved namespace

57733609
google-chrome	firefox
i had a similar issue but the headless worked in firefox and not google-chrome
the xpath for the google-chrome element worked only in headed mode
i found out the html was changing slightly in google-chrome s headless mode

57733703
post	get
he goal is then to get unity to send json structured data
tip you can also create some json and post some json to your api with tools like postman curl etc or even just devtools in web browsers to test out the api side of things


57733803
hex	binary
i think i could derive it from the example though the peculiar numeric encoding numbers seem to be encoded with 2 bytes 4 hex characters each where the most significant bits of these 2 bytes bits 7 and 15 do not contribute to the value they are always zero
furthermore the remaining 14 bits are encoded in offset binary where the most significant of those 14 bits is the inverted sign bit
this means that 4000 is zero 0000 is -8192 the minimum and 7f7f is 8191 the maximum

57734242
int	double

as said above 4 3 being an int division it does which messes up your calculation
you can do 4.0 3 or double 4 3 as suggested above you can also use math.pi instead of manually assigning 3.14 to pi that way you can change the precision of your equation a lot more easily

57734326
int	chars
if it had been we couldn t have added the extra chars
to get rid of the decimals we could convert to int dtype - but that messes up the inf
so there limits as to what you can do to an array and still display all elements in a consistent manner

57734390
spaces	delimiter	spaces	delimiter
key-value brackets can be delimiter by comma spaces or comma+space
value can optionally be wrapped in single or double quotes but must be wrapped if value contains a comma spaces or equal sign
the canonical format uses comma delimiter and single quotes

57734563
folder	directory
this is critical because the shared classes folder is where the alfresco-global.properties file resides as well as the alfresco extension and alfresco web-extension folder
these latter directory need to be populated with files from the zip distribution archive as explained in the docs


57734726
for-loop	loops
this can be done with the ternary operator then you need to print an extra line at the end of each iteration of the outer for-loop because the outer for-loop is the one that prints rows
your loops should look like this


57734892
ubuntu	debian

if you use ubuntu you can try this on the command line
the result is impressive install ghostscript for ubuntu debian sudo apt-get install ghostscript resize your pdf with the command replace the file names output.pdf and input.pdf with your file names

for-loop	loops

as you are a beginner in java learn while and for-loop to fix your problem
you have to loops through the string input line to print morse code

57735413
int	boolean
when converting to boolean the following values are considered false the boolean false itself the int 0 zero the float 0.0 zero the empty string and the string 0 an array with zero elements an object with zero member variables php 4 only the special type null including unset variables simplexml objects created from empty tags refer - the if statement doesn #39
t work for false in php check if boolean is true or false also note


57735467
folder	directory

this issue is likely that jboss has some garbage from previous deployment and has the solution not trivial but simple verify if your jar matches the jboss lib folder copy entire project jar files into jboss lib folder if doest not match. then restarts jboss
verify also if your file are correctly placed on the server directory and if jboss variable is set

57735490
public	protected
if you don t use any access modifier then internal will apply implicitly
which is equivalent to public inside a shared assembly and fields should never be exposed
microsoft docs recommends generally you should use fields only for variables that have private or protected accessibility

57736064
dictionary	map

so perhaps the desired output is a list of dictionary
if that is the case i suggest you parse that is the case as json not as a csv-- the escaping rules are different then map the fields into the data structure you need

57736180
button	checkbox
so to solve your problem the very very raw things that have to happen a must be displayed on the page with a checkbox for every entry that s a candidate for the bulk action with some button s to trigger the bulk action s
your form - besides the entry for checkbox - is alright i guess and not really your problem as far as i can tell
you re not even interested in editing the pagerfanta object i hope and just want the selection

57736237
margin	font-size
there are many different ways to do this without using however if you insist on doing so one way to do this is to remove entirely your blank row then use line-height and then use margin to hide the space before and after your rows
your wanted white space in between the lines would be almost equal to the line-height minus the font-size 2


57736378
rubygems	bundler

you need to simply install an update for rubygems package manager locally
to do this run gem update --system if you don t have bundler version 2 installed locally then run gem install bundler and then finally run bundler update --bundler that s all

57737467
min	max

in you first expression and similarly for the second one when you do a boolean vector is what you get and what a boolean vector is fed into which.min you are getting the min out of a bunch of one and zeros true and false which is not what you want
there are many ways to achieve one is to set those larger than 0.5 to na first which is done by the ifelse then find the max probability with which.max like you mentioned and i m trying to calculate the +-2 range of num whose possibility is the most closest and smaller than 0.5 the num will surely be 5 and the range will be 3 7

57737523
put	get
you can basically set 3 to get variations
also you could put this in a function and use lapply to iterate over all cols


57737694
hive	hdfs
how should the file format be
i have large kafka pipelines that i stream data into hive orc i have used storm in the past but the layer is upto you to choose
you can choose any columnar format that may suit your processing need orc parquet avro are popular choices after send data to the hdfs assume that analyze it using hive or spark sql

57737867
multiplying	transpose
during the transpose convolution you are performing upscaling of and in your three resize_volumes layers
if you multiplying these numbers across the axis it will be each one 2 3 2
so the output of the decoder will be multiple of 12 in each dimension

57737953
post	get

firstly you should post here what s your problem and where s your problem we don t need to see all of your code to solve a basic problem
your form should be this you should use post method when you re creating a something new this is safer than using get method

57738048
int	double

in c++ the result of int division is always an int
you want those integers to be double s or float s double grade s1 s2 s3 s4

57738553
pull	push

try this you have to take pull first
git pull origin test after that u can push your data. git push origin test

57738598
folder	dir

the problem occurred when opening a projects folder which does t contain node_modules sub-folder
include that dir on your opened folder or even sub-folder to prevent above problem

57738683
strcpy	qsort
hat s analogous to attempting to perform a swap without a temporary if your linked list elements contained pointers instead of the arrays themselves then the array array in your sort function and storage managed by qsort would adequately fill the role of temporaries
you could then copy the pointers back out by assignment symmetrically to how you copy the pointers in without strcpy


57739286
filtering	grouping
is it a button
anyway according to the material design guidelines chips allow users to enter information make selections filtering content or trigger actions
chips should appear dynamically as a grouping of multiple interactive elements

57739461
for-loop	arrays
hence after the end of the first for-loop n is still 11 and hence you get odd twice
use arrays instead


57739485
loops	if-statement
also break only affects loops not if-statement
you don t break out of an if-statement
break takes you out of the current loop

57739718
hive	hdfs
y default when you run hive looks for newly added partitions for that table in hdfs and updates the hms with the updated directory details
once this is done your query against the newly added partition s data will be captured assuming the partition directory in hdfs has files with data in this


57739735
versioning	upgrade

a deprecation message doesn t always mean the package or versioning is unusable
it may mean the package is unmaintained and will no longer be updated by the publisher. this leaves a few options either upgrade angular so that recommendations are met downgrade angularfire to a versioning that did hold support for your versioning of angular or try to use as is and hope for the best

57740140
integer	fractions
convert will attempt to converted to a 64bit integer and then get assigned to your variable myage which is a float
if it is a fractions conversion will fail and throw exception
above with using float.parse will retain the floating point number with fractions

57740546

freebsd	linux
t_load entry in the program header describes vmas virtual memory area of the process both linux and freebsd store most data about the process in pt_note segment
on freebsd you can read note segments from core file as below below paper has more details on freebsd supported core dumps the history and future of core dumps in freebsd


57740841
children	parent
the code you show is an hybrid of the two you declare the children relation but the remote_side declaration is outside the backref call
this is because declares the field that is the key that is being referenced by the foreign_key and thus must be added to the relationship that points to the 1 side of the relation the parent


57740890
multiplying	add
i can t really answer without looking at the equation but to the best of my knowledge theta1 +1 is a bias term that we add and there is no point of regularizing or penalizing that bias terms
that equation element-wise multiplication is a way to put theta1 0 by multiplying with 0 and rest of theta s remains as it is by multiplying them with 1 while computing the gradient descent
so in the end we won t be considering theta1 in computation

folder	directory
it just creates it as an initial empty well mostly-empty directory or folder whichever term you prefer
in your work-tree git hides a sub-directory sub-folder named .git and git keeps all of it files in this .git directory

next	except
except that is in a new totally-empty repository when there is no current commit then there are only two copies
the index or staging area holds your proposed next commit
use git add to copy files from the work-tree into the staging area

post	get
se as below by default simple_forms will use post http method for submitting the form in the error i can see that it hits simulations index endpoint because of get httpmethod
post of simulations will hit the create action in the controller hope the controller works

folder	directory
he default locations are the images javascripts and stylesheets directory under the app assets folder but these subdirectories are not special - any path under assets will be searched
create a .css file with any name in your app assets stylesheets folder and put following contents into following contents

post	get
he radio button selection will be model bound to this property on post back
your buildsearch class therefore becomes your get method in your controller will look something like this your view will need to look something like this for the radio buttons note how the name attribute matches the new property geoareaid that i added to your buildsearch class

background-image	background-size
this issue sounds purely like a css one
instead of using vuetify component you could try to create own component and just apply the avatar image as element s background-image inline property
then you could use background-size cover in order to preserve correct ratio of uploaded images

ggplot2	aesthetics

ggplot2 doesn t play nice with operators in aes functions so it would be good practise to avoid these by appending the and to your main data.frame now if i understood correctly the problem was that the geom_point shapes aren t filled
the shape aesthetics in ggplot2 is i think identical to the pch argument in base r plots so we can see what the values would mean factor variables are integers dressed up with a level-label so the that you were using would pass down 1 s and 2 s as shapes

for-loop	loops

if the last element is not displayed this means you have to look if the for-loop excludes it or just doesn t handle the result after the last iteration
in this case i think you only have to append the last element and this case valence after loops ends result cu cu 1 ............................................ hno3 h 1 n 1 o 3 ............................................ cun2o6 cu 1 n 2 o 6 ............................................ h2o h 2 o 1 ............................................ no n 1 o 1 ...........................................

post	put
i argue about that in my blog post
but there is a fluentjpa solution that you may consider this produces the following sql i deliberately put enabled and deleted condition to where for clarity you may read about manytomany concept in fluentjpa here

ggplot2	gganimate
ggplot2 now supports left-alignment through an argument to theme rather than having to modify a plot that has been converted using ggplotgrob
this means you can make a static plot left-align the title and subtitle + caption and then animate that using gganimate

pull	push
owever what you can do and what it sounds like you probably want to do based on your use of npm test is to run a ci job on push and restrict the master branch
you can use github actions to automatically test your code when a pull request is opened and require that all checks pass before a pull request can be merged

width	height

you need to use width 100
height 100

for-loop	arrays	for-loop	arrays
rankin to initialize every arrays element to 0 just requires you to initial the first element in the declaration statement
no for-loop needed
the compiler will auto initialize the rest of the arrays elements for you

virtualenv	conda	virtualenv	conda
i was working on in project within a conda environment previously
i switched over to a virtualenv environment reinstalled pyqt5 with pip this time and everything worked fine
it seems that the qsqldatabase drivers are not included with the conda pyqt5 installation
