versioning	upgrade
i choose not to put schema dumps in under versioning control as alumb and others suggest because i want an easy way to upgrade my production database
for a web application where i ll have a single production database instance i use two techniques database upgrade scripts a sequence database upgrade scripts that contain the ddl necessary to move the schema from versioning n to n+1

versioning	upgrade
for a web application where i ll have a single production database instance i use two techniques database upgrade scripts a sequence database upgrade scripts that contain the ddl necessary to move the schema from versioning n to n+1
these go in your versioning control system. a _version_history_ table something like create table versionhistory versioning int primary key upgradestart datetime not null upgradeend datetime

versioning	upgrade
these go in your versioning control system. a _version_history_ table something like create table versionhistory versioning int primary key upgradestart datetime not null upgradeend datetime
gets a new entry every time an upgrade script runs which corresponds to the new versioning

int	chars
so would produce an error because int is not an object
int is one of the few primitives in java along with chars and some others

568
int	chars
int is one of the few primitives in java along with chars and some others
i m not 100 sure but i m thinking that the integer object more or less just has an int property and a whole bunch of methods to interact with that property like the tostring method for example

568
int	chars
i m not 100 sure but i m thinking that the int object more or less just has an int property and a whole bunch of methods to interact with that property like the tostring method for example
so int is a fancy way to work with an int just as perhaps string is a fancy way to work with a group of chars

1114
put	get
you need to put a real exception handler a catch block upstream of all places where this error occurs and forward it to for example a global handler method class that will determine if it is safe to simply report and continue based on exception type and or content
edit it is possible to disable hack the error-reporting mechanism built into windows so the mandatory crash and burn dialog does not get displayed when your app goes down

1272
cvs	svn
and finally not many tools are developed around cvs anymore
while the new and shiny-new tools like git or mercurial definitely lack tools yet svn has a pretty large application base on any system

2562
wmv	flv
the only other alternative of flash that i would personally consider is silverlight which allows streaming wmv videos
i found the production of wmv much better and easier than flv because all windows flv encoders i tried are not really good and stable whereas pretty much every tool can natively output wmv

2905
emacs	gedit
update i think gedit is exclusively gui based though so it would be useful to learn emacs in case you are stuck with just a shell it is fully featured in both shell and graphical mode
further update just fyi i am not trying to push emacs over vim it s just what i use and it s a great editor as i m sure vim is too

2905
vim	emacs
further update just fyi i am not trying to push emacs over vim it s just what i use and it s a great editor as i m sure vim is too
it is daunting at first as i m sure vim is too but the question was about text editors on linux besides vi.

3895
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
to everyone just starting using version control please do not use git or hg or bazaar because of the hype use git or hg or bazaar because they are better tools for managing source code than svn
i used svn for a few years at work and switched over to git 6 months ago

4188
fflush	gets
short version - use fflush or whatever the relevant system call is to ensure that your data is actually written to the file
note i am not talking about the os level disk cache - if your data gets into here it should appear in a read after this point

5462
versioning	upgrade
if you re okay with the out-of-the-box functionality or you don t mind sticking to the versioning you start with i think you ll be very happy
the times i ve run into headaches using cs is when the client wants functionality cs does not provide but also insists on keeping the ability to upgrade to the latest versioning whenever telligent releases an update

6003
getter	setter
microsoft violates a lot of good programming practices to make it easier to create stuff on visual studio for the sake of rapid app development and i do not see the lack of getter setter for controls as evidence of violating any such best practices
i always do that and if you are following an mvp design creating getter setter for your view components would be a design requirement

6117
post	put
update see jon galloway s post here
i m not certain but i believe you can put it in a config file and encrypt the config file

6405
realloc	malloc
i think the cleanest solution here is to avoid using realloc when trying to modify the function caller s input
just malloc a new buffer return that and let the caller decide whether or not to free the old text

6446
do-while	break
but i find that sometimes using one of them really simplifies things especially if your language doesn t include a do-while or do-until style of loop
i tend to use break in loops that are searching a list for something

6713
junit	testng
it s nice and has some features junit 4 doesn t have but we don t need them
we didn t want people to feel uncomfortable writing tests while getting to know testng because we wanted them to keep writing a lot of tests

7756
uniq	grep
the problem is that the op s data seems to be comma delimited and solaris 8 s uniq doesn t allow you any way specify the record separator so there wasn t a super clean way to do the preprocessing using standard unix tools
i don t think it would be any faster so i m not going to look up the exact options but you could do something like that s not very good because it executes grep for every line containing a duplicate key

7815
post	get
i find that patrick steele answered this question best on his blog avoiding isnothing i did not copy any of his answer here to ensure patrick steele get s credit for his post
but i do think if you re trying to decide whether to use is nothing or isnothing you should read his post

8249
int	chars
change the definition to int so that error messages can be transmitted and then use fseek and ftell to determine the file size
quoting the c99 standard doc that i found online setting the file position indicator to end-of-file as with fseek file 0 seek_end has undefined behavior for a binary stream because of possible trailing null chars or for any stream with state-dependent encoding that does not assuredly end in the initial shift state

8381
debian	linux	ubuntu	linux
for the rails side of things though i d actually suggest a virtual machine running linux. ubuntu works well the only caveat is that you have to install rubygems manually as it does not adhere to the great debian filesystem naming ideology - i suggest this because if you want to do advanced things such as installing imagemagick rmagick or memcached or a number of other plugins which require native c libraries it becomes very painful very quickly if you re on windows
a second reason is that unless you are very atypical your production server will likely be running linux too

8770
cairngorm	flex
it uses flex to its full potential doesn t rely on global variables as cairngorm and puremvc and it makes it possible to write much more decoupled code
about how to develop flex applications the right way i wouldn t look too much at the cairngorm framework

9788
atomic	interlocked
in particular double and long int64 and uint64 are not guaranteed to be atomic on a 32-bit platform
you can use the methods on the interlocked class to protect these

10536
lisp	scheme
as you mentioned sicp is for learning scheme not lisp or at least not common lisp and not emacs lisp
there are some overlap in principles however you can t simply cut and paste code from sicp and expect it to run on any common lisp or emacs lisp system

11679
post	get
i m trying to cobble together a good answer from all the post so help me edit this here is a method of doing this although it does transforming the strings and is not unicode friendly it should be portable which is a plus from what i have read this is more portable than stricmp because stricmp is not in fact part of the std library but only implemented by most compiler vendors
to get a truly unicode friendly implementation it appears you must go outside the std library

12468
reverse-engineering	obfuscation
imho if somebody perceives value in reverse-engineering your code they will do it
that s true for managed code or native code obfuscation or not

12519
implements	extends
daniel keep in mind that just because something is possbile in iis and via any number of off box solutions like hardware load balancers and ssl doesn t mean that it is supported by sharepoint or that it is implements in the same way
you can do what you are asking for however you should do it via sharepoint central administration and create or extends a web application and then extends and existing application

12568
rss	feed
in terms of rss being the acronym that defines the category i m guessing that most users now identify with the orange feed icon rather than the specific flavour of xml behind it
vincent i m not suggesting that anyone rewrite existing rss feed just for the sake of it that would be a big waste of time

12586
rss	feed
the rss brand very much defines the entire feed category though so on the rare occasion that someone does know enough to choose they will tend to choose rss because it s got the name. they will also tend to choose rss 2.0 because it s got the bigger number
rss and especially rss 2.0 are very much entrenched in the feed industry. atom hasn t taken off because it doesn t bring much except a new name

12586
rss	feed
rss and especially rss 2.0 are very much entrenched in the feed industry. atom hasn t taken off because it doesn t bring much except a new name
and why even bother using atom on new projects if rss is sufficient

13251
implements	extends
the upcoming release of the framework design guidelines 2nd edition will have some guidance for implements extension methods but in general you should only define extension methods where they make semantic sense and are providing helper functionality relevant to every implementation
you also should avoid extends system.object as not all .net languages will be able to call the extension method as an extension

13487
add-on	xpcom
the fact that there is a firefox add-on for jslib add-on for firefox makes more more confident
essentially as i understand it sockets are not part of javascript but through xpcom you can get raw socket access like you would in any c c++ application

13618
gtk	fltk
i wouldn t use opengl for the gui unless you are planning for hardware accelerated and or 3d effects that you don t think you would get with a more traditional gui toolkit e.g qt wxwidgets gtk etc
if you just need a quick simple gui for hosting your opengl graphics then fltk is a nice choice

14261
actionscript	mxml
however bindings in pure actionscript need not be that much of a pain
it will never be as simple as in mxml where a lot of things are done for you but it can be done with not too much effort

14412
junit	testng
disclaimer - i ve not used junit 4.x at all so am unable to really comment on advances or new features there
testng s biggest draw cards for me include its support test groups and more importantly - test group dependencies marking a test as being dependent of a group causes the tests to simply skip running when the dependent group fails

14796
ant	maven
a good start point could be this maven pluggin not for use it or maybe yes but this maven is build over ant task
if you see was5+plugin+mojo.zip src main scripts was5.build.xml or as said mcdowell you can use websphere application server was ant tasks but directly as ant task

15811
drools	jess
i am one of the authors of drools i will avoid pimping my wares
but some other options are jess not open source but uses the clips syntax which we also support a subset of - which is kinda a lisp dialect

16211
versioning	upgrade
it s not open source but it is pretty cheap for a versioning control system
if you re moving sourcesafe then vault is a really smooth upgrade path

16381
equals	gethashcode
then the two items are definitely not equals
all you want is a gethashcode algorithm that splits up your collection into roughly even groups - it shouldn t form the key as the hashtable or will need to use the hash to optimise retrieval

17450
client-side	server-side
but i have to agree with the others js does not seem to be the right tool here - and i love to do client-side js
well plain ol asp supported javascript server-side years ago and everyone onad their dog used vbshiate instead

18563
spyware	antivirus
it does mean some sysinternal tools do not work however it means xyz spyware virus cant maliciously apply the same techniques as sysinternals to hide forever intercept calls etc
this is what keeps out some antivirus software.

18939
cassini	iis
or i m pretty sure ultidev s cassini doesn t have this restriction
both of these are easier to setup than iis

19403
goto	break
they are not adding a real goto but extending the break keyword to use static labels
basically it will be enhancing the ability to break out of switch nested if statements

20192
cassini	iis
there are lots of good reasons to prefer iis over the cassini server articles by dominick baier cassini considered harmful another reason why i would not recommend cassini dominick is the man when it comes to iis and security stuff
when using iis for a web app i always create the app in iis first point it at my preferred folder then get vs to create the project

20713
rss	feed
as there are quite a few deprecated versions of rss you might conceivably have to support rss feed that vary quite a bit in their formatting details
rss does not have a registered media content type

20713
rss	feed
you will need to extend the rss format using a variety of published syndication extensions when you start trying to represent resources with complex link relations
i think it is important to remember that to the end-user what syndication format you choose to use is not very important as most feed readers and browsers handle either format equally well

20795
emacs	aquamacs
if you ever plan on making a serious effort at learning emacs immediately forget about aquamacs
it tries to twist and bend emacs into something it s not a super-native os x app

20795
emacs	textmate
it tries to twist and bend emacs into something it s not a super-native os x app
that might sound well and all but once you realize that it completely breaks nearly every standard keybinding and behavior of emacs you begin to wonder why you aren t just using textedit or textmate

20795
emacs	textmate
that might sound well and all but once you realize that it completely breaks nearly every standard keybinding and behavior of emacs you begin to wonder why you aren t just using textedit or textmate
carbon emacs is a good emacs application for os x

21413
int	chars
so here we go the input test.csv stolen from another answer on this page string float1 float2 int hello world 1.0 3.3 4 goodbye world 1e9 -3.3 45 hello again -1 23.33 456 hello world 3 1.40 34.83 4999 hello 2 world 9981.05 43.33 444 the resulting output
this solution does not need any csv or xml libraries and i know it does not handle any illegal chars and encoding issues but you might be interested in it as well provided your csv input does not break the above mentioned rules

21668
emacs	aquamacs
in much the way that aquamacs makes an os x-friendly version of emacs the emacsw32 project makes emacs out-of-the-box work just like a windows text editor
mind you all of emacs power and complexity is there but if you don t already have muscle memory built up there s no reason not to use ctrl-c x v as copy cut paste instead of m-w c-k c-y just to be cool

22043
subclass	inherited
then if you need to throw an exception that should could be handled differently by the presenter you can throw a specific subclass of servicelayerexception say accountalreadyexistsexception
your presenter then has the option of doing using inherited in your own exception classes means you are not required to catch multipile exceptions in your presenter -- you can if there s a need to -- and you don t end up accidentally catching exceptions you can t handle

22800
directx	gdi
that s the primary reason gdi+ wasn t axed in vista in favour of a totally directx solution
there s not specifically anything wrong with gdi gdi+

23137
post	get
a better way would be to retrieve the post read by the current user and then use activerecord calculations to get a count without retrieving all the post in the database this should go into your post model to follow best practices of not having finders in the view or controller post.rb then your view will just be
the following will work or however if you check your development.log you should see that it gets the unread count by retrieving all the post retrieving all the post read by the user removing all of 2

23232
perl	tcl
as expected perl supports the greatest variety of operators but python looks equally capable if not more so
for my own future reference i ll offer the regexp syntax summary page which contrasts the syntax for grep egrep emacs perl python and tcl

24388
listview	gridview
however the built in paging and sorting functionality works well and in 2008 there is a new listview control which aims to sort some of these problems out and give you tighter control of the html that is output
for anything long term i would try to avoid datagrid gridview it sometimes becomes too hacky making it do exactly what you want after a certain number of these tweaks you start to realise its not saving time in the long run and you might not be getting the control over markup that you need

24455
goto	break
the traditional goto label is supported too but i m not sure there are too many instances where this is the only way to achieve what you want - subroutines and loops should suffice for most cases
in perl use of a label to goto from a loop - using a last statement which is similar to break

24629
inherited	subclassing
there are certain situations where the internals are complex and require certain things to be controlled very specifically so the designer decided no one should inherited the class so that no one accidentally breaks functionality by using something in the wrong way
this may not apply to your code but a lot of classes within the .net framework are sealed purposely so that no one tries to create a subclassing

24638
firefox	safari
there is currently no way to programmatically disable the safari spellchecker as there is in firefox and ie7+ so most rich text editors choose to let safari do its own thing by leaving the browser in control of the context menu
most rich text editors let you specify whether or not to disable the browser s spellchecker as answered by others with the exception of those running in safari

24645
implements	sealed
the methods that i had in the interface that matched the actual interface would then need no further details and so i wouldn t have to explicitly implements them
however the class was sealed so i had to instead proxy calls to an internal reference to this class

24682
minix	linux
one thing to note though if you pick minix it is designed for learning
it is a microkernel while linux and bsd are a monolithic kernel so what you learn may not be 100 translatable to be able to work with linux or bsd but you can still gain a lot out of it without having to process quite as much information

24707
tapestry	struts
again though for your needs this may not matter and i ve always found the tapestry products pleasurable to work against
jsf has been out for years and still feels like something that a struts guy built to fix all of the problems of struts

25008
inherited	subclassing
also due to lsp liskov substitution principles one can use derived class where base class is expected and this is actually imposes the greatest impact from use of inherited code using base class may be given an inherited class and it still has to work as expected
in order to protect external code when there is no obvious need for subclassing you seal the class and its clients can rely that its behavior will not be changed

26068
apache	lighttpd
you may not want to server all files using apache and use lighttpd lighty to server static files
apache can do this

26851
perforce	svn
contrary to perforce visualsvn does not work with the ms scc interface but rather directly with the svn client which i personally see as an advantage
perforce does have support for many other oses but our non-windows devs feel more comfortable with svn too

27111
folder	directory
therefore your working tree which is a fully-fledged repository doesn t spit out .svn folder at each level
it also means that a directory that is replaced like an application or other bundle will still find it s contents with particular file names under revision control

27280
tunnel	packets
heck i usually use ssh tunnel to bypass other blocks since people don t usually care about it
i m not sure it s true that any given ssh packets looks the same as any given https packets

27463
ssl	https
443 when used for https relies on ssl not ssh for its encryption
ssh looks different than ssl so it would depend on what your isp was actually looking for but it is entirely possible that they could detect the difference

27503
put	get
i don t have a rake task for backing up my mysql db but i did write a script in ruby to do just that for my wordpress db you should be able to take this and do some mild pruning of it to put in your username password dbname to get it up and working for you
i put it in my crontab to run everyday as well and it shouldn t be too much work to convert this to run as a rake task since it s already ruby code might be a good learning exercise as well

27582
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
but errors and runtimeexception are not checked for by compiler even though you can choose to catch or declare it is not required
so these two are called unchecked-exception

27993
centos	linux
just happened across this article which point out shortcomings in redhat centos fedora implementations of perl which affect uri profoundly
if you are running one of these linux flavours you might want to recompile perl from original source not rpm source

29358
ati	nvidia
for something that s not crazy expensive go with either a nvidia geforce 8000 series card or an ati 3000 series card
even as a nvidia 8800 gts owner i will tell you the atis have better support for older games

29923
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
at the place where i work we decided to move from svn to bazaar after evaluating git and mercurial
bazaar was easy to start off with simple commands not like the 140 commands that git has the advantages that we see is the ability to create local branches and work on it without disturbing the main version

30598
implements	extends
however some of these account subclasses implements versionable or listable or editable so that they can be thrown into controllers that expect to use those apis
the controller does not care what type of object it is by contrast i can also create an object that does not extends from account say a user abstract class and still implements listable and editable but not versionable which doesn t make sense here

31574
spaces	delimiter
note single quotes even no quotes if the value doesn t contain a spaces is valid according to the w3c html spec
quote by default sgml requires that all attribute values be delimiter using either double quotation marks ascii decimal 34 or single quotation marks ascii decimal 39 .

31835
bazaar	git
the alternatives i m considering are vault as before free for single use and bazaar
git i ve had to dismiss as i am unashamedly a windows person and right now git just isn t

31976
ubuntu	linux
as mono and monodevelop are changing fast be sure to use the latest released versions even if they are not marked as stable yet versions shipped with stock ubuntu are terribly outdated
the vmware image is a great way to start testing windows-developed code on linux

32062
public	protected
there s precious little you cannot do if you remove that protection level and only rely on public and private
people here seem to mistake protected class inheritance and protected methods

32356
subclass	accessor
all i have to do is add a setfirstname method to my subclass and that method is automatically used instead
i m just not satisfied with the limitations that php has when it comes to implicit accessor methods

32765
gmail	hotmail
step 2 to 3 gmail to hotmail would normally happen through smtp or esmtp - extended smtp
hotmail doesn t send anything to a client via pop3

32775
gmail	hotmail
if the process terminates ok then ok if not gmail server will notify you that he wasn t able to deliver the message
the first server will look at dns for a mx record of hotmail server

32865
classname	inherited
if your using a web site project no project file then start by checking that both your page and your control both set the classname property in the first line of your aspx ascx file and that you specify the full name of the class including the namespace
example control language vb autoeventwireup false classname yourprojectname.yourusercontrol inherited yourprojectname.yourusercontrol codefile yourusercontrol.ascx.vb many times not setting all of these will still work but you will get odd compiler errors and behavior in vs

33789
installation	upgrade
xcode 3.0 templates can be found in dev installation library xcode likely developer library xcode
if you want to modify these templates or add your own use the following directories to save your new modified templates so that they are not wiped out by future developer tool upgrade file templates library developer shared xcode file templates target templates library developer shared xcode target templates project templates library developer shared xcode project templates i think that you can also use the library developer shared xcode file|target|project templates directory for templates shared by all users

34338
phpunit	simpletest
as far as i know phpunit does not include a html gui but there are gui s available to download such as cool
i found simpletest was even easier than phpunit to set up

34502
post	get
as seen in this blog post from phil haack
here s what i did it fools visual studio into thinking you ve added a stylesheet to the page but it doesn t get rendered

34566
equals	gethashcode
looking at the current documentation on object.gethashcode provides the following rules if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values

34566
equals	gethashcode
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values
the gethashcode method for an object must consistently return the same hash code as long as there is no modification to the object state that determines the return value of the object s equals method

34681
hash	md5
if an attacker can generate two messages m and m that both hash to the same value they can use these messages against you
sha-1 and md5 also suffer from message extension attacks which can fatally weaken your application if you re not careful

34828
equals	gethashcode
gethashcode should always be in sync with equals and equals isn t necessarily guaranteed to check for all of the fields in your object there s certain situations where you want that to not be the case
furthermore gethashcode isn t guaranteed to return unique values for all possible object states

34969
next	except
a simple example using scala for the next line is where the argument to the foreach method is an expression for an anonymous function
the above line is more or less the same as writing something like this not quite real code but you ll get the idea except that you don t need to bother with declaring the function somewhere else and having to look for it when you revisit the code later

35627
filesystems	ntfs
i m not at all familiar with the inner workings of the unix filesystems as in how the bits and bytes are stored but really that part is interchangeable ext3 reiserfs etc
when people say that unix filesystems are better they might mean to be saying oh ext3 stores bits in such as way that corruption happens way less than ntfs but they might also be talking about design choices made at the common layer above

36737
implements	sealed
rule 2 if you have a local variable that implements idisposable make sure that you get rid of it in the current scope rule 3 if a class has a property or member variable that implements idisposable then that class should implements idisposable too
in that class s dispose method you can also dispose of your idisposable properties this isn t really complete which is why the example is sealed

37267
git-rebase	amend
git-rebase will not look at them but at the commit names deadbee and fa1afe1 in this example so do not delete or edit the names
by replacing the command pick with the command edit you can tell git-rebase to stop after applying that commit so that you can edit the files and or the commit message amend the commit and continue rebasing

37364
post	get
regrading the preserve transparency then yes like stated in other post imagesavealpha have to be set to true to use the alpha flag imagealphablending must be set to false else it doesn t work
also i spotted two minor things in your code you don t need to call getimagesize to get the width height for imagecopyresmapled the and should be -1 the value since the cordinates starts at 0 and not 1 so it would copy them into an empty pixel

37407
public	protected
generally if something is not deliberately conceived as public i make it private
if a situation arises where i need access to that private variable or method from a derived class i change it from private to protected

37566
mate	puremvc
mate uses flex own event mechanism it does not invent its own like most other frameworks
you can dispatch an event from anywhere in the view hierarchy and have it bubble up to the framework automatically instead of having to have a direct line like cairngorms cairngormeventdispatcher or puremvc s notification system

37606
queue	fifo
some reasons why msmq doesn t work when you need to change the logic of the queue to not fifo but something like the oldest red message or the oldest blue message you can t do it
i know what people will say you can do it by having a red queue and a blue queue

37854
ingres	mysql	ingres	oracle	postgresql	mysql
and postgresql was originally written by some of the same people in the 80s as a successor to ingres
oracle goes way back and i m not sure where mysql came in

38332
vmware	esx
if performance isn t really that big of an issue then vmware server may be the best option for it can run most .vmx machines directly and is generally a bit easier to manage
if performance becomes critical you still have the esx or esxi upgrade option that you can use those same virtual machines with

38768
post	put
it also contains a link to download the parallel ctp and you can of course browse through the rest of the blog post to get an idea of what the ctp is meant to do and how the programming model works
so i m not quite sure what you re asking but the parallel extensions team has put together some stuff that might fit the bill

39033
google-chrome	firefox
here is a post google-chrome process manager by john resig from mozilla and jquery fame on the subject
because of the way firefox is built this is not possible at the moment

40143
client-side	server-side
personally i use a set of methods i have developed for bridging the server-side asp.net magic i have yet to use the ms mvc stuff yet and my client-side code because of the munging of the ids that happens
here is just one that may or may not prove useful so in your server-side code you simply call this and pass in the instance of a control for which you want to use a friendlier name for

40699
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome does support the netscape plugin api but that is for displaying certain kinds of content
you seem to be after a extention api really firefox is the only major browser to encourage and support third party extentions to browsing capability that aren t simply new toolbars nothing in the developer documentation points to a browser enhancing api - google seem to want to keep a tight reign on the look and feel of the application

42047
metaphone	soundex
i would suggest using metaphone not soundex
as noted soundex was developed in the 19th century for american names

42912
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome s approach is difficult to write and requires forethought from the developers
ie and firefox are both attempting to move to a process-per-tab model but due to backwards compatibility are not able to transition quickly

42918
symlink	realpath
gnu readlink offers additional related options such as -m for resolving a symlink whether or not the ultimate target exists
note since gnu coreutils 8.15 2012-01-06 there is a realpath program available that is less obtuse and more flexible than the above

44289
cvs	svn
michael says the branching and merging is intuitive i would argue that after using cvs for 10 years it is not
if your are running the svn server on linux it may be hard to get your sa to move to svn 1.5 as the default install 1.4.x

44367
equals	compareto
not that performance usually matters with 99 of the times you need to do this but if you had to do this in a loop several million times i would highly suggest that you use equals or because as soon as it finds a character that doesn t match it throws the whole thing out as false but if you use the compareto it will have to figure out which character is less than the other leading to slightly worse performance time
if your app will be running in different countries i d recommend that you take a look at the cultureinfo implications and possibly use equals

44689
vmware	bootcamp
yeah vmware is nice but for my money nothing beats the performance of running windows by itself on the mac
i develop in asp.net on my mac almost daily and i have to question why you aren t interested in bootcamp

45512
disk	ram
modern os s can have up to 5 levels of memory cache level 1 - runs at the same speed as the cpu has negligible access time but is small cache level 2 - runs a bit slower than l1 but is larger and has a bigger overhead to access usually data needs to be moved to l1 first cache level 3 - not always present often external to the cpu slower and bigger than l2 ram - the main system memory usually implements a pipeline so there s latency in read requests cpu requests data message sent to ram ram gets data ram sends data to cpu hard disk - when there s not enough ram data is paged to hd which is really slow not really under cpu control as such
sorting algorithms will make memory access worse since they usually access the memory in a very unordered way thus incurring the inefficient overhead of fetching data from l2 ram or hd

45622
getelementsbytagname	htmlcollection
imagesarr is not of type array its of whatever the return type of getelementsbytagname img is
in this case its an htmlcollection in firefox 3

46093
move	drag
when you release the right-click you ll have the option to svn move version file. however i believe that svn doesn t do anything fancy there but simply deletes the file in the previous location and adds it to the new location
using tortoisesvn i just right-click and drag the folder from one location to another

46296
bazaar	git
i m not familiar with bazaar but git doesn t track file renames
to git this looks like a delete and an add

46430
post	get
the blog post here has instructions on embedding flash via com
i would be very hesitant to place the webbrowser control between your software and the flv because you will lose all control of the flv and will not get any meaningful notifications about its status

46594
post	get
use post if the operation does change the system s state
use get if you don t mind the request being repeated that is it doesn t change state

46598
post	get
post are reserved for requests to the server that alter state
my general rule of thumb is to use get when you are making requests to the server that aren t going to alter state

46602
post	get
using get will allow linking to a particular page possible too where post would not work
i use post when i don t want people to see the querystring or when the querystring gets large

46614
post	get
post is also more secure than get because you aren t sticking information into a url
and so using get as the method for an html form that collects a password or other sensitive information is not the best idea

46639
post	put	post	get	put	get
in a restful application the post will often be overriden to provide the put and delete calls also
but even if you are not following restful principles it can be useful to think in terms of using get for retrieving viewing information and post for creating editing information

46639
post	get
but even if you are not following restful principles it can be useful to think in terms of using get for retrieving viewing information and post for creating editing information
you should never use get for an operation which alters data

47423
punctuation	words
.it in characters not words the of order the reverse to algorithm efficient an give words of sentence a form which characters of array an given this takes at most 4n time with small constant space. unfortunately it doesn t handle punctuation or case gracefully
in c c99 this gives output given an array of characters which form a sentence of words give an efficient algorithm to reverse the order of the words not characters in it

47735
opera	safari	firefox	safari
alas unlike the opera and firefox developers the ie developers have never read the spec and even the latest most secure ie7 will redirect the post request from domain a to domain b without any warnings or confirmation dialogs
safari also acts in an interesting manner while it does not raise a confirmation dialog and performs the redirect it throws away the post data effectively changing 307 redirect into the more common 302

47879
pthreads	fork
in addition to the answer of rob walker nowadays you have things like the native pthreads thread library - if you want. but for a long time the only way to delegate the work in the unix world was to use fork and it s still prefered in many many circumstances . some kind of socket server socket_accept fork if child handlerequest else goonbeingparent therefore the implementation of fork had to be fast and lots optimizations have been implemented over time. microsoft endorsed createthread or even fibers instead of creating new processes and usage of interprocess communication
i think it s not fair to compare createprocess to fork since they are not interchangeable

47933
udp	tcp
there are valid applications of udp but if you re asking this question yours probably is not
keep in mind that tcp usually keeps multiple messages on wire

48177
cpu	processors
unless a thread process has been explicitly bound to a single cpu then a run-away process will not spike one core to 100 while all the others idle
the run-away process will bounce around between all the processors

48405
nunit	mstest
i haven t tried it - but i would advise clients who have a large investment or who have a strong preference for it over the mstest tool in nunit who are interested in implementing tfs to continue with nunit as opposed to trying convert all their existing tests
using nunit with tfs isn t too difficult

48462
arraylist	treeset
it has high overhead and is slower than arraylist so you shouldn t use it except for a large amount of data when its hashing speed becomes a factor
treeset keeps the data ordered therefore is slower than hashset

49256
des	aes
so as a rule of thumb you are not supposed to use des or its variants because it is being phased out
as of now it is better to use aes

49290
implements	extends
all you need to do is implements the interface and add the required methods
existing classes cannot be retrofitted easily to extends a new abstract class

50220
mouse	joystick	mouse	keyboard
for the mouse you can use gpm
i m not sure off the top of my head for keyboard or joystick

50632
integer	unsigned
it will be large but it will not overflow because 6.2.5 9 a computation involving unsigned operands can never overflow because a result that cannot be represented by the resulting unsigned integer type is reduced modulo the number that is one greater than the largest value that can be represented by the resulting type
bonus arithmetic conversion semi-wtf you can use this link to try this online bonus arithmetic conversion side effect arithmetic conversion rules can be used to get the value of uint_max by initializing an unsigned value to -1 ie this is guaranteed to be portable regardless of the signed number representation of the system because of the conversion rules described above

50809
post	get
if an action has side-effects another method post should be used instead
so a user or their browser shouldn t be held accountable for something done by a get

52266
switching	screens
if you had one controller running on the box in front of which you sit you could use keyboard and mouse input to switching it between open sockets with different renderers
you shouldn t need to resize the output window to less than full screens anymore with this approach ever

52565
boost	stl
really c++ templates are the enabling technology for stl and much of boost and c doesn t have them
i ve seen many c-interface libraries for things like image processing 3d graphics networking etc. but never a real general-purpose library like boost

53246
elementtree	beautifulsoup
edit another solution python developer fredrik lundh author of elementtree among other things has a function to unsecape html entities on his website which works with decimal hex and named entities beautifulsoup will not work with the hex ones
i would recommend beautifulsoup for html scraping

53668
switching	screens
and with a regular q or wq you close a tab. if you map tabn and tabp to your f7 f8 keys you can easily switching between files
if there are not that many files or you don t have vim 7 you can also split your screens in multiple files

56902
implements	extends
however petbase will probably not implements imammal since not all pets are mammals and not all mammals are pets
you may add a mammalpetbase that extends petbase and add imammal

56904
lsp	principles
this allows us to use good object oriented principles like encapsulation and reuse and doesn t violate lsp
the liskov substitution principles lsp lsp is a concept in object oriented programming that states functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it

57668
goto	break
goto can be used as a continue but not the reverse
you can goto anywhere thus break flow control arbitrarily

57829
post	get
if you have to go in to change add bits then refactor towards oo practices there are lots of post on so about refactoring when you are changing code anyway and not just for the sake of it
in practise if you haven t done a lot of oop then you ll want to start small and get a feel for it

58072
post	get
i personally didn t know about it until i came upon this post by adam langley i shall give a few code snippets to illustrate the usage of it and clarify some things that might not be that clear on first use
the benefits of using this is that you get back data readily usable in socket listen and other functions and if done right you won t have to worry about ipv4 v6 either

58304
struts	stripes
in our evaluation we considered an alpha version of struts that supported annotations and a lot of other frameworks but stripes won because of it s superior documentation stability and clean-ness
couldn t figure out how to leave a comment so to answer your second question we haven t encountered a single bug in stripes that i know of

58363
memcached	apc
the trouble with those 2 is you need to install them on your web server or another server if it s memcached
apc pros simple fast speeds up php execution also cons doesn t work for distributed systems each machine stores its cache locally memcached pros fast ish can be installed on a separate server for all web servers to use highly tested developed at livejournal used by all the big guys facebook yahoo mozilla cons slower than apc possible network latency slightly more configuration i wouldn t recommend writing your own there are plenty out there

59037
hash	salt
collisions are possible but not a big problem for password apps usually they are mainly a problem in areas where hash are used as a way to verify the integrity of files
so salt your passwords by adding the salt to the right side of the password and use a good hashing algorhithm like sha-1 or preferably sha-256 or sha-512

59037
hash	salt
ps a bit more detail about hash here
i m a bit unsure whether or not the salt should to to the beginning or to the end of the string

59038
hash	salt
there is argument to a hash attack would be faster but only if you re not salting the passwords as they re hash
normally hashing functions allow you to provide a salt which makes the use of known hash table a waste of time

59490
put	get
if it makes sense to put a column in a table then put it in the table if it doesn t then don t
your coworkers approach would definately help to normalize the database but that might not be very useful if you have to join 50 tables together to get the information you need

60075
children	parent
not sure if they keep track of the tree of process spawning i think it depends on what os you use but since when you kill bash or any shell all running children are also killed i think unix like systems do keep track of this
when you use fork on nix the return value is the pid of the child in the parent process and 0 in the child process

60119
cassini	iis
cassini does not support https
however you can use iis to do this if your using iis 5.1 download the ms iis toolpack for iis 6.0 it comes with a tool to create self signed ssl certificates

60496
prepare	execute
another benefit of using prepare statements is that if you execute the same statement many times in the same session it will only be parsed and compiled once giving you some speed gains
while you can still use prepare statements for the query parameters the structure of the dynamic query itself cannot be parametrized and certain query features cannot be parametrized

60714
inherited	properties
xml serialization and inherited types
also be aware that xmlserializer cannot serialize abstract properties

60854
inline	inlining
the compiler may choose not to inline it likewise the compiler may choose to make a function inline that you did not define as inline if it thinks the speed size tradeoff is worth it
this decision is generaly made based on a number of things such as the setting between optimise for speed avoids the function call and optimise for size inlining can cause code bloat so isn t great for large repeatedly used functions

61230
int	chars
in the second case your telling it that 0xff is really an signed chars not an int
it casts to an int for the first comparison since 0xff is still considered an int meaning your chars is -128 to 127 but the 0xff is still 255

61232
int	chars
when p is -1 which is then converted from a signed chars to a signed int it is still -1 which has a representation of 0xffffffff which is not equal to 0xff
integer literals have signed int type

61234
int	chars
anyway beware that the next statement will not work the same way if int p 0xff break
also maybe it would be a better idea to avoid signed chars or it you must use signed chars to compare them with signed values such as -1 in this case if p -1 break

61538
rss	feed
for b if the link itself isn t a feed you can parse it and look for a specified feed in the head section of the page searching for a link whose type is application rss+xml e.g this type of link is the one used by most browsers to auto-discover feed causing the rss icon to appear in your address bar
this link will allow you to validate the link against the rss atom specifications using the w3c specs but does require you to manually enter the url

62050
put	get
in the initial folder you have a webconfig with in the other folder you can put a seperate webconfig with settings like if you want to further refine it you can allow access to a particular role only
this will deny access to anyone who does not have a role of admin which they can only get if they are logged in sucessfully

62848
opensuse	linux
for opensuse 11 gcc 4.3 is the current package installed when you pick the base development pattern
these days i believe most linux distros do not ship with the development system by default

62961
client-side	server-side
the most difficult area to deal with is the model because the data does not persist throughout the application and by nature the models seem to change on the client-side pretty consistently
you could standardize how you pass and receive data from the server but then at that point the model does not really belong to javascript -- it belongs to your server-side application

63834
pull	push
guide a friend by phone through installing mercurial tortoisehg creating a repository and setting it up for working together using seperate push his and pull mine repositories - after installing it only once on a windows machine i only run gnu linux
and since it is fully distributed they can t break your repository when they break theirs - you can simply decide not to pull their changes or to pull only the good changes for example avoiding these huge binary files beginners tend to put under version control

64446
hash	md5
if you get a positive you could compare the actual data to make sure it s not a false positive - though this would be extremely rare you could go with a quicker hash algorithm like md5 or crc instead of something like sha which is slower but less likely to collide just so it s quick and then compare the actual data when you get a hit
the easiest way would seem to be to hash each line on the way in storing the hash and the original data and then compare each new hash with your collection of existing hashes

64891
temp	tmp
some further reading martin smith s great answer on dba.stackexchange.com msdn faq on difference between the two mdsn blog article article unexpected behaviors and performance implications of temp tables and temp variables paul white on sqlblog.com
there are a few differences between temporary tables #tmp and table variables tmp although using tempdb isn t one of them as spelt out in the msdn link below

65603
public	protected
fxcop will detect public protected methods with no upstream callers
however fxcop does not detect all methods without upstream callers as it is meant to check in the case that your code is part of a library so public members are left out

66648
int	chars
although there are arguments why it s not likely to ever change int may not always be an int32
the drawbacks are two extra chars to type and bug

66794
capitalize	capitalization
in french month names should not be capitalize
capitalization rules are different for different languages

67378
free	malloc
what i have done to solve this is to override the malloc new free delete operators such that they keep track in a data structure as much as possible about the operation you are performing
for example when overriding malloc new you can create a record of the caller s address the amount of bytes requested the assigned pointer value returned and a sequence id so all your records can be sequenced i do not know if you deal with threads but you need to take that into account too

67700
mp3	flv
i d check out libavcodec which handles flv mp3 nellymoser natively and should let you get to the audio
this isn t an exact answer but some relevant notes i ve made from investigating flv files for a business requirement

67714
submit	submission
forms strictly speaking if you are submission a form it doesn t matter if the form page itself is not encrypted as long as the submit url goes to an https url
in reality users have been trained at least in theory not to submit pages unless they see the little lock icon so even the form itself should be served via https to get this

67825
tcpclient	networkstream
so i m not sure there s a way to accomplish what you want via tcpclient
if i had to guess the networkstream considers the data to have been sent once it hands the buffer off to the windows socket

68078
textview	imageview
each of these tabs is also a view and in the case of a tab with a graphical indicator and a text label it s almost certainly some other viewgroup maybe a linearlayout but it doesn t matter that contains an imageview and a textview
so with a little fiddling with the debugger or log.i you should be able to figure out a recipe to get the imageview and change it directly

68280
put	get
if you put the files into the program files directory under vista you do not have write access and so the compile will just fail
2 add a shortcut to the solution to either the desktop or the start menu so that the user can then get access to it without having to know the exact location

68365
fflush	gets
you ll want to .close the file first so you know it s fflush to disk from python
import os os.system scp file user server path # os.system scp foo.bar joe srvr.net path to foo.bar you need to generate on the source machine and install on the destination machine an ssh key beforehand so that the scp automatically gets authenticated with your public ssh key in other words so your script doesn t ask for a password

68673
qtkit	quicktime
here s hoping that quicktime x will have a more fully featured qtkit set of apis
as far as i can tell from the qtkit documentation there is not way to do this in straight qtkit cocoa calls

68678
margin	text-align
firefox uses margin 0 auto and it has to be declared on the element you are trying to center
css text-align property should be declared on the parent element and not the element you are trying to center

69641
plpgsql	plpython
i write pretty much everything in plpgsql but i m also a database guy first and foremost so it generally suits me better than any other language
but there s plenty of things that it doesn t do very well in which case another language such as plperl or plpython is a good bet

69989
post	get
you d have to add ssl as all methods post get and http auth well except digest hhtp authentication send plaintext
get is basically just like post it just has a limit on the amount of data you can send which is usually a lot smaller than post and a semantic difference which makes get not a good candidate from that point of view even if technically they both can do it

69995
post	get
however i kinda assumed that if you didn t have post you wouldn t have these either.
you can actually do it all with get methods

70375
equals	gethashcode
msdn a hash function must have the following properties if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values

70375
equals	gethashcode
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values
the gethashcode method for an object must consistently return the same hash code as long as there is no modification to the object state that determines the return value of the object s equals method

70447
ssl	https
however some of the most common and critical mistakes made not specifically php with regards to use of ssl tls allowing http when you should be enforcing https retrieving some resources over http from an https page images iframes etc directing to http page from https page unintentionally - note that this includes fake pages such as about blank i ve seen this used as iframe placeholders this will needlessly and unpleasantly popup a warning
web server configured to support old unsecure versions of ssl ssl v2 is common yet horribly broken okay this isn t exactly the programmer s issue but sometimes noone else will handle it... web server configured to support unsecure cipher suites i ve seen null ciphers only in use which basically provides absolutely no encryption ditto self-signed certificates - prevents users from verifying the site s identity

70447

70627
quicksort	mergesort
quicksort is not better it is well suited for a different kind of application than mergesort
mergesort is worth considering if speed is of the essence bad worst-case performance cannot be tolerated and extra space is available

70687
super	implements	super	extends
rather one is implicitly supplied which simply calls the super constructor so the arguments supplied must fit the super constructor
if the parent contains multiple constructors the simplest one is called simplest as determined by a rather complex set of rules not worth bothering to learn in detail--just pay attention to what netbeans or eclipse tell you. alternatively you can specify an interface to implements such a declaration creates a new instance of an unnamed class which extends object and implements interfacename

71406
bazaar	svn
here you can find more information at least hg bazaar and git can use external merge utilities
merge is not intrinsically better in dvcs it is just that they would be practically very difficult to use if the branch merge did not work correctly svn arguably does not implement branching merging correctly because instead of making a checkout you are making a new branch everytime you start working on a project from an existing code

72100
lxml	beautifulsoup
lxml is much much faster and you can fall back in lxml s bs soupparser if the default parser doesn t work
i don t recommend beautifulsoup if you want speed

72839
pascal	delphi
pascal analyzer for one does not
i can tell you however that in most delphi applications even if there was a tool to check this for you you would get no results

73670
tunnel	vpn
one caveat with modifying routes - vpn tunnel are not too happy about chnages in static routes once the vpn is set up so be sure to set it up at windows boot up after the nics are initialized through some scripting
static routes- these will work fine unless you are using a vpn tunnel

73819
lambda	first-class-functions
in c# functions are flexible with the use of lambda and delegates
but c# does not have first-class-functions

74550
mouseover	mouseout
this task can also be accomplished with jquery and other libraries although i haven t found explicit documentation for this -- amendment to the edit ie has a problem with the onmouseout for select controls it doesn t consider mouseover on options being a mouseover on the select
this makes using a mouseout very tricky

75238
int	chars
as others have mentioned since i posted this you re better off using int8_t and uint8_t if you really want to represent small int
this is implementation dependent as the c standard does not define the signed-ness of chars

75238
int	chars
on most platforms signed chars will be an 8-bit two s complement number ranging from -128 to 127 and unsigned chars will be an 8-bit unsigned int 0 to 255
note the standard does not require that chars types have 8 bits only that sizeof chars return 1

75789
width	margin
i ve never come across a problem caused by using width padding and or margin together
so long as you have a valid doctype and are not in quirks mode you will have a predictable box model and therefor should use whichever is most appropriate out of margin padding to represent what you are trying to do

75883
int	chars
that can be treated as a small int or a pack of bits
in addiction as someone else has said the standard doesn t define the sign of a chars

76040
xna	slimdx
xna isn t the only alternative though
there is also slimdx which is under constant development as a means of providing a lean wrapper of directx in a similar fashion as managed directx which was i believe discontinued by microsoft in favor of xna

76127
post	get
use the sc command like this you need to be on a command prompt to execute the commands in this post sc stop shortservicename sc delete shortservicename note you need to run the command prompt as an administrator not just logged in as the administrator but also with administrative rights
if you get errors above about not having the necessary access rights to stop and or delete the service run the command prompt as an administrator

76348
postgresql	mysql
the following snibblet of code should do ya this is known to work on the following databases derby mysql sql server for databases where it doesn t work hsqldb oracle postgresql etc you will need to futz with database-specific tricks
for example on postgresql you would make a call to select nextval ... for the sequence in question

76478
width	margin
if your div does not have a width specified then the width of the table has nothing to do with it
from another angle if your parent div does have a width set and the margin is still affecting your table then you are probably in quirks mode

76543
next	except
collective code ownership is hard to achieve as well not doing pair programming we tend to keep the logical next user stories from iteration to iteration
i consider myself lucky all except pair programming we can do it but only to solve big issues not on a day-to-day basis

77328
textmate	bbedit	textmate	textwrangler
the only devs i know who like textmate are ruby fans
i really do not get the appeal it s marginally better than textwrangler bbedit s free little brother but if you re spending money you may as well buy the better tool for a few dollars more

77328
bbedit	jedit
i really do not get the appeal it s marginally better than textwrangler bbedit s free little brother but if you re spending money you may as well buy the better tool for a few dollars more
jedit does have the virtue of being cross-platform

77777
rss	feed
i wouldn t use xml for storing rss items
a feed reader makes constant updates as it receives data

77945
quicksort	mergesort
quicksort is not better than mergesort
with o n 2 worst case that rarely happens quicksort is potentially far slower than the o nlogn of the merge sort

78000
post	put
things like what object is being viewed edited should really be get post variables passed around between the screens so a user can use multiple browser windows to work with your application unless you d like to prevent that
do not put database connection information in the session

78569
atoi	strtod	atof	strtod
atoi and atof will convert the number even if there are trailing non numerical characters
however if you use strtol and strtod it will not only skip leading white space and an optional sign but leave you with a pointer to the first character not in the number

78627
strtol	strtod	strtol	atof	strtol	atoi
note also that strod strtol skip initial whitespace so if you want to treat strings with initial whitespace as ill-formatted you also need to check the first character
use strtol strtoll not atoi to check integers. use strtof strtod not atof to check doubles

78627
atoi	strtod	atof	strtod	strtol	atof	strtol	atoi
use strtol strtoll not atoi to check integers. use strtof strtod not atof to check doubles
atoi and atof convert the initial part of the string but don t tell you whether or not they used all of the string

78627
atoi	strtod	atof	strtod
atoi and atof convert the initial part of the string but don t tell you whether or not they used all of the string
strtol strtod tell you whether there was extra junk after the characters converted

79118
asterisk	ivr
i have successfully tried asterisk with lumenvox for a speech recognition ivr
asterisk is very flexible when it comes to ivrs and not just that

79901
strace	systemtap
some applications can trick strace ptrace not to run so the only real option i ve had is using systemtap systemtap can intercept a bunch of system calls if need be due to its wild card matching
systemtap is not c but a separate language

80758
agile	sprint
this is what robert said about tdd and design there has been a feeling in the agile community since about 99 that architecture is irrelevant we don t need to do architecture all we need to do is write a lots of tests and do lots of stories and do quick iterations and the code will assemble itself magically and this has always been horse shit
i even think most of the original agile proponents would agree that was a silliness. james coplien states that merely driving your design from tdd has a great risk one of the things we see a lot in a lot of projects is that projects go south on about their 3rd sprint and they crash and burn because they cannot go any further because they have cornered themselves architecturally

81145
rss	feed
you could have a look at the nuclblog project as that has the capability to generate an rss feed for the blog entries it maintains
i am not aware of any specific rss library

folder	directory
the date strategy can be convenient if you decide to remove old and unused files you only have to get the 2006 folder and remove all that has not been accessed in the last year according to your log. this also can be a good indication for your users as they will know if it is a fresh file or not. the folderxyz is only a variant of this one replacing date with a tag each n files
the threshold subfolders helps you to keep the number of entries of your directory low so access is faster

81853
implements	sealed
in this case for some reason the es_number style has not been implements
you could possibly handle the handlecreated event or override onhandlecreated as textbox isn t sealed and call setwindowlong to set the es_number style on the underlying edit control

83182
ssl	https
the following is more lenient and will not disable keepalives when using msie and ssl
if you are serving a page over https then you ll need to serve all the included static or dynamic resources over https either from the same domain or another domain also over https to avoid a security warning in the browser

83952
vmware	virtualbox
vmware server 2.0 should fix these issues with vista as the host os
i was using vista business rtm also of note vmware forbids any type of benchmarking to be posted on the internet unless if they authorize the data you will not see any benchmarks that show vmware as slower than tech x the rumor mill states that you can see better performance with hyper-v xvm sun s enterprise version of virtualbox and xen

84713
pull	push
this is similar to what you are asking apply-template push and call-template pull
i was convinced push would be faster but that was not the case

84763
activeperl	perldoc
activeperl comes with html documentation you can open perlvar in your browser hit ctrl+f and type env then hit enter
the searching for env is a feature of the pager named less not of perldoc

85402
ienumerable	ienumerator
iterators aren t exactly translatable to the .net way but they are roughly replaced by ienumerable t and ienumerator t
rather than you would see in c# or more explicitly without hiding the ienumerator behind the foreach syntax sugar as you can see foreach just hides the .net enumerator for you

85491
ienumerable	ilist
you are most often better of using the most general usable type in this case the ilist or even better the ienumerable interface so that you can switch the implementation conveniently at a later time
however in .net 2.0 there is an annoying thing - ilist does not have a sort method

85742
nlb	iis
haven t done it yet with wcf but plan to have a local dns entry pointing to our network load balancing nlb virtual ip address which will direct all traffic to one of our servers hosting services within iis
i have used nlb for this exact scenario in the past for web sites and see no reason why it will not work well with wcf

85803
postgresql	mysql
we did a move from a mysql3 to postgresql 8.2 then 8.3
postgresql has the basic of sql and a lot more so if your mysql do not use fancy mysql stuff you will be ok

85803
postgresql	mysql
postgresql has the basic of sql and a lot more so if your mysql do not use fancy mysql stuff you will be ok
from my experience our mysql database version 3 doesn t have foreign key.

85846
ssl	https
use to tell if it is ssl and redirect to the right place if not
and remember the page that displays the form does not need to be fed via https it s the post back url that needs it most

86052
inherited	properties
requires svn 1.8 june 2013 this is similar to svn ignore except it makes use of svn 1.8 s inherited properties feature
compare to svn ignore the file pattern is automatically applied in every descendant directory not just immediate children . this means that is unnecessary to set svn global-ignores with the --recursive flag as inherited ignore file patterns are automatically applied as they re inherited

86306
inherited	properties
to avoid including inherited properties in your enumeration check hasownproperty edit i disagree with jasonbunting s statement that we don t need to worry about enumerating inherited properties
there is danger in enumerating over inherited properties that you aren t expecting because it can change the behavior of your code

86427
cpython	ironpython
a downside in using jython or ironpython is that you cannot use native c modules they can be only used in cpython
ironpython and jython use the runtime environment for .net or java and with that comes just in time compilation and a garbage collector different from the original cpython

86547
cvs	svn
you can however get it by buying a license for fisheye or possibly by using cvstrac note i have not tried cvs trac
or you could migrate to svn which does provide this capability via atomic commits

86812
children	parent
for example a single abstract class that can have child nodes if no children its a leaf if no parent its a root but this can change in its lifetime
or a fixed class structure in which leafs are a specific class type that cannot have children added to them in any way

87519
equals	tostring
for example the java.net.url class has an equals method which makes use of an internet connection to determine whether two urls are truly equals but it still has a simple and constant-time tostring method
so yes inexpensive tostring calls are the norm and unless you use some weird third-party package which breaks with the convention you shouldn t worry about these taking a long time

87531
post	get
nu guarentees that it will work for your data but feel free to modify and post back here
everyone seems to starts off with a few greps and perl expressions and you sorta kinda get something that works for your particular dataset but you have no idea if it s imported the data correctly or not

87861
multiplying	add
split the 64bit quantities into two 32bit words and multiplying the low words to the lowest and 2nd lowest word of the result then both pairs of low and high word from different numbers they go to the 2nd and 3rd lowest word of the result and finally both high words into the 2 highest words of the result
add them all together not forgetting to deal with carry

88696
x86	mips
to add to that the embedded processor industry is very segmented it doesn t have a major player like intel x86 is for the desktop processor industry
the arm processor does have a large share so does mips i believe and there are many smaller more specific microcontroller like chips available like the msp430 etc from ti

89848
profiling	benchmarking
which just goes to show if you don t know how to do proper code profiling don t be doing this stuff
the speed difference of these two methods are within the same big o speed as proven by leon timmermans opcode analyisis - the benchmarking are just going to show differences based on other local conditions not necessarily your code

90068
inherited	subclassing
also it should be noted that since java does not have multiple inherited the use of interface can be used to emulate that feature
by implementing multiple interfaces one can have a class that is a subclassing to inherit some features yet also inherit the features of another by implementing an interface

90444
udp	tcp
udp has less overhead but isn t guaranteed delivery
conversely tcp is more trustworthy

90655
int	double
and the #1 gotcha in java the primitive types int float double chars and long are not object s like in c#
all of them have a respective object representation like integer float double etc

90964
ogre	irrlicht
but if you re ready for some hardcore work ogre would be better although its source can be much more enigmatic and hard for a new comer
if you want c++ and your just starting out i d go with irrlicht its free and its code although not blazing fast like ogre its very well structured and a good example of what a c++ should look like

91759
strcpy	strcmp
you didn t mention whether your input is null terminated - if not then extra care is needed and strcmp strcpy won t be suitable
you ll probably need to use strcmp to see if the string is already stored then if you really need to store a copy of the string then you ll need to allocate a buffer and copy the characters over

91965
spaces	delimiter
the -z means output with zeros 0 after the filenames so spaces are not used as delimiter
xargs -0 means interpret 0 to be delimiter

92324
pascal	delphi
the language c++ pros c++ is more standard you will find more code libraries examples etc. and you may freely use the stl and boost while object pascal is more of an exotic language qt compiles on different platforms and compilers kylix is based on qt btw object pascal pros some dynamic properties are build right into the language no ugly workarounds like the moc are needed the compiler is highly optimized for the language and indeed very fast the language is less complex than c++ and therefore less error prone the ide qt pros strictly spoken there is no ide for qt besides the designer but it integrates nicely into your preferred ide at least visual studio and eclipse the designer does a better job with layouts than delphi forms note this is based on delphi 6 experience and may not be true with current versions delphi pros the ide is really polished and easy to use now and it beats visual studio clearly imo i have no experience with eclipse there is no point 2.
but if i had to assign the buzzword integrated i would assign it to the delphi ide the framework i will leave a comparison to others as i don t know the newest vcl good enough

92588
webclient	httpwebrequest
you ll use it like httpwebrequest is detailed at a second option is to use the webclient class this provides an easier to use interface for downloading web resources but is not as flexible as httpwebrequest more info on the webclient can be found at
you can use the httpwebrequest class to perform a request and retrieve a response from a given url

92782
switching	screens
switching to gdi+ won t solve it nor will switching to sdi
your question title mentions screens capture but your actual question doesn t

93696
rsa	aes
as i said above the key bit of knowledge is that the cert doesn t matter so long as it s generated with an algorithm that supports aes 256-bit encryption rsa
just to make sure that we re on the same page for my testing i generated my self-signed cert using the following keytool -genkey -alias tomcat -keyalg rsa now you have to make sure that your java implementation on your server supports aes-256 and this is the tricky bit

94099
datamapper	activerecord
activerecord is very heavy datamapper and domain object are separating those concerns out so you have a more defined set of code doing various aspects for you domain or entity objects
i personally prefer not that you asked going with the separation into domain object datamapper probably use an assembly pattern and even a data transfer pattern to assure clear separation of what happens to data between the database an the upper tiers of an application

94119
junit	easymock
if you are using junit to test use mocks instead of stubs
read martin fowler s seminal article mocks aren t stubs i recommend the easymock framework it works like a charm automatically mocking your interface using reflection

94119
easymock	unitils
read martin fowler s seminal article mocks aren t stubs i recommend the easymock framework it works like a charm automatically mocking your interface using reflection
it is a bit more advanced than the code samples in fowler s article especially when you use the unitils library to wrap easymock so the syntax will be much simpler than that in the article

95208
instances	transient
that being said if you have instances variables that are themselves not serializeable the only way i know of to get around it is to declare those fields transient
ex private transient foo foo

96449
folder	directory
ideally do not move back the .svn folder continue working and be sure to update commit
make a backup of the folder that has the missing .svn then delete the folder if it is the root of the checkout you will have to re-checkout if it is not the root just run an update from a directory above

96449
folder	directory
make a backup of the folder that has the missing .svn then delete the folder if it is the root of the checkout you will have to re-checkout if it is not the root just run an update from a directory above
then move the backup folder on top of it

97096
sorting	grouping
by the way when sorting is not important you can get small speed-up by using order by null
as the mysql documentation says is equivalent to default behaviour can not be changed but you can use without experiencing any speed penalties as the sorting will be performed on the grouping field anyway

98367
copying	overwrite
i d actually suggest just copying the contents to your .vimrc as it s well commented and a good place to start learning how to use vim
you can do this by this will overwrite your current .vimrc but if all you have in there is the indent settings davr suggested i wouldn t sweat it as the example vimrc will take care of that for you as well

98697
ssl	https
if that s not the desired behaviour there s nothing stopping you from special casing ssl behaviour in the development environment yourself
i guess they believe that you should probably be using https perhaps with a self-signed certificate in development mode

99239
lisp	scheme
though it s not blazingly fast like a compiled language nor is it particularly useful at serving websites or parsing text i ve found that scheme and other lisp by extension has no parallel when it comes to simplicity elegance and powerful functional manipulation of complex data structures
to be honest i think in scheme

100037
metaclass	subclassing
note that the magic behaviour that initalised gains by having the metaclass init_attributes is not passed onto a subclassing of initalised
here is an even more concrete example showing how you can subclassing type to make a metaclass that performs an action when the class is created

100064
getchar	kbhit
however you should be able to use getc getchar from tango.stdc.stdio - i changed the faq you mention to reflect this
kbhit is indeed not part of any standard c interfaces but can be found in conio.h

102717
extjs	gxt
for more information on gwt extjs for more information on extjs gwt gxt
i m working on a project right now that uses extjs gwt gxt not to be confused with gwt extjs

102717
extjs	gxt
i m working on a project right now that uses extjs gwt gxt not to be confused with gwt extjs
there is a difference extjs gwt is the one that is actually produced by the company that wrote extjs the javascript library

102977
google-chrome	safari
because google-chrome uses the webkit to render html you can be assured if it works in safari it ll work under google-chrome however it s rendering engine isn t up to scratch quite yet
i think writing applications that take advantage of it is similar to writing iphone applications remember google-chrome is expected to be adopted by android to make it similar to iphone

104095
cassini	iis
cassini is ment to be a light waight test webserver
the idea is that a developer does not need to have iis installed and configured to test his application

104264
cassini	iis
all the previous responses are great answers - here s one gottcha with cassini that might require iis on the destkop
cassini runs in the context of the developer not as the iis user iusr_ iwam or in winxp x64 the w3wp process

104451
hash	salt
there are implementations that can do millions of hash per second on everyday hardware so no matter what salting you do this is not going to be a big deal to brute force
by sheer coincidence when looking for something giving hash algorithm benchmarks i found this article about storing credit card hash which says storing credit cards using a simple single pass of a hash algorithm even when salt is fool-hardy

104530
allocator	stl
stl containers with default allocator don t do anything fancy they all end up allocator via standard new delete operators somehow
in stl map s case it will throw exception and will otherwise behave as if it was not called

104855
move	drag
if that is not an option there are a couple of other methods at your disposal if you re using flex you can have other objects move along with the map by listening to moveevent .move events on it and moving themselves accordingly you can implement the drag functionality yourself so that you ll have more control over it see below
here s an example that implements drag functionality for an object that will also move a bunch of sibling objects along with it

104893
int	chars
jon skeet did an analysis for something similar for parsing int before tryparse was in the framework checking if a string can be converted to int32 however as anthonywjones indicated you probably shouldn t be worrying about this
run the potential guid though a regex or some custom code that does a sanity check to ensure the strig at least looks like a guid and consists only of valid chars and maybe that it seems to fit the overall format

105339
int	double
also these are only defined for unsigned values they work for signed int as well
for floats and double it s more difficult as with plain int as these may or not may be in the host machines byte-order

106553
queue	fifo
if you were to use a fifo queue for the semaphore the kernel would have to traverse the queue of tasks waiting for the mutex to find the one with the highest priority
this operation is not deterministic as the time to traverse the queue changes as the number of tasks queued changes

107131
svg	vml
w3schools has a good reference for learning using svg
vml is microsoft s answer to svg and surprise is natively supported by ie although svg is not

107131
svg	vml
vml is microsoft s answer to svg and surprise is natively supported by ie although svg is not
msdn has the best reference for vml

107358
unix	sunos
i don t know if this advice applies to sunos or any unix
first the answer after the socket and before the connect or first sendto try adding this code now the explanation the the unix 7 man page says this when a socket is connected and it doesn t already have a local address a unique address in the abstract namespace will be generated automatically

107426
post	put
a put is used to update existing data at a given url or to create something new when you know what the uri is going to be and it doesn t already exist as opposed to a post which will create something and return a url to it if necessary
a post is considered something of a factory type method

108430
vbscript	autoit
it uses a combination of simulated keystrokes mouse movement and window control manipulation in order to automate tasks in a way not possible or reliable with other languages vbscript and sendkeys
autoit is also very small self-contained and will run on all versions of windows out-of-the-box with no annoying runtimes required

108451
udp	tcp
if you need the reliable in-order delivery of tcp and also the fast response of udp and don t need to worry about congestion from sending large streams of data you can disable nagle s algorithm
as others have pointed out your question is very general and whether or not something is faster than tcp depends a lot on the type of application

108884
memcpy	memset
the compiler will replace small memcpy s and memset s with more suitable code so it is not as horrible is it looks
but if you do know enough to guarantee assignment will always work and your profiler tells you it is faster you can replace the memcpy with an assignment

109038
cairngorm	puremvc
this is more true of cairngorm than puremvc but both are pretty bad
puremvc is more invasive than cairngorm meaning that your code is heavily dependent on the framework you have to subclass implement the framework classes interfaces but that doesn t mean that cairngorm isn t

109038
cairngorm	puremvc
puremvc is more invasive than cairngorm meaning that your code is heavily dependent on the framework you have to subclass implement the framework classes interfaces but that doesn t mean that cairngorm isn t
cairngorm is full of anti-patterns like heavy use of global variables puremvc hides the worst parts of itself

109038
cairngorm	flex	cairngorm	puremvc
cairngorm is full of anti-patterns like heavy use of global variables puremvc hides the worst parts of itself
puremvc is anti-flex cairngorm just doesn t use many of the good parts of flex

109038
cairngorm	flex	cairngorm	puremvc
puremvc is anti-flex cairngorm just doesn t use many of the good parts of flex
by this i mean that puremvc reinvents many things that flex already have because it wants to be platform agnostic and because of its architecture specifically the mediators it makes it harder to use bindings to their full power

109038
cairngorm	flex	cairngorm	puremvc
in short cairngorm is the visualbasic of flex it works but will teach you a lot of bad habits
puremvc isn t so bad it just isn t a very good fit for writing flex applications

109069
clang	icc
see asm from gcc clang icc and msvc on the godbolt compiler explorer
x86-64 emits this powerpc64 emits for the int arg version rldicl 3 3 0 32 # zero-extend from 32 to 64-bit popcntd 3 3 # popcount blr this source isn t x86-specific or gnu-specific at all but only compiles well for x86 with gcc clang icc

109485
versioning	upgrade
i would recommend attempting to update your firmware as newer versioning supposedly address this problem
however nokia does not make it very easy to upgrade the firmware in most cases you have to send the device off to nokia

110037
jxtable	jtable
look into jxtable
jxtable is an extension of jtable that supports multi-column sorting as well as other functions that jtable doesn t provide

110326
vmware	esx
from my experience moving up the vmware application stack has never been problematic server to workstation to esx
however i would verify this by exporting all of your vms from the workstation install to an esx install to make sure you re not seeing any weird issues related to running the high-end tool from vmware

110453
vmware	bootcamp	parallels	bootcamp
i strongly recommend vmware over parallels as vmware supports 2 virtual cpu s i think it s up to 4 virtual cpu s in v2
it s a lot easier to have a really large virtual disk which is not using it all where as bootcamp will take the space

110492
client-side	server-side
one rule of thumb you should follow is not to trust client-side javascript to do this for you since it s easy to go around it
always do it server-side first

110956
post	get
from an http standard viewpoint get requests should not change the site and browsers spiders are much more likely to make get requests on their own without the user actually clicking something then post requests
get passes data in the url post passes the same data in the http content both are exactly the same from a security standpoint that is completely insecure unless you do something about it yourself like using https

111123
post	get
however avoid to use post if the action is safely repeatable like a search since the warning is not necessary and would just be a confusing to the user
a point regarding security if you have a password field in a get-form the password will get masked for prying eyes when you type it in however it will be plainly visible in the address bar when you hit submit

112266
gif	png
i wanted to read the type version height and width of a gif image but couldn t find anything useful online
fortunately in case of gif all the required information was in the first 10 bytes type bytes 0-2 version bytes 3-5 height bytes 6-7 width bytes 8-9 png are slightly more complex width and height are 4-bytes each width bytes 16-19 height bytes 20-23 as mentioned above wotsit is a good site for detailed specs on image and data formats though the png specs at pnglib are much more detailed

113397
client-side	server-side
in addition to the above i would like to point out that client-side validation html code javascript etc. is never enough
also check the length server-side or just don t check at all if it s not so important that people can be allowed to get around it then it s not important enough to really warrant any steps to prevent that either

113519
hash	md5
it is not currently computationally feasible to generate a hash collision for a specific md5 value but it is possible to generate two different inputs that will produce the same md5 therefore not triggering your code
it is also possible to generate two different strings with the same prefix that hash to the same value

113832
pull	push
if you want lazy evaluation not to reduce latency but to avoid calculations my approach won t help because it relies on a push model not a pull model
possibly using coro outines you can turn this approach into a single-threaded pull model as well

113843
short	base
short answer no
long answer it is not the base class or the number of ancestors a class has in its hierarchy that affects it speed

113912
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
here s how to construct an update statement to perform a case-sensitive search replace by specifying the collation mode to use this will match and replace thecontent but not thecontent or thecontent
determine whether the default collation is case-sensitive like this select charindex result if the result is 0 you are in a case-sensitive collation mode a result of 0 indicates you are in a case-sensitive collation mode 8 indicates it is case-insensitive

114000
inline	inlining
functions called using virtual dispatch are not inline there is one kind of penalty for virtual functions which is easy to forget about virtual calls are not inline in a common situation where the type of the object is not know compile time
if your function is small and suitable for inlining this penalty may be very significant as you are not only adding a call overhead but the compiler is also limited in how it can optimize the calling function it has to assume the virtual function may have changed some registers or memory locations it cannot propagate constant values between the caller and the callee

115825
xfce	kde	xfce	gnome
xfce ratpoison fluxbox awesome -1 cannot handle minimize to tray xmonad dwm fvwm codebase for another wms icewm englightenment wmii openbox pekwm
the window managers listed below all subscribe to the lightweight and fast approach. they are faster than fully fledged window managers like kde or gnome and trim down on most visual distractions

115838
gif	png
as a general rule png is never worse and often better than gif because of superior compression
there might be some edge cases where gif is slightly better because the png format may have a slightly larger overhead from metadata but it s really not worth the worry

115838
gif	png
there might be some edge cases where gif is slightly better because the png format may have a slightly larger overhead from metadata but it s really not worth the worry
it may just be the tools i m using but gif files usually seem to be a bit smaller than a comparible png that may indeed be due to the encoding tool you use

116296
migrate	upgrade
not kept in source control or have each developer keep their own configs in source control under some sort of identification scheme username.properties like dustin uses the advantage of keeping the developer s specific configs in source control makes it easy to migrate from one computer to another eg
in the case of a hardware failure or upgrade

116302
komodo	notepad++
i d recommend komodo 4.4 though i used the trial version since it was awesome
better than notepad++ but not free.

116586
google-chrome	safari
not that any browser in the world uses this yet not even google-chrome but if all you re worried about is standards then that s your best bet - it passes acid3 something no browser on the market can do yet
safari using the latest webkit nightly build

116730
firefox	safari
tweak it to look right in at least firefox and ie and now you ve covered 90 + of the people that will be using your website
don t get me wrong here - i m not trying to dismiss the users of opera safari or any other browser

116741
inline	inlining
you have inline everything in cppclass.cpp not good header-inlining should be the exception and then you declare your class in main.cpp again which is a double declaration in c++
the inlining in the class body leads to code reduplication everytime you use a method this only sounds insane

116753
salt	md5
when a unique salt is used the benefit of using a more secure algorithm than sha1 or md5 is not really necessary at that point it s an incremental improvement whereas using a salt is a monumental improvement
add a unique salt to the hashed password value store the salt value in the db

117834
firefox	safari
firefox apparently still does not
safari 1.3+ opera 9.2+ konquerer and ie8 all support it at least to some degree

118680
cpython	ironpython
if beautifulsoup doesn t work on ironpython it s because ironpython doesn t implement the whole python language the same way cpython does
beautifulsoup is pure-python no c-extensions so the only problem is the compatibility of ironpython with cpython in terms of python source code.there shouldn t be one but if there is the error will be obvious no module named ... no method named ... etc.

118680
cpython	ironpython

google says that only one of bs s tests fails with ironpython

119995
maven	pom.xml
i really don t see what is the big deal with getting maven + eclipse to work as long as you don t have to change the pom.xml too much most frameworks that user maven have maven archetypes that can generate stub project
so basically the steps should be install maven add m2_repo class path variable to eclipse generate project with the archetype import project to eclipse as for wicket there is no reason why you couldn t use it without maven

120273
jsf	wicket	tapestry	wicket	struts	wicket	wicket	seam
after many painful experiences with struts tapestry 3 4 jsf seam gwt i will stick with wicket for now
wicket bench for eclipse is handy but not 100 complete still useful though

121653
librsvg	cairo
just found those two pages rendering svg with librsvg python and c-types how to use librsvg from python something like this should probably work render test.svg to test.png
cairo cannot render svg out of the box. it seems we have to use librsvg

121720
folder	directory
for example to create a c sample.zip and add the c temp folder to it use the following important note the addfoldercontent function is not functional as included in the xzip library
it will recurse into the directory structure but fails to add any files to the zip archive due to a bug in the paths passed to zipadd

122344
mouse	keyboard
another thing that helped me much more than replacing the keyboard is replacing the mouse
i m not using a mouse any longer i m using a trackball

122344
mouse	keyboard
i m not using a mouse any longer i m using a trackball
source arstechnica.com and after i tried plenty of keyboard i have more than 20 at home no kidding

122431
filesystems	fat
in addition to the above illegal characters the caret is also not permitted under windows operating systems using the fat filesystems
under windows using the fat filesystems file and folder names may be up to 255 characters long

123314
put	get
if you are the only one working in your repository or don t mind commit not showing up in fb until after you do a pull then you can add the hook locally to your primary clone if you are using your primary clone then you need to do something slightly different from what they say here you can put your fogbugz.py anywhere you want just add a path line to your fogbugz section of that repositories hgrc file just make sure you have python installed
you may also wish to add a commit hook so that local commits to the repository also get into fb

124248
rsa	aes
that is actually not the case with rsa which is --- more so than aes --- just a math equation
so in addition to storing and managing keys properly you have to be extremely careful with the way you format your rsa plaintext blocks or you end up with vulnerabilities

124262
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
fetching an arrays with mysql_fetch_array lets you loops through the result set via either a foreach loops or a for-loop
mysql_fetch_object cannot be traversed by a for-loop

the way to prevent implementation inherited is in the programming language since the beginning you should use the final keyword on the class declaration and this way you are prohibiting subclassing
subclassing is not evil if it s done on purpose

124997
post	get
simply do not allow consecutive post that are extremely similar
of course anyone with knowledge of the measures you take is going to be able to get around them

125698
waitpid	posix
the only way to do a waitpid or waitid on a program that isn t spawned by yourself is to become its parent by ptrace ing it
here is an example of how to use ptrace on a posix operating system to temporarily become another processes parent and then wait until that program exits

125908
post	get
the helpful bit of the googled post above is in fact this is a known bug in the windows xp visual styles implementation
certain controls like imagelist do not get properly initialized when they ve been created before the app calls application.enablevisualstyles

126125
printf	strlen
use your own functions especially if you have a rtc templates are ok to use as long as you have enough space for code - othwerise don t use them exceptions are not very portable also printf functions that don t write to a buffer are not portable you need to be somehow connected to the filesystem to write to a file with printf
use only sprintf snprintf and str functions strcat strlen and of course their wide char corespondents wcslen...

126773
lisp	scheme
first of all lisp depending on the meaning intended by the speaker isn t really a language at all but a language family
there are a couple of more or less well-known and widespread members of this family scheme common lisp emacs-lisp and autolisp are the traditional ones

126773
lisp	scheme
however as far as i can tell schemers are actually a minority in the lisp world at least when considering practical usage of lisp as a programming tool as opposed to a research or study subject
i do not know much about autolisp or all the other lisp dialects beside scheme and common lisp but what i do know is that common lisp is definitely not a single-paradigm language that eschews imperative or even object-oriented programming

126773
lisp	scheme
i do not know much about autolisp or all the other lisp dialects beside scheme and common lisp but what i do know is that common lisp is definitely not a single-paradigm language that eschews imperative or even object-oriented programming
in fact common lisp features the most powerful class-based object system that i know of incorporating stuff like aspect-oriented programming out of the box

127198
boost	stl
if not you may want to look into using boost s iterator facades and adaptors where you can define your own iterators or adapt other objects into iterators
i want to think there should be a way to do this through straight stl similar to what you are trying to do

127619
put	get
for example you could put each section of the menu in a partial and then modify your layout to something like you then can then specify in your views content_for and put whatever partials you want into the menu
if it s not specified it won t get rendered

127892
swt	swing
this akin to asking the difference between tk and win32 or swing vs .net forms not to say that swt is .net
there are a lot of discussions out there discussing swt vs swing--i don t know enough about swt to summarize the differences

128200
filtering	grouping
i m not sure where the standardreportid concept falls in here but it looks like a filtering mechanism that i won t toy with
in addition to removing the where clause and adding more grouping conditions you also will want to watch out for null records in each of your tables

128390
gif	png
this link gives an example and contains many more links with further explanation gif images are not subject to this problem
be careful of color shifts when using png

128723
tinyint	boolean
boolean ... although mysql doesn t have a boolean type you can use the quasi standard tinyint 1 for that purpose and set it only to 0 or 1
if the flags have very different meanings and are used directly in sql queries or views then using multiple columns of type boolean might be a good idea

128971
button	checkbox
radio button checkbox are used when there are lists of options and the user may select any number of choices including zero one or several
in other words each checkbox is independent of all other checkbox in the list so checking one box doesn t uncheck the others. when designing a ui it is important to use standard or conventional components for a given task

129118
folder	directory
you can use it with appdata to get the application data folder that is writeable for all users
instead of changing the permissions on directory under program files why not put the logs in a location that is writeable by all users

129361
post	get
you ll probably have to just write the code for your page to accept get requests as well as post requests
http doesn t support redirection to a page using post

129361
post	get
http doesn t support redirection to a page using post
when you redirect somewhere the http location header tells the browser where to go and the browser makes a get request for that page

129398
inherited	properties
seems like you would not want to have the type inherited from archive. always favor encapsulation containment over inherited
why not create a class called archive and give it a type properties

129817
post	get
update as i said in the comment i have now in fact written a blog post on this topic .net integral data types and you
you should almost always use int32 or int64 and no you do not get credit by using uint32 or uint64 when looping over an array or collection by index

131883
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
something on http url scheme from rfc 2616 3.2.3 uri comparison when comparing two uris to decide if they match or not a client should use a case-sensitive octet-by-octet comparison of the entire uris with these exceptions - a port that is empty or not given is equivalent to the default port for that uri-reference
- comparisons of host names must be case-insensitive

132541
subtract	add	subtraction	add
looping through wouldn t be your only option - you could perform subtraction to figure out the total number of days and subtract one for each of your skipped dates every week range in between that contains one of those days
by the time you figure out whether a day lands on one of the partial weeks at the beginning or end of the range and add your code will be more complicated than it would be if just counted but if you re expecting to have huge date ranges it might perform better

133160
firefox	safari
afaik there is no difference on the part of browsers as both firefox and ie will incorrectly cache the response from a url with a querystring in the same way they cache the response from a url without a querystring
in the case of safari it respects the spec and doesn t cache urls with querystrings

134014
put	get
in practice you may want to put a data value in the cache which indicates not available perhaps with a reason and a timeout for when to retry
every time anything is added to the cache all threads wake up and check the cache no matter what key they re after so it s possible to get better performance with less contentious algorithms

134152
jboss	weblogic
i m not sure why jboss has it but i don t expect other servers have something similar
weblogic afaik may be very wrong only jdbc drivers can be used with lro and it s a purely administrative task

134203
interpolation	splines
the best summary sentence is catmull-rom splines have c1 continuity local control and interpolation but do not lie within the convex hull of their control points
said another way if the points indicate a sharp bend to the right the splines will bank left before turning to the right there s an example picture in that document

134597
versioning	upgrade
marketing increment versioning based on how many new or useful features are being provided to your customers
you may also tie the version numbers to an update policy...changes to a require the user to purchase an upgrade license whereas other changes do not

135008
serializable	deserialization
suddenly i couldn t read any of the previously serializable information
you might be better off writing clunky per property columns in a table and composing and decomposing the object in this manner instead to avoid this issue with object versions and deserialization

135460
post	get
you can programmatically create an http request and retrieve the response of course this code will return an error since google uses get not post for search queries
this method will work if you are dealing with specific web pages as the urls and post data are all basically hard-coded

135739
for-loop	loops
the for-loop is imperative the algorithms are declarative
when you write std max_element it s obvious what you need when you use a loops to achieve the same it s not necessarily so

136706
maven	pom.xml
as has been previously stated maven will not know about the eclipse project build path
you do need to add all dependencies to the pom.xml and you need to make sure all dependencies are built and installed first by running mvn install

137349
versioning	upgrade
if the user does not have the versioning of flash required or has javascript disabled they will see an alternate content
you can also use this library to trigger a flash player upgrade

137561
public	protected
note that a type declared as a member of a class can have any of the five kinds of declared accessibility whereas a type declared as a member of a namespace can have only public or internal declared accessibility. struct members can have public internal or private declared accessibility and default to private declared accessibility because structs are implicitly sealed
struct members introduced in a struct that is not inherited by that struct cannot have protected or protected internal declared accessibility

138585
cpython	pypy
use cpython which is a python- like language that is compiled into a python c extension use pypy which has a translator from rpython a restricted subset of python that does not support some of the most dynamic features of python to c or llvm
pypy is still highly experimental not all extensions will be present after that you can use one of the existing packages freeze py2exe pyinstaller to put everything into one binary

139894
nlb	iis
windows nlb is definitely your solution - it sits in the network stack on each of your iis servers and distributes tcp requests among the member servers
nlb works with ssl traffic since it distributes via tcp ports not the contents of the traffic

140719
boost	stl
boost thread is great i m not sure whether you can say its part of the language though
it depends if you consider the crt stl boost to be part of c++ or an optional add-on library

140921
daemons	systemd
the rng-tools package includes a daemons which will feed hardware generated entropy into dev random
if a hrng is not available on your systemd and you are willing to sacrifice entropy strength for performance you will want to seed a good prng with data from dev random and let the prng do the bulk of the work

141225
google-chrome	firefox
since the bookmarklet is positioned outside of any page this area is generally called the browser google-chrome - which is confusing since there s now a browser with that name it s not possible to detect javascript-related events there
that being said if you created this as a firefox extension then you would have access to event information javascript and keyboard modifiers

143163
bazaar	svn
depending on your ide and if you can change scm you might want to have a look at other fully distributed scms think mercurial bazaar git ... which support distributed development out of the box
it is possible but not necessarily simple the problem you are trying to solve is dangerously close to setting up a distributed development environment which is not exactly what svn is designed for

if you want antialiasing make sure to use a format that supports transparency bmp and tga do
ppm does not

144141
int	chars
the user input is treated as a string that needs to be converted to an int using atoi or another conversion function
atoi will return 0 if the string cannot be interptreted as a number because it contains letters or other non-numeric chars

jruby	mri	jruby	rubinius
here s a bit of info i scrounged up on the main vms ruby mri ruby 1.9 yarv jruby xruby rubinius and ironruby there was a performance benchmark last year that compared the major vms but with how quickly vm development has been it probably is not as relevant today
ruby 1.9 was generally the fastest and still has the edge over jruby for now i believe

144723
gtk	cairo
mono does not use qt kde or gtk gnome widgets because they don t match up with the winforms api
mono implements winforms on top of their system.drawing implementation which in turn uses cairo

145424
textmate	gedit
i searched for textmate e-text editor like text editor for linux
i found out gedit is not a bad one

145503
put	get
- as said above put them under a subsidiary section technology seems to be a good term
looking at my own resume not updated in a while i have made a section just called languages so i can t get wrong.

145952
inline	inlining
which means that should you change the code of the inline function you would need to recompile all the code using it to be sure it will be updated for the same reason i avoid default values for function parameters when used in a header it makes your header file larger and thus will dilute interesting informations like the list of a class methods with code the user don t care about this is the reason that i declare inline functions inside a class but will define it in an header after the class body and never inside the class body
inlining magic the compiler may or may not inline the functions you marked as inline

145952
inline	inlining
inlining magic the compiler may or may not inline the functions you marked as inline
it may also decide to inline functions not marked as inline at compilation or linking time

146209
factors	mean
factors out common styles
not styles that just happen to be the same styles that are intended to be the same - where changing the style for one selector will likely mean you ll want to change the other as well

146691
typedef	struct
so in tree.h instead of #include element.h do typedef struct element_ element
this declares the types element and struct element_ says they exist but doesn t define them say what they are

147034
folder	directory
modify just the security on a specific sub-directory of the appdata directory this is from the link you provided csidl_common_appdata this folder should be used for application data that is not user specific
for example an application may store a spell check dictionary a database of clip-art or a log file in the csidl_common_appdata folder

147195
post	put	post	get
it however isn t very clean because your code has to determine if you re in the post create case or post update case
the rest 1 approach uses post get put and delete to implement the crud rules for a web resource

147195
post	get
edit while there s no technical reason for post to have no key the rest folks suggest strongly that for post to have distinct meaning as create it should not have a key. get retrieves existing objects
the uri may have a key depends on whether you are doing singleton get or list get

147213
post	get	put	get
and it can know that post put and delete should not be cached
it allows data to flow both ways so why would get be needed

147337
innodb	myisam
the difference really only matters for myisam other storage engines do not care about the difference. edit many users commented that innodb does care link 1 by steampowered link 2 by kaan
with myisam with fixed width rows there are a few advantages no row fragmentation it is possible with variable width rows to get single rows split into multiple sections across the data file

147392
vim	emacs
i have no doubt that anything you can get done in emacs you can also get done in vim just not standard
try emacs

147589
boost	allocator
if you use something like boost s scoped_ptr template your class could look more like and you would have no memory leaks and the default dtor would also clean up the dynamic memory allocator
to sum up and hopefully this also answers the question about the statement when an exception is thrown inside a constructor there are several things that you should take note of in terms of properly handling resource allocator that may have occured in the aborted construction of the object the destructor for the object being constructed will not be called

147654
crypt	salt
do not store crypt password in config file but insted of this store crypt salt + password
as salt you can use something that is required to open database eg

148033
mouse	keyboard
as the back forward buttons aren t their own windows you ll need to figure out how to do this with simulating a mouse click at a certain x y position so chrome knows what you re doing
or you could send the keyboard shortcut equivalent for back forward and so on

148425
int	boolean
here we are testing for all non false values any of them is fine and one third example just to prove that it is safe to compare any int that is considered false to a false which is only 0
the reason your print statement is not getting executed is because your boolean is getting implicitly converted to a number instead of the other way around

149471
nstimer	nsrunloop
as i wrote below a nstimer object is created that gets a pointer to the target object and a pointer to a c string containing the method name and when the timer fires it finds the right c method to call by using the string table hence it needs the string name of the method of the target object hence it needs a reference to it
not exactly the implementation but pretty close to it every thread in cocoa has a nsrunloop it s always there you never need to create on for a thread

149715
crc	reed-solomon
so if the message is large you re most likely correct that its some sort of crc
it might not be a crc it might be an error correcting code like reed-solomon

149720
atomic	interlocked
intel s open-source threadbuildingblocks has a template atomic that offers the same functionality as .net s interlocked class
unlike gcc s atomic built-ins it s cross platform and doesn t depend on a particular compiler

149720
atomic	compare-and-swap
unlike gcc s atomic built-ins it s cross platform and doesn t depend on a particular compiler
as nemanja trifunovic correctly points out above it does depend on the compare-and-swap cpu instruction provided by x86 and itanium chips

149811
post	get
it should so long as you set your httpservice s method property to post
if you omit it it will default to get and the parameters will be sent as part of the query string not as post data

149865
irrlicht	ogre3d
ogre and irrlicht both are said to have a cleaner design than crystalspace so i wouldn t worry to much about problems with the latter
ogre3d is typically named together with crystalspace and irrlicht

150009
unsigned	short
i believe that compiler takes a hint to disable padding when you use the unsigned int wwindow 16 syntax
also note that a short is not guaranteed to be 16 bits

150148
filtering	grouping
extract method is the nearest a datatable provides in termes of filtering it returns an array of pointers to datarows
grouping is not so powerful as in tclientdataset as also indexing is poorer

150195
put	get
keytool doesn t have key export built in to avoid accidental disclosure of this sensitive material so you might want to consider some extra safeguards that could be put in place to protect your exported keys
here is some simple code that gives you unencrypted pkcs #8 privatekeyinfo that can be used by openssl see the -nocrypt option of its pkcs8 utility if you need other formats you can use a keyfactory to get a transparent key specification for different types of keys

150283
lisp	scheme
so for learning scheme lisp javascript isn t a bad start
note though that functional languages like lisp are quite different from pure functional languages such as haskell

150480
implements	sealed
when coming to mock classes that are not test friendly sealed not implements any interface methods are not virtual you would probably want to use the adapter design pattern
in this pattern you add a wrapping class that implements an interface

151244
suppressfinalize	finalizer
the suppressfinalize optimization is not trivial as your objects can live a long time waiting on the finalizer queue
don t be tempted to call suppressfinalize on other objects mind you

151534
initializer	class-method
basically the module cannot be initializer
when a class includes a module a proxy superclass is generated that provides access to all the module methods as well as the class-method

151912
postgresql	mysql
this is the sequence solution for postgresql you d have to do it in a stored procedure or on your application code of course
for mysql the transaction is important not to trip on your own feet in case you re using the same connection for more than one insert

151938
inline	inlining
there are several situations where the compiler is not able to determine categorically whether it is appropriate or beneficial to inline a function
inlining may involve trade-off s that the compiler is unwilling to make but you are e.g code bloat

152596
builtin	isinstance
to check if o is an instance of str or any subclass of str use isinstance this would be the canonical way if isinstance o str to check if the type of o is exactly str exclude subclasses if type o is str the following also works and can be useful in some cases if issubclass type o str see builtin functions in the python library reference for relevant information
one more note in this case if you re using python 2 you may actually want to use if isinstance o basestring because this will also catch unicode strings unicode is not a subclass of str

153399
degrafa	flex
if you re interested in leveraging the graphics potential of flex why not go check out degrafa which is an open source graphing and general graphics api
it s pretty cool very well documented and quote - adobe has asked if the degrafa team would consider helping directly contribute to the flex graphics open source effort. - which they are

154388
vmware	esx
for vmware server you really need server hardware unless it s only for testing
go with a virtualization solution that is bare level like xen server or vmware esx or esxi free or hyper-v which isn t bare-level but closer in performance

154416
spaces	delimiter
this is microsoft sql server nonstandard syntax for delimiter identifiers. sql supports delimiter for identifiers to allow table names column names or other metadata objects to contain the following sql reserved words order words containing spaces order qty words containing punctuation order-qty words containing international characters column names that are case-sensitive order vs
order microsoft sql server uses the square brackets but this is not the syntax standard sql uses for delimiter identifiers

154490
int	chars
you need this additional check as the simply existence of the int on the map does not equate to the existence of the word in the associated set we are using hashing here to reduce the computational space of the problem but this introduces collision which need to be disambiguated checking on each identified anagram
if the corpus is so large try to optimize it in this way compute an hash of each word you need to check assigning to each chars an int prime number and then multiplying each number together

154849
vsts	tfs
this is especially important for servicing purposes - making sure that when a service pack for vsts is applied to the client machine then the tfs api s get upgraded as well
there are no re-distribution rights to the tfs api s therefore they should not be shipped with your application

154973
put	get
you can then put less-crucial information advertising non-mission-critical features in an additional 250px column to the right that will be visible to visitors with 1024px or more
also as jimharries99 suggests internet-wide statistics for screens or browsers or whatever may not match your audience profile so you should use analytics to get a handle on your specific audience

154976
g++	gcc
also use the correct gcc frontend executable g++ will treat .c files like c++ files unless you explicitly tell it not too
so if you are compiling real c then use gcc not g++

154976
g++	gcc
so if you are compiling real c then use gcc not g++
gcc -pedantic -wall -werror .c g++ -pedantic -wall -werror .cpp to help with your specific problem it may be nice to see line 43

155612
disk	ram
if you have designed to scale horizontally usually just buying more servers is cheaper than trying to figure out how to optimize disk
not to mention things like ssd or even ram disks for your templates will make it a non-issue

155771
int	double
however since these methods are overloading one another and are neither overriding nor shadowing it is reasonable to assume that the best argument fit should apply here and therefore conclude that it is a foo int n that should be called when provided an int as an argument
to prove that what should happen is unclear the exact same code when run in vb.net has the opposite result public class form1 private sub button1_click byval sender as system.object _ byval e as system.eventargs _ handles button1.click dim b as new b b.foo 5 a foo b.foo 5.0 b foo end sub end class class a sub foo byval n as int messagebox.show a foo end sub end class class b inherits a overloads sub foo byval n as double messagebox.show b foo end sub end class i realize that i am opening up the opportunity for the c# programmers to bash vb.net for not complying with c#

156321
stdio	fflush
this doesn t mean that manually adjusting the stdio buffering is a good idea though
you may wish to utilise std endl or std fflush from which may help you

157010
typedef	typename
by the way it is considered good practice to also expose a few other types if you want your class to behave as a container and if needed by your class you ll find the meaning of all these typedef s here stl documentation on vectors edit added the typename as suggested in the comments
i am unsure about what you mean by not exposing std vector publicly but indeed you can just define your typedef like that you will be able to change these typedefs later without the user noticing anything .

157025
inline	inlining
although the greatest loss is that a virtual function when called polymorphically cannot be inline
and inlining will in a lot of situations represent some real gain in performance

157134
factors	mean
physical distance whilst a factors does not always mean that latency automatically goes up
another factors is if is direct peering agreements with transit carriers based in other countries

157785
vbscript	vba
the on error goto label syntax is supported by visual basic and visual basic for applications vba but vbscript doesn t support this language feature so you have to use on error resume next as described above
vbscript has no notion of throwing or catching exceptions but the runtime provides a global err object that contains the results of the last operation performed

158550
submit	submission
if you call submit then it will not trigger the form object s onsubmit
that way your function will be called whether the link is clicked or the submit button is pushed or the enter key is pressed and you can cancel the submission by returning false

158603
cpu	processors
thus the bigger problem might be that you rely on a certain speed you assume the processors can perform that many operations a second however when the core frequency is lowered it will behave like a slower cpu less operations per second and the core frequency doesn t jump to max just because the cpu is not 100 idle
it will jump up again when the cpu thinks it needs more processing power than it currently has

159052
int	double
don t store it as a float n .5 and then try to reconstitute it as if it were an int in another part of your code mypercentage n 100
as long as you make sure not to do that and you are not building a laser that requires 30 significant digits of precision just pick your favorite flavor between int double or whatever float s your boat

159131
udp	tcp
if the messages you are sending need to be reliable udp is probably not a good basis
tcp tries very hard to prevent congestion in the network

159819
nginx	lighttpd
possible problems nginx is buggy
at least lighttpd has horrible fastcgi bugs i wouldn t wonder if nginx has some too django is dying with a traceback in an internal system that is not properly catched and closes the fastcgi server which you can t see from the client

159999
cvs	svn
remember that active development of cvs stopped a while ago so there are probably no tools for you from the cvs developers
and since one of the main goals of svn was to be a better cvs those developers will probably not have expected anyone to move backwards either

160306
free	malloc	free	calloc	free	realloc
you do not need to free the result
you can only call free 3 on pointers allocated on the heap with malloc 3 calloc 3 or realloc 3

161077
disk	ram
adding a new page of zeroed memory doesn t require reading a page from disk so usually this is still going to be tons faster than searching a heap especially if part of the heap was paged out too
in a rare situation and you could construct such an example enough space just happens to be available in part of the heap which is already in ram but allocating a new page for the stack has to wait for some other page to get written out to disk

161455
instances	transient
persistent won t execute any statements outside of the currently running transaction just to assign the identifier. save persistent both work on transient instances ie instances which have no identifier assigned yet and as such are not saved in the db
update and merge both work on detached instances ie instances which have a corresponding entry in the db but which are currently not attached to or managed by a session

161459
ant	maven
this way you shouldn t get the compilation errors that you would get when running eclipse and ant
maven has the ability to run all your tests for you during the testing cycle of compilation this should stop the need for any ant tasks to run the tests

161459
ant	maven
maven has the ability to run all your tests for you during the testing cycle of compilation this should stop the need for any ant tasks to run the tests
however if you still need to have scripts for other tasks generation of code etc then be weary of maven s ability to generate code and not include it in the compiled binaries jar war though this may well be fixed for newer versions of maven

161568
bazaar	svn
although i tested not thouroughly on windows as i no longer use this system i m quite confident that all the major vcs svn git mercurial bazaar have proper windows-implementation now
this advantage for svn is gone

161947
margin	height
in prototype it s this will recursively add up the rendered height not just the styled height for each child element and any associated margin and padding and return an accurate figure for element height
you can t predict the overall height of the element until after load as the browser will render and position elements depending on the adjacent elements and the size of the viewing window

162145
post	get
next time please post the stacktrace that you receive you may leave out where you call it you could only include the hibernate stuff if your project is too sensitive
if you do map to a primitive character and it is null you will get an exception because primitives cannot have null assigned to them

163084
distance	polygons
if you are dealing strictly with points and only the distance function this is fine
if you need to do any calculations with polygons lines or buffered-points the spatial operators do not provide exact results unless you use the relate operator

163483
prepare	execute
you should be able to prepare a sql query to validate the syntax and get result set metadata
preparing a query should not execute it

163544
put	get
if we had used s instead of c we would have asked printf to print the content of the memory address pointed to by a plus one in this example above and we wouldn t have had to put the in front but this would not have just printed the second character but instead all characters in the next memory addresses until a null character 0 were found
and this is where things start to get dangerous

163730
overwrite	preserve
you could write a script that checks the crc or md5 hash of each file from the source and target folders and only perform the overwrite if the file has changed
this would preserve the timestamps for files which have not changed giving you the desired caching behaviour

164507
httpresponse	request
then wrap render_to_response or whatever you are using for creating httpresponse objects to grab the iphone version of the template instead of the standard html version if they are using an iphone
rather than changing the template directories dynamically you could modify the request and add a value that lets your view know if the user is on an iphone or not

165174
kate	kdevelop
i really enjoy kate part of kde
it s the editor used in kdevelop but doesn t serve as an ide

165604
hide	show
barname as a property is intended to hide the private variable among other things for the purpose of avoiding the sweeping changes you contemplate to the rest of your code
i am assuming that the refactoring as show above is not a breaking change because the property is basically staying the same

165622
yourkit	jprofiler
i have used yourkit
i have not used jprofiler

165651
put	get
a better way might be to put title attributes in your html
that way if someone has javascript turned off they ll still get a tool tip albeit not as pretty flexible as you can do with jquery

165921
qpushbutton	qwidget
it is not possible to do it because it means you would add a slot to an existing qt class like qpushbutton which is not really the way to go
you should create your own qwidget eventually by subclassing an existing one

166098
subclass	getattr
the problem gets worse when this double-underscore attribute is actually a method overriding the method or calling the method in a subclass means doing the name-mangling manually or reimplementing all the code that calls the method to not use the double-underscore name
not to mention accessing the attribute dynamically with getattr you will have to manually mangle there too

166477
structuremap	log4net
note you can get more flexible - and complex - using an inversion of control container such as structuremap . and an example of using this code in your classes declared as a static readonly field you can get the same slightly more performance friendly effect using the former example is considered more maintainable
you would not want to create a singleton to handle all logging because log4net logs for the invoking type

166485
instances	transient
the microkernel comes with three ireleasepolicy implementations allcomponentsreleasepolicy track all components to enforce correct disposal upon the microkernel instances disposal lifecycledcomponentsreleasepolicy only track components that have a decommission lifecycle associated notrackingreleasepolicy does not perform any tracking you can also implement your own release policy by using the interface ireleasepolicy
what you might find easier is to change the policy to a notrackingreleasepolicy and then handle the disposing yourself - this is potentially risky as well but if your lifestyles are largely transient or if when your container is disposed your application is about to close anyway it s probably not a big deal

167350
getdate	dateadd
for example the last possible instant of yesterday local time is select dateadd ms -3 dateadd dd datediff dd 0 getdate 0 so to do the orders due this month as a between query you can use this remember always make sure that you do math against input parameters not columns or you will kill the sarg -ability of the query which means indexes that might have been used aren t
the answer is select dateadd ms -3 2008-01-24 the explanation is below

167434
allocator	stl
i d doubt that is possible except using custom allocator
but even then it s most likely you would be using plain stl containers and not boost

167681
trac	bugzilla
of course trac doesn t have support for blocking blockedby tickets out of the box so if you want to import this data too you ll have to use the masterticketsplugin and then modify the script yourself which is what we did when we migrated
for bugzilla trac has a script bugzilla2trac.py that will automate the process of importing bugzilla bugs to trac tickets for you

167805
vmware	virtualbox
vmware virtual server is not really designed for use as a desktop and you will get very tired of it with any prolonged use
sun s virtualbox is another option competing with virtual pc

167811
switching	screens
in my case my desktop monitor is much larger than my laptops and i m more comfortable facing forward anyway not looking off to the side where the laptop is. there is a lag compared to using a kvm switching but no loss in video quality
synergy is great but also give something like vnc a try it consolidates not only the keyboard and mouse but also the screens

168060
range	max	range	min	min	max
in addition to what others have already said about signed unsigned here s what the standard says about the range of an enumerated type 7.2 6 for an enumeration where e min is the smallest enumerator and e max is the largest the values of the enumeration are the values of the underlying type in the range b min to b max where b min and b max are respectively the smallest and largest values of the smallest bitfield that can store e min and e max
it is possible to define an enumeration that has values not defined by any of its enumerators. so for example defines an enumerated type where e min is 1 and e max is 4

168200
post	get
while it may not be appropriate for you situation it should be stated that you should consider converting the link into a form post
it sounds like you might be misusing a get request to modify server state although this is not necessarily the case

168366
onclick	onsubmit	submit	submission
if i attach an onclick handler to the submit button i can see that the button is being clicked - but if i attach an onsubmit handler to the form i get nothing
if i make the button onclick handler submit the form through javascript it works fine - it s just the direct submission that s not working

168539
vb.net	vb6
you may also like to take a look at these links this has an example of how to do what you want zipping using windows built-in zip capabilities from vb.net it shouldn t be much different from vba or vb6 transparent zip with dll call this one has a sample application on vb6 using windows built-in capabilities to zip in zip rather than gzip format of course using windows xp compressed folder shell extension to work with .zip files found both thru googling you should be able to find more better examples
vba which is really a dialect of vb6 is slow for these kind of applications

169614
strcpy	strncpy
some safer alternatives to strcpy strcat that you might want to look into you may need to track down implementations for some of these - they re not all standard strncpy - includes the target buffer size to avoid overruns
has the drawback of not always terminating the result string strncat strlcpy - similar to strncpy but intended to be simpler to use and more robust strlcat strcpy_s - microsoft variants of these functions strncat_s and the api you should strive to use if you can use c++ the std string class

169629
strdup	strtok
use strdup to copy the string
strtok does not give you a new string

169760
cpu	processors
we d found a bug in the data cache of a shipping cpu
the cache in this processors was not coherent with dma requiring the software to explicitly flush it at the proper times

169825
wxpython	pyglet
it doesn t use wxpython but perhaps it will give you an idea of what is involved
note however mactorii is using the old pyglet api so the run loop i have in there is obsolete

171252
screens	tablet
the 900 series would be a far better choice with a bigger screens and faster ram but the same processor but it s still not well-intended for visual studio 2008
i find vs cramped on my 12 tablet

171994
post	put
html forms support get and post
html5 at one point added put delete but those were dropped. xmlhttprequest supports every method including chicken though some method names are matched against case-insensitively methods are case-sensitive per http and some method names are not supported at all for security reasons connect

172177
apache	lighttpd
the idea is of splitting your site into static content css js images etc and dynamic code that flows through apache
i m not saying you can t do a lot with lighttpd on its own

172453
filesystems	fat
comparison of different filesystems are here
there is a number of embedded filesystems not fat compatible that designed exactly for this purpose

172607
temp	tmp
i think asking the user where temp files should go is preferable to assuming somewhere and leaving them there if your process gets killed
use tmpdir - tmp tmpdir or tmp if tmpdir is not set

172750
expressionengine	joomla
which is kinda cool also you can try expressionengine whch also have some nice features for multi-domain users with one setup. anyhow the best solution is to build a custom solution for this but of course you won t be only a hosting company anymore d
no joomla is huge and heavy is not a reliable solution

172929
g++	gcc
both are capable of linking against the c++ standard library but only g++ does this by default
so if you have a program written in c++ that doesn t happen to need to link against the standard library gcc will happen to do the right thing

173007
g++	gcc
g++ will compile .c .cpp files but they will all be treated as c++ files
also if you use g++ to link the object files it automatically links in the std c++ libraries gcc does not do this

173007
g++	gcc
also if you use g++ to link the object files it automatically links in the std c++ libraries gcc does not do this
gcc compiling c files has fewer predefined macros

173090
floating-point	fractions
there s no significance to the long numbers you posted -- they re an artifact of the underlying floating-point implementation filtered through god-knows how many intermediate layers
bit-shifting by a fractions number of bytes is insane and i m surprised it doesn t raise an exception -- but that s javascript always willing to redefine insane

173101
int	chars
for example you might do the following -- track information on the player create table players id int not null username varchar2 32 not null password varchar2 32 not null email varchar2 160 constraint pk_players primary key id
-- track information on the chars create table chars id int not null player_id int not null chars varchar2 32 not null status varchar2 32 hitpoints int constraint pk_characters primary key id

173101
int	chars
-- track information on the chars create table chars id int not null player_id int not null chars varchar2 32 not null status varchar2 32 hitpoints int constraint pk_characters primary key id
-- foreign key reference alter table chars add constraint characters__players foreign key player_id references players id

173730
post	get
i will post a solution tonight edit
i wasn t sure i wanted to post as i don t have a huge amount of scope on the matter but it s definatley possible. if you have a handle to the application if not you can get one you can use that to disable right click within the application

174521
allocator	stl
even if you do not share stl objects across threads many implementations use non-thread safe constructs like ++ for reference counting instead of an interlocked increment style or having non-thread-safe allocator
in each of these cases i still opted to use stl and fix the problems there are enough hooks to get what you want

174728
boost	stl
you may also choose not to use stl for a particular case because more applicable containers exist that are not in the current standard such as boost array or boost unordered_map
projects with strict memory requirements such as for embedded systems may not be suited for the stl as it can be difficult to control and manage what s taken from and returned to the heap

176071
opera	firefox	firefox	safari
here s my testing bugfixing priority list absolutely essential to fully support firefox 3 and ie7 highly recommended to fully support opera and safari no missing functionality slightly degraded interfaces are acceptable but only if absolutely necessary interface degradation is acceptable with ie6 and firefox 2 as long as it is still usable i consider these as end of life browsers and frankly rarely worth the effort also here are older versions of opera and safari but i rarely see significant problems with these
if the interface does not rely heavily on javascript then it must degrade gracefully enough to be usable in text based and mobile browsers such as opera mobile links lynx iphone etc this includes any necessary optimisations for the screen size informational non-application sites must be at least tested with a screenreader i will put no significant effort into supporting firefox 1 and ie5.5 or below

176071
opera	google-chrome
if the interface does not rely heavily on javascript then it must degrade gracefully enough to be usable in text based and mobile browsers such as opera mobile links lynx iphone etc this includes any necessary optimisations for the screen size informational non-application sites must be at least tested with a screenreader i will put no significant effort into supporting firefox 1 and ie5.5 or below
new functionality must be tested and at least working with upcoming browsers such as ie8 and google-chrome

176144
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
my support list in order of priority currently looks like this unless a client expresses a need to expand it safari 3 firefox 2 firefox 3 ie 7 ie 8 beta public-facing functionality works looks correct in ie 6 google-chrome the reason i take this approach is that first it s best to work in a standards-compliant browser before tweaking to broken engines
second safari has the greatest standards support combined with a marketshare which isn t negligible opera is just hard to justify for cost benefit reasons

176144
opera	firefox	opera	safari
second safari has the greatest standards support combined with a marketshare which isn t negligible opera is just hard to justify for cost benefit reasons
third in my experience going from safari to firefox is usually less problematic than the other way around

176285
client-side	server-side
depending on the requirements of your project you may or may not want to implement client-side validation
however server-side validation should always be implemented

176501
udp	tcp
if the data that you re sending cannot tolerate dropped packets and you re trying to scale to high utilisation of your network then perhaps udp is not the best protocol to use
implementing a series of tcp proxies where each node retransmits unicast to all other connected nodes - similar to your flooding idea would be a more reliable mechanism

176700
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the contenteditable property is what you want -- it s supported by ie safari and by google-chrome as a byproduct and i think firefox 3 alas not ffx2
and hey it s also part of html5 d firefox 2 supports designmode but that is restricted to individual frames whereas the contenteditable property applies applies to individual elements so you can have your editable content play more nicely with your page d edit olliej removed example as contenteditable attribute doesn t get past so s output filters despite working in the preview edit olliej i ve banged up a very simple demo to illustrate how it behaves edit olliej so yes the contenteditable attribute in the linked demo works fine in ie firefox and safari

177386
hash	md5
i think i d be more generally confident when keeping the whole of a hash but md5 has known vulnerabilities which may or may not be a problem for your particular application
if i truncate the 41-byte hash to 33 i d probably certainly

177557
qdialog	qobject
your dialog derives from more than one class and qdialog is not the first class that it derives from
for qmake to work correctly the qobject derived base class needs to be the first class that is inherited from

177875
int	chars
directly answering your questions the best delimiter is the chars that does not appear in your data use a blank in those columns any int will have a chars or even a null chars all this and more is why you should use the ready made tool all the hard choices have been thought out and made already for you
i would do whatever bcp with the -c option chars instead of binary does by default overriding it only if you see a specific problem with your data

178178
qspinbox	qpalette
here is what i did to change the background color of a qcombobox i haven t specifically tried for a qspinbox but i guess it ll work the same
using a qpalette isn t guaranteed to work for all styles because style authors are restricted by the different platforms guidelines and by the native theme engine

178481
csla	.net
it taught me a lot about .net and design in general i don t agree with the design of csla thus i would never use it take the ideas and use what is valuable to you
csla doesn t stand on its own as an orm it just provides the object framework

179252
button	checkbox
button
double-click each entry in the hot keys for input languages list and make sure the checkbox are not checked

179782
awt	swing
if it s a gui app switch from swing to awt or maybe eclipse s toolkit it s supposed to be pretty quick
this is more important on older vms i ve been working embedded for a while and we are actually in a 1.0.x vm swing isn t even available i know this isn t specific to java exactly but not allocating objects--this includes string concatenation in a loop outside a loop it s pretty acceptable

180440
put	get
while you can put any sql you like in the conditions of a named scope if you then call find_by_sql then the scopes get thrown away
given this works it just sticks the sql string in there - if you have more than one they get joined with and however this doesn t so the answer is no

180839
tax	shipping
your parameters or commands would be base price local tax city tax state tax ground shipping and coupon discount
the flexibility come into play when you handle the variation of orders - some states will not have sales tax while other orders will need to apply a coupon

180906
dictionary	map
it s not identical but vbscript has a dictionary object which behaves like java s map or hashtable
you can use this almost like a hashset by just looking up the item as a key in the dictionary and finding if there is any value there

181118
client-side	server-side
if you re looking for a client-side click event - just type it into your server control markup asp.net will emit additional attributes in the html markup that generates
your question doesn t specify if you mean to raise the click event on the server vb or c# or the client javascript. if you re looking for a server-side event you should use a link button with css that makes the link appear as a label

181245
bash	zsh
it serves as a good warning to those of us that don t use bash as our shell because we we ll forget that a feature that s in our day-to-day shell isn t going to be available when this code is run at the appointed time
the use of there is perfectly valid zsh but not sbin sh

181372
matlab	simulink
for further comparison with python i can say that matlab provides a full package for you to do your work without the need of looking around for external libraries and implementing extra functions
one last point about matlab which i see is not mentioned in the answers here is that it has a very powerful visual modeling simulation environment called simulink

181372
matlab	simulink
one last point about matlab which i see is not mentioned in the answers here is that it has a very powerful visual modeling simulation environment called simulink
it s easier to design and simulate larger systems with simulink

181815
firefox	safari
for me both the bbc sites you link to get the proper characters in the window title bar using firefox or ie on windows
i suspect you don t have the right fonts installed though i m not sure entirely what fonts it is that you would be missing to cause this problem particularly not if safari works

182684
for-loop	loops
as a slight aside when looping through an arrays or other collection in .net i find to be more readable than the numeric for-loop
this of course assumes that the actual counter int itself isn t used in loops code

182777
int	double
it is a fixed-precision decimal implemented with int storage
it can be compared exactly and does not have the rounding issues of say double

184285
put	get
i put cleanup code in the class s destructor expecting the code to be called when the object went out of scope
but that s not how object destruction works in .net when an object goes out of scope it gets put in the finalizer s queue and its destructor doesn t get called until the finalizer gets around to it

184540
realloc	malloc
the realloc function might be able to extend the size of a chunk of memory for you more efficiently
it is worth mentioning that you cannot mix new free and malloc delete

184695
put	get
then we take long running tests and put them in a nightlycategory so that they only get run during nightly builds and not in the continuous builds that we want to run fast
we use .net and nunit which supports categories an attribute you can put on a test

185631
apache	lighttpd
i probably could come up with a nightmare configuration for apache that would make it actually slower serving static files than proxying those requests to a backend lighttpd but it would involve enabling expensive features like .htaccess in apache that are disabled in lighttpd so it wouldn t really be fair
running lighttpd behind apache to serve static files certainly seems braindead to me

186298
modifiers	sealed
from the c# programming guide the following keywords on a partial-type definition are optional but if present on one partial-type definition cannot conflict with the keywords specified on another partial definition for the same type public private protected internal abstract sealed base class new modifiers nested parts generic constraints
you can duplicate the class modifiers or leave them out in one file but you ll get a compiler error if they re specified in different files as different access levels

186332
redhat	fedora
redhat won t provide any support for packages that were not installed for that specific rhel version from rhn
while packages for other distributions like fedora rawhide may install cleanly those packages were not blessed for rhel

186478
post	get
in php adapted from this post on the php date manual page output from week_from_monday 07-10-2008 gives
php below post was because i was an idiot who didn t read the question properly but will get the dates in a week starting from monday given the date not the week number

186521
public	protected
also keep in mind that what you need to test is the public api of an object not it s protected private methods
finding bugs in private protected method should be what logging debuggers are for

186645
perforce	svn
i would certainly recommend perforce for a number of reasons already covered in other answers but i m not in a position to offer a comparison with svn having never really used it
on the perforce website they have a paper comparing the two p4 vs svn obviously given the source you have to realise that it stresses the advantages of perforce over svn but it is still a useful read

189162
inline	inlining
declaring it inline makes it a candidate for inlining it does not mean a lot nowadays in c++ as the compiler will inline or not sometimes ignoring the fact the keyword inline is present or absent a function declaration 8.3.5 9.3 11.3 with an inline specifier declares an inline-functions
the inline specifier indicates to the implementation that inline substitution of the function body at the point of call is to be preferred to the usual function call mechanism

190282
websphere	ibm
websphere mq 7 for windows supports x86 and x64 but not itanium 64bit
it only officially supports visual c++ 2005 for development at the moment but ibm usually issues ptfs for toleration on a regular basis so it shouldn t be too long before c++ 2008 support is there

190745
factors	mean
applications differ in how they scale depending on a large number of variables including types of problem solving approach to solution and other factors
100 concurrent users consuming 10 cpu does not mean 500 concurrent at 50 it could be 20 or it could be 100

190745
cpu	processors
100 concurrent users consuming 10 cpu does not mean 500 concurrent at 50 it could be 20 or it could be 100
your bottleneck could be processors or memory or network bandwidth

191706
punctuation	words
you could even be creative about introducing ellipses if the first non-selected term doesn t end in punctuation etc
i think instead of trying to find sentences i d think about the amount of context around the search term i would need in words

193248
mvp	presenter
now it s up to you to determine whether you think this is worth the time but it is expected in almost any real software that you will have some kind of separation of these components whether it s mvp or something more enterprisey like n-tier
i m in agreement with chills42--the goal of mvp is not to make the presenter so generic that it could be used with any ui technology

193952
subclass	superclass
callvirt is for calling virtual methods so that if this is a subclass that overrides the method the subclass version is called instead
call is for calling non-virtual static or superclass methods the target of the call is not subject to overriding

193960
implements	sealed
so it looks like the compiler will emit a call if all these things are true the method call is immediately after the object creation the method is not implements in a base class
for this reason .net s sealed classes can have better method dispatching performance than their non-sealed counterparts

194206
hash	md5
abcdefgh.jpg - a ab abc abcdefgh.jpg if your filenames are not evenly distributed not a hash try to choose a splitting method that gets an even distribution the last characters if it is an incrementing user-id
one thing about distributing the filenames into different directories if you consider splitting your md5 filenames into different subdirectories which is generally a good idea i would suggest keeping the complete hash as filename and duplicate the first few chars as directory names

194305
int	chars
this version allows any non-digit chars to delimit int if you only want dots to be allowed you can modify the inner loop to skip only dots and then check for a digit
here is the correct way to do it it is a little longer than the simplest way but it doesn t suffer from undefined behavior if the value read is out of range works properly if the first chars is not a dot etc

194402
ant	maven
given that maven s advantages are not too much compared to ant
then again if you want some of maven s features ant folks have ivy for the dependencies feature

194709
markitup	wymeditor
and you can ease editor s life by using some helpers like markitup editor it also supports original wiki and textile
sometimes it is possible to use something like wymeditor - it isn t that simple but produces clean semantic code

194889
int	double
for example adding two int is different than adding two double or even one int and one double
there is even the whole pointer arithmetic domain without casting you can add to a pointer an int but you cannot add two pointers...

194907
put	get
the comments are put into their own xml file when you build the project and as long as that file is in the right place visual studio will be able to use it
not only that but you ll get intellisense help to build the comments

195128
mousehover	mouseenter	mousehover	mouseleave
btw instead of setting enabled in mousehover you should do it in mouseenter
mouseenter and mouseleave is a pair which indicate whether is the mouse is within the button or not and it s fired once per entry exit

post	get
if it does it should be a post request if it doesn t it should be a get request
i m glad that you call post requests slightly more secure because that s pretty much what they are

195219
post	put
making it a post request however prevents web accelerators or reloads from re-triggering the action accidentally
as ajax there is one more consideration if you are returning json with callback support be very careful not to put any sensitive data that you don t want other websites to be able to see in there

195250
hid	keyboard
on mac os x you can use the hid manager to get direct visibility into which hid elements are being actuated on which devices
that should work not just for keyboard but for all hid devices mice game pads etc

195398
postgresql	mysql
but if you do a lot of heavy updates to a table as often as other threads have to read then the default locking in mysql is not the best and postgresql can be a better choice performance-wise
iow postgresql scales better regarding to db writes

195398
postgresql	mysql
that s why it s usually said that mysql is best for webapps while postgresql is more enterprisey
of course the picture is not so simple innodb tables on mysql have a very different performance behaviour at the load levels where postgresql s better locks overtake mysql s other parts of your platform could be the bottlenecks

195398
postgresql	mysql
of course the picture is not so simple innodb tables on mysql have a very different performance behaviour at the load levels where postgresql s better locks overtake mysql s other parts of your platform could be the bottlenecks
postgresql does comply better with standards so it can be easier to replace later

195444
hash	md5
storing the password hash in the database is not optimal secure in case the database contents get into unauthorized hands. there is no way to reverse the hash directly but there are online dictinonaries like here for reversing hash pass words
in the db you should store somethig like md5 login_name + domain_or_appname_salt + password

196328
cruisecontrol	teamcity
besides cruisecontrol documentation its wiki page also has some useful information as well
i do not have a direct experience with teamcity

196705
django	web2py
the django orm does not do migrations natively see south web2py does
the django orm does not allow partial sums count field and group by web2py does

196705
django	web2py
the django orm does not allow partial sums count field and group by web2py does
web2py can connect to multiple databases at once django and pylons need to be hacked to do that and web2py has a configuration file at the app not at the project level like them

196705
django	web2py	pylons	web2py
web2py can connect to multiple databases at once django and pylons need to be hacked to do that and web2py has a configuration file at the app not at the project level like them
webp2y logs all tracebacks server side for the administrator django and pylons do not

196705
django	web2py	pylons	web2py
webp2y logs all tracebacks server side for the administrator django and pylons do not
web2py programs often run on gae unmodified

196705
django	web2py	pylons	web2py
anyway the most important issue is that web2py is easier than django pylons php and rails
you will also notice that web2py is hosted on both google code and launchpad and there are not open tickets

196798
django	web2py
web2py is 265kbytes of source code and 1.2mb all inclusive compare with 4.6mb of django
yet web2py will do everything you need manage session cookies request response cache internationalization errors tickets database abstraction for gae sqlite mssql mysql postgres oracle firebird etc. it does not need installation - just unzip and click on it - and you can do development in your browser

196933
opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
i ve successfully tested it in firefox 3 msie 7 opera 9 and google-chrome
it apparently doesn t work this way in safari 3

198470
range	max
but if you don t use random.new then the class method rand only takes a max value not a range as banister energetically points out in the comment and as documented in the docs for random
only the instance method can take a range as illustrated by generate a random number with 7 digits

198487
post	get
even if post gives no real security benefit versus get for login forms or any other form with relatively sensitive information make sure you are using post as the information post ed will not be saved in the user s history
the sensitive information password etc. sent in the form will not be visible later on in the url bar by using get it will be visible in the history and the url bar

198492
post	get
while one is not more inherently secure than the other if you do follow this convention you can apply cross-cutting security logic only people with accounts can modify data so unauthenticated post are rejected
many people adopt a convention alluded to by ross that get requests only retrieve data and do not modify any data on the server and post requests are used for all data modification

198607
xna	slimdx
xna provides several math constants including 3d specialists like pi 2 etc. and some advanced math functions with float precision though not the trigonometric functions
while that is most likely not an option for you since xna is not as slim as slimdx it certainly means that system.math is either actually missing something or the performance hit is not that big

199038
dns	spf
if that is not the case then all you need is a simple mta like postfix as long as all the necessary dns records listed above are configured properly you should have no trouble sending emails
to my experience when email providers check for spams they check 5 main things other than content when i say domain i m referring to the domain of the sender s email address. a record ip of the domain name exists mx records of the domain name exist ptr record reverse lookup of the sender s ip address exists sometimes i think it is also checked to see if the ptr record has the same a record as the original domain spf record of that domain matches the ip number this is a list of ip numbers allowed to send emails of that domain

199070
multi-query	mysql
if you use multi-query you should use rigorous code inspection habits to avoid sql injection vulnerability
this is called multi-query. the mysql extension in php does not have any means to enable multi-query

199070
multi-query	mysql
this is called multi-query. the mysql extension in php does not have any means to enable multi-query
the mysqli extension does allow you to use multi-query but only through the multi_query method

199159
post	get
edited to post the following example refactored code apologies for any errors as i typed it in notepad in a couple seconds rather than opening visual studio and i wouldn t get intellisense for your project anyway you will probably also want to implement idisposable using as a number of people have suggested
having now reviewed the code sample you edited to post i would definitely refactor your class to take advantage of linq-to-sql s built in functionality

199222
awt	swing
awt is thread-safe is theory but not in practice - also restrict usage to the edt
it does look like mixing lightweight usually swing and heavyweight awt components together

199472
int	double
clearly if an int is 8 instead of 4 bytes the amount of memory taken by values is doubled
given that not every value is an int though you should typically not expect the memory footprint of your application to double

199741
bash	tcsh
it s a bit more consistent than bash because it does not try to support any csh constructs
tcsh in my experience is least compatible with other shells and i avoid it

199754
mouse	keyboard
press release are interaction events not mouse events
if you activate a button or mc with the keyboard by tabbing to it and pressing space it will fire a press event but not a mousedown

199867
bash	zsh
it can do everything bash can do but more easily and more elegantly
it also has the nice property of having extremely bash-like keystrokes so if you re on a system without zsh you ll be able to make do even if it wouldn t feel as nice

200235
ubuntu	linux
i tried the first alpha version current is 3 of the flex builder under ubuntu and it was just okay but not useable for productive just alpha flashdevelop works only under windows maybe with wine.
and in my opinion it s not a good ide fdt is on eye level with the flex builder but also not free and i don t know if it runs innately on linux

200454
prerequisites	uninstaller
it was supported in earlier versions of windows installer but is now deprecated and even then i m not sure uninstallation of an other product was supported. the recommended way now is to use a bootstrapper to check for and install any prerequisites
theoretically you should also be able to uninstaller a product using a custom bootsrapper however writing one is not a trivial exercise. also silently uninstaller something from a users machine is not necessarily a nice thin

200798
strsplit	substr
re-reading your question again strsplit is not available in j2me but the same effect can be achieved with substr and indexof
that depends on what exactly you want to achieve but the function substr will be in there somewhere this will print the substr starting from index 6 to the end of the string system.out.println mystring.substring 6

202044
rss	feed
i think what you mean to say is that if you have a doget dopost method which contains code to build the data needed for the rss feed from scratch then each request triggers this fetching of data over and over again
if this is your concern and you are ruling static content out simply modify your servlet doget dopost method to cache the rss content that you would otherwise return so that handling each request does not mean re-fetching all of the data all over again

202137
daemons	systemd
admittedly this syncing does not happen until after the daemons starts so keeping your hardware clock in sync also helps between the power up and the point the time daemons syncs against the time server
i would also like to point out the hardware clock is only accurate to a point i have seen systemd that will loose gain a couple of seconds a day

202187
bazaar	git
i know with bazaar the repository is simply a hidden folder added to the directory
this might not be a viable option but perhaps you could use a distributed system like bazaar git or mercurial

202416
rss	feed
you may have to create an intermediary and transform the atom to rss
it appears that is actually an atom feed and not rss so that is probably where the vs issue is coming from

203012
kde	gnome
and i know there s qt and other managers like kde etc
i noticed the same thing so it probably isn t gtk or gnome alone you basically just answered your own question - mac os x has one desktop environment centered around cocoa which has a lot of very good programmers and designers spending much time designing discussing and implementing it

203910
put	get
put an nscell in a control in the middle of a window and make yourself ui for tweaking the parameters you re interested in
bindings can make this pretty straightforward for positioning stuff bind an x value to a slider though you will not get direct manipulation of the elements of course

204203
3des	aes	rsa	aes
windows xp rsa with rc4 128 md5 rsa with rc4 128 sha rsa with 3des cbc sha ..
you can also modify the list of cipher suites by configuring the ssl cipher suite order group policy settings using the group policy object snap-in in microsoft management console windows vista but the issue is that windows xp doesn t include aes in the list of ciphers available for sslstream

205626
accessor	properties
it s much easier to debug a problem involving a field if it is wrapped by a properties accessor
placing breakpoints in the accessor can quite quickly help with finding re-entrancy and other issues that otherwise might not be caught

205884
google-chrome	safari
webkit safari google-chrome etc now appears to support onerror
original post as far as i know webkit safari does not support the onerror event

206153
queue	fifo
if you want to use queue you need to be able to determine order before the message goes in the queue not after it goes in
queue are for fifo order not random access order

206153
queue	fifo
queue are for fifo order not random access order
even though you are saying that you want fifo order you want fifo order with respect to a random set of variables which is essentially random order

206904
dreamweaver	aptana
unfortunately the best one i ve used as far as wysiwyg is dreamweaver and i don t like it that much either but it is a standard part of the toolset in many web shops and you just get used to it
i currently use aptana for that sort of prototyping which is not really wysiwyg but has a great preview function and i don t end up having to go back through crappy wysiwyg generated markup and cleaning it up later

207062
google-chrome	firefox
firefox also has the word google-chrome all over its code base
google google-chrome is an application not a window or a directx which you can create as a control

208569
ant	maven
this means that your project should not rely on any ide-specific files to build but rather use an external build system like maven ant or even make or custom scripts
maven is supported by most popular java ides either directly or via plug-ins

208728
ingres	oracle
where there is no mvcc mysql ingres it is a trick to get around locking problems that can slow performance or cause the locking system to run out of locks if not properly tuned
in the same way that you need to tune rollback undo in oracle you need to manage the locking system in non-mvcc databases

209569
profiling	instrumentation
assuming you want to profiling a whole app not just a snippet of code and that your app is written in c c++ objective-c not ruby and that you re using xcode 3.0 or higher you should also check out the instrumentation application
the sampler instrumentation will give you very similar information to shark though without shark s sometimes very helpful tips on improving performance

209945
ws-addressing	soap
has several protocols and technologies relating to it wsdl xsds soap ws-addressing representational state transfer rest rest need not be over http but most of my points below will have an http bias
rest is very lightweight it says wait a minute we don t need all of this complexity that soap created

210081
tabcontrol	tabitem
note that the visibility of our tabitem will not be affected while that tabcontrol is in view so we can apply styles only when the tabcontrol visibility changes
private void breadcrumb_isvisiblechanged object sender dependencypropertychangedeventargs e if bool e.newvalue if sender is tabcontrol tabcontrol tabcontrol tabcontrol sender

210235
xsl-fo	xslt
from wiki the general idea behind xsl-fo s use is that the user writes a document not in fo but in an xml language. xhtml docbook and tei are all possibilities but it could be any xml language
then the user obtains an xslt transform either by writing one themselves or by finding one for the document type in question

210652
opera	firefox
you cannot do that in all browsers supposedly ie does allow it but mozilla and opera do not
when you compose a message in gmail the attach files feature is implemented one way for ie and any browser that supports this and then implemented another way for firefox and those browsers that do not

210667
hex	binary
offset 0 two bytes jpeg soi marker ffd8 hex offset 2 two bytes image width in pixels offset 4 two bytes image height in pixels offset 6 byte number of components 1 grayscale 3 rgb there are a couple other things after that but those aren t important
you can open the file using a binary stream and read this initial data and make sure that offset 0 is 0 and offset 6 is either 1 2 or 3

210693
prepare	execute
parameters are not combined with a prepare statement on the client-side so pdo should never have access to the query string combined with its parameters
the sql statement is sent to the database server when you do prepare and the parameters are sent separately when you do execute

210693
prepare	execute
this is not a true prepare query
you will circumvent the benefits of prepare queries by interpolating variables into the sql string before execute

210850
np-hard	np-complete
np-hard np-complete is a way of showing that certain classes of problems are not solvable in realistic time
edit as others have noted there are often approximation solutions for np-complete problems

210997
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
the comparison is performed by looking for a case-sensitive match first
if this match is not found a subsequent search is occurs for a case-insensitive match

211047
public	protected
classes which have public members but which are not intended for external consumption are prominently marked in the class javadoc
i also document every protected method in every api class though to a lesser extent

211060
public	protected
classes which have public members but which are not intended for external consumption are prominently marked in the class javadoc
i also document every protected method in every api class though to a lesser extent

211327
int	chars
short byte or chars values may also be used as index values because they are subjected to unary numeric promotion and become int values. an attempt to access an array component with a long index value results in a compile-time error
i could not find the type of the length attribute but it is at least an int

211671
post	get
from webservice returns xml even when responseformat set to json make sure that the request is a post request not a get
scott guthrie has a post explaining why

212488
factors	mean
it depends on your os cpu compiler and possibly other factors
in general it means the cpu bus could not complete a command or suffered a conflict but that could mean a whole range of things depending on the environment and code being run

212589
hash	salt
jeff atwood has an excellent 2012 update too lengthy to repeat in its entirety here which states this using salt hash will provide the illusion of security more than any actual security
since you need both the salt and the choice of hash algorithm to generate the hash and to check the hash it s unlikely an attacker would have one but not the other

212589
hash	salt
since you need both the salt and the choice of hash algorithm to generate the hash and to check the hash it s unlikely an attacker would have one but not the other
if you ve been compromised to the point that an attacker has your password database it s reasonable to assume they either have or can get your secret hidden salt

212944
geocoding	geocode
most of the services also restrict the number of geocoding queries you can make per day so it s ok to look up addresses of say new customers who get added to your database but if you run a batch job that feeds thousands of addresses from your database into the geocode you re going to get shutoff
i don t think this one has been mentioned yet but esri has arcweb web services that include geocoding although they aren t very cheap

214689
versioning	upgrade
yes it does mean that the windows createprocess and loadlibrary apis on windows nt before 2000 and all of windows 95 98 and me will not load a dll or exe file made by vs9 because the pe header in the file has the required os versioning field set to 5
the error message upon attempting to load a vs9 generated exe file will be a very unfriendly modal error dialog actually say you need to upgrade your operating system to run this program

214710
superclass	subclassing
the superclass doesn t know about any of its subclassing
so here you could use the runtime method objc_getclasslist along with objc_getsuperclass to find the classes that are subclassing of mlabstractdatapacket

214911
put	get
you need to put an event on each a link and then you will get all the information about the specific click
this will work only in the some document so if you try to do a test between the link inside an iframe and a link in your page you will not get an event for the iframe link

215288
daemons	systemd
the port was fairly easy and one benefit was it s very easy to create a gui using pylons so i was able to throw a status page on top of what s basically a daemons process
i would summarize pylons this way it s similar to ruby on rails in that it aims to be very easy to deploy web apps it s default templating language mako is very nice to work with it uses a systemd of routing urls that s very convenient for us performance is not an issue so i can t guarantee that pylons would perform adequately for your needs you can use it with apache lighthttpd though i ve not tried this we also run an app with twisted and are happy with it

215323
processors	hyperthreading
each processors or processors core can do exactly 1 thing at a time
with hyperthreading things get a little different but for the most part that still remains true which is why my ht machine at work almost never goes above 50 and even when it s at 100 it s not processing twice as much at once

215473
opera	firefox
even if you test with mozilla firefox opera and konqueror from kde 4 on windows you re not even close to covering most of the userbase
that being said if you narrow your focus to browsers with support for modern css you ll find that there s only a few underlying engines trident ie gecko mozilla webkit apple khtml kde and presto opera

215746
google-chrome	firefox
camino contains native svg support as per its own documentation google-chrome uses an old version of web kit to support svg natively konqueror has svg support via a plugin ksvg2 from 2007 a here is a list of the state of svg support in many browsers
opera has native svg support firefox has native svg support internet explorer does not include svg support natively

215746
opera	safari	firefox	safari
opera has native svg support firefox has native svg support internet explorer does not include svg support natively
safari has native svg support for images and fonts since version 3.1

215749
svg	vml
ie has svg support in ie9 but not in ie8 and below
the alternative is vml mozilla claims to support it on its latest version opera claims to support it since v8.0 safari has experimental support probably incomplete chrome seems to have roughly the same level of svg support as safari konqueror uses the same svg engine as safari and chrome - ksvg claims to be in beta

216108
serializable	deserialization
xml serializable is a little easier than returning an xelement because all you have to do is mark properties with attributes and the serializable does all the xml generation for you
plus you get deserialization for free assuming you have a parameterless constructor and well a bunch of other things. on the other hand a you have to create an xmlserializer to do it b dealing with collection properties isn t quite the no-brainer you might like it to be and c xml serializable is pretty dumb

216270
websphere	ibm
you might like to take a look at ibm s websphere service registry and repository
it does what you describe with governance abilities as well and integrates nicely with ibm s esb products although it not one itself

216519
dbal	mdb2
in the end it s up to you so even though i wouldn t do it and it sure is not impossible the question remains if you can actually save time and resources in the long run by implementing your own dbal
i d recommend class-based sql building and recommend doctrine zend_db or mdb2

217119
client-side	server-side
i often suggest this include it when needed approach because simulating mvc client-side means exactly what you said it means -- you have two mvc frameworks now to maintain
not only that -- with most client-side models they have direct access to your server-side model which defeats the purpose of your server-side mvc

217361
dictionary	map
can you use dictionary string string instead of namevaluecollection
since dictionary t t implements ienumerable you could use linq as so edit actually you may be able to use dictionary directly as if it doesn t map key value the way you want you can always go back to linq

217708
config	ini
being php parseing it is nearly eg the file needs to be opened closed etc as fast as having the code at the top of each script and much faster than ini and xml config solutions centralised location for the sites config on each server so easy to keep upto date server doesn t change that oftern updateing the config is simple with an update script
can be generated by the script all my sites have a function that rebuilds the config file useing the config assoc array

217993
bitconverter	binaryreader
the bitconverter class has an islittleendian field to tell you how it will behave but it doesn t give the choice
the same goes for binaryreader binarywriter

218131
folder	directory
you can t directly ignore folder on a checkout but you can use sparse checkouts in svn 1.5
for example this will check files and directory from your project trunk into my_checkout but not recurse into those directory

218544
unix	aix
linux isn t unix stupid open group and most real unix boxes don t have anywhere close to the software that linux does
as an example on a fairly plain aix 5.3pl6 install less ksh less not found. and yes i admin these systems but we ve agreed to not load non-core components in most cases since we need them to match the deployed systems in the field

218773
mouse	keyboard
if i look at the official document object model events document mouse events fields are defined as read-only
keyboard events are not defined there i suppose mozilla followed this policy for them

219072
sharepoint	spsite
i cannot emphasize enough that proper early planning is essential for a successful sharepoint implementation
my additional best bets are use x64 to allow more ram on your server make the best use of your application pool recycling make sure all custom code properly disposes spweb and spsite objects using this utilize ms capacity planning tool plan your site collection and database sizes

219311
postgresql	mysql
database considerations for your database server you will want something that is fast microsoft sql server ibm s db2 postgresql or oracle
mysql might be useful too but i have not experience with large databases with it

219490
sqldatasource	objectdatasource
my understanding is that with sqldatasource connection management is performed for you and you have nothing to fear
objectdatasource doesn t talk to the database directly in the first place so it will be safe -- as long as the underlying object performs its connection and reader management correctly

219729
cairngorm	flex
if you re already using an mvc framework like cairngorm or puremvc flexunit should integrate pretty painlessly
i will say however that my experience with flash flex unit testing is not nearly as positive as it has been with other languages such as ruby or .net for three reasons

219835
accessor	properties
compare to the same for properties vs fields since properties before the same function as events encapsulation via accessor also - events do not mention anything about fields
they only define the accessor add remove

220089
jboss	glassfish
books and other 3rd party products are available for jboss but not for glassfish
if something is mission critical and you need to get it up and running right now you will not go wrong going with jboss

220089
jboss	glassfish
if something is mission critical and you need to get it up and running right now you will not go wrong going with jboss
however if you have some time in the long run glassfish will not hurt you

220164
xslt	xquery
i think i heard all those limitations were adressed in the xslt 2.0 specification sadly ms decided not to implement it and promote xquery instead
i think that xslt would still have a good chance of becoming as popular as css became for html

220563
cvs	svn
cvs - svn import is pretty shaky really it s a one-off thing probably not that many individual people work on it enough to really care about making it perfect
going from another scm system to cvs and then to svn sounds like a recipe for useless history data and frustration

220594
free	realloc
consequently realloc has probably free the original memory and then you pass it the same pointer again and it complains that you re freeing the same memory twice because you pass the original value to it again
this not only leaks memory but means that you are continuing to use the original space -- and john downey s shot in the dark points out that you are misusing realloc but doesn t emphasize how severely you are doing so

220801
icmp	tcp
the webserver can choose to ignore it and not respond instead of responding with an icmp response
the web brower uses http which means it opens a tcp connection on port 80 by using a syn synack ack exchange

221601
post	get
without knowing exactly what you re trying to accomplish here s what i would suggest attach an event handler to the form s submit option or use the standard submit if you re not going to use ajax bundle up any parameters that will need to be passed to the php function either in a post or in the query string of the address to the page
fire the request either asynchronously or via submit in the php script that is the target of the request pull out of the parameters from the _ post or _ get

221639
free	malloc
after all not just gc is not deterministic free is as little deterministic as malloc is
nobody says that a free call just has to mark the memory as free

221639
free	malloc
nobody says that a free call just has to mark the memory as free
it might as well try to combine smaller free memory blocks surrounding the free d one to a big one and this behavior is not deterministic nor is the runtime for it sometimes free won t do that and malloc will do that instead on next allocation but nowhere is written that free mustn t do that

221639
free	malloc
it might as well try to combine smaller free memory blocks surrounding the free d one to a big one and this behavior is not deterministic nor is the runtime for it sometimes free won t do that and malloc will do that instead on next allocation but nowhere is written that free mustn t do that
in a critical realtime system you might even replace the system standard malloc free with a different implementation maybe even writing your own one it s not as hard as it sounds

221639
free	malloc
the only non deterministic part about is that you won t know if calling release will just decrease the ref counter or really free the object depending if the ref count goes to zero or not but you could delay the actual free by offering a function to say releasewithoutfreeing which decreases the ref counter by one but even if it reaches zero it won t free the object yet
your malloc free implementation can have a function finddeadobjects that searches for all objects with a retain counter of zero that have not yet been released and free them at a later point when you are in a less critical part of your code that has more time for such kind of tasks

221953
mathml	tex
also mozilla mathml page contains links to a tex- mathml translator and a possibly dead javascript mathml editor
likely not what you wanted to hear but after trying mathml i went back to tex as it s far more readable and compact than the xml representation

221953
mathml	tex
likely not what you wanted to hear but after trying mathml i went back to tex as it s far more readable and compact than the xml representation
tex also has a large user base and a number of stable open wysiwyg editors

221985
folder	directory
with ganymede 3.4 the correct way to manage your plugins would be to drop them in the dropins folder that plugin will be detected by the p2 provisioning mechanism and used but not copied in the plugins and features directory of eclipse
it stays in the dropins folder

222183
migrate	upgrade
if you want use this wizard to upgrade the back-end to sql express then manually migrate to another db platform
hope this is not too far off-topic but sometimes all you need to do with access is upgrade the back-end as we ve already discussed always make sure the front-ends are locked down read-only if necessary create different front-ends for different user roles as a form of security

223288
client-side	server-side
this solution isn t as responsive as pure client-side validation needs time to send receive data between client and server but is quite simple and you don t need to translate validation rules to javascript
to keep validation rules in one place i use only server-side validation

223570

accessor	properties
if you pattern all of your code appropriately there are sets of rules that guarantee that using an accessor in init dealloc is safe
the big issue is that as mmalc said the code the sets up the properties default state should not go through an accessor because it leads to all sorts of nasty issues

227555
accessor	properties
the big issue is that as mmalc said the code the sets up the properties default state should not go through an accessor because it leads to all sorts of nasty issues
the catch is that there is no reason init has to setup the default state of a properties

227555
accessor	properties
for a number of reasons i have been moving to accessor that self initialize like the simple example below this style of properties initialization allows one to defer a lot of init code that may not actually be necessary
in the above case init is not responsible for initing the properties state and it is completely safe even necessary for one to use the accessor in the init method

objectdatasource	formview
in some cases usually when an objectdatasource is involved i ve had to override the values set by the formview control by doing something like this it s not pretty but it give you absolute control over what gets passed to the datasource
generally you should not have to do this if the controls in your formview are all bound using bind for two-way databinding instead of eval but at the very least you could put a break point in itemupdating and open up the e.keys e.oldvalues and e.newvalues collections to see if the contents are what you expected

ddhidlib is neat and in fact i rewrote parts of it for delicious library 2 for leopard s newer hid apis and submitted the changes back to the original author -- if you write him you can get the leopard-only sample code
unfortunately the new leopard hid apis have the ability to peak at keyboard events as they pass by but not to intercept them so you can t build your own application-level device handler unless it s ok that the key events are also going to the appkit as well

int	chars
the overhead is due to including a chars object reference and three int an offset a length and space for storing the string s hashcode plus the standard overhead of simply being an object
slightly different from string.intern or a chars array used by string.substring is using a single chars for all strings this means you do not need to store the object reference in your wrapper string-like object

232602
ienumerator	idisposable
ienumerator t does inherit idisposable however whereas the non-generic ienumerator doesn t
even when you use foreach for a non-generic ienumerable which returns ienumerator the compiler will still generate a check for idisposable and call dispose if the enumerator implements the interface

232616
ienumerator	idisposable
with c# 1.2 introduced in vs2003 - there s no 1.1 bizarrely foreach began to check in the finally block whether or not the iterator implements idisposable - they had to do it that way because retrospectively making ienumerator extends idisposable would have broken everyone s implementation of ienumerator
if they d worked out that it s useful for foreach to dispose of iterators in the first place i m sure ienumerator would have extended idisposable

232666
ienumerable	iqueryable
a jagged array is an array of arrays and is declared like so versus a rectangular array being defined as a single array that holds multiple dimensions because of this a jagged array is iqueryable ienumerable because you can iterate over it to receive an array at each iteration
whereas a rectangular array is not iqueryable ienumerable because elements are addressed in full dimension 0 0 0 1..etc so you won t have the ability to use linq or any predefined functions created for array in that case

mouse	keyboard
edit after peeking at the kernel source actually patch history it looks like linux at least gathers entropy from keyboard presses mouse activity interrupt timing but not all interrupts and block device request finishing times
on a virtualized system i suspect that mouse keyboard events would be pretty low and thus not contribute to the entropy gathered

snmp isn t bad but it may not be able to do everything you need it to do

nemerle	boo
a key factor for linq is the ability of the compiler to generate expression trees. i am using a macro in nemerle that converts a given nemerle expression into an expression tree object. i can then pass this to the where select etc extension methods on iqueryables. it s not quite the syntax of c# and vb but it s close enough for me
i got the nemerle macro via a link on this post it should be possible to create a similar macro for boo

235760
inline	inlining
however in many cases that s just not possible and therefore it becomes impossible to inline
early versions of javascript did not allow named function expressions and because of that we could not make a recursive function expression to get around this arguments.callee was added so we could do however this was actually a really bad solution as this in conjunction with other arguments callee and caller issues make inlining and tail recursion impossible in the general case you can achieve it in select cases through tracing etc but even the best code is sub optimal due to checks that would not otherwise be necessary

236111
free	malloc
on linux with glibc the memory is actually always returned to the os above a certain size glibc malloc uses mmap for big allocations controlled by mmap_threshold and in that case free calls munmap which frees automatically the reserved memory
below that threshold it uses brk and free does not return the memory in that case

236112
free	malloc
but since you ask specifically about malloc lets see what the c standard says the free function causes the space pointed to by ptr to be deallocated that is made available for further allocation. which seems a pretty clear requirement that the memory is not returned to the os
you occasionally see programs relying on this behaviour however when this question has come up on comp.lang.c some posters have pointed out this section the malloc function returns either a null pointer or a pointer to the allocated space. this suggests that any call to malloc may fail

onchange	onkeyup	onchange	onkeydown
in general for text inputs you want to use onkeypress onkeyup onkeydown events not onchange for this type of autocomplete

237298
try-catch	exception-handling

2 have the catches within each method catch only the exception-handling you know about

237495
disk	ram
this means that one of your stream reads could result in multiple disk block reads - but those reads will always use a full block - no wasted reads
now this is offset quite a bit in a typical streaming scenario because the block that is read from disk is going to still be in memory when you hit the next read we are doing sequential reads here after all - so you wind up paying the ram - l3 l2 cache latency price on the next read but not the disk- ram latency

in terms of order of magnitude disk- ram latency is so slow that it pretty much swamps any other latency you might be dealing with

setlocale	strftime
you should definitely use the datetime class or any home grew equivalent class over de date function and not use timestamps timestamp don t work well in all environments for dates before 1970 - if you deal with birthdays you re relying on code that may break on some servers be also very carefull of the use of strftime it looks like a nice function but it is very unrelyable as it depends on setlocale which is process-wide
what this means is that if your server is a windows box you have one process per processor and then the rest is multi-threaded - in other words one setlocale in one script will affect the other scripts on the same processor - very nasty

238564
versioning	upgrade
imagine you have an application that needs versioning 1 of libfoo but another application requires versioning 2
if you install everything into usr lib python2.4 site-packages or whatever your platform s standard location is it s easy to end up in a situation where you unintentionally upgrade an application that shouldn t be upgrade

238767
post	put	post	get
my preference would be that the username password only be accepted via post so that it doesn t appear in the url at all but you could conceivably encrypt and encode the password so that it could be put in a get request
i can t envision any reason why i would do this instead of a post

239095
submit	submission
an alternative to the above form submit options would be to add an event listener for the input form to detect if the user pressed enter
it s because it s not a form submission so there s no event to be triggered when the user presses enter

239137
inherited	subclassing
an abstract class is used when you have some base functionality that you want subclassing to inherited but it wouldn t make sense to instantiate the base class
for example if you had something like a shape base class you could have some built in implementation that could be used by subclassing as well as interface methods that you want the subclassing to implement

240272
post	put	put	get
in a word idempotency in a few more words get safe + idempotent put idempotent delete idempotent post neither safe or idempotent idempotent just means you can do it over and over again and it will always do exactly the same thing
you can reissue a put update or delete request as many times as you want and it will have the same effect every time however the desired effect will modify a resource so it is not considered safe

therefore post is not considered safe or idempotent
methods like get and head are just read operations and are therefore considered safe aswell as idempotent

hex	binary	octal	binary	octal	hex
octal is rarely if ever used you can tell someones age if they think octal instead of hex

multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
the problem is multiplying and divide which even today many processors do not support yes many have no fpu and only do add and subtract sometimes multiplying but divide is rare
multiplying and divide take a lot of electronics the trade off is you can do them with adds and subtract in software

241908
multiplying	subtract
multiplying and divide take a lot of electronics the trade off is you can do them with adds and subtract in software
take the worst case multiplying for a four bit system 1111 1111 11100001 so it takes 8 bits to store the result of a 4 bit multiplying you will quickly find that if you had a 4 bit system most of the multiplies you want to do will result a number that cannot be stored in 4 bits

241908
put	get
so when i saw you taking 64 bit integers the unsigned long long is often 64 bits and multiplying four times that means you need 64 5 or a 320 bit integer to store your answer you were trying to put that answer in a 64 big result which quite often depending on the compiler and computer will happily do and will truncate the upper bits leaving you with the lower 64 bits of the result which can easily look smaller than any of your operands which is what i had thought you might have done at first
floating point is not much more than scientific notation but in binary if you wanted to multiply the number 1234 and 5678 using scientific notation you would take 1.234 10 3 times 5.678 10 3 and get 7.007 10 6

innodb	myisam
the other major thing to watch out for is that innodb does not support fulltext indices nor insert delayed

242953
cpu	processors
if your app is running on a 64 bit cpu then probably not much difference at all
on a 32 bit cpu a 64 bit integer will be more processors intensive to perfom calculations with

243772
octal	decimal
there s a direct mapping between hex or octal for that matter digits and the underlying bit patterns which is not the case with decimal
a decimal 9 represents something different with respect to bit patterns depending on what column it is in and what numbers surround it - it doesn t have a direct relationship to a bit pattern

244217
free	malloc
one example would be a big application where you need to allocate memory in one module say in library1.dll and free that memory in the main module say program.exe
this can be done safely if you are using heapalloc heapresize and heapfree functions but cannot be done using c runtime library eg malloc free resize

put	get
usability notes personally i hate when sites put the forgot password or forgot username or help links inbetween the password field and the login button
as a keyboard user i shouldn t have to tab over them to get to the submit button

245264
apache	lighttpd
not to mention the multiprocess nature of apache tends to eat up more ram as each process grows to the size of it s most intensive request
lighttpd with fastcgi will be nominally faster but really the time it takes to run your python code and any database hits it does is going to absolutely dwarf any performance benefit you get between web servers

int	boolean	int	chars	int	double
in java for example there are primitive types int bool double chars that aren t proper objects

245323
cvs	svn
that being said i think svn is better in every other respect and you probably shouldn t start a new project with cvs
call me old fashioned but i much preferred the branching tagging model under cvs

245335
hex	binary
some subsidiary problems your strings were hex but you needed a x per character to actually get that hex byte at that position in the string which i suspect was what you wanted
you were trying to hash 40 bytes from data which wasn t that long actual effect you d end up partly hashing your result string your expected result was as far as i can tell incorrect you would print out random characters to the terminal since the hmac function will produce 32 bytes of random binary data not printable stuff

245361
ienumerable	iqueryable
basically you should usually not have to care one way or the other if it is an iqueryable or an ienumerable
iqueryable implements ienumerable so right off the bat with iqueryable you can do everything that you can do with ienumerable

245546
cvs	svn
subversion has some substantial wins over cvs good remote options http https svn vs pserver atomic commits ubiquitous tool support rename directory versioning however it has serious shortcomings
the biggest by far is that branches and tags are not first class citizens in svn they are just directories that adhere to a convention

245867
filesystems	ntfs
if the filesystems is case preserving but insensitive mercurial will treat names that differ only in case as the same
saying it s a file on disk that hg isn t tracking to better see mercurial not caring about case on ntfs try these steps hg init echo line foo hg add foo hg commit -m committed foo move foo not-foo move not-foo foo hg status and you should see hg saying that nothing has changed because the only thing that has changed is the case which hg is ignoring for you

post	put
regarding postal addresses the most important suggestion i have is to ensure that you can accept non-numeric post zip codes otherwise you won t be able to handle addresses in canada and the uk and possibly other places
this is a bit of a hobby horse of mine as i ve had a few issues with websites in other countries that simply refused to let me put in a non-numeric post code and i had to resort to faxing over my address information as i couldn t fill in the online application form

246649
vb.net	vb6
imho i would suggest not moving to vb.net at all but instead utilizing your c background and making the move to c#
the reason for this is you already know the syntax and that vb.net is not enough like vb6 to make it as easy a move as you might expect

247056
dependency-injection	factories
if you are using a dependency-injection framework then the common way to handle this is to either pass in a permissionsmanager object in the constructor or to have a property of type permissionsmanager that the framework sets for you
if this is not feasible then having users get an instance of this class via factories is a good choice

247940
integer	unsigned
you can overflow a signed integer and in theory though not in practice on current mainstream systems the overflow could trigger a fault perhaps similar to a divide by zero fault

installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade

sudo	passwd
i would not run the application full time as root but you might want to explore making your application setuid root or setuid to some id that can become root using something like sudo for particular applications
you might be able to set up an account that cannot login use setuid to change your program s id temporarily when needed and have sudo set up to not prompt for passwd but always allow access to that account for specific tasks

248757
sudo	passwd
you might be able to set up an account that cannot login use setuid to change your program s id temporarily when needed and have sudo set up to not prompt for passwd but always allow access to that account for specific tasks

edit stolen from kyoryu s comment brought up to the post because it s really a perfect summary of what i was saying and could be missed in the comments

252122
versioning	upgrade
support of multiple server versioning means design and implementation of multiple versioning of parsers and related infra in parallel. this multiplies time and cost to develop test and support
at the same time the core module is an important product base that enables not only intellisense feature but also other products including upgrade advisor to analyze scripts

252867
typedef	struct
gtk+ aside i m not sure the tagname is used anything like as commonly as a typedef to the struct type so in c++ that is recognised and you can omit the struct keyword and use the tagname as the type name too
the name you optionally give the struct is called the tag name and as has been noted is not a type in itself

253703
hash	salt
edit to help defeat rainbow attacks -- where the attacker has retrieved your hash passwords and finds suitable matches that hash to the same values -- consider both using a random salt unique to each user s hash password and a fixed salt that is part of the algorithm not the data
for example this should invalidate the rainbow tables since even knowing the user s salt and the hash algorithm the values in the attacker s rainbow tables won t map onto your hash passwords because of the addition of the fixed salt in the algorithm

expander	togglebutton
you not only have to retemplate the expander .
you need to retemplate the togglebutton within the expander s template .

254250
union	distinct
you must write them as the names of union and enumerations are also tags rather than types
in c tags are distinct from all other names for functions types variables and enumeration constants . c compilers maintain tags in a symbol table that s conceptually if not physically separate from the table that holds all other names

254250
typedef	struct
many programmers including yours truly prefer to think of struct names as type names so they define an alias for the tag using a typedef
for example defining lets you use s in place of struct s as in a program cannot use s as the name of both a type and a variable or function or enumeration constant s s

254250
typedef	struct
many programmers fold the struct definition into the typedef and dispense with the tag altogether as in the linked article also has a discussion about how the c++ behavior of not requireing a typedef can cause subtle name hiding problems
to prevent these problems it s a good idea to typedef your classes and struct in c++ too even though at first glance it appears to be unnecessary

254316
range	max	range	min
the grouped selected of isn t going to change drastically over the course of a day in comparison with the range of data its covers presumably many years so one option would be to create a summary table based on the data in the main table.
select index min date as mindate max date as maxdate into mysummarytable from myoriginaltable group by index this table could be dropped and recreated on a semi-regular daily base via a sql job. equally i d stick an index on the id column of it

if you think what you are doing will be a marked improvement to the kohana project you should make your changes and submit a patch to be considered by the project s maintainers

for-loop	loops
you are probably best placed doing a reverse for-loop i didn t test this code just an example

skip-lists	tree
... a skip-lists upon which we have not recently performed any such θ n operations does not provide the same absolute worst-case performance guarantees as more traditional balanced tree data structures because it is always possible though with very low probability that the coin-flips used to build the skip-lists will produce a badly balanced structure edit so it s a trade-off skip lists use less memory at the risk that they might degenerate into an unbalanced tree
from the wikipedia article you quoted θ n operations which force us to visit every node in ascending order such as printing the entire list provide the opportunity to perform a behind-the-scenes derandomization of the level structure of the skip-list in an optimal way bringing the skip-lists to o log n search time

filesystems	btrfs	filesystems	xfs	xfs	btrfs
most linux systems also have fallocate which only works on certain filesystems such as btrfs ext4 ocfs2 and xfs but is the fastest as it allocates all the file space creates non-holey files but does not initialize any of it
linux all filesystems xfs_mkfile 10240m 10gigfile linux and some filesystems ext4 xfs btrfs and ocfs2 fallocate -l 10g 10gigfile os x solaris sunos and probably other unixes mkfile 10240m 10gigfile hp-ux prealloc 10gigfile 10737418240 explanation try myfile as an alternative of dd

257952
vsts	tfs
see also vsts 2008 test edition home btw there s a link to a trial vpc w tfs vsts suite on the right-hand side visual studio 2008 training kit - not a lot on vsts in here but there are a few demos and resources that touch on the test features and it s a good general resource to have anyway
videos for team system asp.net s learn section video tutorials at teamsystemrocks.com plenty of videos between those sites on the various vsts test edition features

257953
width	height
safari will expand up to a width of 800px unless the width is already greater than 800 in which case it maintains that width and only modifies the window height
of course if there aren t any hard width values then the design is a liquid layout so the concern about designing for a particular width is somewhat altered

258209
cbutton	cdialog
assuming this functionality is present in 6.0 - i use 2003 now and cannot remember if this used to be present in 6.0 add cbutton variable if you want to dynamically change the buttons visibility during load add a variable for your button using the mfc class wizard
you are lucky to have this - this wizard seems to have been removed from visual studio .net override cdialog initdialog next override the initdialog function of your dialog box and then once the base initdialog function has been successfully called set the buttons showwindow property to sw_hide before showing the dialog box

258460
folder	directory
iirc the aliased folder does not need to be within the webroot
if you are using apache as the server you can set it to alias a directory in httpd.conf.

258785
debian	centos
i don t know how well it s supported on debian
if it s not just install a centos 5.2 with selinux enabled in a vm

259083
multiplication	exponent
this takes advantage of the fact that if exp is even and will only require about log2 exp multiplication
is exp times it doesn t handle negative exponent though

259460
postgresql	mysql
you can do all your testing and development on sqlite so you don t need to have an instance of postgresql running on your dev machine
if you aren t sure if you want to use mysql or postgresql i suggest trying them both out

260336
disk	ram
again this is fairly quick in relation to the disk i o
however if there s not enough ram to store the hashtable sql server will use tempdb to store parts of the hashtable and the found rows and then process only parts of the hashtable at a time

260731
daemons	launchd
this will launchd the gconf daemons
if the d-bus environment vars are not set the daemons will not launchd

260779
public	protected
since the abstract type seems to indicate that technically a public constructor will act very much protected this is not correct
an abstract class cannot be directly instatiated by calling its constructor however any concrete implementation will inherit the abstract class methods and visibility so the abstract class can certainly have public constructors

260932
realloc	malloc
if you want to dynamically resize the array in order to keep a low memory footprint for your program it may be better to not do too many realloc s
if you want to dynamically allocate arrays you can use malloc from stdlib.h

260976
cpu	processors
if you want to display what cpu portion the thread has recently consumed sample getthreadtimes every second then compute usedtimenow - usedtimeprevious now - previous numberofcpus if you sample every second now-previous would roughly be 1 but you should record the time of sampling anyway - the system might not make you sleep exactly 1s between samples
your main thread may execute at different cpus at different times so information specific to the processors on which my main thread is executing might be meaningless - it might well be all processors

260976
cpu	affinity
windows doesn t keep track how much time a thread executed on what cpu so you can t ask give me a list of execution times for this thread per cpu
the only exception is when you set a thread affinity mask to a single cpu - then you can be certain that if the thread executes at all it runs on that single cpu

261159
subclass	abstract-class
you would define a constructor in an abstract-class if you are in one of these situations you want to perform some initialization to fields of the abstract-class before the instantiation of a subclass actually takes place you have defined final fields in the abstract-class but you did not initialize them in the declaration itself
define all your constructors protected making them public is pointless anyway your subclass constructor s can call one constructor of the abstract-class

261179
grouplayout	miglayout
although this is not a true answer to your question you may as well look at alternative solutions in terms of layout management matisse and grouplayout are neither the only way nor the best one to define your gui forms
i would suggest you take a look at miglayout very powerful and quite simple and designgridlayout quite powerful and very simple both are open source and have a friendly license not gpl . a quick search on google will give you the links immediately

261277
boost	stl
i recommend nicola bonelli s answer to be accepted. that s part of the stl and doesn t require using boost if your code doesn t use boost thanks to the commenters for pointing this out
boost has a utility called next and its inverse prior for just that purpose

261498
nlb	iis
using transportwithmessagecredential security wcf refuses inbound http connections - so we had to set up the nlb to re-encrypt between the nlb and the server node - but not a biggie
the only other issue we had was with hosting wcf inside iis and wcf not being able to correctly identify the intended site although iis was fine over http but fine over https

262997
post	get
if you think about your typical http transaction from the client side you can see the limitation as well as you can see you can only use one method post get etc... however due to the nature of how various languages operate they may pick up the query string and assign it to the get variable
ultimately though this is a post request and not a get

263063
post	get
in order to determine whether you can post a search part to a specific service you need to study this service s protocol specification
if the service is practically defined by means of a html form then you cannot use a mix - you can t even use post if the form specifies get and vice versa

263063
post	get
if the service is practically defined by means of a html form then you cannot use a mix - you can t even use post if the form specifies get and vice versa
if you post to a web service you need to look at the web service s wsdl - which will typically mandate post

263482
range	median
you might do this by simply counting the number of pixel within a colour range or you could perform region growing around pixel to calculate the size of the areas the colour
edit for dealing with grainy images you might want to perform a median filter on the image first and then reduce the number of colours to segment the image first you will have to play around with the settings on a large set of pre-classifed adult or not images and see how the values behave to get a satisfactory level of detection

263791
folder	directory
in this case the export directory doesn t need to be in the www folder at all
you can do an svn export into your www directory

263797
gridview	objectdatasource
the old gridview instance and the data table you bound to have been thrown away
when you are using an objectdatasource or any other datasource you set the datasourceid for your gridview not the datasource

263797
gridview	objectdatasource
when you are using an objectdatasource or any other datasource you set the datasourceid for your gridview not the datasource
the datasourceid should be whatever the id of your objectdatasource is

264473
innodb	myisam
very limited concurrency i think it s either one writer or multiple readers per database file mysql far more features choice of engines innodb provides good features for many workloads much more control of storage backup restore etc network-capable - which allows its use in large scale applications better concurrency - the innodb engine has mvcc which means that readers do not block writers nor do writers block readers
even the old myisam engine has table-level locking rather than for the whole database as sqlite

264518
cpu	processors
the way you normally do this is your cpu will implement some sort of idle or sleep instructions that will cause it to temporarily stop processing commands
an external interrupt line connected to a timer circuit will wake the processors back up at regular intervals and which point the cpu checks to see if it has been asleep for long enough and if not it goes back to sleep

264518
cpu	processors
an external interrupt line connected to a timer circuit will wake the processors back up at regular intervals and which point the cpu checks to see if it has been asleep for long enough and if not it goes back to sleep
the exact details vary from processors to processors

264581
cruisecontrol	teamcity
i ve some experience with using star team for continous integration - though using teamcity not cruisecontrol
in our case the regular connections from teamcity to starteam barely register as a blip on our performance monitoring

264770
ssl	https
some ssl accelerators will also have parameters allowing you to tune the time the session is cached
another impact to consider is that static content served over https will not be cached by proxies and this may reduce performance across multiple users accessing the site over the same proxy

265889
post	get
also it appears that real invented its own way of doing the same thing but the basic design is very similar - get for the downstream link post for the upstream with some magic cookie in this case the guid to tie the two together on the server
either way the post should get to the server and in your case it seems like it doesn t

266785
free	malloc
that said memory leaks are caused by those system calls that allocate memory by means of malloc and leave the application the responsability to free the memory once the returned data has used
in these cases the raii idiom is advisable in order to not forget to free the allocated memory -- see exception safety

266902
int	chars
int is intended to be the data size that is most efficient for the cpu to work with
hence things which do not have a specific size like chars are the same size as an int

266910
put	get
you can address this in a number of ways architecturally in order to funnel all changes through a central service so that they are not able to make inconsistencies but regardless of how much effort you are willing to put into that and creating a bottleneck or single point of failure may violate some other requirements you have you will not be able to rely on the database engine itself to enforce it with a guarantee like you can with a fk constraint
i often had to deal with this in cross-departmental database situations where things could get out of sync because disparate systems were not fully integrated yet or security concerns required them to have separate administrators

267099
g++	gcc
to add to what others have said g++ is the gnu c++ compiler
gcc is the gnu compiler collection not the gnu c compiler as many people assume

267197
hide	show
there is not necessarily a best way although one better approach is to use css class definitions when you want to hide something dynamically apply that class to the element
when you want to show it again remove it

267333
dictionary	map
in java the hashmap implements the map interface while the dictionary does not
that makes the dictionary obsolete according to the api docs

267469
free	strdup
you could use the macro preprocessor to redefine malloc and free to use the mem package ones but i recommend against it because it won t redirect library calls to malloc like what strdup does
here s a set of wrapper functions i used for years and still do when i dip into c to detect unfree d memory memory free d multiple times references to free d memory buffer overflows underflows and freeing memory that was not allocated

267976
folder	directory
this is not true in tomcat 6 and tomcat 7 any classes in the web apps lib and classes folder will be resolved before those in common and thus this will not break other apps which deploy all of their jars in the war 2
the problem therefore of deploying a shared library to that directory is that it breaks the architecture for individual applications being isolated from one-another

268287
inherited	subclassing
classes should either be designed for inherited or prohibit it
there is a cost to designing for inherited it can pin down your implementation you have to declare which methods are going to call which other methods in case a user overrides one but not the other it reveals your implementation rather than just the effects it means you have to think of more possibilities when designing things like equals are hard to design in an inherited tree it requires more documentation an immutable type which is subclassing may become mutable ick item 17 of effective java goes into more details on this - regardless of the fact that it s written in the context of java the advice applies to .net as well

269006
onenote	ms-office
when collecting a large amount of information especially if it s primarily some text tables or images prior to actual development or when brainstorming or just writing down thoughts i actually use microsoft onenote though i wouldn t install it just for that
but since it s included in ms-office which is installed on all computers at my company i go use it since i m quite comfortable with it

269117
swt	swing
i suggest to check these criteria swt is more simple to use than swing especially if this is your first ui swing is older and you can find more components if you also use jface you will find many powerful widgets that work out of the box where you would need a lot of additional configuration in swing
swing is available anywhere swt is not swt is developed actively you have the source and bugs are fixed quickly

269117
swt	swing
swing is available anywhere swt is not swt is developed actively you have the source and bugs are fixed quickly
swing hasn t been touched in years then there was suddenly a big update for java 6

269600
inherited	subclassing
basically i agree with other folks use inherited only if your derived class truly is the type you re extending not merely because it contains the same data
remember that inherited means the subclassing gains the methods as well as the data

270050
comparator	icomparer
i would think a combination of the two is the right choice as i would expect the compare method to return the comparison result not the comparator itself
...and as dana mentions there is an icomparer interface in .net that reflects this pattern

270409
put	get
you can put the userid and password into any biztalk binding that supports authentication including msmq
for security the password is not exported you just get a mask

270619
lisp	scheme
lisp has been mentioned but i think scheme in particular plt-scheme is in some respects as good a choice as ruby python perl php
it doesn t have as many good libraries as some of those which is a minus but most scheme have excellent ffi foreign function interface which makes it trivial to integrate external c code libraries

271143
int	chars
you should however not derive from that that int is at least 2 byte
theoretically chars int and long could all be 1 byte in which case char_bit must be at least 32

271187
range	minimum
for the most part the number of bytes and range of values is determined by the cpu s architecture not by c++
however c++ sets minimum requirements which litb explained properly and martin york only made a few mistakes with

272261
postgresql	greenplum
i m not sure off the top of my head if mysql does this but postgresql certainly does
iirc some of the variants greenplum i think also directly support bitmap indexes and there was some talk of incorporating it in the main db engine

273914
internationalization	translation
disclaimer i am not experienced in internationalization of software myself
i don t think this would be good in any case - just introduces too much coupling as long as you keep formatting sparse in the parts which need to be translation this could be okay

274440
ord	chr
added the previous part of the answer addresses the utf-8 encoding claim but ignores the rest of the question which says now i need to pass the string into a function that does this operation strdecryptedpassword + chr ord c - 3 - intcounter - 30 i get this error chr arg not in range 256
at which point chr is likely to complain

274654
inherited	properties
to design it out of the language classes that support inherited should be accessible by reference only not by value
the d programming language has this properties

274723
unix	solaris
there are about 1 100 standard function calls in all but many of those are part of the standard c library or are obviously not kernel facilities. today s unix has threads real-time signals asynchronous i o and new interprocess-communication features posix ipc none of which existed 20 years ago
the best i can find is a unix-linux-bsd cheat-sheets for various syscalls variations to be compared with the solaris syscalls

274738
getter	setter
i m not sure why it s a problem that exposing a dto type as a service would cause use of its getter setter to do a round trip
if the service is a remote service the returned dto is serialized anyway and your getter setter will get the copy of the values

274751
mouse	keyboard
mousegestures autohotkey script to enable mouse gestures across applications autoit as a general automation tool
besides many already mentioned tools i use clipx for multiple clipboard support in any program not only inside visual studio slickrun for quick command execution find and run robot for fast desktop start menu search or filesystem search with locate32 plugin autohotkey for keyboard remappings with my own keyboard mappings f4+f4 to close any window alt+alt to open find and run robot process list similar to alt+tab but with filters alt+1 send active window to half up screen useful for comparisons in one monitor alt+2 send active window to half down screen alt+0 switch active window to monitor 1-2 .

275156
inherited	properties
the difference in delphi 2009 is that it s published now. if you can live with only ignoring the errors and not making the properties work instead here is a possible solution then change the declarations of the forms in your project to inherited from tdelphi2009form this will work at runtime - the properties errors will be ignored
to make it work at design time too create a design-only package add designide.dcp to its requires clause and add the following unit to it install the package in delphi 2007 ide and properties errors for doublebuffered and parentdoublebuffered properties will be ignored automatically when opening your forms in the ide. the values of the properties will be lost when you save the form in delphi 2007 so you should initialize them in code instead

275993
post	get
it s this hook which post the wm_null message that triggers the checksynchronize
it just doesn t get that far in the console app

276151
ssl	https
------ previous answer ------------ ssl hosts must be tied to a unique ip address port combination thus you cannot use virtual hosting or at least it can only have one ssl host per ip address
this is due to the fact that https begins encryption before the host parameter is sent in http and thus it cannot determine which cipher to use from the hostname - all it has is the ip address

276255
inherited	properties
okay given the extra information - i believe the problem is that getproperty is going up the inherited change
if you change your call to getproperty to then prop will be null if the properties isn t overridden

276519
for-loop	loops	goto	break
increment ... which is somewhat ignoring continue and break for now equivalent to so your for-loop example is again ignoring continue and break equivalent to which acts as if it were again ignoring continue and break two extra details of the for-loop which were not in the simplified conversion to a while loops above if the condition is omitted it is always true resulting in an infinite loops unless a break goto or something else break loops
a continue acts as if it were a goto to a label just before the increment unlike a continue in the while loops which would skip the increment

276806
free	malloc
it s quite likely that free will not return pages to the operating system under the assumption that your program will malloc more memory later
i m not saying that free never returns memory to the operating system

277082
inherited	properties
or at least there isn t except for specialized architectures like the old system 38 or as 400 . what object oriented means was settled long ago as being three things abstract data types with inherited and polymorphism
the wikipedia article linked confuses the properties of oo with the benefits to some extent

277253
nunit	mstest
as a recommendation i suggest using vs2008 with nunit free and testdriven.net not free
it takes away all the pain allowing you to just write simple things like then just right-click on the class on the method on the project on the solution and use the test options that testdriven.net provides including if you have mstest test with - team coverage which runs your nunit tests with the mstest coverage tools including giving the colorization back into the ide to show which lines executed

277445
innodb	myisam
the main difference is that innodb supports transactions while myisam does not
there are numerous other differences however the common one s i am aware of are myisam has typically been considered faster at searching but recent innodb improvements are removing this difference and improving high concurrency workload performance innodb support transactions whilst myisam does not innodb supports referential integrity whilst myisam does not innodb handles indexes a bit differently storing the primary key as part of every index making indexes take up more room on the disk but also making a covering index more likely myisam does table level locking while innodb can do row level locking different memory buffer index settings are used in the mysql configuration files innodb is typically said to have better crash recovery as mentioned in another answer the data is store on disk differently

277445
innodb	myisam
there are numerous other differences however the common one s i am aware of are myisam has typically been considered faster at searching but recent innodb improvements are removing this difference and improving high concurrency workload performance innodb support transactions whilst myisam does not innodb supports referential integrity whilst myisam does not innodb handles indexes a bit differently storing the primary key as part of every index making indexes take up more room on the disk but also making a covering index more likely myisam does table level locking while innodb can do row level locking different memory buffer index settings are used in the mysql configuration files innodb is typically said to have better crash recovery as mentioned in another answer the data is store on disk differently
i believe innodb is configurable in this area and can have one file per table etc

277489
operands	scalar
in scalar context or if the left operands is not enclosed in parentheses it returns a string consisting of the left operands repeated the number of times specified by the right operands
in list context if the left operands is enclosed in parentheses or is a list formed by qw string it repeats the list

277499
superclass	subclassing
it s purpose is to call init on animal s superclass nsobject in this case and to do any generic initialization that might be necessary
finally the first line in animal s initanimal method is an assertion that the receiver is actually an animal and not some subclassing

277568
hex	binary
if the first four bytes are hex ff fe 00 00 the file is tentatively utf-32 le
if through the above checks you have determined a tentative encoding then check only for the corresponding encoding below to ensure that the file is not a binary file which happens to match a byte-order mark

278527
superclass	subclassing
i d rather not manage the extra objects floating around to assure that all superclass features are part of a subclassing object
i d rather have inherited to be sure that each subclassing is an instance of it s own class plus is an instance of all superclass too

278739
jboss	weblogic
i do not think jboss is bad in anyway it simply isn t as up-to-date
most of my experience is on weblogic but i have used jboss and glassfish

279137
implements	sealed
the property getter and setter of an explicitly implements interface property has an unusual attribute
it s isfinal property is true even when it is not a member of a sealed class

280505
public	protected
a better example would have been things like dbcommand etc which do this - but that is harder to show in a short example if we had used a public virtual method we wouldn t be able to override it and use new in the base-class as you aren t allowed to do both using the protected virtual approach any usage foo.clone bar.clone icloneable.clone all use the correct clonecore implementation for the concrete type
well not specific to mvc but this approach allows you to keep the core public api clean

280900
vbscript	vba
vbscript works quite well with the jet engine
however i do not see why you say it is not possible to export a query to a csv file from within access. sub transfercsv docmd.transfertext acexportdelim putnameofqueryhere c putpathand filenamehere.csv true end sub is the usual way in vba

281035
centos	linux	ubuntu	linux
i m considering a virtualization host and multiple client os ubuntu and centos being the top 2 candidates - that way once i get the client configured as i want it i can save it off for reloading as needed
doesn t get around the original setup issue but does limit the rebuild my linux box yet again problem

281391
width	margin
since you re not setting any width in your li s i suggest skipping the float and set display inline on your li s instead if you want them on a row
adjust with padding margin to get appropriate spacing between them and line-height to get correct behaviour for any eventual 2nd line

281421
swt	swing
right now i m either using swt or qt jambi
swing didn t evolve in the last say 10 years bugs aren t fixed the development has stopped in favor of javafx so you won t ever see any new features too

281688
cassini	iis
the xp version of iis has limitation that are not present in the server version that cassini side-steps
the only argument i know against is that there are a couple very rare edge cases where the cassini built-in server doesn t exactly mimic iis because you re using odd port numbers

281688
cassini	iis
the only argument i know against is that there are a couple very rare edge cases where the cassini built-in server doesn t exactly mimic iis because you re using odd port numbers
i doubt you ll ever run into them and using cassini as the primary dev environment does not preclude developers from also having access to iis on the machine

281688
cassini	iis
i doubt you ll ever run into them and using cassini as the primary dev environment does not preclude developers from also having access to iis on the machine
in fact my preferred setup is cassini first for most small work then deploy to my local iis for more in-depth testing before moving code back to the shared source repository

282421
emacs	aquamacs
not sure if you re totally married to using emacs from the terminal but another option is to use carbon emacs my favorite and aquamacs very mac-like
carbon emacs uses the command key for meta this is nice because you can do control-meta commands just by holding control and command down instead of first hitting escape then the control key sequence

282698
ssl	https
you re not going to be able to do what you re talking about simply because the postback which is what the login control uses is going to be whatever the page s security is ssl or non-ssl
your best bet in this scenario is to use an iframe which contains an https ssl page that just contains thelogin control

283248
strcpy	strncpy
i wouldn t recommend you to learn it the hard way - just develop a habit to check target buffer before strcpy and strcat
edit good suggestion from healthcarel - use strncpy rather than strcpy

283686
post	put	post	get	put	get
a simple ajax call in jquery is as follows it also helps if you understand the basics of http - for example the request methods put post get delete head and so on
the error you pasted means that the header content-length is missing with your request and most servers if not all expect it to be send when you issue put or post because those are assumed to be data changing create update

284711
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
a uinavigationcontroller is a distinct object that is very different from a uitabbarcontroller
in general your application should have a tab controller one of who s tab s loads a uinavigationcontroller which in turn loads it s views - not that both maintain management over the different views

284711
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
it is also improper to refer to the display of a uiviewcontroller as such an object doesn t have a visual representation
in the case of a uinavigationcontroller the navigation controller object is responsible for displaying a navigation bar and a table view in the most common case and for managing the display of all the views in the navigation hierarchy

285627
cvs	svn
it isn t a static entity like a cvs tag is well to be fair you can move a tag on individual cvs files which effectively changes it
most svn users treat tags the way cvs presented them

285801
ready	each
the returned set is only the file descriptors that are ready to be used
you are supposed to use fd_isset to check each one if it is set or not

285809
serializable	deserialization
a serializable class can declare its own serialversionuid explicitly by declaring a field named serialversionuid that must be static final and of type long if a serializable class does not explicitly declare a serialversionuid then the serializable runtime will calculate a default serialversionuid value for that class based on various aspects of the class as described in the java tm object serializable specification
however it is strongly recommended that all serializable classes explicitly declare serialversionuid values since the default serialversionuid computation is highly sensitive to class details that may vary depending on compiler implementations and can thus result in unexpected invalidclassexceptions during deserialization

285819
int	chars
for c compatibility so sometimes you have to explicitly convert your string literal something enclosed in quotes like hello world to a std string to get the behavior you want you can still write because c-style strings such as literals like hello world are implicitly convertible to std string but it doesn t always work hello + world won t compile because the + operator isn t defined for two pointers. hello worl + d however will compile but it won t do anything sensible. instead of appending a chars to a string it will take the integral value of the chars which gets promoted to an int and add that to the value of the pointer
std string hello worl + d does as you d expect however because the left hand side is already a std string and the addition operator is overloaded for std string to do as you d expect even when the right hand side is a chars or a single chars

285973
y-combinator	combinators
while he doesn t to my knowledge look at the y-combinator itself he does look at other combinators for instance the kestrel the thrush the cardinal the obdurate kestrel other quirky birds and a few posts on how you can use them
reginald braithwaite aka raganwald has been writing a great series on combinators in ruby over at his new blog homoiconic

286068
decimal	ieee
please read what every computer scientist should know about floating-point arithmetic other options besides a decimal class are using common lisp or python 2.6 or another language with exact rationals converting the doubles to close rationals using frap
ieee floating point is binary not decimal

286303
swt	swing
now swt is os specific and you may not have the same flexibility than swing so you need to have good reason for looking for an alternative to swing especially when you consider there are good lafs look and feel for java
it depends with eclipse 3.4 swt 3.4 is quite supported with macos

287270
vb.net	vb6
here is the equivalent vb.net code
it s not exactly the converted version of the vb6 code but does the same thing

287538
hash	md5
and then transmit the hash to your site
i would imagine you will have to add a column to the database for the encrypted password then run a batch job over all records which gets the current password encrypts it as others have mentiond a hash like md5 is pretty standard edit but should not be used on its own - see other answers for good discussions stores it in the new column and checks it all happened smoothly

then you will need to update your front-end to hash the user-entered password at login time and verify that vs the stored hash rather than checking plaintext-vs-plaintext

287883
salt	md5
make sure you use a proper salt although the libraries you re using should be making sure of this for you
when you hash the passwords use do not use plain md5

287883
hash	salt
when you hash the passwords use do not use plain md5
use pbkdf2 which basically means using a random salt to prevent rainbow table attacks and iterating re-hashing enough times to slow the hashing down - not so much that your application takes too long but enough that an attacker brute-forcing a large number of different password will notice from the document iterate at least 1000 times preferably more - time your implementation to see how many iterations are feasible for you

287883
pbkdf2	salt

8 bytes 64 bits of salt are sufficient and the random doesn t need to be secure the salt is unencrypted we re not worried someone will guess it

287883
hash	salt	hash	hmac	hmac	pbkdf2
a good way to apply the salt when hashing is to use hmac with your favorite hash algorithm using the password as the hmac key and the salt as the text to hash see this section of the document
example implementation in python using sha-256 as the secure hash edit as mentioned by eli collins this is not a pbkdf2 implementation

287942
configobj	configparser
edit if you don t mind the extra dependency you could check out configobj which natively supports lists as a value type
configparser isn t designed to handle such conditions

288507
versioning	upgrade
you will need to install them as named instances when you go through the installation procedure eg myserver sql2000 myserver sql2005express myserver sql2005 etc i wouldn t advise running this many versioning or instances on a production box but 2 instances until you upgrade your other applications to 2005 should be no problem
on our development server we have lots of versioning installed eg 2000 2005 express 2005 standard 2008 express we haven t had any major problems

288615
hash	md5
as of 2017 there s no research that comes even close to feasibility so even a determined well-funded attacker can t compute a url that would hash to a hash of any existing url in your database
the only known collision attack against md5 is not useful for attacking url-like keys

288727
floating-point	integer
there are actually four good reasons i can think of that you might want to store and calculate with whole-number percentage values rather than floating-point equivalents depending on the data types chosen the integer value may take up less space
depending on the data type the floating-point value may lose precision remember that not all languages have a data type equivalent to sql server s decimal type

289005
hash	md5
the md5 hash is calculated on the file contents and is not affected by document metadata
it is a deterministic process that will always produce the same result if you start with the same content although there are ways to fake an md5 signature due to collision

289052
put	get
don t put it in a stored procedure and make us all come over there
all the other posters who say not to worry about it and that you should get gaps are right

289061
int	double
if you are working on octal you can simply if you are working on hex you can simply but for decimal you should probably do it the way jesse beder suggests most systems have a fast int divide
if you re working on a system that doesn t you could use the double dabble algorithm to fast convert to bcd

289412
jruby	mri
since approximately two years ago it is also possible to extend jruby in java and there is actually since last month a port of rcov for jruby
however this requires both a knowledge of ruby and c and a pretty deep knowledge at that because fiddling around with the internals of mri is not for the faint at heart

289412
mri	rubinius
however this requires both a knowledge of ruby and c and a pretty deep knowledge at that because fiddling around with the internals of mri is not for the faint at heart
but only with rubinius will it be possible to write dynamic analysis tools such as code coverage tools in ruby itself making tool writing accessible to a much larger portion of the ruby community

289524
inline	inlining
this means that if a function in the cpp file calls another function which is not implemented in the same cpp file or in a header file that is included then it doesn t have the actual body of the function and can therefore not inline it
but if you use ltcg it s the linker that does the inlining and it has all the functions in all the of the cpp files of the entire project minus referenced lib files that were not built with ltcg

289738
tinyint	boolean
but if i m not wrong mysql can store boolean bool and it store it as a tinyint 1
i use tinyint 1 in order to store boolean values in mysql

290362
int	boolean
any values you do not set in the response object will have their default values set int 0 string but this way you can signal to the client not to pay attention to those fields
i would add a boolean flag to the response something like isobjectpresent

290989
post	get
when a spammer has flooded your site with zillions of identical post about viagra you ll regret not taking the extra 20 mins to install a captcha
recaptcha has some plugins that make installing it pretty simple and you get to help them digify books

291529
int	boolean
looks like the key parts are these 2 lines from you exception nested function does not have the same signature as delegate system.func of calls int boolean
to boolean

291924
profiler	aqtime
interestingly it doesn t claim to be a profiler but it seems to be as much of one as gpprofile unless i am missing something
it supports delphi 2009 and has a free trial and is a little cheaper then aqtime

292209
decimal	ieee
it has the lua 5.1 arithmetic operators and more full control over rounding modes and working precision up to 69 decimal digits
though not arbitrary precision lua decnumber a lua 5.1 wrapper for ibm decnumber implements the proposed general decimal arithmetic standard ieee 754r

292931
boost	allocator
alternatively you can use boost ptr_map or a map that contains a share_ptr
the gc allocator is allocator and looking after objects of this type just because this object has a pointer in it does not mean it the allocator will call delete on it

293455
database-normalization	denormalization
database-normalization isn t just for theoretical correctness it can help to prevent data corruption
i certainly would not denormalization for simplicity as askywalker suggests

294747
super	implements
i m not sure of the best way but can think of a few none are super great though
use iis windowsauthentication with basic security and implements the validation method and then mark the rss action with an authorize filter

294869
expander	tabitem
last but not least i was able to get everything working properly with a groupbox and tabitem but not so much luck with an expander and i m not sure why
the expander handles the contentstringformat properly but not the headercontentstringformat

295036
lisp	scheme
that s not the focus of the book which is programming languages in general but it is covered. lisp in small pieces goes into more depth but that s both good and bad for your case
there s a lot of material on compiling and such that won t be relevant to you and its simpler interpreters are in scheme not c++

295048
boost	allocator
here s what the boost docs say about the deleter custom deallocators allow a factory function returning a shared_ptr to insulate the user from its memory allocator strategy
since the deallocator is not part of the type changing the allocator strategy does not break source or binary compatibility and does not require a client recompilation

295089
width	font-size
1 em is the width of the letter m 1 ex the height of the letter x -- obviously also inherited
you should not use px as font-size as in your example

295322
folder	directory
anyway when building application suite several projects but lot of common code we create folder structure like this main project1 project2 ... commonunits we add common units to relevant projects regardless it s not in same folder as project file
further sometimes it s easier to use project-level conditional defines project | options | directory conditionals for small code differences

295871
rar	gzip
zip itself and rar aswell are a combination of the two processes
gzip and bzip2 is simply a compressor not an archiver-software

296594
children	parent
groupboxes are not supposed to have any children and using them as parent will cause all kinds of errors including painting keyboard navigation and message propagation
just change the parent in the buttons createwindow call from group_box to hwnd the dialog

296777
accessor	properties
pull up reflector you ll see that your properties already are methods under the hood the get and set accessor in a properties are simply converted to get_mypropertyname and set_mypropertyname methods
this is also why you can but typically shouldn t add parameters to a properties

297123
dictionary	map
notice we re making a distinction between the dictionary class and the dictionary adt. the dictionary class has been marked as obsolete so it s best not to use it
in terms of java both the class hashmap and the class dictionary are implementations of the map abstract data type

297123
dictionary	map
in terms of java both the class hashmap and the class dictionary are implementations of the map abstract data type
abstract data types are not specific to any one programming language and the map adt can also be known as a hash or a dictionary or an associative array others at

297823
put	get
that should put your mind at ease
from the server s perspective an ajax request is not very different from normal get post request - just some extra headers added on in the request

298306
maven	pom.xml
but i have never used maven with clearcase since they follow a different logic maven needs signed names for files like myfile-1.2.jar whereas clearcase can store only myfile.jar and record the fact it is version labeled 1.2 that may have changed with the maven2 clearcase plugin reported by romaintaz but there is still some bugs in this new product as shown by this thread when one runs it a second time without unco ing the pom.xml file
maven is getting through the checkout fine but is not able to whatever the next step is

298329
inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties
i m not sure i understand what you mean by map a subclassing one-to-one but if you want to map inherited where the subclassing have properties that are not nullable you can do like this in fluent-nhibernate since you want the subclassing properties to be not-null you have to use the table-per-class joined-subclass way of modeling the inherited
this is because table-per-hierarchy requires all subclassing properties to be nullable

298601
hash	salt
even if you do accidentally stumble upon two numbers which have the exact same sha1 hash with your salt then the key will still be different and you ll avoid all collisions
why not do something which guarantees there ll be no collisions as well as makes sure that no one can change a get parameter to view something they shouldn t using a salt combine the id and its hash

298773
daemon	cron
but i usually just write a script that checks if the daemon is running and run if not and put it in cron to run every minute
it s a job for a dmd daemon monitoring daemon

298817
folder	directory
this allows you to create quick scratch projects and not clutter up your projects folder
hopefully it hasn t been cleaned up yet but if not it will be in you application data directory

299121
division	multiplication
do multiplication first as long as they re not likely to overflow and division second
3 4 0 in integer math integer math doesn t round on division it truncates

299180
put	get
you can put application-level security over the services layer in a way that might not be possible to a data access layer
points 1 and 2 mean that you get re-use of the business rule validations in the middle-tier

299541
tostring	string.format
maintainability readability for me is using string concatenation without any tostring calls if you re after performance make the tostring calls yourself to avoid boxing i m somewhat biased towards readability - same as first option in your question if you re showing localized strings to the user not the case here string.format has an edge
my initial preference coming from a c++ background was for string.format

299702
put	get
from understanding weak references by ethan nicholas weak references a weak reference simply put is a reference that isn t strong enough to force an object to remain in memory. weak references allow you to leverage the garbage collector s ability to determine reachability for you so you don t have to do it yourself
you create a weak reference like this and then elsewhere in the code you can use weakwidget.get to get the actual widget object

299848
filesystems	fat
regarding the usb key generally usb keys use one of the fat family of filesystems
fat doesn t support security at all so as soon as you copy the file to it the security information is lost

299848
filesystems	ntfs
it is possible to format usb keys using another filesystems for example ntfs which does support security
in that case if the accounts in windows at least it must be a domain account or similar just naming two accounts the same will not do it do not exist on the target computer only a user who can ignore filesystems permissions such as root on nix or administrator on windows will be able to access the file

300680
stdout	stderr
in real shells meaning not sea shells - i mean not in c shell or its derivatives then this runs program with the given arguments and redirects the stdout to tmp log.file
the notation hieroglyph at the end sends stderr file descriptor 2 to the same place that stdout file descriptor 1 is going

300851
integer	unsigned
please see additional documentation in the php manual the size of an integer is platform-dependent although a maximum value of about two billion is the usual value that s 32 bits signed
php does not support unsigned integers

301255
unix	solaris	unix	bsd
what this means is that the lsof concept of an open file not only covers regular files but also the following directories streams or network files for example internet or unix domain sockets and nfs files native libraries for example .soor .dylibdynamic libraries linked to a process block and character special files for example disk volume external hard drive console or mouse pipes wait i cannot find lsof on my system
lsof is such a popular tool that it has been ported to pretty much all unix dialects linux mac os x bsd solaris and so on

301845
post	get
however i sort of found a solution and since this problem seems to be pretty common i post it here
simply using the tableadapters to get the data will not retrieve the proper relations from the database

302232
stdout	stderr
you can redirect stderr to stdout as follows the 2 1 part says to redirect file descriptor 2 stderr to file descriptor 1 stdout
wget prints the headers to stderr not to stdout

302922
treemap	treeset
a treeset internally uses a treemap so why not use treemap directly
i would definitely choose a treemap treemap automatically sorts new keys on insertion no sorting afterwards is needed

302978
hash	salt
in addition to looking into these libraries you should also consider adding salt to the hash which essentially means adding some extra data to the value being hash prior to the hashing and adds an extra layer of security
in this way even if an attacker knew which hashing algorithm you used they wouldn t easily know how you salt the data before hashing it

303439
inject	interceptor
changing the dependencies you want to inject in the constructor doesn t necessarily mean you need to refactor much code
you get various benefits of tunneling dependencies through one source decorators interceptor proxies as well as handling object lifestyle

303682
put	get
if you are doing things from the user interface this might not be so important to do inthe proc although i would have the user inteface do checks before even running the proc to ensure the data is good for the insert things like checking to make sure a datefield contains a real date that all required fields have values etc. if you are writing procs to put large amounts of data into tables it is best to have a way to test those results before they are finalized
you d be amazed at the junk you will get from clients and vendors for data imports

304143
accessor	properties
this accessor would call one of the real array accessor described above you can and should fill in the proper class for the objects in the array in place of nsobject . then instead of you write
sadly and its counterpart are last i checked only recognized by kvo for set as in nsset properties not array properties so you don t get free kvo notifications with them unless you implement them on top of accessor it does recognize

304368
post	get
i believe you need to properly encode and send the actual post content
it looks like you re just serializing into json which php doesn t know what to do with ie it won t set it as values this should get your variable in php set

304492
ant	maven
however this is more like ant or nant rather than maven - it is an xml based scripting language designed for software builds rather than using the convention over configuration approach of maven
msbuild doesn t have the dependency management features that are pretty unique to maven

304807
ant	maven
all in all i would suggest ant maybe with ivy if you want dependencies management but i never tried that bye stefano
we re using maven for a really big project more than 15 modules and we tried hard not to fight the tool but 1 maven solves the 90 of common problems but if you re struggling the other 10 it is always a mess to fiddle with 2 life-cycle management is a mess

305087
folder	directory
override folder working directory path to which the files from star team are to be checked out for the build
if not specified the original working folder specified in the starteam will be used to extract the files

305612
versioning	upgrade
not sure why you re stuck with that versioning of cr
if you can at all upgrade to at least cr xi developer edition you ll be better off

305739
post	get	put	get
use post or put instead the browser should warn the user not to reload the request
redirecting using http redirection to a receipt page using a normal get request after a post put request will make it possible to refresh the page without getting warned about resubmitting

306053
ostream	ostringstream
because it s a temporary we cannot trivially convert to an ostream object through casting
both the constructor obviously and str are class ostringstream methods. yes we need to use .str

306222
abc	isinstance
furthermore abc s can be customized to account for exceptions such as not considering strings to be sequences
here an example after registration the atomic class can be used with isinstance and issubclass this is still much better than a hard-coded list because you only need to register the exceptions to the rule and external users of the code can register their own

306360
cvs	svn
svn has some important features over cvs vss like atomic commits cheap copies more efficient storage on the server side
svn is however not the only revison control system out there.

306593
margin	height
it isn t padding or margin and it s damned persistent
setting a width and height on the checkbox and then overflow hidden for some reason cuts off the extra space and allows ie s positioning to act very similarly to safari and firefox

306965
post	get
feel free to post more thoughts if you have them
i think that i ll just tell them that they either have to trust a couple of us to have access and not look at it or they don t get a project

306967
cassini	iis
it requires using the visual studio development server cassini during development instead of your local iis see the properties box on the project
when using iis as your development server edit and continue is not currently available for visual studio for asp.net

308170
translation	localization
for example there is a lot to be said about determining the locale the translation adapter will use
i d suggest you read the following in the zend framework manual because localization can be a complex issue and zend_translate can not be described entirely in here 53.4.1.13

308383
int	boolean
your compiler has arranged all of the members of test3 on int size boundaries
once a block has been used for a given type int bit-field or boolean bit-field the compiler does not allocate any further bit fields of a different type until the next boundary

308480
maven	pom.xml
probably you have older version of dependency plugin which does not have goal list if this does not help try upgrading maven
since 2.0.9 default versions are provided by the super pom.xml for most important plugins dependency plug-in included so 2.0 version will be downloaded which has list goal

308720
mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave
a good solution is to use mouseenter and mouseleave events instead of mouseover and mouseout the major difference between mouseenter mouseleave events and mouseover mouseout events is that the former don t bubble
in this example the child paragraph of div#image still receive the mouseenter mouseleave events even if you aren t listening for them but the events won t bubble up to their parent element

309318
button	checkbox
example with an up down effect given by borders obviously you can add background images that represent button up and button down and make the background color transparent
the good semantic way would be to use a checkbox and then style it in different ways if it is checked or not

310338
komodo	notepad++
i have worked a bit with python programming for google app engine which i started out in notepad++ and then recently shifted over to komodo using two excellent startup tutorials - both of which are conveniently linked from this blog post direct here and here
komodo supports the basic organization of your work into projects which notepad++ does not apart from physical folder organization

310386
subtract	add
now if the bank doesn t handle race conditions properly they will do the following assuming the transactions are handled manually of course clerk a will see the request to add 200 to my balance and note that my balance is currently 500. clerk b will see the request to subtract 50 from my balance and note that my balance is currently 500 clerk a hasn t yet transferred the money
clerk a finishes the paperwork and sets my account balance to 700 500 + the 200 he was supposed to add . and then a minute later because clerk b just had to grab a cup of coffee clerk b finishes up the other transaction and sets my balance to 450 the 500 i had when he checked minus the 50 he was meant to subtract

310913
vb.net	vb6
in my vb.net code i would use ctype to do this
however when i try to use ctype in vb6 i get a sub or function not defined error

310913
vb.net	vb6
solution as you may have discovered vb6 does not have a ctype function like vb.net does
however the other conversion functions those that have names beginning with c which you may have encountered in vb.net code such as cint and cstr do exist in vb6 and you can use them to convert to and from non-object types

310913
vb.net	vb6
keep in mind that vb6 unlike vb.net does not support inheritance
a class in vb6 can implement one or more interfaces but it cannot inherit from another class

311269
post	get
also you may not need the whole post transmitted to the next page edit i should make clear that i think the second option is possibly worse as you are limited by the size of data you can send through get and it is possibly less secure as users can more obviously manipulate the data
you could store that data in the session in the first file that handles the post then you can read it on the next page like or you could pass it through get but as per comments this is a bad idea if you do that make sure you do additional processing validation on page.php as a malicious user could change the variables

311329
agile	sprint
you ll also take advantage of the estimations calibration agile processes bring
when the amount of time the team is able to put in at every iteration varies too much the velocity cannot really help to plan the sprint since it will vary too especially at the beginning

311448
sharepoint	spsite	sharepoint	splist
do not query the sharepoint database directly
you really need to look at the object model available in c# you will need to get an spsite instance for a sitecollection and then iterate over the splist instances that belong to the spsite and the spweb objects

311448
sharepoint	spsite
you should never go to the database directly as sharepoint isn t designed for that at all and there is no guarantee actually there s a specific warning that the structure of the database will be the same between versioning and upgrade and additionally when content is spread over several content databases in a farm there is no guarantee that a query that runs on one content database will do what you expect on another content database
when you look at the object model for iteration also note that you will need to dispose the spsite and spweb objects that you create

312056
profiling	debugging
profiling however are better tools for guesstimating
the reason why hitting the pause button in debugging mode may not give a real picture of application behavior is because debuggers introduce additional executable code that can slowdown certain parts of the application

312166
post	get
i didn t want to post this in the actual question so it wouldn t influence the answers as much - here s the code
this is what i have came up with so far - to get the ids of all posts then retrieve the actual items for the first x number of ids

312166
post	get
this is what i have came up with so far - to get the ids of all post then retrieve the actual items for the first x number of ids
it s not terribly efficient but more so than retrieving all the post then throwing most of the away

312199
3-tier	n-tier
it s based on how you separate the presentation layer from the core business logic and data access wikipedia 3-tier means presentation layer + component layer + data access layer
n-tier is when unneccessary layers are added beyond these three and it s labeled with a buzzword so it doesn t seem like your architects are a bunch of crack monkeys

312430
versioning	upgrade
if you are only to minor versioning behind there probably isn t much reason to upgrade
check the changelog if there s something that interests you then upgrade

312468
firefox	safari
document.body.offsetwidth returns the innerwidth value from left hand side to the left side of the vertical scrollbar in firefox
not for me it doesn t it returns the same value as ie opera konqueror and safari

313022
innodb	myisam
lesson learned in production despite the fact we like to use innodb tables in mysql for many many reasons.
be sure you haven t managed to find one of the few myisam tables that doesn t respect transactions and you can t roll back on

313239
rss	feed
so while all the information was coming from apple the script would download multiple things from different parts of their site to piece together a final rss feed that would contain links to .mov files that actually contained the movie trailer
although probably not a true mashup i created a script hat would read the apple movie trailer rss feed and then visit the links in the feed to download the html of the pages linked to in the rss feed

313523
np-hard	np-complete
note that np-complete problems are also np-hard
however not all np-hard problems are np or even a decision problem despite having np as a prefix

313928
subtract	add
then with modulo 4 adding 3 is the same as subtract 1 but has the advantage of never going negative some modulo operators may not like negatives
then you once again add 1 to get back to a 1-based number

314499
int	chars
edit as suggested by mehrdad in the comment to a similar solution it s better to do this this casts the a chars to it s int value and then increments based on this so it s not hardcoded
you could do something like this based on the ascii values of the chars see the table here . you are just casting from the int value of the chars to the chars value - but that only works for ascii chars not different languages etc

317415
unix	aix
if not then revert to vmstat which is available on most unix system

post	put	put	get
put and delete are not supported by all browsers according to jquery the type of request to make post or get default is get
note other http request methods such as put and delete can also be used here but they are not supported by all browsers

317665
versioning	upgrade
the best solution here is to provide a link to the last functioning win98-compatible versioning of your software to these users but you shouldn t go out of your way to cater to people who are still keen on running a 10-year old os
i think that sherm hit the nail on the head here if you still have users running windows 98 then one obvious drawback to dropping support is that some of those will inevitably refuse to upgrade

317986
hash	salt
this improves security vastly because now your users don t use 5 letter passwords anymore they use 5+len salt size passwords and if the salt is big enough no rainbow database will ever contain your hash
i m not sure what these functions do but for passwords in a lamp stack website i d definitely use a salt field as well

318010
hash	salt
some applications require the user s password to be retrievable as opposed to a system where the user s password is randomly reset to something if forgotten because it cannot be decrypted because you re using a hash
also keep with the suggestion of using a salt value whether you hash or encrypt

318266
int	chars
if you wanted to write this yourself rather than use a library then atoi to convert chars to int will let you test the range of each number and some strcmp s between the . s
you can also do some quick checks such as the length of the string should be less than 16 chars not including null terminator number of dots

319127
children	parent
you must not try to populate every children list but rather get rid of the children items from the flat list then it becomes easy
i assume you already know the parent of all items

319290
hide	show
the solution i ended up going with was to link the jquery.validate.js and jquery.metadata.js from i then had a check list of request types at the top of the form which show hide the id element when you checked the item show hide function not show
for this example we ll say that delete account has been checked which would show because both of the input fields within the fieldset are required when the delete account option is checked i ve added the following to the class attribute of the required input

319321
width	height
while the width is not limited as other answers show i ve always found it strange that one can drag and resize the height with the mouse but not the width
i think the default 80 character width is related to compatibility with old programs that assume the terminal won t be more than 80 characters wide

319433
gif	png
the comment by paul fisher reminded me that i also probably wouldn t recommend using gif either
paul points out that png compresses static line art better than gif for nearly every situation

320138
installation	upgrade
in my experience you can install bids 2008 side-by side with bids 2005 on your machine just select it from client tools section in sql server 2008 installation wizard
you do not need to install a new sql server instance as you did with express or upgrade existing one

320140
folder	directory
for example cd code project001 git init this creates a .git hidden folder in the current directory
to make a new project run git init with an additional argument the name of the directory to be created to check if the current current path is within a git repository simply run git status - if it s not a repository it will report fatal not a git repository you could also list the .git directory and check it contains files directory similar to the following if for whatever reason you wish to de-git a repository you wish to stop using git to track that project

320389
rss	feed
sometimes there simply isn t any way to get asynchronous notifications for example to replace rss with a push system the server would have to know about everyone who reads the feed and have a way of contacting them
this is a mailing list - precisely one of the things rss was designed to avoid

321054
mvp	presenter
since you are probably using webforms it would be hard to migrate to asp.net mvc but you could implement mvp pretty easily into existing apps
on a basic level you would move all the business logic into a presenter class that has a view that represents some sort of interface you would define your interface to hold the atomic types you want to display once those are defined you can now simply implement the interface in your form as you can see your code behind is now extremely simple so code duplication is not a big deal

321552
redmine	trac
redmine is another good pick - i don t love it quite as well as trac but it s much easier to set up on the shared host where i keep my project management tools
trac and mediawiki would be my top two picks depending on whether or not you wanted ticketing integrated

321628
innodb	myisam
i m not as familiar with myisam intricacies but with innodb it is true that statistics can get out of date
the database keeps estimated statistics on how your data is distributed for a given index and it s possible for those to get out-of-date but mysql innodb has some built in functionality to try to keep statistics current

322081
getter	setter
the dbkey property getter is virtual in the il because it is in an interface
the setter is not virtual because it is not part of the interface but part of the concrete class

322241
udp	tcp
for udp you send datagrams over the internet using ip
udp doesn t provide the safety that tcp does but doesn t require a response but such responses are part of their protocols not yours

322241
udp	tcp
udp doesn t provide the safety that tcp does but doesn t require a response but such responses are part of their protocols not yours
i would suggest using tcp to save you some headache

323092
hmac	md5
to verify a token simply recompute the hmac with the supplied value of c and see if it matches the supplied hmac value
also as vinko mentioned you should not use md5

323388
udp	tcp
it would probably be another protocol over tcp but i see no reason why you cannot stream over udp
if you do you have to take into account that there is no certainty that your data will arrive at the other end but i can take it that you know about udp

323675
doxygen	tex
if you want to have documentation outside the ide and are happy to run non-java tooling then doxygen is worth a try since it doesn t require any change to your java code
doxygen has a number of features that javadoc does not offer the class diagrams for the hierarchies and the cooperation context more summary pages optional source-code browsing cross-linked with the documentation additional tag support such as todo on a separate page and it can generate output in tex and pdf format.it also allows a lot of visual customization

since doxygen supports the standard javadoc tags you can run doxygen on any source code with javadoc comments on it

323764
sudo	passwd
this will install git into the default place usr local - so git will be in usr local bin git it will prompt you to enter your passwd for sudo this is so it can write to the usr local directory which can only be accessed by the root user so sudo is required
if you with to install it somewhere separate so git s files aren t mixed in with other tools use --prefix with the configure command this will install the git binary into usr local bin gitpath bin git - so you don t have to type that every time you you should add into your by adding the following line into your .profile if you do not have sudo access you can use and install into your home directory

324087
filesystems	ntfs
if i were you i would never rely on any version of any filesystems driver be it microsoft s be it another os s to be consistent about the algorithm it uses to generate short file names
the exact behavior of the microsoft fastfat and ntfs drivers is not officially documented except as somewhat high level overviews thus are not part of the api contract

324655
inherited	properties
pita that it doesn t inherited your history from unregistered accounts.
maybe there should be an properties where you can specify which generation that the object before it is collected

324811
folder	directory
not so much for snippets but for common libraries that i ve either collected or developed myself i keep a folder called _lib
whenever i need something from that folder eg jquery.js a css reset i just symlink that directory into my working folder and hey presto

325178
folder	directory
unfortunately -xbootclasspath is an option for sun jvm that is jrockit does not have it nor the ibm s vm what ever his name is there was another option where you declare a folder where all the extensions are
plus there is an ext directory in the jre

325422
versioning	upgrade
some versioning bumps between eclipse versioning cause a certain amount of upgrade pain for the plugin writers 3.0 to 3.1 was a big jump configuration between different versioning of the same product may not be compatible
versioning of the same plugin may have a different feature set but not work on all versioning checkstyle 5 supports java 5 but may not work with the checkstyle plugin which works with eclipse 2.1 however if it isn t possible or desirable to have multiple levels of categories then promoting the categories suggested above to separate update sites is the way forward

325769
imperative	declarative
orchestration languages are in fact imperative scripting languages with conditionals looping and other traditionally imperative constructs typically expressed through a flowchart-based user interface
they certainly do not in my experience implement tail-recursive functional programming backward chaining or any other paradigm that might reasonably described as declarative in the generally accepted sense

326073
post	get
the only way to accomplish the post without using a tag is to manually alter the http request header and add the name-value pairs in yourself
also keep in mind that an http server doesn t intrinsically know whether a request get or post came from a main browser window or an ajax call

326292
box	myspace
just because the box is on a web page doesn t mean it should use ajax omar
if you need to put your widget onto myspace you ll want one of these

326440
bufferedreader	ioexception
in java 8 bufferedreader added a new method lines to produce a
if an ioexception is encountered while reading the file it is wrapped in an uncheckedioexception since stream doesn t accept lambdas that throw checked exceptions

327551
decimal	ieee
thus when printed out with full precision as a decimal fraction they won t match the original value
the most common storage for floating-point values in programming languages - ieee singles and doubles - does not have exact representations for most decimal fractions

327551
floating-point	fractions	decimal	ieee
the most common storage for floating-point values in programming languages - ieee singles and doubles - does not have exact representations for most decimal fractions
the reason is that they store values in binary floating-point format rather than decimal floating-point format

327568
agile	greenhopper
use jira and fogbugz for what they were meant to do keep track of bugs and requests but not be a full scrum management tool. update you can use greenhopper plugin to jira which is a little better to support agile projects
after using fogbugz and jira for agile i have decided that neither tool is really ideal to support the model

328228
int	chars
for example if int is only 16 bits wide in a particular implementation then jan can t be represented anymore like you intend it chars must be at least 8 bits while a chars literal is always of type int
i only know what the c standard says about this c99 the value of an integer chars constant containing more than one chars ab or containing a chars or escape sequence that does not map to a single-byte execution chars is implementation-deﬁned

328228
int	chars
i only know what the c standard says about this c99 the value of an int chars constant containing more than one chars ab or containing a chars or escape sequence that does not map to a single-byte execution chars is implementation-deﬁned
if an int chars constant contains a single chars or escape sequence its value is the one that results when an object with type chars whose value is that of the single chars or escape sequence is converted to type int

328942
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
since it s a button it shouldn t own the uiviewcontroller that it displays
instead it sends a message to the uitabbarcontroller to switch to the uiviewcontroller as indicated by the selected tab bar item

329945
classname	inherited
you create an object from an existing piece of data often but not always an anonymous hash used to store instance variables with bless reference classname
you call object methods like obj- methodname args and class methods like classname - methodname args . multiple inherited method resolution order can be altered using mro

330109
bash	tcsh
so in your shell script a bash shell script here the contents would be
i am not sure about the function to generate a random number in tcsh

330232
hash	md5
md5 does not create a unique hash value
the goal of md5 is to quickly produce a value that changes significantly based on a minor change to the source

330491
lisp	scheme
disclaimer i m not a lisp expert
i m mostly interested in programming languages and have been playing with lisp clos scheme erlang python and a bit of ruby

330617
vim	emacs
in the vim help see he text-objects for more
i m a regular vim user but not an emacs user and haven t used vimpulse to confirm this

331233
post	get
when you try to bind to the first object on post it may not have been the first object in that list to render out
for example items 0 may not be the same between the get and the post

331878
post	get
found the or at least a solution from another post
apparently the reporting services root directory can get corrupted - how is not clear - but i deleted the reportserver virtual directory and recreated it with the reporting services configuration tool

332294
accessor	properties
on a different note for kvc-compliance i d advise implementing objectinwidgetsatindex and countofwidgets instead of a widgets accessor
remember kvc models relationships not array properties

332749
yacc	bison
i work on projects that use yacc
not new code - but were they new they d still use yacc or a close relative bison byacc ...

332756
automake	autotools
the main difference between this automake example and your example seems to be that automake touches the stamp file while in your example it is not even a real file
this seems similar to what autotools does for its config.h header

332975
profiling	instrumentation
aqtime is an instrumenting profiling
instrumenting profilers often aren t suitable for measuring code time particularly in microbenchmarks like yours because the cost of the instrumentation often outweighs the cost of the thing being measured

332975
profiling	instrumentation
instrumenting profiling often aren t suitable for measuring code time particularly in microbenchmarks like yours because the cost of the instrumentation often outweighs the cost of the thing being measured
instrumenting profiling on the other hand excel at profiling memory and other resource usage

332978
subclass	inherited
classes in other packages will not have access unless they subclass this original class
see this similar question for more specific information on inherited markers

333002
post	get
i am not sure how the ispostback is calculated but my guess would be that it checks the http request to see if it s a post or a get.
it might be some sort of proxy which creates a get request out of a given post request.

333011
hash-collision	key
let s suppose that the hash-collision resolving function we used found that the new empty element is 29 since there was a hash-collision in this insertion our performance was not quite o 1
this problem will also crop up when we try to search for the pet key as trying to find the element containing the pet key by performing hash_function pet will always return 18 initially

333631
webkit	gecko
with gecko-engined browsers you get in terms of other browsers implementing these features i m only aware of webkit implementing array extras but it s actually quite easy to monkeypatch support for those in all browsers since they re just additional methods
gecko opera and webkit also support the canvas element which although being a new html element is used via javascript so i m not sure if that fits your criteria

334225
client-side	server-side
use the craxdrt.dll for any client-side application that does not contain the embeddable designer or use it for any server-side application
craxddrt.dll is apartment-model threaded but is not thread safe and can only be used in a client-side application

334335
try-catch	exception-handling
a try-catch imo should be tailored to specific exception-handling
again this is just my opinion but my concept of defensive programming is that you need fewer smaller try-catch blocks not more larger ones

334787
put	get
or if you really need gets working you can put this into your controller which will put the variables back into the get array
when i first started working with codeigniter not using get really threw me off as well

335122
pascal	delphi
i don t think there are any machine code decompilers that produce pascal code
most delphi decompilers parse form and rtti data but do not actually decompile the machine code

335379
filesystems	ntfs
10 gb is not quite a huge amount of data so you can probably use the database to store it and have no big issues but of course it s best performance wise to use the filesystems and safety-management wise it s better to use the db backups and consistency
happily sql server 2008 allows you to have your cake and eat it too with the filestream attribute in sql server 2008 you can apply the filestream attribute to a varbinary column and sql server then stores the data for that column on the local ntfs file system

335596
put	get
429 when user s requests are too frequents 500 i tend to put these in catch blocks where the only option is to give up to make sure something meaningful is sent to the browser
i realise i could get away with simply letting the server send 200 for everything but they save a lot of pain when users are seeing or causing errors and not telling you about them

335908
hash	md5
if you re looking for more options just use php s hash functions -- you ve got plenty of options there
md5 and sha-1 probably aren t recommended anymore due to know attacks

335911
hash	salt	salt	md5
it s not necessarily that you shouldn t use md5 as much it s that you shouldn t use just md5 as this leaves you vulnerable to rainbow-table attacks a rainbow table is a table of precomputed hash values - if your password is even remotely common or simple the attacker needs merely to look up the hash and he knows your plaintext password. at the very least you should add a salt to every password so that any existing rainbow table is useless forcing the attacker to generate an entire new rainbow table just for your database of passwords
better still is to use a different salt for every password in your database say the username it s associated with so that an attacker can t even generate a rainbow table for your whole database and has to crack each entry separately

335913
hash	md5
it would still take some work to crack a hash made with md5 but it s several times easier than guessing the password by brute-force
ideally cracking a hash should not be easier than brute-force

336089
width	height
bold true align center x 10px y 10px width 300px height 100px my_edit editbox placeholder x 10px y 110px width 300px height 100px my_btn button text click me

336249
int	chars
a datetime is just a large int indicating the amount of time in an epoch - it doesn t have a format
but that is fine since you should be using parametrized tsql anyway - so just add the datetime as the value of a dbparameter and it will be handed to the db in an unambiguous way don t use string concatenation to build a tsql command or for a sqlcommand if you genuinely need a string then just use the string directly as a n var chars parameter

336282
union	distinct
the below query by itself will only provide distinct values select col from table1 union select col from table2 if you did want duplicates you would have to do select col from table1 union all select col from table2
select unique is not valid syntax for what you are trying to do you want to use either select distinct or select distinctrow and actually you don t even need distinct distinctrow in what you are trying to do

337033
jquery	nyromodal
depends on your concrete needs but as far as i m concerned i was mostly unhappy with it found the code to be poorly written at least wrt the available jquery plugin api and would not recommand it
i m currently testing nyromodal and while it s a bit on the heavyweight side it looks much more promising

337572
int	double
javascript doesn t have int
it only has double precision floating-point numbers

338290
stdout	stdio	stdout	stderr
i m not 100 sure but i think stderr isn t buffered which can cause confusion because you might see output you made to stderr before output you previously made to stdout
your problem is that printf and anything else that uses the stdio library to write to stdout standard output is buffered - line buffered if it goes to the console and size buffered if it goes to a file

338295
stdout	fflush
printf writes to stdout the default output stream which is usually line buffered
the buffer isn t fflush by the time sleep is called so nothing is displayed when the program exits all streams are automatically fflush which is why it prints right before exiting

338533
post	get
a quick google search leads me to believe that there isn t any checking to make sure some douche isn t using your web methods for his own malicious desires here s a blog post talking about this
so before you get this working you might want to think about ways to prevent someone from hijacking your webmethod to send me viagra emails

338821
wordpress	joomla
it s very easy to use has many plugins for it and the newest version of wordpress even has auto-updating features
wordpress isn t as good as joomla when it comes to user management though

wordpress	joomla
wordpress isn t as good as joomla when it comes to user management though
for example joomla can specify exactly what content users and user groups have access to

338821
wordpress	joomla
joomla typically requires having a sit-down with the client to go over the basic features of how to use the software while wordpress is easy enough for the client to figure out without any assistance
however the wordpress sites i ve worked with that require more than the standard blogging features e-commerce image galleries forums usually involve integrating wordpress with a separate software application while joomla more often than not has those plugins available for it

338821
wordpress	phpbb	wordpress	joomla	joomla	phpbb
however the wordpress sites i ve worked with that require more than the standard blogging features e-commerce image galleries forums usually involve integrating wordpress with a separate software application while joomla more often than not has those plugins available for it
the end result is a website with several applications on it installed wordpress coppermine phpbb each with separate logins and admin screens

339544
vmware	virtualbox
to second eric s comment about virtualbox not only is it free but it doesn t load processes bloat to your host os as vmware does
vmware slowed down my bootup even in a day in which i wasn t going to launch it at all

339734
post	get	vsts	tfs
note if you are using vsts 2008 and tfs 2005 you ll need to do the compile yourself see the notes at the bottom of the home page buck hodges has a post why this wasn t built into 2005 and isn t the default action in 2008
if that is the case and you are using vsts 2008 and tfs 2008 then using the get latest version on checkout setting of both is probably your answer if you aren t then the checkout and get latest version is what you investigate

339820
junit	easymock
it s not the task of junit to test sql statements
you should create a mocker easymock and isolate the connection. so the mocker can imitate the sql connection and its results

339988
folder	directory
setting the folder search paths in the visual studio settings to fix an include issue is generally not really a good idea from a design point of view
your code will be less portable to different machines with different directory lay-outs. br my suggestion would be to settle on an organisation of your code so that the relative paths of the sub-directories relative to your including code are fixed add the base folder to the project project properties - configuration properties - c c++ - additional include directory additional include directory add the subdirectories to the #include statements #include subdirectory somefile.h

340015
rtl	verilog
your data structures coded as rtl will likely infer registers and latches during logic synthesis
your data structures will probably work when coded correctly in verilog but what makes sense executing on a microprocessor may not be the best way to build it in hardware

340688
put	get
host the solution yourself put up a website charge for use
license the software they get the source but cannot legally modify or redistribute the source

340805
superclass	subclassing
one difference you are likely to encounter is that the general table for the superclass doesn t really need the type code column
the type of a single superclass instance can be derived by the presence or absence of foreign keys in the various subclassing tables

340811
int	double
using native types like int double etc
and void-pointers for a container is nearly always an icky affair because you have either the choice to cast the int for a double this doesn t work to a pointer or you need to allocate extra memory for the data type

341435
implements	extends
that said i don t really know why hashmap values would not implements equals itself
both abstractlist and abstractset extends abstractcollection and they have different behaviors for their equals methods specified by the interfaces list and set

342137
cassini	iis
i ve had problems with security thread.currentprincipal etc on cassini that just disappeared when i started debugging against iis
probably not relevant to this discussion but be careful testing debugging on cassini

342137
cassini	iis
probably not relevant to this discussion but be careful testing debugging on cassini
its threading model is different from iis

343306
post	get	put	get
action delete id 342 securityid 923847203487 there s post and put or delete why have action add and action delete
btw you shouldn t allow changes to data via get

343478
ienumerable	icollection
the key difference between the icollection family and the ienumerable family is the absence of certainty as to the count of items present quite often the items will be generated loaded hydrated as needed - in some cases an enumerable may not ever finish generating results which is why the count is missing
deriving and adding a count is possible depending on your requirements but it goes against this spirit which is the purpose of icollection - a collection of stuff that s all there

343797
bazaar	git
basically id does not make any sense with bazaar git and other distributed source code management tools
having automatically generated id tags that show a sensible version number is impossible to do with dscm tools like bazaar because everybody s line of development can be different from all others

344598
put	get
note if you wanted to do a pure version of a then boofus is right you probably wouldn t put the state_id in the questions table as well as it s redundant
but that would definitely be inconvenient because it would make simple queries to get questions in a particular state much harder

344763
nofollow	noindex
chances are the search spiders are already especially google yahoo and msn searching the nofollow pages because they still have to hit those pages to see if they have a noindex
the real problem is nofollow doesn t actually mean don t follow it just means don t pass on my reputation to this link

345132
cos	sin
i m not much of a mathematician but my understanding of where sin cos and tan come from is that they are in a sense observed when you re working with right-angle triangles
if you take measurements of the lengths of sides of a bunch of different right-angle triangles and plot the points on a graph you can get sin cos and tan out of that

346117
cvs	svn
working with cvs without write access is a real pain - with git there is not a big different how get get your patches in. this is not only a technical advantage but also saves complicated discussions whether this noobie should really get write access
number of commands while svn and other modern vcs like hg or others are nice and useful tools git is a shop full of machine tools

346878
int	chars
then the int is read in after the colon and any intervening white space
for completeness here s a simple solution in c explanation the says to read in as many possible chars that aren t colons and the suppresses assignment

347436
filesystems	hfs
if you delete a file on a fat or udf filesystems its directory entry simply gets marked as deleted with most of the dir entry still intact
on hfs volumes due to their use of b-trees deleted edits must be removed from the directory or else searching for items wouldn t work any more efficiently well this argument may be a bit weak but fact is that deleted entries get removed and overwritten

347506
width	margin
since the tables are generated dynamically statistical results pulled from a database the width can not be known in advance
the desired result can be achieved by wrapping the two tables within another table and the result is a perfectly centered pair of tables that responds fluidly to arbitrary widths and page re sizes and the align center table attribute could be hoisted out into an outer div with margin autos

347817
content-disposition	content-length
headers content-type mime type content-disposition attachment
filename archive.zip content-length filesize_in_bytes the content length is not mandatory but using it will make sure that the download dialog box can show how much more file there is to download

pbkdf2	hash
here are other answers i ve written on this topic hashing passwords hashing passwords salt hiding salt pbkdf2 versus bcrypt bcrypt
hashing a password once is insecure no multiple hash are not less secure

348558
prng	random
the prng solution doesn t permit you to obtain only part of the solar system you have to make the whole thing. just how much detail is there anyway that you need to save
a random seed for each solar system is a viable solution but i have a feeling you re barking up the wrong tree here

349036
multibyte	setlocale
it therefore is impossible to use locale-aware string operations within php on windows when strings are multibyte encoded
update on this issue even though the discussion around this problem revealed that we could have discovered a php bug with strcoll and or setlocale this is clearly not the case

349207
subtraction	multiplication
both have one if and one subtraction but the first one has a multiplication in some cases the last one has not
some cpus have a swap sign operation and the compiler recognizes what does it just swaps the sign so instead of a multiplication it will issue a swap sign operation for cpus that offer it and this operation is as fast as a cpu operation can get usually one clock cycle

349340
folder	directory
advantage of the method flexibility - you can filter out some file types walk down recursively or ignore folder etc
if the method is slow for you maybe you should get a better method like not creating an array filled with directory info takes time to fill it

width	margin
now as j-p correctly states jquery has the functions outerwidth and outerheight which include the border and padding by default and also the margin if the first argument of the function is true original answer the width method no longer requires the dimensions plugin because it has been added to the jquery core what you need to do is get the padding margin and border width-values of that particular div and add them to the result of the width method something like this split into multiple lines to make it more readable that way you will always get the correct computed value even if you change the padding or margin values from the css
update the original answer was written prior to jquery 1.3 and the functions that existed at the time where not adequate by themselves to calculate the whole width

349805
salt	md5
the downside of this is you have to keep track of these acceptable salt strings
the time-based salt will not make md5 any easier to break

349805
salt	md5
the time-based salt will not make md5 any easier to break
you re still relying on 1 the user having a good password to defeat brute force calculations and 2 md5 being a decent hash

349932
inherited	properties
if it is only going to work as your own implementation of a collection use inherited
if not include a a collection as a properties

350167
gridview	repeater
if you don t need any of the features of a gridview why not use a repeater
a repeater keeps it simple for implementation but also allows you to have full control over the generated source

350855
anjuta	geany	anjuta	kdevelop
then there are some others where i cannot tell you how they are since i ve not tested them including anjuta for the gnome desktop and code blocks written with wxwidgets it s quite cross-platform
if all you want is a gui for the compiler and a symbol browser you could also use geany which is very fast and includes an embedded terminal like kdevelop

351267
disk	ram
you are probably i o bound not cpu or memory bound so optimizing the disk access is critical
your ram is fine--more than adequate

351349
unix	solaris
linux is seen as not as well supported as unix solaris or windows servers
if this bothers you purchase support from redhat or install solaris and purchase support from sun

351629
dictionary	map
i recommend the map str args instead of just args because some of your arguments could potentially not be strings and would cause a typeerror for example with an int argument in your list when you get into dictionary objects you will probably want to comma-separate the values of the dictionary presumably because the values are what you want to pass into this function
if you do the join method on the dictionary object itself you will get the keys separated like so what you want is the following note the new problem you encounter however

351894
udp	tcp
in addition when using udp it s not necessary for all the fragments to arrive at the destination so preventing fragmentation means the message either arrives or doesn t arrive - there is no possibility that only a bit of the udp datagram will reach the destination
i can t recall how long the tcp ip stack held on to unassembled ip packets waiting for missing fragments but use of the df flag meant there were no unnecessary resources tied up during that time

352132
jboss	glassfish
not sure if it was worth the 3+ year effort but the release notes are here group_id 22866 as with any big rewrite of an app server i would tread carefully on jboss 5
if you are programming simply to java ee specs then glassfish will probably suit your needs fine

352804
onmouseover	onclick
don t rely on hover or onmouseover because these events don t work on touch screens
onclick is delayed mousemove may not work

353563
cassini	iis
iis6 doesn t do the intergrated pipeline that is intrinsic to cassini and is default in iis7
edit details in iis manager open application properties

354067
inherited	properties
i wouldn t create a publisher class to inherited book since publisher isn t a book it is metadata information about a book. the bible though would inherited book
my advice would be to create a publisher properties on the book. this publisher could be of type ipublishinformation and the string publisher could use a namedpublisher string name class implementing ipublishinformation

354315
disk	ram
a ram disk might seem faster but that s because you aren t factoring in the copy to ramdisk and copy from ramdisk times
dedicating ram to a fixed size ramdisk just reduces the memory available for caching

354320
folder	directory
i have found that in some circumstances the property file if inside the jar cannot be in the root folder
move it into a directory inside of the jar and then use getresourceasstream

354405
implements	extends
if your helper method commony only exists in abstract base class b all classes which implements interface a will have to also extends base class b in order to take advantage of that implementation of commony
but you might not always want to be forced to extends class b

354818
boost	allocator
i m not a fan of this technique but i ll let you decide for yourself if it s what you want then there s boost array which has none of the dynamic sizing behavior of the first two but gives you more of the vector interface than just using pointers as iterators that you get with built-in arrays ie. you get begin end size etc.
some options you may want to look at stlsoft by matthew wilson author of imperfect c++ has an auto_buffer template class that puts a default array on the stack but if it grows larger than the stack allocator will grab the memory from the heap

355295
post	get
if its a form post you can get the value with request.form control one of the properties will help you do it if its a new control in some page you can do something with ajax i did not try it its just a theory you can make an ajax request that will create a textboox control in the server and then render the html to your page
now when you will call text1.text you will get the value

355405
folder	directory
generally when i configure iis i set the properties for the default web site to a folder that doesn t contain anything then create individual entries within iis for each web site
for example you would create a new entry for myapplication.com and set its home directory to the proper folder on the server that contains your root files usually c inetpub wwwroot myapplication.com but it could be anywhere you like

355405
folder	directory
for example you would create a new entry for myapplication.com and set its home directory to the proper folder on the server that contains your root files usually c inetpub wwwroot myapplication.com but it could be anywhere you like
it sounds as if you have created a folder for your application but do not have a specific entry in iis configured to handle the requests and load files from the proper folder

355790
setinterval	settimeout	setinterval	clearinterval
well the first thing to say is that if you re calling settimeout but not changing the interval you should be using setinterval
edit update from comment you can keep a reference from the closure if used as a class and setinterval clearinterval don t require re-referencing

356774
inherited	properties
in your case because you inherited from observablecollection that would be the items properties
unfortunately the items properties is read-only and that s not allowed because the content properties must have a setter

356920
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome uses webkit a fairly standard rendering engine
safari uses it also and it doesn t sound like webkit is going away

356941
width	margin
the default width of the div is 100 of the parent object s width still the body tag
the default position is to be the next block element in the flow - since there aren t any other block elements it vertically aligns with the top margin

357081
printf	strncpy
what you can do is use printf to write to a temporary string and then something like strncpy to copy only the bytes that you want
there is no way to tell printf not to write a trailing null

358613
post	get
for long running processes like gae it is possible to make it otherwise but i am not sure you would need this complexity here you haven t supplied any code but i am assuming you get a post and then you redirect to results which is a get
so it should be easy to preserve the parameter this view in case of a post casues the client to issue a get request to whatever url is aliased some_target

359079
udp	tcp
this is to ensure that the udp checksum takes into account these fields
from the tcp or udp point of view the packet does not contain ip addresses

359316
executable	upx
thus the above drawbacks are more of an issue if your exe or dlls contains lots of resources but otherwise they may not be much of a factor in practice given the relative size of executable and available memory unless you re talking of dlls used by lots of executable like system dlls
to dispell some incorrect information in other answers upx will not affect your ability to run on dep-protected machines

359671
cassini	iis
despite the fact that i am in fact deploying to an iis 7 server i have been debugging using the vs 2008 built in web server cassini
cassini passes all requests through the asp.net pipeline iis does not

360137
agile	sprint
agile can only be successfull if you have the requirements for atleast one sprint
most of the clients will tend to not have proper requirements or they change frequently in middle of the sprint which leads to re-planning and starting the sprint again

360203
hash-collision	key
to get to an item your hashtable will do something like this get the hash of the key get the bucket number for that hash usually the map function looks like this bucket hash bucketscount traverse the items chain basically it s a list of items that share the same bucket most hashtables use this method of handling bucket hash-collision that starts at that bucket and compare each key with the one of the item you are trying to add delete update check if contained
lookup times depend on how good how sparse is the output and fast is your hash function the number of buckets you are using and how fast is the key comparer it s not always the best solution

361252
put	get
if your mail ip gets put on one of these lists you can kiss sending email normally from that ip ever again goodbye
users are very finicky and it doesn t take many complaints to get your mail ip blocked at many domains

361489
inherited	subclassing
i often see questions asking how the developer can inherited from a class but hide a method because that method should not exist on the subclassing
that person obviously misses the point of inherited and should be pointed toward delegation instead

361956
udp	tcp	udp	rtp
so udp is the obvious choice in cases such as this
rtp is fairly insensitive to packet loss so it doesn t require the reliability of tcp

361961
copying	overwrite
this copy command doesn t work for two reasons as the target directory already exists svn treats the copying request as copying into the target directory
you can t overwrite with cp

362013
udp	tcp
udp does not care about reliability of the communication and will not slow down or re-transmit data
if your application needs a reliable data stream for example to retrieve a file from a webserver you choose tcp

362013
udp	tcp
if your application doesn t care about corrupted or lost packets and you don t need to incur the additional overhead to provide the additional reliability you can choose udp instead
voip is not significantly improved by reliable packet transmission and in fact in some cases things in tcp like retransmission and exponential backoff can actually hurt voip quality

362390
integer	unsigned
to convert from unsigned byte to a java integer to convert from unsigned 32-bit little-endian in byte to java long from the top of my head not tested
there are no unsigned integers in java

362457
subclass	abstract-class
they cannot be instantiated so if you have an abstract-class with concrete methods then it can be subclassed and the subclass can then be instantiated
an abstract-class is a class that is declared abstract - it may or may not include abstract methods

362804
post	get
one of the reasons i m not going to post details is because i m pretty sure i d get it wrong in at least some respects
i mean no disrespect whatsoever to the community when i say that the chances of everyone who thinks they can answer this question actually having enough rigour to get it right is practically zero

363180
post	get
recently i came across a great post as part of a thread on managing memory leaks which helped me identify a leak i didn t know about in a bug when setting the datagrid.datasource in one of our mobile apps
when binding a datagrid you should not directly use something like as this creates a new currencymanager each time that doesn t properly get disposed of

363386
ilist	ienumerator
if it s a non-generic collection or you know the generic collection implements nothing in its dispose method then the following can be used if you know if may implement ilist you can do this likewise if it s likely it ll be of a certain type of your own definition that has some kind of indexed access you can use the same technique
the simplest way to do this is but this isn t particularly efficient if it s actually a generic collection because ienumerator implements idisposable so the compiler has to put in a try finally with a dispose call in the finally block

363519
jobs	cron
expect is out of the question because i would like to run it as a cron job and since cron jobs don t run under a terminal the combination of expect ssh just doesn t work you can run expect scripts from cron at least you can with expect libraries like pexpect for python
i just tested this to confirm running a pexpect scp ssh script from cron and i was able to successfully scp a file from a python script running in cron

363732
range	max
you now will get a value in the range
following our example that means but this still doesn t include max and you are getting a double value

364598
put	get
it won t make a huge difference but one thing i would suggest is not putting the gwt javascript code into your main template but rather only put it on the pages that need it
it s true that if you re not running https it is cached basically forever but it seems wrong to get people to load in the module if it s not actually needed on that page

364931
haskell	ocaml
it s not quite what you asked for and it s not directly related to haskell but bruce mcadam s paper that about wraps it up goes into this topic in substantial breadth and depth
bruce s basic idea is to use an explicit knot-tying operator called wrap instead of the implicit knot-tying that is done automatically in haskell ocaml and some other languages

364960
fcntl	fork
8196 - hp-ux 11.23 for ia-64 fcntl f_setfl failed 16384 - solaris 10 16384 - macos x 10.5 o_nonblock did not work though fcntl f_setfl did not fail 32768 - aix 5.3 65536 - cygwin windows xp o_nonblock did not work though fcntl f_setfl did not fail 65536 - suse linux 10 and centos fcntl f_setfl failed one point that is clear from these tests is that o_nonblock works with pipes on some platforms and not on others
the program creates a pipe and fork

365126
post	get
you don t have support for team explorer and vs built in source control access in isolated shell see this post from vin though not directly related - if you are using vs sdk 1.1 to develop your packages - remember that the managed package framework is no longer available with the default distribution
so don t get surprised if your old packages can t load mpf files after moving to sdk 1.1

365216
public	protected
and make sure it s a public event too
private protected events rightfully shouldn t show up because they re not accessible. one thing you can do to make your user s design experience nicer is to do something like the following the description bit puts a nice message in the description panel of the property window

365692
for-loop	arrays
another key advantage with the foreach loops is that if your collection implementation changes from an int arrays to a for example then your foreach loops won t require any code changes foreach int i in mycollection the above is the same no matter what type your collection is whereas in your for-loop the following will not build if you changed mycollection from an arrays to a list
the differences in speed in a for - and a foreach -loop are tiny when you re looping through common structures like arrays lists etc and doing a linq query over the collection is almost always slightly slower although it s nicer to write

365834
innodb	myisam
in innodb however primary keys are clustered meaning they stay attached to the data pages and ensure that the row contents remain in physically sorted order on disk according to the primary key but only within single data pages which themselves could be scattered in any order. this being the case i would expect that innodb might have an advantage in that myisam would essentially have to do double work -- write the int once in the data pages and then write it again in the index pages
innodb wouldn t do this the primary key index would be identical to the data pages and would only have to write once

365834
innodb	myisam
innodb wouldn t do this the primary key index would be identical to the data pages and would only have to write once
it would only have to manage the data in one place where myisam would needlessly have to manage two copies

367296
inline	inlining
using the stl will increase your binary size for two basic reasons inlining by default the compiler treats template code as inline
therefore if you use in several different compilation units and the compiler inlines that code they ll each have their own local inline definitions of functions which probably isn t a big deal since the compiler will only inline very small definitions by default

367303
inline	inlining
but it is up to the compiler if the method is actually inline or not
the compiler inlining is sophisticated enough to only in-line if this will help in the optimization stratergy being used

367662
int	chars
buffer overflows reading or writing to an object or array at an offset that is negative or beyond the size of that object stack heap overflow int overflows signed int overflow evaluating an expression that is not mathematically defined left-shifting values by a negative amount right shifts by negative amounts are implementation defined shifting values by an amount greater than or equal to the number of bits in the number is undefined types cast and const casting a numeric value into a value that can t be represented by the target type either directly or via static_cast using an automatic variable before it has been definitely assigned using the value of any object of type other than volatile or sig_atomic_t at the receipt of a signal attempting to modify a string literal or any other const object during its lifetime concatenating a narrow with a wide string literal during preprocessing function and template not returning a value from a value-returning function directly or by flowing off from a try-block multiple different definitions for the same entity class template enumeration inline function static member function etc. infinite recursion in the instantiation of templates calling a function using different parameters or linkage to the parameters and linkage that the function is defined as using
oop cascading destructions of objects with static storage duration the result of assigning to partially overlapping objects recursively re-entering a function during the initialization of its static objects making virtual function calls to pure virtual functions of an object from its constructor or destructor referring to nonstatic members of objects that have not been constructed or have already been destructed source file and preprocessing a non-empty source file that doesn t end with a newline or ends with a backslash prior to c++11 a backslash followed by a chars that is not part of the specified escape codes in a chars or string constant this is implementation-defined in c++11

367881
ubuntu	linux
my current ubuntu server eats 40megs
i m not sure how much ram you have to play with on your server but if it s a lower amount you re going to fit a lot more on a linux host

369354
erd	diagram
a single erd or set of erd s are not sufficient to document a system of this complexity any more than a class diagram would be adequate to document an oo system
you ll have to write a document using the erd s as illustrations

369379
entity-relationship	diagram
in my experience entity-relationship or uml diagram aren t the most useful artifact - with a large number of tables diagram especially reverse engineered ones are often a big convoluted mess that nobody learns anything from
for my money some good human-readable documentation perhaps supplemented with diagram of smaller portions of the system will give you the most mileage

369605
inherited	properties
it doesn t matter where the properties comes from in the inherited chain
even if com.example.mycomponent extends mx.containers.canvas the states properties will use the xml namespace in which mycomponent is defined

369605
inherited	properties
in short don t think of the states properties as mx states because the mx prefix of a properties is merely inherited from the component
however we do have to use mx when we define the actual state itself because that s a class not a properties and that class is defined in the mx namespace

369955
cpu	processors
remember that bitmaps are usually accessed by more parts of the hardware than your processors and the endian that is specified by say conventional display adapters is not necessarily the same as the endian of your cpu
at the level of manipulating the channels in the pixel its no problem for a cpu to extract the fields whatever their order

370188
x86	64bit
there was a question a while ago talking about problems connecting a 32-bit debugger to a 64bit target which i think is the opposite from your situation x86 remote debugger service on x64 even though there s no resolution there it might give you some ideas - maybe it s as simple as making sure you re running the 32-bit version of the debugger on the x64 machine if that can be done simply
you may be running into issues with the 64bit debugger not being able to deal with the 32-bit debugger client

370311
int	double
using g++ with no optimization -o0 it automatically inlines constant int variables but not constant double values
at higher optimization levels -o1 it inlines constant double

370337
inline	constexpr
in the meantime your best bet is to follow the pattern also used by std numeric_limits it will not return a constant expression value is not known at compile time but that only matters theoretical since practical the value will be inline anyway
see the constexpr proposal

370378
opera	firefox
in opera the only browser i found where you could replace it in you only get the function back
you can however add a new function will work in firefox google-chrome and opera but not in ie since ie don t have the constructor property update by reading your description here i see your error you get a reference to the object called myinnercontent you remove that object from the dom when you replace the content of the outer tag

371111
pascal	delphi
the only problem is that you will have to learn pascal but it should not be a problem
delphi is compiled and very fast similar to c++

371348
equals	gethashcode
if the hash-code for two items does not match they may never be considered equals equals will simply never be called
the gethashcode method should reflect the equals logic

371348
equals	gethashcode
the gethashcode method should reflect the equals logic
the rules are if two things are equal then they must return the same value for gethashcode if the gethashcode is equal it is not necessary for them to be the same

371348
equals	gethashcode
the rules are if two things are equals then they must return the same value for gethashcode if the gethashcode is equals it is not necessary for them to be the same
this is a collision and equals will be called to see if it is a real equality or not

371588
post	get
as mentioned in the earlier post it is not a fixed value and would vary depending on the current resolution and monitor size
first get the current resolution

371743
octree	quadtree
the reason to use a quadtree is because you can then split on x- and y-coordinates an octree on x y and z making collision detection trivial
quadtree if an element is not in the topleft it wont collide with one in topright bottomleft or bottomright

371793
rss	feed
in rss feed for example you should have a guid for each item in the feed
that way the feed reader software can keep track of whether you have read that item or not

371982
accessor	properties
i had 2 problems upgrading from 5.0.15 to 5.0.17 one is that any fields marked as properties must not have any accessor
if you have an accessor for a properties field you must remove the properties tag and implement both accessor if you need them

372258
post	get
see this forum post for more - in order to be backwards compatible nothing is known about the type of t at runtime
when you use this version of the generic class foo then for the member variable a the compiler is essentially taking this line and replacing t with double to get this you cannot cast from object to double hence the classcastexception

372544
subclass	inherited
since static members cannot be overriden in a subclass the abstract annotation cannot be applied to them
as an aside - other languages do support static inherited just like instance inherited

373058
post	get
http get is semantically meant to be used to fetch a page while post can be argued that when used you d expect that some kind of state is changed
for example there s an expectation that using get with the same parameters multiple times yield the same results while using post they may not

373058
post	get
for example there s an expectation that using get with the same parameters multiple times yield the same results while using post they may not
not using post when you should yield to problems

373058
post	get
not using post when you should yield to problems
i think the ruby on rails ajax libraries used get instead of post and lead to a lot of data being lost when being touched upon by web spiders

373099
pem	pkcs#12
openssl works best with pem while most browsers and emailapplications will expect pkcs#12 but you can freely convert between the formats
so i can export that as a pkcs#12 file but am not exactly sure how to use that

bluecloth	rdiscount
see also moving past bluecloth on ryan tomayko s blog
ryan s post includes the following benchmark of 100 iterations of a markdown test bluecloth 13.029987s total time 00.130300s average maruku 08.424132s total time 00.084241s average rdiscount 00.082019s total time 00.000820s average update august 2009 bluecloth2 was released it s speed is on par with rdiscount because it is based on rdiscount - it is not pure ruby

put	get
if you are confident that the size of this image library will not exceed the disc you re happy to put on your web servers say 200g at the time of writing as being the largest high speed server-grade discs that can be obtained
i assume you want to use 1u web servers so you won t be able to store more than that in raid1 depending on your vendor then you can get very good read-scaling by placing a copy of all the images on every web server

375484
mvp	presenter
the presenter or the controller depending if you do mvc or mvp should know about it not the domain the domain will assert defensive coding is as all needed values ok or throw an exception not ask for it
so let say you don t supply the number your model throw a authorizationnumberrequiredexception then your presenter handle it from there

375694
put	get
can you create a .vbs file and put this in it save the file and double click it
if you get an error then i would think there is an issue with it being registered if you don t get an error then i would look at office and vba and see if something is missing or not installed properly

375708
multiplying	division
it would multiplying 2 32-bit integers and split the results across 2 registers but not division as far as i recall
more than likely the division limitation stems from the fact that you re compiling for 32-bit instead of 64-bit

376065
google-chrome	firefox
hopefully it ll render ok in google-chrome and safari
the reason is that there are fixes available to make ie work properly but not many to make firefox behave badly

376462
ienumerable	ienumerator
however with just ienumerable ienumerator there is no way to know for sure wether or not there are more if you use foreach
if you need to know this use ienumerable yourself which is what foreach does

376486
post	get
to enable get instead of post decorate your operation with the following additional attribute
you get the method not allowed error because the default http verb for the web service calls is post and when you just type the url in the web browser the verb is get

376486
post	get
you get the method not allowed error because the default http verb for the web service calls is post and when you just type the url in the web browser the verb is get
use an http debugger tool like fiddler to simulate post requests

376828
interpreted-language	compiled-language
it is not true that interpreted-language are mostly ducktyped
it is not true that compiled-language mostly have strong typing

377155
polymorphism	specialization
so this works for a list of any element type - it s what would be called a function template in c++ or a polymorphism function in haskell not the same as a polymorphism class in c++
we can now define that by providing specialization for each interesting case measure the empty list and you get zero

377777
hide	show
dan i remember trying to do something similar many years ago and could not achieve it. what i ended up doing was adding a empty top level menu with the same caption as the menu on the ocx control and having it always be disabled. then when the ocx got focus i would hide my disabled menu item making it look as if clicking on the ocx had enabled the menu item
it saves all the ugly jumping around as menus appear and disappear obviously once the ocx lost focus i would show the disabled menu again

379749
post	get
for displaying the index page you only have to select data from one table board_forums - this is definitely much faster than selecting a second table to get the last post information even when using a clever join
updating board___forums whenever a post or a reply is inserted is - regarding performance - not the worst idea

380637
uninstall	upgrade
not a direct answer but the key difference between an upgrade and an uninstall+ a reinstall is that any custom uninstall steps are not called in 2k8 but are in 2k5
this is referenced in visual studio 2005 - 2008 10 service installer project upgrade issue the other difference related to this is that in 2k8 the files get upgrade based on the version info resource - if your modules dont have newer versions they dont get replaced

380671
installation	upgrade	installation	downgrade
not meaning to be smart but how would this help the user - it merely exposes them to risk of undoing a good installation
see also .net install package sometimes not completely removing previous versions as 2008 doesnt do a naive uninstall + install the install step would need to be able to handle both upgrade and downgrade scenarios

381385
ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	icollection
the .net 3.5 extension method ienumerable t .count will enumerate behind the scenes if the return value does not implement icollection t which may be undesirable
i often return ilist t or icollection t when the result is a collection - internally your method can use a list t and either return it as-is or return list t .asreadonly if you want to protect against modification if you re caching the list internally

381559
salt	md5
i ll add a caveat to s.lott s answer of do not store passwords store digests of passwords if you really want to protect against attacks make sure you use salt in the digest
if it s a well-known algorithm like md5 and someone can get hold of the hash output then on their own cpu time they can rapidly check against possible passwords and if they find a match then they ve got the password

382034
sequence	permutation
my approach is a recursive generator that doesn t follow branches that contain illegal sequence
here s the python 3 code the implentation is written for readability not speed but the algorithm should be much faster than naively filtering all permutation

382528
rsa	3des	rsa	dsa	rsa	aes
for some reason when i use that short-cut i can t decode the data correctly but if i use the rsa long way it works.
now this application was never fully finished so i don t support things like dsa key-pairs but i do support rsa key pairs with sha1 md5 using idea aes i think my 3des code does not work correctly but i may have fixed that since

rss	feed
many people think that rss should be plain text and that css in rss feed is inappropriate
it s probably not appropriate to impose a different font on your rss feed

382967
put	get
while you are absolutely correct that namespaces are good wholesome and completely necessary it sounds like considerable effort has been put forth to establish the status quo on your team
the only way i think you have a chance of selling the idea is to set hard numbers on the cost of not having namespaces maintainability debugging etc. and get executive management on board

inherited	properties
objects which are created using function.prototype as constructor would inherited its properties - but as there should be no reason to do something insane like this setting it to null undefined or an empty object is reasonable function.prototype.prototype.prototype will in all likelyhood be undefined as we have seen before function.prototype.prototype should be something without properties null undefined or an empty object and definetely not a function object
therefore its prototype properties should be undefined or might even throw an error when trying to be accessed hope this helps

383540
inherited	properties
you might also involuntarily access its inherited properties if you don t check hasownproperty
javascript s built-in array type does not help one bit javascript arrays are not associative arrays but just objects with a few more special properties

383652
filesystems	ntfs
ok so if i can figure out how to get your application to write a file to the filesystems because you granted read write to the entire application s virtual directory i can now write an aspx file you your website invoke it and run arbitrary code including cool things like wmi calls and com interop
why not just preclude the possibility when it is so cheap timewise to set ntfs permissions

383705
hash	md5
crypto hash results could be considered as integers but they won t fit in a java int - you could use a biginteger to hold them as suggested in another answer
incidentally if you re put off by the idea of a collision being extremely unlikely it s probably similar likelihood that a bit would randomly flip in your computer memory or hard disk and cause any program to behave differently than you expect - note there are also some theoretical weaknesses in some hash functions md5 but for your purposes that probably doesn t matter and you could just use the most efficient such function - those weaknesses are only relevant if someone is maliciously trying to come up with strings that have the same code as another string

384087
stringbuilder	stringwriter	stringbuilder	bufferedwriter	stringbuilder	printwriter
all of these concrete classes implement the appendable interface bufferedwriter chararraywriter charbuffer filewriter filterwriter logstream outputstreamwriter pipedwriter printstream printwriter stringbuffer stringbuilder stringwriter writer
in java these concrete classes all implement the charsequence interface charbuffer string stringbuffer stringbuilder these concrete classes do not have a common parent class other than object so there is nothing that relates them other than the fact they each have something to do with arrays of characters representing such or manipulating such

384640
bazaar	git
basically id does not make any sense with bazaar git and other distributed source code management tools
as i ve written before having automatically generated id tags that show a sensible version number is impossible to do with dscm tools like bazaar because everybody s line of development can be different from all others

384672
integer	unsigned
if you design your software around platform-neutral integer type names probably using the c99 header which when the types are available on the platform provides in signed listed and unsigned not listed
prefix with u int8_t - 8-bit integers int16_t - 16-bit integers int32_t - 32-bit integers int64_t - 64-bit integers uintptr_t - unsigned integers big enough to hold pointers intmax_t - biggest size of integer on the platform might be larger than int64_t you can then code your application using these types where it matters and being very careful with system types which might be different

385054
typedef	typename
to simplify it you were allowed to typedef it to a single name data type
allowed functions taking a parameter of the enum to be defined as void f myenum x instead of the longer void f enum myenum x note that the name of the typename does not need to be equal to the name of the enum

385407
inherited	properties
therefore abstraction polymorphism and inherited aren t forms of encapsulation but forms of extending and modifying encapsulated code
different forms of encapsulation would mean the modifiers on properties methods fields and classes - that is public private static virtual in c#

385494
maven	buildr
maven had already left all m1 users high and dry with the need to redo all of their build systems and some of mine cannot be expressed in m2 as far as i can tell
i ve been using buildr for some of my projects

385583
int	double
note however that if the string does represent an int but that int does not fit into a 32-bit signed int then you ll actually get an object of type long instead
you can then convert it to other widths and signednesses with some simple math you can convert strings to floating point with the float function python floats are what other languages refer to as double they are 64-bits

385727
directcast	out
for c# developers trycast is similar to as and directcast is the equivalent of normal casting
as mike pointed out in the comments as works for nullable value types but trycast doesn t. if the value really should be a t then directcast is indeed the right way to go - it fails fast with an appropriate error

387116
x86	64bit
i heard in the latest .net-rocks podcast that setting x86 instead of any cpu in the build configuration should resolve a lot of problems but since i haven t had any problems other than the one i described i have not yet tried that
i run vista 64 and the other members of my team run xp 32 bits the only issue we ve had so far was with a third party com-component where the interop assembly wasn t easy to generate on the 64bit machine

387902
post	get
as mentioned in the other post its faster
you also get immediate feedback to see if it looks right and isn t confusing to the user

388090
memcpy	memmove
memcpy should have that behavior
memmove doesn t by design if the blocks of memory overlap it copies the contents starting at the ends of the buffers to avoid that sort of behavior

388658
google-chrome	safari
since you are on windows anyway you could try using the inbuilt javascript debugger of google-chrome which is a browser very similar to safari although the javascript engine is different
well apart from the error console that can be opened from the develop menu which in turn can be enabled in prefences advanced show develop menu in menu bar there aren t many javascript debugging options in safari afaik

389389
keydown	mouseup	keydown	mousedown	keyup	mouseup	keyup	mousedown
you ll have to do that with a keydown and keyup event
also be aware that a mousedown event may not ever be followed by a mouseup event if the user moves the mouse after pressing down to a point where it is no longer over the button

389824
innodb	myisam
innodb enforces foreign key constraints
myisam doesn t enforce or even store foreign key constraints

390498
do-while	goto
i think what you are looking for is a do-while loop
i 100 agree that while true is not a good idea because it makes it hard to maintain this code and the way you are escaping the loop is very goto esque which is considered bad practice

390523
goto	break
the argument i have against using a break to get out of an endless loop is that you re essentially using the break statement as a goto
i m not religiously against using goto if the language supports it it s fair game but i do try to replace it if there s a more readable alternative

390523
goto	break
i m not religiously against using goto if the language supports it it s fair game but i do try to replace it if there s a more readable alternative
in the case of many break points i would replace them with consolidating all of the stop conditions this way makes it a lot easier to see what s going to end this loop

390717
put	get
the problem is you wouldn t want to put sensitive data there as any malicious body can see and modify it

391589
mouse	keyboard
you need to trick emacs into thinking that the keyboard was not being used which is not as intuitive as tricking it into thinking that the mouse was used
defadvice find-file-read-args around find-file-read-args-always-use-dialog-box act simulate invoking menu item as if by the mouse

392428
post	get
when i m in a hurry to do something real quick and dirty i just do a httpservice send call where i ve composed an http post the data is not visible in the url as it is with a get
a quickly written java servlet processes the post and receives the data as a map of name value pairs in text format

392428
post	get
a quickly written java servlet processes the post and receives the data as a map of name value pairs in text format
the httpserivce.send method behaves asynchronously like the ajax xmlhttprequest mechanism. it just doesn t get any simpler than doing something like that but name value pairs is not as flexible as structured data

392646
gif	png
a png is almost always smaller than the equivalent gif and will not lose quality like a jpeg file
a png equivalent of a jpeg will typically be a lot larger assuming it s photorealistic

392778
superclass	subclassing
a virtual method is shown to be overridden by a subclassing and calls to that method even on the superclass type or from inside code of the superclass will call the replacement implementation from the subclassing
then a concrete method is shown one not marked as virtual or abstract being hidden by using the new keyword when defining a method with an identical signature on the subclassing

393719
folder	directory
this is because of folder redirection in windows vista
if you do not normally have the rights to write something into the c program files-folder vista will silently redirect those writes into a secret folder inside your user directory

393924
profiling	debugging
there still doesn t seem to be a good answer to these just do lots of profiling and keep trying to figure it out
a couple of years ago when i did this i had to use a combination of printf debugging and quickcheck

394333
inherited	subclassing
your classes that inherited from wxwidgets wxpython data types should not implement any business logic
wxwidgets is a gui library so any subclassing of wxapp or wxframe should remain focused on gui that is on displaying the interface and being responsive to user actions

394350
versioning	upgrade
i usually assume that ignoring a new versioning of a library coz it doesn t have any interesting features or improvements is a mistake because one day you ll find out that this versioning is necessary for the migration to the next versioning which you might want to upgrade to
so my advice is to review carefully what has changed in the new versioning and consider whether the changes requires a lot of testing or little

394966
pop-up	dialog
if you need further interaction based on the results of your initial dialog then i would consider either adding another modal dialog that you pop-up after the current one is closed with your ajax results or insert the ajax results into your main interface and deal with it there
i suppose you could do this given that you have a close x button on the dialog by simply replacing the contents of the message with your results and removing the buttons so your callback doesn t get fired again

395254
hash	salt	hash	md5
why not just make the links dynamic and indirect for example on page x static on page y dynamically generated and replace timestamp w the current time in msec since 1970 counter a counter that you increment once per download hash md5 hash of concatenate timestamp counter secret salt where secret salt any favorite code you keep secret
then on page z.php you just recalculate the hash from the counter and timestamp in the query string check that it matches the hash in the query string and that the timestamp is recent from the previous 30 minutes or 60 minutes or whatever

395319
atomic	interlocked
making it volatile doesn t give you any guarantee of atomic if you have the desire to modify the integer a read increment write operation
for integers a mutex or monitor may be too heavy depends on your use case and that s what the interlocked class is for

395649
width	height
don t use padding left and right and width on the same element unless you know well how that ll work out
if an element is floated give its parent overflow hidden and height 1 if the parent does not already have a height

395725
firefox	safari
for stuff that works in firefox but not in ie i debug in visual studio
i ve also got the developer toolbar installed in ie and have the develop menu turned on in safari

395751
inherited	properties
it also normally requires a lot of copy.copy ing to maintain inherited and to copy from class to instance and means you have to look in many places to see whats going on always looking from metaclass up which goes against the python grain also. i have been picking through formencode and sqlalchemy code to see if such a declarative style was worth it and its clearly not
such style should be left to descriptors such as properties and methods and immutable data. ruby has better support for such declarative styles and i am glad the core python language is not going down that route

395751
metaclass	subclassing
sqlalchemy for example does use them elsewhere to add a particular custom method to all subclassing based on an attribute value in their class definition e.g a toy example could have a metaclass that generated a method in that class with special properties based on hello say a method that added hello to the end of a string
it could be good for maintainability to make sure you did not have to write a method in every subclassing you make instead all you have to define is method_maker_value

396114
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
if you want to do case-sensitive compare on strings then you could use a switch statement as it is faster than performing a string.compare in an if else
for some actual performance tests however if you wanted to do a case-insensitive then it is better using a if else as the resulting code is not pretty

396270
maven	pom.xml
and for anyone looking to set up an internal repository server look here half of the problem with using maven 2 is finding the docs
i ll assume that you re asking how to push a dependency out to a well-known repository and not simply asking how to update your pom.xml

396773
tunnel	packets
most of them use some sort of tunnel to get around bridges and non-compliant routers
one caveat for multicast packets however is if there are any wifi connections the access point will use the slowest possible bit rate for the multicast packets and requires acks from all clients even those who are not part of the multicast group

396805
firefox	safari
firefox still doesn t have a large enough market share to be the targeted browser
it s not realistic that your site is 100 perfect in every browser but targetting the big ones should always be done ie6+ firefox 2+ safari 3 any good javascript library should work or at least degrade nicely over the three major browsers

397615
sudo	passwd
you could consider sudo
although not passwordless it doesn t require the user to be given the root passwd

398846
int	double
2 the code return math.round n precision precision .tostring does not compile due to an ambiguity between math.round double int and math.round decimal int
you will have to cast to decimal not double since it is a financial app and therefore can as well go with decimal in the first place

398918
versioning	upgrade
versioning specific folders are no good
what you need to do is make sure all subsequent installers upgrade properly over the previous versions so that different folders are not required

398918
versioning	upgrade
what you need to do is make sure all subsequent installers upgrade properly over the previous versioning so that different folders are not required
you may want to do something like progfiles app 1.0 using the major and minor version number if you want to allow side by side installs of different versioning

lsp	principles
lsp the liskov substition principles subtypes must be substitutable for their base types
dip the dependency inversion principles abstractions should not depend upon details

entity-relationship	diagram
data normalization is utterly irrelevant to entity-relationship diagramming
a well built entity-relationship diagram will have very little harmful redundancy in it but that s largely serendipity and not the result of careful planning

400773
entity-relationship	diagram	entity-relationship	entities
a well built entity-relationship diagram will have very little harmful redundancy in it but that s largely serendipity and not the result of careful planning
the entities and relationships in a stakeholder oriented entity-relationship diagram should only include entities that are understood by the subject matter experts and not include entities or relationships that are added in the course of logical database design

400773
entity-relationship	entities
the entities and relationships in a stakeholder oriented entity-relationship diagram should only include entities that are understood by the subject matter experts and not include entities or relationships that are added in the course of logical database design
values to be held in a database and served up on demand can be connected to attributes and attributes can in turn be connected to either entities or relationships among entities

401392
goto	break
it s like using goto - just a terrible style d
first of all reintroduce break the inheritance chain and should not be used and i mean never ever

401412
folder	directory
if the app doesn t already have permissions to mess with that folder you might be able to write a custom action to remedy the problem by adding the necessary permissions to your process
another way of doing this is to make sure that the directory deletion is happening within a custom action that you control as in you own maintain the code that performs the deletion rather than rely on msiexec to do it for you

401698
hash	salt
but if the string is salt say with the string my_personal_salt the hash for the empty string my_personal_salt becomes aeac2612626724592271634fb14d3ea6 hence non-obvious to backtrace
what i m trying to say that it s better to use any salt than not to

401698
salt	md5
therefore it s not too much of an importance to know which salt to use
there are actually websites that do just this - you can feed it a md5 hash and it spits out a known plaintext that generates that particular hash

402623
unsigned	short
the statement that you show doesn t cast a char to an unsigned short it casts a pointer to a char to a pointer to an unsigned short
this means that the usual arithmetic conversions of the pointed-to-data are not going to happen and that the underlying char data will just be interpreted as unsigned shorts when accessed through the slt variable

402623
unsigned	short
this means that the usual arithmetic conversions of the pointed-to-data are not going to happen and that the underlying char data will just be interpreted as unsigned shorts when accessed through the slt variable
note that sizeof unsigned short is unlikely to be one so that won t necessarily correspond to

402635
unsigned	short
that will interpret the bytes making up the array as unsigned short objects when you read from that pointer s target
strictly speaking the above is undefined behavior because you can t be sure the array is suitable aligned and you would read from a pointer that s not pointing at the type of the original pointed type unsigned char - unsigned short

402759
rss	feed
drawbacks for parsing the html include adding a whopping great dependency on their website layout -- this could be mitigated by giving them the php that generates rss for them to host as it would add value to their website as well as transferring ownership of maintenance to them
as there isn t yet an rss feed for your target -- you could write one in php which iirc joomla is written in so i ll assume support

402759
rss	feed
as there isn t yet an rss feed for your target -- you could write one in php which iirc joomla is written in so i ll assume support
you simply need to connect to the remote website and parse the html regular expressions are your friend here to generate the feed data

403849
button	checkbox
and then a checkbox with yes i accept the responsibility for my actions and two button yes i want to delete it this button should only be enabled if the checkbox is checked
oh crap that s not what i meant at all this button can always be enabled

403971
client-side	server-side
if you have a client-side method that uses xslt to dynamically render an element in the page make sure it s not loading and compiling the xslt every time it s called
if you re using server-side xslt cache the xslt processor object in whatever collection your server environment supports

404802
try-catch	exception-handling
also since you raised the issue yes the try-catch block does incur some overhead even if the exception-handling is not thrown
personally and i think this is backed up by convention eafp is never a good way to go. you can look at it as an equivalent to the following as opposed to moreover consider the following this may look a lot less elegant and yes this is a crude example - bear with me but it gives you much greater granularity in handling the error as opposed to wrapping it all in a try-catch to get that nullpointerexception and then try to figure out where and why you got it

404857
innodb	myisam
any data you need transactions for must be in an innodb table and you manage the transactions using whatever access library you are using or with manual sql commands
given that you can t have transactions in myisam tables i am not sure what the actual problem is

405021
postgresql	mysql
see the mysql 5.1 faq if you plan to use postgresql it is possible look here
if you plan to use mysql 5.1 it is not possible to pass in an array

405038
put	get
this way you don t need config files for enabling disabling features there is no feature access code as you should have if you put everything into one application
also there is no chance that your user hacks your application or key and get access to features he did not pay

405055
switching	screens
this will allow you to draw on screens using only 2d coordinates if you want 3d later on switching from ortho to perspective view and you have 3d however i don t think it will help you reuse the code since the 2d ortho view is usually done with textures and you cannot transform a texture to a 3d mesh
maybe a better approach is to do everything in 3d and setup your camera to look from above if you do that later you can switching to 3d just by relocating the camera and making better models and textures

406274
int	chars
other than that little distinction there really isn t a big difference between int and int
consider how many folks declare main int argc chars argv vs main int argc chars argv . attention all memory addresses here are fictional

406501
children	parent
ie doesn t seem to calculate the height of the parent when all the children are floated
if you can get away with applying a fixed height to the parent you ll be able to add bottom padding

406588
margin	height
which means that officially margin padding width and height properties should be ignored in practice not really
if i were to go the right way to set the height to a button i would write something like display block and then define the height

406807
accessor	properties
i believe this is almost identical to making the fields public maybe a bit different if you re using threads but generally is not the case or if your accessor have business presentation logic something strange at least
i m not in favor of public fields but against making a getter setter or properties for everyone of them and then claiming that doing that is encapsulation or information hiding .

407474
google-chrome	safari
if it s working fine on safari it will probably work on google-chrome as well
the only difference is the javascript engine but i ve yet to see a real world example of some legitim javascript code not working on google-chrome

407475
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome doesn t have much of a user-base now but i can imagine that will change
theoretically because google google-chrome uses the same engine as safari webkit you ve already tested

408200
for-loop	loops
matlab s for-loop is static in nature
you cannot modify loops variable between iterations unlike the for initialization

408513
filesystems	hfs
i couldn t easily find information about which filesystems use efficient data structures like b-trees for large directories
i did find a claim that the macos hfs does

408611
for-loop	loops
an interesting side note is that the following two loops do not execute the same the first loops creates a variable i that is a scalar and it iterates it like a c for-loop
note that if you modify i in loops body the modified value will be ignored as zach says

408828
awt	swing
any serious java ui work is done in swing not awt which was primarily used for applets
swing vs awt

409171
int	double
first never use floats or double if you want to represent decimal values exactly - use either int types int long etc or decimal which is just an int type with a scaling factor
floats and double are converted internally to an exponential representation in base 2 and numbers represented exactly in an exponential representation in base 10 cannot in general be represented exactly

409235
client-side	server-side
if i understand correctly the i think you should use a client-side javascript timer instead
you can not use a server-side timer for this

410415
dotnetzip	system.io.compression
these stream classes are shipped in the dotnetzlib assembly available in the dotnetzip distribution at
also - keep in mind the deflatestream in system.io.compression does not implement the most efficient deflate algorithm

410814
toolchain	binutils
building a toolchain from scratch especially for cross-compiling purposes is tedious and can be a complete pain
also the newest versions of glibc or uclibc gcc and binutils aren t always compatible as they re developed independently

410831
inherited	properties
table per concrete class is an inherited model which gives problems at runtime as you can have the situation where one updates the address of land but not of house while they re the same semantically
i.o.w. drop this model and introduce table-per-subclass so you have a properties base table with id and address and two separated tables with a pk which is an fk to the pk of properties base one is house with the house specific fields the other is land with the land specific fields

411026
try-catch	exception-handling
the bad thing about using try-catch block everywhere is that in consuming the exception-handling you potentially conceal bad code
try-finally without the catch does not hide exception-handling but does provide code execution guarantees

411034
integer	unsigned
for integer division otoh unsigned integers are a tad faster on the arm
the arm does not has a hardware divide unit so division is done in software and is always done on unsigned values

411480

postgresql	mysql
enterprisedb is a company that provides supported commercial versions of postgresql with some value-added software
mysql 5.x has a feature set that supports a reasonable cross section of capabilities but it is not as feature-rich as postgresql

412091
postgresql	mysql
for any application that wants to use an open source database the hands-down answer is postgresql
it s a lot more enterprise-ready than mysql not to mention that it follows the sql standard a lot better

412589
pthreads	fork
i m assuming you re working on a mac application so the links are to apple s documentation for these functions but they re all pthreads so you should be to use them on any posix-compliant system
fork exec and wait should work if you re not really looking for a objective-c specific way

free	malloc	free	calloc	free	memset

i would use calloc instead or add a memset after malloc

413093
equals	icomparable
the system.object class equals and gethashcode - not all classes are comparable or hashable should be moved to an interface
iequatable or icomparable or similar comes to mind

414143
vsto	add-in
requires code-access security on installation vsto 3 - can only be used for excel 2007 add-in
does not require code-access security excel 2003 - can install add-in for all users or per-user

414231
versioning	upgrade
this can lead to surprising results such as installing neatoapp 2008 and discovering that it knows all the settings you chose for neatoapp 2003 even though the 2003 versioning was never installed on your current machine
as an addendum to harms answer i would note that like the windows registry os x preferences are deliberately not deleted when the app is removed but unlike the windows registry preferences can migrate from machine to machine as you upgrade your mac and use the user migration facility

415016
keydown	keyrelease
when the key is pressed you set the the appropriate index to true in the keydown method and in your game rendering loop you call depending on what keys in the array are true
you set the key value to false when the key is released in the keyrelease event method i m not sure what it is in c#

415444
bash	zsh
bash complicates this in that .bashrc is only read by a shell that s both interactive and non-login so you ll find most people end up telling their .bash_profile to also read .bashrc with something like other shells behave differently - eg with zsh .zshrc is always read for an interactive shell whether it s a login one or not
the manual page for bash explains the circumstances under which each file is read

416681
try-catch	exception-handling
maybe whoever came up with the requirement doesn t understand that you can still catch all exception-handling at the top without putting a try-catch in every single function
you can see an example of how to catch all unhandled exception-handling here

416898
goto	break
c++ goto break_iterate_rows is just a visible version of break iterate_rows if you confine your use of goto and labels on this kind of code only you will not be figuring out the intent
limiting your use of goto and labels on this kind of code will make you just read the code not analyzing or figuring it out

416917
boost	allocator
replacing your containers with boost containers is not a good idea
the work to make appropriate custom allocator wouldn t be that bad but you d be violating the spirit of your allocate at startup rule

417126
profiler	perf
for instance if your application hits a database and the disk is slow causing queries to take longer that might not be apparent in a profiler since the application will be running slower in general
for the client side if your app does not require administrative access on install i might make perf counters part of a diagnostics mode since installing them requires admin access

equals	tostring	equals	gethashcode
here s my set of tuples they re autogenerated by a python script so i ve perhaps gone a bit overboard link to subversion repository you ll need a username password they re both guest they are based on inheritance but will not compare equals to even if they happen to have the same values for the two first members
they also implement gethashcode and tostring and so forth and lots of smallish helper methods

417992
invariantculture	cultureinfo
security considerations if a security decision will be made based on the result of a string comparison or case change your application should use an ordinal comparison that ignores case instead of using invariantculture
... string operations if your application needs to perform a culture-sensitive string operation that is not affected by the value of currentculture it should use a method that accepts a cultureinfo parameter. ... persisting data the invariantculture property is useful for storing data that will not be displayed directly to users. storing data in a culture-independent format guarantees a known format that does not change

418080
uilabel	nsstring
if the text fields are not directly editable by the user you may want to use uilabel instead which is basically just a non-editable text field and which also has a read write text property
uitextfield objects have a text property of type nsstring that can be read and written

418903
config	ini
here s a piece of code that probably does the job disclaimer i don t know anything about the config format for kerberos the code is based on what you posted here
edit parsing the ini format is not difficult either

419098
rational-numbers	integer	floating-point	integer
to calculate that you ll have to use the floating-point type mpf_t or the rational-numbers type mpq_t
the mpz_t data type can only store integers and 2 -18 is not an integer

419668
disk	ram
thus the number of passes and the localization of comparisons can be more important than the raw number of comparisons since comparisons of nearby elements to one another happen at system bus speed or with caching even at cpu speed which compared to disk speed is virtually instantaneous
for example the popular recursive quicksort algorithm provides quite reasonable performance with adequate ram but due to the recursive way that it copies portions of the array it becomes much less practical when the array does not fit in ram because it may cause a number of slow copy or move operations to and from disk

419869
freebsd	linux
not really a comparison but here are what big projects are using centralized vcses subversion apache gcc ruby mplayer zope plone xiph freebsd webkit .
cvs cvs distributed vcses git linux kernel kde perl ruby on rails android wine fedora x.org mediawiki django vlc mono gnome samba cups gnupg emacs elpa.

420039
cpu	processors
the power of the mainframe lies not in it s cpu grunt the individual processors aren t that powerful but they come in books of 54 cpus with hot backups and you can run many books in a single system z box but in the fact that all the cpu does is process instructions
everything else is offloaded to specialist processors ziips for db2 zaaps for java workloads other devices for i o and i o is where the mainframe kills every other system using fibre optics and very large disk arrays

420240
equals	compareto
use case contexts comparable interface the equals method and and operators test for equality inequality but do not provide a way to test for relative values
some classes eg string and other classes with a natural ordering implement the interface which defines a compareto method

420251
comparator	comparable
if you are implementing your own classes which you know you want to compare at some stage you may have them implement the comparable interface and implement the comparator method accordingly
if you are using some classes from an api which do not implement the comparable interface but you still want to compare them

420889
hash	salt
one purpose of salting is to defeat precomputed hash tables
if someone has a list of millions of pre-computed hashes they aren t going to be able to look up 1 foo te5sbm.7c25ffdu6birbx1 in their table even though they know the hash and the salt

421147
hash	salt
changing even one bit in the input of a cryptographic hash function should completely change the output
this means you cannot build a rainbow table with the common passwords and then later update it with some salt

421147
hash	salt
because you cannot get to the password from the hash you precompute all the hash of the most likely used passwords and then compare your hash with their hash
quality of the salt but say foo would be an extremely poor choice of salt

421149
put	get
not only are the online docs incredibly slow the problem is compounded by someones s iffy decision to put class summaries constructors and methods properties all on seperate pages so it just takes forever
someone said to get the docs installer and install docs locally for a slightly improved experience

421386
union	distinct
a union can be deceptive with respect to result set ordering because a database will sometimes use a sort method to provide the distinct that is implicit in union which makes it look like the rows are deliberately ordered -- this doesn t apply to union all for which there is no implicit distinct of course
however there are algorithms for the implicit distinct such as oracle s hash method in 10g+ for which no ordering will be applied

422019
union	distinct
you can get a list of rows with the team_id and whether or not the game was played at home or away select case ha.home when 0 then g.away_team_id else g.home_team_id end as team_id case ha.home when 0 then 0 else 1 end as home_games case ha.home when 0 then 1 else 0 end as away_games from game as g select 0 as home union select 1 as home as ha from there you can simply sum up the games at home and away for each team select t.team_id sum t.home_games as home_games sum t.away_games as away_games from select case ha.home when 0 then g.away_team_id else g.home_team_id end as team_id case ha.home when 0 then 0 else 1 end as home_games case ha.home when 0 then 1 else 0 end as away_games from game as g select 0 as home union select 1 as home as ha as t group by t.team_id this will result in a single table scan
if you want the distinct list of teams you have to select from the game table twice unioning the home and the away teams theoretically one team could play all its games on the road or at home if you have logic that prevents that then you could adjust this query select home_team_id as team_id from game union select away_team_id as team_id from game the union operator will make sure you only get distinct elements in the return set unless you use union all from there you can use left outer joins to aggregate your data if you want to reduce your table scans even further the above will produce four you can add more code but it will cost you

422353
feeds	rss
it is not ms specific however but should provide the flexibility you need - a configuration server holding the configuration and providing the feeds needed to configure the clients and possibly servers
you could use rss together with bittorrent to distribute changes

422511
kerberos	ntlm
from my experience kerberos is more of a prefered method but i have not worked with it much so unfortunately i don t have much advise as far as that goes
on a side note i recall reading somewhere that the jre also has ways of tying into ntlm on your web server in order to obtain identity information for the authenticated user

422650
nsscanner	nsstring
even that s not needed for args though since nsscanner will overwrite what s there anyway
the rangeofstring would work if you want to go this route you can trim leading whitespaces using nsstring s stringbytrimmingcharactersinset method i would also test to be sure both arguments and the command exist or you ll get an error

422849
implements	extends
and since you want to avoid code duplication the symmetric operators can be implements in terms of the compound assignment ones as in your code example although convention recommends making the temporary inside the function
the big thing to consider when writing any operator is that member operators do not undergo conversions on the left parameter this is because conversion never applies to this for member functions and this extends to operators

423209
post	put
i ve already posted the solution in a duplicate question but for anyone that may require this information i ll post it here as well
as far as i am aware it is not possible to put it in the same layer but it is possible to put several images in separate div s on top of one another and has been implemented by popular usability testing website silverback check the background to see how it has been layered

423284
udp	tcp
just a heads up i would recommend first working with tcp rather than udp
udp doesn t automatically redeliver lost packets like tcp so it will add another element to the equation that will probably just confuse you as you re just starting out

423683
m2e	pom.xml
i have found that any time you update a project s pom.xml it helps to rerun m2e or it will not see the new external dependencies
if you have not tried to run this since you added your new dependencies jpa + hibernate or whatever to your pom.xml then give it a shot and see if it works

423733
rss	feed
currently generating rss feed of podcasts in the itunes music store does not appear to be supported
you can generate a limited set of rss feed for information in the itunes store but podcasts are not included

423733
rss	feed
you can generate a limited set of rss feed for information in the itunes store but podcasts are not included
you can generate these feed using apple s itunes music store rss generator

423733
rss	feed
you can generate these feed using apple s itunes music store rss generator
furthermore this really isn t the type of thing rss is designed to do

424308
accessor	properties
if you re not entirely comfortable with that write a properties accessor on the page that acts as a facade to retrieve the value from the viewstate
later if you feel compelled to convert it to a hidden field the accessor can handle that switch seemlessly for the rest of the code

424805
put	get
you will rapidly find that those not null constraints are a pita when you are gathering them on page 3 because they put customers off on page 1
because the forms are liable to change as they get rearranged you ll end up separating the business logic from the view pretty early on and generalising how you populate your model

424827
centos	linux
i couldn t stand to use rhel centos without it
fedora generates missing but compatible packages for rhel and they host them in a repository called epel extra packages for enterprise linux

424835
min	max
the naive algorithm is too loop and update min max
however a recursive solution will require less comparisons than naive algorithm if you want to get min max simultaneously it isn t necessarily faster due to function call overhead

424984
cpu	processors
definetely parallel programming will advance a lot in the future since cpu are not going to become much faster anymore we simply will have lots of them
having dual or quad cores is just the beginning there will be systems with a much higher number of processors in the near future currently there are cpu with 256 cores windows 7 will have support for such processors

425058
tiff	png
lzw-compressed tiff always wins hand over jpeg both in viewable quality and file size i think because tiff can take advantages of rle encoding for whitespace
i m not sure whether png can do this too or whether rle can be extended for multicolor images not just black white

425061
x86	64bit
as has been stated the 64bit jit compiler behaves differently to the x86 jit compiler
the x86 compiler will take advantage of some optimizations that the x64 one does not

425061
x86	64bit
the x86 compiler will take advantage of some optimizations that the x64 one does not
for example in .net 3.5 the 32-bit jit will inline function calls with structs as arguments but the 64bit jit does not

425572
filepath	unc
when you open a file via a web browser the web browser downloads the file locally then sends a local filepath to the application that opens it
even in the case you are using a unc in your href adobe does not get that unc path to save back to it is getting a local machine path

427015
cdr	cons
what a future destructive function does setf cdr though is not the responsibility of the first non-destructive function
you have to think of lists in terms of cons cells

427149
cairngorm	flex
mvc frameworks are all the rage in ria applications such as adobe flex-based web programming cairngorm mate puremvc etc.
in my company our first flex app was not done as mvc yet we had multiple views into the model

427231
getter	setter
your second example won t compile as the getter s value variable doesn t exist
also the setter would result in the eponymous stackoverflow exception

427737
stringbuilder	stringwriter
unfortunately stringwriter doesn t let you specify the encoding directly so you need a class like this this question is similar but not quite a duplicate. edit to answer the comment pass the stringwriterwithencoding to xmlwriter.create instead of the stringbuilder then call tostring on it at the end
you need to use a stringwriter with the appropriate encoding

429192
websphere	ibm
i assume by websphere you mean the regular j2ee application server and not something like community edition
websphere is a brand name applied to a number of ibm products

429215
nullreferenceexception	argumentnullexception
to address the people that advocate allowing the runtime to throw a nullreferenceexception i started a topic on the subject of whether or not it is a good idea to proactively throw an argumentnullexception or to let the runtime throw a nullreferenceexception
the basic consensus was that it s a good idea to take the proactive approach rather than the nullreferenceexception approach

429859
post	get
the benefit is you wouldn t need to use https or post
get rest api methods should be using the http get method i m not sure if being restful is your goal just thought i would point that out

430045
post	get
you should suggest to the management that if they re not going to take security seriously then you should just go ahead and post the company s bank statements and accounting books in clear text on the site with a prominent link from the home page
at least that way you can tell them the end result will be about the same but they re less likely to damage everything else to get what they re looking for

430261
int	boolean
basically c has two main simple data types int and floating point numbers though various precisions
everything else boolean enums not simple but it fits etc

430451
division	addition
for example addition is closed over the integers but division isn t 4 2 is integral but 5 2 isn t
so addition of integers is somehow complete in a sense that division isn t

430476
base	fractions
for convenience and because of some information-theoretic considerations i m not going to go into we usually express that as a number of bits which is lg n k where lg denotes the logarithm base 2
because we re used to thinking of bits as discrete things we actually usually take the ceiling of that number ie the least integer greater than lg n k but in fact the fractions value is perfectly legitimate

430810
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
this works on the original case-insensitive file system but not on the case-sensitive system
thus i would suggest that you avoid depending on whether the file system is case-sensitive or not if you can

432214
equals	gethashcode
i prefer not to override equals just to enable testing
don t forget that if you do override equals you really should override gethashcode also or you may get unexpected results if you are using your objects in a dictionary for example

433137
cpu	processors
with a high cache hit rate it will be more like 2 cpu bus clocks which is the clock rate of the bus between the cpu core and the cache but not necessarily the core s clock
modern processors such as core 2 duo that you mention are both superscalar and pipelined

433202
for-loop	loops
of course if you use this approach you won t want to unconditionally increment it in the for-loop
why not just call t2ps.clear at the end of loops

433725
int	chars
what you see is the sign preserving conversion from chars to int
the behavior results from the fact that on your system chars is signed note chars is not signed on all systems

433829
post	put
in regards to the custom skin there s a blog post from nina meiers that goes into a bit of detail on how to get a legacy skin to work in dnn 5
in the end i don t think she got it to work and it doesn t look like it d be a trivial task however so i d be prepared to put in some hours to learn how it works under the covers

433915
int	chars
i realize this doesn t exactly answer your question but it would make some sense for the rest of the chars literals to be sizeof int if the eof literal was
i remember reading k r and seeing a code snippet that would read a chars at a time until it hit eof

433980
subclass	inherited
seen from the outside your class derived is not a subclass of base only from inside the class itself
the same counts for protected inherited with the only difference that the base class now isn t private to the own class any more but rather to any derived class as well

434047
int	chars
edit just to be sure i checked my copy of expert c programming deep secrets and i confirmed that a chars literal does not start with a type int
it is initially of type chars but when it is used in an expression it is promoted to an int

434182
int	boolean
about boolean most other answers get it wrong - alignment and speed is why a programmer should stick to int for-loop counters not why the compiler can make a byte be 4-bytes wide
all of your reasonings in fact apply to byte and short as well as boolean

434740
floating-point	fixed-point	floating-point	integer
you can learn more about floating point comparisons here what every computer scientist should know about floating-point arithmetic
also when processing currency there is no reason you cannot simply store an integer representing cents instead of dollars so that you effectively have a fixed-point representation

435556
queue	fifo
in particular you can set each asp.net application pool with a max number of queue requests and max worker processes
each process has multiple threads up to a maximum not configurable afaik i may be wrong and incoming requests are processed on a fifo basis

435605
boost	stl
boost is full of great code you can t help but learn from
maybe not the sort of tip you were looking for but i have to say that my experience after a few years of moving from c++ stl to c++ boost stl is that i now spend a lot less time in gdb than i used to

435605
boost	stl
maybe not the sort of tip you were looking for but i have to say that my experience after a few years of moving from c++ stl to c++ boost stl is that i now spend a lot less time in gdb than i used to
i put this down to a number of things boost smart pointers particularly shared pointer and the pointer containers when performance is needed

435609
mouse	keyboard
mouse events however are not hookable in ce unless you write a new touch panel driver
you can capture keyboard events device-wide via hooks be aware that they are officially unsupported and so could disappear at any future release - though they ve been there as long as i ve been using ce which is a long time

435831
vb.net	vb6
if costs are a constraint you could try this there is a wizard in visual studio that will attempt to upgrade vb6 to vb.net
it s not 100 accurate and you will have to write code for things vb.net does not support such as control arrays etc

436114
spaces	linefeed
note that a single spaces is not enough though perhaps multiple spaces would help i don t know.
you can also insert a tab character at the end of the line just before the cr linefeed

436494
virtualbox	parallels
my current workhorse is virtualbox largely because it s free supports snapshots and runs on the various host platforms i have to use
i ve used vmware when the company would pay for it vmware server when the company would not virtualbox because it s free decent and supports snapshots parallels on the mac which i bought and xen

436628
int	chars
it s a common mistake that c++ programmers run into when they use chars as an 8 bit int type
while most integral types like short and int default to being signed chars does not have a default signage in c++

436939
width	height
try floating both elements to the left and apply a left-margin equal to the width of the decorative column to column2 as such you ll need a clearing div below both elements
the reason why this is happening it seems is because the image floated left isn t the height of the entire page

437763
int	chars
other than varargs functions though functions which return an int do not have to be declared and functions that return something other than an int do need a declaration that shows the return type but do not need the prototype for the argument list
note however that if the function takes arguments that are subject to normal promotions in the absence of prototypes for example a function that takes a chars or short - both of which are converted to int

438125
implements	modifiers
the problem is i can t make the interface or the implements methods protected here it is hence achieving what you wanted prevent interface and class usage outside of the package
this question is based on a wrong statement i know that an interface must be public not really you can have interfaces with default access modifiers

438695
equals	tostring	tostring	gethashcode
ggf31316 i believe that calling tostring equals and gethashcode result in boxing if the structure does not override the methods. i have checked tostring for you
int32 does override tostring so i made a struct that doesn t

439146
cvs	svn
i ve never really been a cvs user so i do not know what common use-cases the solved wanted to... by using check-out hooks actually i haven t known them
svn provides pre-commit and post-commit hooks among some others which should be able to do whatever one wants to be done per-change on the source

439486
put	get
when trying the delete on sms inbox or sms all you will probably get for additional reference too make sure to put this into your manifest for your intent receiver note the receiver tag does not look like this when i had those settings android gave me some crazy permissions exceptions that didn t allow android.phone to hand off the received sms to my intent
so do not put that receive_sms permission attribute in your intent

439925
equals	icomparable
unless you re using a dictionary which actually sorts the keys you should be more interested in and - you don t need to be able to say that one object is greater or less than another just whether or not they re equals and what one object s hash code is in a manner consistent with equals
implementing iequatable is like implementing icomparable - it means that an object can compare itself with another object of the specified type usually the same type

440239
int	double
in addition mehrdad s answer is correct for 32 bit int
in a compiler with a 64 bit double and a 64 bit int you ve got more problems of course... edit perhaps you meant the theoretical result of floor the largest integer value less than or equal to the argument may not be representable as an int

440454
rss	feed
the other answers is absolutely correct i would recommend against giving your feed a title of rss if the format used is actually atom
rss of course refers to an entirely separate format for feed and syndication and there s enough confusion among the general population about what the differences are that i wouldn t suggest feeding the fire

440454
rss	feed
rss of course refers to an entirely separate format for feed and syndication and there s enough confusion among the general population about what the differences are that i wouldn t suggest feeding the fire
- instead give your feed a more descriptive title such as news feed blog feed comics etc. based on your content

440500
gwt	dwr
so gwt isn t necessarily converting your full application into javascript though it can if you re willing to limit your use of java libraries and some functionality
at any rate if this approach calling out to java running on a server from within javascript appeals to you one nice option is dwr which basically allows your javascript to directly call methods in java classes running on the server without you having to build a web service or other frontend

441809
nunit	mstest
mstest is essentially nunit slightly reworked with a few new features such as assembly setup and teardown not just fixture and test level and missing some of the best bits such as the new 2.4 constraint syntax
nunit is more mature and there is more support for it from other vendors

442181
postgresql	mysql
in-query variable modification doesn t work in postgresql for instance this will work in mysql but not in postgresql i haven t tested this recently maybe it does work now. set a 1 select id a a+1 from some_table
i also personally believe that postgresql has better handling of complex queries that include sub-selects and the like which most mysql users used to avoid

442887
put	get
just download my jar and put in the plugin folder of eclipse and remove the old one
i can t get to make the plugin work with ganymede linux version . when setting the jadclipse class viewer i get the following error in the log file of the workspace .metadata .log perhaps jadclipse isn t compatible with the version of its eclipse dependencies on this line jadclipse makes a call to a class defined in the jdt plugin but i didn t have the time to figure this out

443114
versioning	upgrade
google apply the latest bug fixes and security patches for the versioning of the library that you re running
contrary to what others have claimed they do not automatically upgrade you to the latest versioning

443397
cassini	iis
i d imagine the stack is immense though i would expect cassini to replicate iis as closely as possible
it s surprising that something that runs in vs wouldn t run in iis and i d even consider filing a vs bug with microsoft since it seems that the whole point of cassini is to replicate the functionality of iis and provide an ideal debugging environment since any web projects you write in vs will inherently be deployed against iis

443828
inherited	properties
when you change the properties and compile that doesn t mean that s the default setting for classes that inherited your control
if you are using the properties selector visual studio automatically puts some code in your application to change those values i.e the designer code

444020
getter	setter
here s a good rule of thumb if you have a variable that has nothing but a setter and a getter you have data not code--get it out of your class and place it into a collection or something
having a variable with a setter and a getter just means that either you never do anything with it it s data or the code that manipulates it is in another class terrible oo design move the variable to the other class

444369
opera	firefox
for best results use opera 9.2x- not 9.5+ safari or konqueror on this page
it partially works in firefox nested functions are not tidied meaning that most scripts you want to tidy still end up unreadable and fails to reformat code in ie and icab 3-

445001
postgresql	mysql
standard sql specifies this optional syntax for insert this is legal sql syntax supported for example by microsoft sql server postgresql and sqlite but not by oracle ibm db2 or mysql
mysql supports other syntax that achieve the same result in hibernate you should configure the sql dialect properly and it s up to hibernate to generate valid sql for the target rdbms brand

445311
folder	directory
the whole point of uac is to prevent random apps from writing to folder that require admin privileges
ok not the whole point but a large portion of it. you could create a service with admin privileges and send commands to it to move the downloaded files into the desired target directory but this opens up a user s system to being abused by other apps if you don t design it very carefully

445325
mvp	presenter
the conclusion that i ve very recently come to is that in many cases it might be impossible to apply the mvp pattern at both the window and user control levels without breaking the pattern
my thought on it is that the user control is part of the view implementation and the presenter should not know what is going on inside the view implementation which means that the window-level presenter by extension should not know about the user control s presenter and hence there should be no communication between them including instantiation of the latter by the former

445541
put	get
this definitely presents a big security issue though so i wouldn t put this into anything important
i found that all i needed to get it to work was this it all has to do with xpcnativewrappers

445747
nant	xmlpoke
these new tasks can either be build separately and added to nant by copying dlls into nant bin folder or by extending nant directly from your build files the information to get you started is found on script task if you happen to make this task generic enough it might be good to try to submit it to nantcontrib so everyone benefits
xmlpoke will definitely not work because the xpath must match something in the first place to be able to replace it

446429
ready	each
under templates select xml file enter a name for the dictionary such as codeanalysisdictionary.xml and click add in solution explorer right-click on the xml file and choose properties in the properties tool window under build action choose codeanalysisdictionary in solution explorer double-click on the newly created dictionary to open it in the xml editor paste the following replacing productname and companyname with your team s equivalents you are now ready to start entering your own custom words
simply add a new element for each word in your project that does not exist in the dictionary

447218
put	get
if you put the rev keyword inside a file and enable keyword substitution with the svn keywords property you will not get what you want
you will get the last revision that affected the file that contains the keyword instead of the last revision that affected any part of the project

post	put	post	get
see also power-efficient apps msdn power to the people developers 1 developers 2 devices power-efficient wm apps blog post
i had a whole long post detailing how you shouldn t expect to be able to get acceptable battery life because wm is not designed to support what you re trying to do but -- you could signal your service on wakeup do your processing then use the methods in this post to put the device back to sleep immediately

448079
free	malloc
when free ing the piece first goes into a free-list for quick reuse by another malloc if the size fits
it may at this time be merged with another free item to form bigger free blocks to avoid fragmentation a whole bunch of different algorithms exist there from freelists to binary-sized-fragments to hashing and what not else

448079
free	malloc
but usually malloc keeps things in its pocket dependig on the allocated free ratio many heuristics and sometimes compile or flag options are often available
notice that there is not one malloc free algotrithm

449090
subnet	packets
you could send an arp request for each possible ip in the subnet . of course the source address of the arp request must be ff ff ff ff ff ff otherwise you might not see the response
i forged a packets like this with bittwiste and replayed it with preplay and all the hosts on the network got the response

449283
width	height
for what it s worth xp ie7 users with the default width of sidebar open at full-screen xga get a viewport width of 862px
height are not so important as we expect to scroll vertically but having to scroll horizontally as well is death

450429
hide	show
hide the container using your main stylesheet and create a seperate stylesheet for print media
within that new stylesheet show the container element and hide the old elements and anything else that you do not wish to print

450703
cvs	svn
i already do through svn hg git and cvs
as long as you can make others scm ignore eachothers through a .cvsignore .hgignore kind of file or make them cooperate like git svn i do not see why you should not be able to do that

450746
sudo	passwd
i d advise in looking at sudo 1 instead
well the best way to do that would be a setuid-root binary that ask for the passwd then execute whatever command is needed but it requires knowledge you say not to possess

451130
coalesce	isnull
suggests to select where is null and build from here db2 - coalesce
sql server isnull or coalesce sybase isnull function postgres i couldn t find one though haven t fully checked

451804
hide	show
therefore edit looking at this again double-take you can t just hide everything that doesn t match as it will hide your whole page
you ll need to make sure you re selecting only divs but not the one you want to show

452450
children	parent
from the docs in either case the children of the object will not emit a show or hide event unless the object has specifically written an implementation to do so. i wrote a sample application that confirms this to be true
what you can do is walk up the display list checking for visible to be false on a parent

452780
versioning	upgrade
you ll have to either install asp or upgrade your versioning of vista to windows vista home premium edition windows vista professional edition windows vista ultimate edition
your versioning of vista does not support asp on iis

453153
folder	directory
remember to rename your zend framework containing folder to zend uppercase z to follow zf naming conversions then put your zend folder in your include directory
if you put your zend directory in your include path and not the include directory that contains the zend directory you may not use this require_once zend loader

453265
getter	setter
what you could do is having the ibar-interface having the getter and the setter there s really no point of not having this
when you only have the setter in ibar you re really explicitly saying that on the ibar interface the offset propery is write only this is obviously not what you want

453721
punctuation	words
so it depends which category the screen reader puts the ellipses character into which punctuation setting the user has selected and what action the user is taking
for example in the jaws for windows screen reader www.freedomscientific.com the ellipses isn t read when reading the document but is read when navigating by letter or words

453751
kerberos	ntlm
there are 3 authentication protocols that can be used to perform authentication between java and active directory on linux or any other platform and these are not just specific to http services kerberos - kerberos provides single sign-on sso and delegation but web servers also need spnego support to accept sso through ie
ntlm - ntlm supports sso through ie and other browsers if they are properly configured

453751
kerberos	ntlm
first authentication between two windows machines favors kerberos because servers do not need to communicate with the dc and clients can cache kerberos tickets which reduces load on the dcs and because kerberos supports delegation
but if the authenticating parties do not both have domain accounts or if the client cannot communicate with the dc ntlm is required

453751
kerberos	ldap
iwa is a simple term that basically means kerberos or ntlm or spnego to negotiate kerberos or ntlm
using an ldap bind as a way to validate credentials is not efficient and requires ssl

453751
ssl	ntlm
using an ldap bind as a way to validate credentials is not efficient and requires ssl
but until recently implementing kerberos and ntlm have been difficult so using ldap as a make-shift authentication service has persisted

453751
kerberos	ntlm
the sun implementation of kerberos has been a comedy of errors over the years so based on sun s track record in this area i wouldn t make any promises about their spengo implementation until you have that bird in hand
for ntlm there is a free oss project called jcifs that has an ntlm http authentication servlet filter

453792
integer	fractions
if you store something with an index that can be interpreted as a nonnegative integer it will try to do so
if you store something with an index that is not a nonnegative integer it s alphanumeric negative or a floating-point number with a fractions piece it will fail on the array-index store and default to the object which is array s base class store which then converts the argument to a string and stores by string index -- but these stored properties are not seen by the array class and therefore are not visible to its methods properties length join slice splice push pop etc

453920
inherited	subclassing
that s not necessarily a bad thing but it doesn t feel like the original purpose of inherited
many of these are much less of a problem for application builders than class library designers if you know that you and your colleagues are going to be the only people ever to derive from your type then you can get away with a lot less up-front design - you can fix the subclassing if you need to at a later date

455181
post	get
this is a squirrely sort of question for a few reasons text fields can be dynamic without relying on external resources the post is six months old and the flash search-player project is under active development
so it d be difficult to get a solid answer from anyone who isn t either a google or adobe engineer working on the search-player project and even then it s still a somewhat complicated one depending on the implementation

456313
spweb	splist
that means the connection to the backend sql server will remain open from the moment the sprequest object has been created till the spweb object is disposed
the best practice for your code sample would look like this note that it is not safe to use sp objects like spuser splist etc

457084
for-loop	loops
there are two problems the iterator api doesn t declare any exceptions to be thrown so you d have to throw runtimeexceptions or non-exception throwables the enhanced for-loop doesn t do anything to try to release resources at the end of loops this is very annoying
in c# for instance you can really easily write code to iterate through the lines of a text file use as foreach string line in readlines foo.txt the foreach loops calls dispose on the ienumerator in a finally block which translates to check if we need to do anything in the iterator block s finally from the using statement

458422
actionscript	haxe
it isn t really actionscript but it is very similar and you could also compile to the server side or javascript haxe.org
you could try haxe

458442
post	put
please post their name here and in as many other public forums as possible to shame before the whole world and warn others not to by that brand
you should also be able to take the drive you removed and put it into another machine and read it or even boot it

459194
selecteditem	selectedindex
the selecteditem property can only be read. using the selectedtext and selectedvalue properties will change the text and value not which one is selected
you are gonna want to use the selectedindex attribute

459217
equinox	knopflerfish
springsource dm server is based on the equinox osgi framework and should not be confused with the spring dm technology included in dm server which can run on equinox apache felix and knopflerfish
however embedding dm server in another application server such as websphere application server based on equinox would be a non-trivial piece of work

459242
folder	directory
i can think of a workaround storing a dummy filename in the zip folder which should be ignored on extraction but not portable across implementations
a zip file has no directory structure it just has a bunch of pathnames and their contents

459381
scheme	racket
it may not be as fast as sbcl but it does have excellent libraries and documentation as well as an integrated environment that s designed to get you developing and running scheme programs right out of the gate
what i really like about racket s ide racket is what you don t have to do you don t have to learn emacs you don t have to learn slime you don t have to worry about hunting down third-party libraries as virtually all libraries meant for racket can be found in packages

459434
folder	directory
if you re just copying a file or folder within your working copy for some reason say you re breaking one class file into two and you want to preserve the common history then just use svn copy in your wc
when you do the copy locally you will of course incur a space and time cost from copying the files on your local machine your local filesystem doesn t know about svn deltas but when you go to commit you should see that only the root of the copied directory structure is listed as added with history

459663
disk	ram
if you re really serious about getting to big primes with the sieve you re not going to get away with several things in your current impl arraylist of boxed longs using like uri mentions not systematically paging to disk
realize that with a 32-bit signed int index to a long you re addressing 16gb of ram

459684
put	get
the html put this below the body tags the css what this does to solve the issue it forces chrome to think the page s content is 100 when it s not - this stops the body appearing the size of the content and resolves the missing background bug
this is basically doing what height 100 does when applied to the body or html but you don t get the side effect of having your backgrounds cut off when scrolling past 100 page height like you do with a 100 height on those elements

460764
profiling	instrumentation
the amount of overhead depends - if the sampling frequency is set to high values then the profiling itself can contribute significantly to the performance being reported
instrumentation vs sampling it is not like one is better than the other approach

461738
hash	salt
you wouldn t even need a guid - you could even just hash the key since it s a one-way operation and can t be easily reversed
you could even salt your key before you hash it which would make it virtually unbreakable by making the key unpredictable

461778
super	implements
it s not super safe but gives much shorter urls than for instance sha256 and also it s completely collision free
i thought about a similar problem some time ago and ended up implements blowfish in the url

461785
put	get
it s a little fiddly but it stays put once it s saved
on the rare cases where this isn t good enough i sometimes use the following technique to get it all to line up it s not perfect and i know those that prefer c# will be tut-tutting but there it is

461797
ant	maven
rewrite your ant mojo in java and invoke the cargo api you d want to look at the sources of the cargo plugin
according to the maven developers this is not the way plugins are supposed to work

461797
maven	cargo	ant	maven
cargo is not only a maven plugin it also has a java api and an ant task
so you could probably call the cargo ant task from your ant mojo i think you ll just need the cargo jars in your plugin s classpath

461881
textarea	textbox
if you wish to update a text value inside a textarea or similar then you should listen for the change event in the arraycollection and take the appropriate action then
from your additional points below just edit your original question i take it the autocomplete your talking about is the autocomplete text input box from adobe exchange area as a normal textbox doesn t take an arraycollection. if you posted some code it may make it easier to help you. preinitialize then initialize then creationcomplete then applicationcomplete this is the order they get called in

462241
superclass	subclassing
the public methods of a abstract or not superclass do the same
you shouldn t try to require subclassing to have certain private members - you are trying to specify implementation which is what oop is all about avoiding

462389
bazaar	svn
there are ways around this but with git bazaar mercurial this simply doesn t happen - they realize whether the commits have already been merged because they id each commit across the merging paths it takes
svn s merging capabilities are decent and the simple merging scenarios work fine - release branch and trunk where trunk tracks the commits on the rb

462486
equals	gethashcode
from msdn if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values

462486
equals	gethashcode
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values
the gethashcode method for an object must consistently return the same hash code as long as there is no modification to the object state that determines the return value of the object s equals method

462567
equals	gethashcode
msdn a hash function must have the following properties if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value

463373
vbscript	autoit
vbscript does not provide the way to do this natively
the best way to do it is to use autoit instead or something similar

463375
next	except
usually you do not know in advance which metadata fields you will add within the next two years. things like couchdb work much nicer for that kind of data than relational databases
i also personally love the fact that i don t need any client libraries for couchdb except an http client which is nowadays included in nearly every programming language

463600
xpand	xtend
xpand templates are only meant for generating textual artifacts while most logic underlying the generation should be implemented in xtensions
xtend does not have a loop construct either but it s possible to find an alternative if you re willing to follow the functional programming-paradigm

463908
san	fileserver
if you do not perceive dfs as a viable approach you may wish to consider failover clustering of your fileserver tier whereby your files are stored in an external shared storage not an expensive san which i believe is overkill for your case since dfs is already out of your reach connected between active and passive file servers
if the active fileserver goes down the passive may take over and continue read writes to the shared storage

464096
kerberos	ntlm
note that kerberos can only be used if both the server and client have accounts in the target domain and the client can communicate with the domain controller sufficiently to acquire a kerberos ticket
if these conditions are not satisfied the ntlm ssp is used directly

464605
fastcgi	scgi
since fastcgi scgi and wsgi are all based on the cgi specs django developpers choosed to stick to this convention fwiw the modpythonrequest class do the same rewrite for consistency
so it seems that your problem is that something in the cherokee scgi chain doesn t rewrite the headers correctly

465396
int	boolean
create table product product_id uuid not null -- primary key product text not null bar_code text not null default rfid_code text not null default current_qty int default 0
create table vendor vendor_id uuid not null -- primary key vendor text not null is_active boolean not null default true

465790
virtualbox	esx
frankly virtualbox will probably get you up and running with the least hassle but it doesn t support virtualized smp
failing that vmware server is free as is esxi whichi s more of a pain to configure unless you have some experience with esx and virtualpc is a serviceable option

465871
actionscript	mxml
there is a prototype of an actionscript 3 version but it is not even in beta yet and i admit that i haven t had the time to test it
i haven t found anything similar for xml let alone mxml

466217
subclass	inherited
other things being equal i prefer the simpler solution a single concrete class which takes a string as a constructor parameter to the more complicated one using a base class and a subclass
inherited is appropriate when you want to vary behaviour if the browser watcher will do something that the ordinary process watcher doesn t

466397
cvs	svn
you should leave cvs
cvs is old and not very fast in terms of branching tagging branch tag creation depends linearly on number of files in a project you should think of your branching strategy first do you want to have a stable trunk feature branches developer branches unstable trunk release branches platform branches this heavily depends on your project and development philosophy if you want to use svn you really have to think of your repository layout because nearly all softwareprojects are module-based and you should find a structure in which you can easily tag all needed modules

svn with its folderbased approach of branches tags is not easy to achieve this requirement

467363
backtracking	greedy
but although spirit will backtracking it won t backtracking to the middle of what a sub-parser would otherwise greedy match
it will backtracking to the next choice point but your grammar doesn t have any

467382
regexbuddy	rubular
by the way this regex works in regexbuddy in ruby mode but not at the rubular site
i suspect rubular uses an older version of ruby with less-powerful regex support

469974
put	get
so every time code gets changed reviewed you need to look for something in quotes and yes you can filter out the empty strings but i tell people it is good practice to never put strings in quotes unless you know it won t get localized
i strongly prefer string.empty aside from the other reasons to ensure you know what it is and that you have not accidentally removed the contents but primarily for internationalization. if i see a string in quotes then i always have to wonder whether that is new code and it should be put into a string table

470060
int	boolean	int	double
so you can convert it to a number but not necessarily an int
according to the vb6 documentation isnumeric returns true if the data type of expression is boolean byte decimal double int long sbyte short single uinteger ulong or ushort or an object that contains one of those numeric types

470060
int	boolean	int	chars	int	double
according to the vb6 documentation isnumeric returns true if the data type of expression is boolean byte decimal double int long sbyte short single uinteger ulong or ushort or an object that contains one of those numeric types
it also returns true if expression is a chars or string that can be successfully converted to a number. many of those cannot be converted to an int

470060
int	chars
it also returns true if expression is a chars or string that can be successfully converted to a number. many of those cannot be converted to an int
for example 1.5 is numeric but it s not an int

470071
int	double
the isnumeric does not guarantee it is an int just that it matches one of the numeric possibilities
if the number is a double perhaps regional settings comma versus period and so on are causing the exception

470102
google-chrome	firefox
speedwise you re not going to find significant gains choosing one over the other unless you re doing specific tasks that play towards their strengths look at the range in benchmarking for instance some google tests have google-chrome hundreds of times faster where as others have firefox beating google-chrome
ideally you d want it to be agnostic but if you had to choose one though i would go with firefox as it s a more mature browser

470249
inherited	subclassing
my take is that classes are used for implementation inherited whereas types are used for runtime substitution
here is a link explaining the substitution principle and why subclassing and subtypes are not always the same thing in java for example

471587
submit	submission
the validation happens when the submit button gets clicked hope it helps
not inline but you can perform the validation programmatically say on submission of a form or when a user tabs out of a control etc

472180
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
solution always create the objectoutputstream first and flush it before creating the objectinputstream
if you tried a debugger it would have told you where the problem was. perhaps not why the issue you have is that objectoutputstream writes a header and objectinputstream reads that header

472180
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
if you tried a debugger it would have told you where the problem was. perhaps not why the issue you have is that objectoutputstream writes a header and objectinputstream reads that header
you have created the objectinputstream first which means it is trying to read a header which will never be written

472197
int	chars	int	double
i would add as well as a common trick in these sort of questions it in the assumption you make that i is an int
other common assumptions might be s is a string x y are a double ch is a chars b is a byte etc. if you see a question like this you can bet that i is not its expect type

472222
freebsd	linux
if you are going to deploy on freebsd then it might make sense to also run it locally at least in a virtual machine
browser testing of course is a different issue. do keep in mind that while all development tools you can run on bsd are also available on linux the opposite is certainly not true especially since linux has gained more commercial traction

472312
cpython	ironpython
are always integrated in cpython first and you have to wait until they are implemented in ironpython
licensing some people argue this is a timebomb nobody knows how the licensing of ironpython mono might change in near future extensions one of the strengths of python are the thousands of extensions which are all usable by cpython as you mentioned mathematical problems numpy might be a suitable fast package for you which might not run as expected under ironpython although ironclad especially under windows you have a native gui-toolkit with wxpython which also looks great under several other platforms and there are pyqt and a lot of other toolkits

472358
console.readline	console.writeline
you can only interact receive data - console.readline console.read with the console window if you do not show the windows forms
output to console - console.writeline - works in both modes

473009
jar	war
you need to ensure that the cxf jar is in the web-inf lib directory of your war
so in fact sticking the cxf jar in web-inf lib isn t going to work

473206
folder	directory
what we miss was to delete the configurations folder
the new plugin was not unzipp and the library was not existing in the configurations directory

473419
put	get
however i put it to you it s just not important compared to making sure that your output is understood at the other end and to guarantee that you must be explicit with your encoding
additionally if you really want to match your internal bytes you can already just choose the unicode encoding and get that performance savings

473503
super	self
it also looks like you have a bug in this method you are essentially discarding the results from super init while it may not be a problem in this instance it could cause serious problems in others
you should always structure you init methods like this if you are not going to return self from an init method for instance it is a factory or something odd like that you should remember to release self

473600
post	get
this doesn t change when using ajax because you want proxy servers to also understand that this is a post and that they shouldn t try to cache the response
there are also advantages and disadvantages to using get vs post

473740
inherited	properties
i m not really sure this example is a good case for either inherited or interface implementation it would really depend on more design details we don t have
programming to an interface means designing a set of methods and properties which are the public signature of the functionality or service the class will provide

473918
tiff	png
quicktime should work but keep in mind that tiff files are usually not optimized for size and are often much larger than jpeg resp
png renderings of the same image

474081
short	base
it s often best just to stick with good old fashioned oop and use the newer language features when plain old oo programming falls short of providing you a reasonable solution
in general you shouldn t provide base functionality through extension methods

475620
subtract	add
also since there are only two states rather than using else if false an else will suffice can be rewritten as second rather than comparing the string literals add subtract and such try to use constants final variables or enum s
doing a string comparison such as is performing a check to see whether the string literal add and the operator variable are both refering to the same object not whether the values are the same

475907
inherited	subclassing
i should also note that the protocol buffers wire format doesn t directly support inherited
protobuf-net can spoof this while retaining wire-compatibility but like with xmlserializer you need to declare the subclassing up-front

475953
cpython	pypy	cpython	ironpython
they also provide alternative methods for deploying your python applications if for some reason you find yourself in a situation like silverlight where distributing the cpython implementation with your application is not appropriate
i can t say anything about ironruby but most python implementations like ironpython jython and pypy try to be as true to the cpython implementation as possible

476246
inherited	properties
you can use inherited and components to reduce the code model but only in ways that make sense with the underlying domain
for example a pipe class with a diameter properties would make sense while a diameterizedobject class with a diameter properties with a geometrytype properties of geometrytype.pipe would not

476412
stateless	stateful
but i can say learning c# for web development particularly if you don t already sort of grok oo can be daunting -- mainly because oo is so much about creating and managing state and statefulness and the web is inherently stateless
believe it or not i learned more about oo writing ajax apps with javascript and flex apps in actionscript -- building stateful clients -- than i ever did trying to force c# into my brain because ajax apps and flex apps force you to think about things in terms of state

476567
postgresql	mysql
however postgresql until recently was unix-based and i ve never found it particularly reliable installing on windows
personally i would not recommend mysql for your scenario - although the latest edition can finally be described as a rdbms having evolved from what really was a collection of flat files with a limited sql query interface it s peculiarities probably mitigate against it s use as a learning tool unless you are actually focused on mysql

476902
codeigniter	slim
actually i did a detailed roundup of all the authentication libraries for codeigniter when i was testing them out just after new year s
fwiw i ll share it with you dx auth pros very full featured medium footprint 25+ files but manages to feel quite slim excellent documentation although some is in slightly broken english language file support recaptcha supported hooks into ci s validation system activation emails unactivated accounts auto-expire suggests grc.com for salts not bad for a prng banning with stored reason strings simple yet effective error handling cons only lets users reset a lost password rather than letting them pick a new one upon reactivation homebrew pseudo-event model - good intention but misses the mark two password fields in the user table bad style uses two separate user tables one for temp users - ambiguous and redundant uses potentially unsafe md5 hashing failed login attempts only stored by ip not by username - unsafe

476921
cpython	ironpython
string concatenation + has an optimized implementation on cpython
but this may not be the case on other architectures like jython or ironpython

477578
hash	salt
the reason a salt is used is that hashing in itself is not sufficient -- you ll want to add a so-called salt to protect the hash against rainbow tables
a salt effectively prevents two passwords that exactly match from being stored as the same hash value preventing the whole database being scanned in one run if an attacker is executing a password guessing attack

477578
hash	salt
a salt effectively prevents two passwords that exactly match from being stored as the same hash value preventing the whole database being scanned in one run if an attacker is executing a password guessing attack
a cryptographic hash should not be used for password storage because user-selected passwords are not strong enough do not usually contain enough entropy and a password guessing attack could be completed in a relatively short time by an attacker with access to the hashes

478584
unix	bsd
not really none of the other unix system have an indexer builtin the file system except beos but it is not a unix system and mostly dead anyway
you can have something not too far with the locate 1 command on all bsd systems the daily script create the locate database with locate.updatedb but this is only enables you to find pathnames

478619
division	multiplication
rounding down is implicit for integer division and as such does not require compensation
if you re using a lot of these on a relatively slow platform you may eliminate the multiplication by using a variant of t m + n - 1

478836
post	get
so far all our debugging in the properties accessor and no-op ivalueconverter s hasn t found a solution -- but if we do i ll post it back here too
geoff to confirm i understand your problem the databinding infrastructure doesn t seem to recognise that two objects you consider equal are actually equal - therefore the initial selecteditem isn t set correctly since the databinding doesn t find a reference-equals object in your staticresource collection to match session.sessiontype . you get around this by flattening the references ie

479164
inherited	properties
you should try and favour composition via dependency injection over inherited where you can though and note that interfaces being contracts support unit-testing separation of concerns and language varying multiple inherited in a way abstracts cannot
purely on the basis of inherited you would use an abstract where you re defining clearly descendant abstract relationships animal- cat and or require inherited of virtual or non-public properties especially shared state which interfaces cannot support

implements	extends
you can implements this without too much difficulty using the vistor pattern
multiple dispatch further extends this concept to more parameters but is significantly harder to implements in languages like c# not that it can t be done it s just hard

implements	extends
multiple dispatch further extends this concept to more parameters but is significantly harder to implements in languages like c# not that it can t be done it s just hard
some languages implements this ability right out of the box

post	get
an asp linkbutton renders to an html link and as such cannot post to a web page
but can only make get requests

short	base
are similar in short no c is not a subset of c#
the look of many control structures base on c

16-bit	64bit
for an unmanaged dll file you need to first check if it is a 16-bit dll file hopefully not . then check the image _file_header.machine field
someone else took the time to work this out already so i will just repeat here to distinguish between a 32-bit and 64bit pe file you should check image_file_header.machine field

481382
int	double
it would be better if you had this bool canberepresentedexactly int numerator int denominator
because not all fractions have exact representations but the moment you shove it into a double you ve chosen a representation in binary.

481573
hash	md5
you can upload an md5 hash of the file and then upload the file and if the file uploaded doesn t match the md5 then it s not finished or if it takes to long perhaps it didn t upload properly md5 is often used to check the integrity of a file by creating a hash that represents the file
if the file varies at all it will almost always as in basically never for our purposes generate a different md5 hash

481573
hash	md5
if the file varies at all it will almost always as in basically never for our purposes generate a different md5 hash
the only reason a file would not match it s previously uploaded md5 hash is if it wasn t finished or the md5 file was corrupted on upload

481963
inherited	properties
there s really nothing you can do to keep your class readonly if you allow people to inherited your class
i think the key phrase here is i do not want that anyone to add a setter properties in my classes

482026
filtering	grouping
in this case you want to filtering based on the results of a grouping by so i would use a having clause as follows
i am not as familiar with mysql as i am with sql server but in t-sql you can t use aliases in grouping by clauses i originally thought order by clauses as well but that has since been shown to be incorrect

482346
facade	mediator
this way the facade is not adding functionality it is just delegating to some existing objects
in the other hand the mediator add the new functionality by combining different objects

482703
division	subtract
here s an excerpt you cannot synthesize a general n-bit m-bit division operation using the div and idiv instructions
such an operation must be performed using a sequence of shift and subtract instructions and is extremely messy

483013
put	get
even if you don t want the object to be strictly immutable if you really wanted which i wouldn t recommend you could put some kind of lock mode on it so that it could only be mutated when unlocked
have the lock unlock methods be private or protected as appropriate and you get some level of access control there

483323
superclass	subclassing
but it is not a very good example as the concrete superclass already implements a default functionality for foo
when there is an abstract subclassing that redefines it to be purely virtual it is a sign for me that the class hierarchy is flawed because a subclassing and the callers of foo usually should be able to fall back to the default implementation

484517
google-chrome	firefox
i was not able to duplicate it in webkit-based browsers google-chrome and safari
antonio i m afraid that the problem is in firefox it self

484538
xslt	xquery
for example a left outer join between suppliers and parts might return information about suppliers that have no matching parts. do note that xquery does not have a standard document function it is an xslt function and instead has the doc function which is part of the xquery 1.0 and xpath 2.0 functions and operators
there are at least two errors in the answer by chris xquery is case sensitive -- the capitalised keywords used in chris example will not be allowed by a conforming xquery processor

484619
implements	extends
say for instance i have w extends x a implements w b extends a c extends b implements y d extends c implements z suppose i am processing an instance of d the object d
computing d instanceof x requires to take d.getclass loop through the interfaces it implements to know whether one is to x and if not do so again recursively for all of their ancestors... in our case if you do a breadth first exploration of that tree yields at least 8 comparisons supposing y and z don t extends anything.

484745
postgresql	mysql
postgresql is kind of the opposite -- it s a database researcher s favorite playground which means it has a dozen different join strategies storage engines advanced optional packages and all kinds of stuff
it s slower than mysql when doing things mysql does well and blows it out of the water when doing things mysql just doesn t know how to do see above with hash joins

485614
strlen	strcpy
you do not strcpy a string you have just strlen d
strcpy should not be used at all in modern programs

486094
erlang	lisp
haskell erlang and scala are not homoiconic clojure is
clojure s fundamental differentiators are it has a software transactional memory system which makes shared state concurrent programming easier it is a lisp unlike haskell or erlang therefore all code is data which allows you to make what look likes changes to the language itself at runtime through the macro system it runs on the jvm which means you have direct access to all java libraries clojure data structures implement java interfaces such as collection list map runnable and callable where appropriate

486284
post	get
post your server-side code if the naming container thing doesn t help
in most situations you can get by with using findcontrol server-side or passing the result of clientid to your javascript client-side if you really need to hit an exact control

486569
google-chrome	safari
if it s worth anything google-chrome doesn t set the cookies either if you use the appending method but if you have a hidden with the same source google-chrome works in addition to the rest of the browsers except again safari
from the safari developer faq safari ships with a conservative cookie policy which limits cookie writes to only the pages chosen navigated to by the user

486641
disk	ram
edit if you re absolutely in need of ram-only temporary tables you can create a table space for your database on a ram disk dev shm works
this reduces the amount of disk io but beware that it is currently not possible to do this without a physical disk write

487489
multiplying	division
matrix scalar multiplication you can multiplying a matrix with a scalar
in that case each cell is multiplied with that number inverting a matrix matrix division is not possible but you can create an inversion of a matrix such that a x a-inv is a matrix with all zero s except for that main diagonal inverting a matrix can only be done with square matrices and it is a complex job that does not neccesary have a result

488151
implements	extends	implements	sealed
so i made my own voila all my objects regardless of implements type and whether or not i wrote it or someone else did now have a foreach method by adding an appropriate using statement in my code
some of the best uses i had for extension methods is the ability to extends functionality on third party objects whether commercial or internal to my company but managed by a separate group which in many cases will be marked as sealed

488204
internationalization	translation
the cldr project is an excellent repository of internationalization data the supplemental data is really useful
if a translation of a specific page is not available use a language fallback mechanism back to the neutral language

488309
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
what many folks probably don t know is that this rule is already supported in opera 9.5 shipping versions of safari for the mac windows and iphone os and is promised for firefox 3.1. and well as ie6 and later
sadly while support for font-face was hinted at for opera 9.5 and firefox 3.1 see my comments at #4 below this is in fact not the case sadly

488978
jmock	powermockito
we are planning to add jmock support as well
powermockito is not intended to replace other frameworks rather it can be used in the tricky situations when other frameworks does t allow mocking

489120
folder	directory
that somewhere becomes the next issue and that is primarily a business kind of decision. if the directory for the documents is okay to add to i would add an index directory in each folder as documents are parsed and store a file such as originalfilenamesansextemsion _index.txt inside
if that is not possible create an index folder on each drive and mirror the directory structure as needed

489290
filesystems	ntfs
app that would use win32 apis to determine the filesystems write a plug-in for nsis that would use win32 apis to determine the filesystems edit borzio updated his before i finished mine you might need to add something i found on the winamp forums execwait with file redirection without the it was not working on my system to generate a redirected file
i ve tested the above and it does work 0 for ntfs and 1 for non ntfs

489872
free	malloc	free	calloc	free	realloc
eventually i created a simple set of wrappers around free malloc calloc realloc that simply printed memory addresses and sizes to a file
after it aborted within gdb i could backtrack in time and figure out when the memory was free d and where the references were that did not get removed

490278
integer	unsigned
however if you insists on doing it the right way try using spec# declare it as an integer where you would have used uint and attach an invariant to it saying it can never be negative
it s not advisable to use unsigned integer because if u assigned negative values to it all hell break lose

490311
internationalization	translation
sometimes this is the right choice depending on how extensively the ui will be used. internationalization is really not that difficult except for finding a firm to do good translation of your text
the programmer portion of internationalization is pretty straightforward

490825
maven	pom.xml
i experienced a similar issue in eclipse ganymede when using the maven and subclipse plugins
i have not determined which plugin caused this problem but i suspect that it is related to my pom.xml containing nested modules ie

491197
put	get
you can see a partial list of such special values with this so if you add two floats end up with a special value 1.2e+6 then put that value unmodified into an update query to store the value in a decimal column say you will likely get a failed transaction since the database will see 1.2e+6 as varchar data not decimal
likewise you will likely get an xsd validation error if you put the value into xml

491583
mouse	keyboard
thw windows ce os itself doesn t support mouse hooks at all
it supports keyboard hooks unofficially but it s been there since 1.0

491977
x86	64bit
since sql server is a 64bit process and my assembly would be hosted in process - i loaded the assemblies from the framework64 folder and system.identitymodel and system.identitymodel.selectors from program files as opposed to program files x86
so i tried the x86 assemblies - but trying to load system.web gives the rather cryptic error assembly system.web references assembly system.web version 2.0.0.0 culture neutral publickeytoken b03f5f7f11d50a3a. which is not present in the current database

492471
int	chars
this mechanism is used to make sure that the length does not become a significant portion of the size taken up by the serialized string. binarywriter and binaryreader have methods to read and write 7-bit encoded int but they are protected and so you can use them only if you derive from these classes
personally i would put an int16 at the start of the strings so you know how long they re going to be and use the io.binaryreader class to do the reading it ll read ints strings chars etc into variable binreader.readint16 will read two bytes return the int16 they represent and move two bytes on in the stream hope this helps

492718
for-loop	loops
the trick is to create a new function scope within the for-loop so that the variables you declare are bound during that iteration
you can accomplish this by executing an anonymous function inside loops the way you had it before all of you functions closed over the same variable references and so used what ever the last value was not the value of when the function was created

492942
put	get
it ll do what you need it to but you may run into issues that aren t easily resolved because it hasn t been put through the ringer
as an early adopter though you may find that the sync developers are eager to help you out when you get stuck so this isn t as big a problem as it might seem

493199
bazaar	svn
a very important missing thing in bazaar is cp
you cannot have multiple files sharing the same history as you have in svn see for example here and here

493493
git-rebase	amend
not long ago especially not before many branches and merges then i use this procedure git checkout -b tmp bad-commit fix the files git commit --amend git-rebase tmp master if you have merges in between you may wanna try git-rebase -i -p but the results may vary
if you only want to amend the second to last commit eg

493868
queue	fifo
clearing the queue can be seen as a violation of the fifo concept
consequently if you need to clear your queue maybe it s not really a queue and you should better use a deque

494047
pop-up	dialog
howabout a pop-up window dialog with a filterable list instead
my suggestion would be to not use a pop-up menu if it is that big

494207
reparsepoint	ntfs
but most folks just 1 look for reparsepoint on the list of attributes returned by directoryinfo.getdirectories
1 note that a ntfs junction is a particular type of reparse point but not the only one

495265
post	get
either of these could use the delete or post method
in order to handle the case where javascript is turned off when you detect in the controller that the post was not done with ajax request.isajaxrequest is false you could look at the request.urlreferer property to get the url of the referring page

495290
asterisk	ivr
freepbx makes it really easy to set up an ivr - got a decent web-based front end and supports some cool asterisk tools out of the box
edit freepbx isn t asterisk - it is a pretty interface that generates the configs for you

495737
hash	md5
it sounds like you want a hash of some sort
it doesn t need to be secure so nothing as complicated as md5 or sha but something along the lines of char1 + char2 + char3 + .

495902
put	get
if you must then put the database into single user user mode before you do it and do your task during off hours
next do not under any circumstances ever use identity to get the value just inserted

496124
toolbar	docking
it tends to act strangely with toolbar placement in my experience if you don t dockpane both toolbar first
i haven t found a good simple solution to stopping the toolbar from being dragged yet while docking next to each other you can remove the cbrs_gripper style however that doesn t stop the toolbar from being dragged

496124
toolbar	docking
i haven t found a good simple solution to stopping the toolbar from being dragged yet while docking next to each other you can remove the cbrs_gripper style however that doesn t stop the toolbar from being dragged
you can also just not call enabledocking on the menubar or toolbar

496312
int	chars
if there is no actual next argument or if type is not compatible with the type of the actual next argument as promoted according to the default argument promotions the behavior is undefined except for the following cases one type is a signed int type the other type is the corresponding unsigned int type and the value is representable in both types
one type is pointer to void and the other is a pointer to a chars type

496376
pkcs#12	pfx
it will ask you for a password openssl pkcs#12 -export -out paulstovell.pfx -in paulstovell.pem -name paul stovell enter and re-enter your password when prompted
at this point system.io.packaging can use your pfx and verify the package signature but it will not trust the certificate

497148
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
the database default collation determines whether objects within the database are treated in a case-sensitive way in queries - this applies to all object name tables columns etc
if your application code comes from a case-insensitive collation database it may not run on a case-sensitive collation database if a object is misreferenced you would get a message when you attempted to run the statement or create the stored procedure or in a stored-proc architecture you would catch all these pretty quickly unless you had a significant amount of dynamic sql

497230
actionscript	mxml
you can access the property in actionscript only
it is not settable in mxml

497967
quicksort	mergesort
i actually just wrote a linked-list comparative sort demo program in c and arrived at a similar conclusion that mergesort will beat quicksort for most uses altho i have been told that quicksort is generally not used for linked lists anyway
i would note that the choice of pivot values is a monster factor -- my initial version used a random node as the pivot and when i refined it a bit to take a mean of two random nodes the exectution time for 1000000 records went from over 4 minutes to less than 10 seconds putting it right on par with mergesort

497967
quicksort	mergesort
the biggest difference that can be produced between the two of them will always be to quicksort s detriment and it involves lists that are already largely sorted or contain a large number of ties when quicksort does better than mergesort the difference will not be nearly so great
this is because ties or already sorted segments streamline straight through mergesort

499950
post	get
you probably want a session resource btw this is how restful_auth works . so you would say create me a session for this user or something like post sessions where the body of the post is the username password for the user. this also has the good side effect of not saving the password in the history or letting someone capture it on the http proxy
so your controller code would look something like this you would set up your routes like this that will get you urls like

500532
for-loop	arrays
and since you can never be sure that nothing will be added to the prototype chain just use a for-loop to enumerate the arrays this will write 0 foo 1 bar
because for...in enumerates through the object that holds the arrays not the arrays itself

500680
post	get
ok i have to add in an answer to the points you made in a separate answer post it would be a lot more convenient if you d edited this into the original question so it doesn t end up at the bottom below the answers to it
if all cleanup always gets done in destructors then there wouldn t need to be any cleanup code in a catch block - yet c++ has catch blocks where cleanup actions get done

500878
inherited	properties
inherited properties can be excluded by checking hasownproperty but that won t help you with properties set in the array object itself for..in isn t guaranteed to preserve element ordering it s slow because you have to walk all properties of the array object and its whole prototype chain and will still only get the properties s name ie to get the value an additional lookup will be required
there are three reasons why you shouldn t use for..in to iterate over array elements for..in will loop over all own and inherited properties of the array object which aren t dontenum

500878
inherited	properties
there are three reasons why you shouldn t use for..in to iterate over array elements for..in will loop over all own and inherited properties of the array object which aren t dontenum
that means if someone adds properties to the specific array object there are valid reasons for this - i ve done so myself or changed array.prototype which is considered bad practice in code which is supposed to work well with other scripts these properties will be iterated over as well

501191
nfa	dfa
then convert the nfa into a dfa
if the start state is not the accept state and the accept state is reachable then the two regular expressions are not orthogonal. since their intersection is non-empty. there are know procedures for converting a regular expression to a dfa and converting an nfa to a dfa

501362
metaclass	subclassing
a metaclass allows you to hook into and modify the process of creating a python class not the creation of an instance of that class the creation of the class itself
django s model object and thus also your models which are subclassing has a modelbase metaclass

501870
writetofile	nsdata
to get an nsdata representation of your image in the png format use likewise a jpeg representation can be obtained using once you have the nsdata you could write it to your documents directory using writetofile atomically and then i believe you can pass it in as a local url although i ve not tried this
an alternative is to use the base64 nsdata category that françois p

502213
nullpointerexception	classcastexception	comparator	comparable
obviously invoking comparator on null will raise a nullpointerexception
as its mentioned in java docs that all elements in the array must be mutually comparable that is e1.compareto e2 must not throw a classcastexception for any elements e1 and e2 in the array of course here its not about classcastexception but invocation of comapreto is obvious

ant	cruisecontrol
i solve exactly this problem using hudson ant and ivy
i follow a pattern demonstrated by clark in pragmatic project automation he doesn t demonstrate the dependency problems and solutions and he uses cruisecontrol rather than hudson. i have a hand-written ant build file we call it cc-build.xml because of our cruisecontrol roots. this file is responsible for refreshing the working space for the project from the cm repository and labeling the contents for future reference

the exact reason for this is due to the unusual nature of our product and the stages of a given banking transaction
for online payment in the uk a charge is not able to be post authorised until the goods have shipped

504058
sdl	xlib
sdl is not a hardware interface in its own right but rather a portability layer that works well on top of many other display layers including directx opengl directfb and xlib so you get very good portability and its a very thin layer on top of those technologies so you pay very little performance overhead on top of those
if you re trying to dump pixels to screen you ll probably want to make use of sdl s surface facuility

post	get
i ve got a couple of earlier post which may be able to give you some ideas - not everything will be appropriate of course but some of it may be
important things for java benchmarks are warm up the jit first by running the code several times before timing it make sure you run it for long enough to be able to measure the results in seconds or better tens of seconds while you can t call system.gc between iterations it s a good idea to run it between tests so that each test will hopefully get a clean memory space to work with

implements	extends
it has examples of how to implements the majority if not all of the adobe flex components
if you want something more complex you may need to extends legend and create you own component

int	chars
given that there are an infinite number of different strings its just not possible to allocate a different int 32bits which can represent up to 4 billion number for each
with just 8 chars tehre are 2 60 different strings

506378
typedef	struct
you can define the typedef and forward declare the struct first in one statement and then define the struct in a subsequent definition
edit as others have mentioned without the forward declaration the struct name is still valid inside the struct definition you can used struct a but the typedef is not available until after the typedef definition is complete so using just a wouldn t be valid

506463
vb.net	vb6
if you aren t aware of this then your visual basic arrays end up being 1 element longer than you expected vb.net c# the reason why microsoft designed vb.net to size arrays based on upper bound rather than array length is to make it easier to port code from vb6 to vb.net
the initial index of a vb6 array is 1 unless you declare option base 0

also there are numerous filemaker developers not as much as more standard platforms but they are definitely about if you let me know where you are i can put you in touch with a selection of developers in your area
the important point i want to make is that in the correct context filemaker is the best thing in the world at what it does - if you try to do something that it s not meant to do you ll get stuck

508537
mouseup	mousedown
most often you ll want to perform some processing on mousedown and do some further processing on mouseup
the trick is that simply tracking mouseup messages is not enough mousedown may not have happened in your window

508537
mouseup	mousedown
the trick is that simply tracking mouseup messages is not enough mousedown may not have happened in your window
especially considering that the mousedown processing such as selecting an item did not occur

508537
mouseup	mousedown
going further up the reasoning you should not rely on receiving a mouseup after you processed mousedown user may have move the mouse and released the button somewhere else think drag n drop in which case you don t receive the mouseup event.
unless you capture the mouse on mousedown to make sure you get mouse event up to mouseup even if the mouse left your window

508537
mouseup	mousedown
all in all you end up tracking mousedown capture the mouse and when you receive mouseup just check if you own the capture
if not the mouse was either double-clicked no 2nd mousedown or mousedown happened somewhere else hence you most likely don t care about this mouseup

post	get
having done that you ll find the topmost single hour that has the most post in it but this period of time might not be exactly one hour long it might be shorter but never longer
to get a prettier period you can calculate how long it really is divide by two and adjust the start of the period back by that amount and the end forward this will center the post inside the hour

508572
post	get
to get a prettier period you can calculate how long it really is divide by two and adjust the start of the period back by that amount and the end forward this will center the post inside the hour
this adjustment is guaranteed to not include any new post so the count is still valid

post	get
the customer that you post from the form will not have entity keys so may not attach well also you may not have every field of the customer available on the form so all of it s fields may not be set
i would recommend using the tryupdatemodel method in your action you ll have to get the customer from the database again and update it with the form s post variables

509179
hash	md5
every hash resides in bucket guessed via its first k bits if any bucket overflows double file size and split every bucket everything is accessed via mmap not read write it s just unbelievably faster than sqlite even though it s low-level perl code and perl really isn t meant for high performance databases
it will not work with anything that s less uniformly distributed than md5 its assuming everything will be extremely uniform to keep the implementation simple

509589
post	get
when you post questions like this you should not expect people to guess how you have defined your tables and indexes
it s very simple to get the full definitions then paste the output into your question

division	modulo
by that i presume you mean doing a regular floating point division
modulo is performed in the integer context not fractional remainders are integers

509836
division	modulo
as i expected 1 2 0.5 etc . that s the result of division
not modulo

firefox	safari
this solution works using css in firefox and the other gecko browsers and css expressions in ie
the header and footer do not stay fixed in opera or safari chrome but the whole table is scrollable so it is usable

511153
superclass	subclassing
that s the beauty of polymorphic typing in fact the caller doesn t have to know about any of this at all and the subclassing determine how their behaviour differs from the superclass
if you sometimes want it to act as its superclass method and sometimes want it to act as its subclassing method then you need to provide the context required to do this

511153
superclass	subclassing
one which is never overridden and so always returns the superclass behaviour you can even mark the definition with final to ensure it s not overridden and your normal one which is overridden as appropriate by the subclassing
alternatively if there is some contextual information available you can let the subclassing decide how to handle this

511325
inherited	properties
and by the way free doesn t care if the instance to be freed is nil so this will work if but only if inherited destroy sets the properties to nil
you could call inherited first and check if the properties are still set destructor tmemcorrecteddictionary.destroy

fancybox	thickbox
fancybox is also another option
works similarly to thickbox edit it appears after some playing around that the plugin does not natively support closing the fancybox through an child iframe element

512358
fancybox	thickbox
works similarly to thickbox edit it appears after some playing around that the plugin does not natively support closing the fancybox through an child iframe element
i think that this is certainly achievable with a little effort i started hacking together something here although i stress that this was simply a poc and does not work as the button within the iframe removes the fancybox div wrapper from the dom and therefore does not display when you click the google image again .i am wondering however if an iframe is the right lines to go down

int	chars
to read only one byte try this this reads an unsigned int but stops after reading two chars two hex chars equals eight bits or one byte
x reads an unsigned int not a uint16_t thought they may be the same on your particular platform

uiview	subviews
it shouldn t be much harder to place any number of buttons according to the parent uiview s bounds and orientation
august i took your advice and added the uibuttons as subviews of the uiview rather than look further into the uitable

513542
komodo	scite
komodo edit seems to be most similar to ultra edit
scite is something i ve used before and lua is not that difficult

513566
int	chars
an advantage i see of storing the value in hex vs int is that if we needed to grow the size which i don t see happening with this application at 16 chars we could simply increase the truncated length and leave the old values without fear of collision
converting to int values wouldn t work as nicely for that

513763
uninstall	upgrade
i would then provide the customer with this cleanup tool and say after uninstall if you want to remove all user data then use this
consider the following cases customer uninstalls prior to installing a new version major upgrade which will uninstall the old version so you need to be aware of this accidental uninstall by a user who shouldn t have done it but had the ability to do so the cleanest way to remove this data for all users that i can think of would be to take advantage of active setup and use this to trigger a per-user script that runs the next time each user logs on

uninstall	upgrade
consider the following cases customer uninstalls prior to installing a new versioning major upgrade which will uninstall the old versioning so you need to be aware of this accidental uninstall by a user who shouldn t have done it but had the ability to do so the cleanest way to remove this data for all users that i can think of would be to take advantage of active setup and use this to trigger a per-user script that runs the next time each user logs on
the data won t be deleted during the uninstall but at the next logon

513902
bam	b2b
other features that biztalk has but wf doesn t or has to be implemented by developer tracking natively integrated wtih the business activity monitoring bam transaction supports both atomic transaction and long-running transaction extensive set of tools for admin management migration and scaling however all this changes with dublin
having read your requirements once again i think that your application doesn t fall into either the b2b or eai categories so biztalk is probably an overkill

513964
translation	localization
to expand correct on the first answer above it s not translation that string.format would help with actually
what string.format will help with is when you re printing a date time or a numeric format etc where there are localization l10n differences ie some countries will print 04feb2009 and others will print feb042009

514021
lsp	principles
liskov substitution principles lsp functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it
interface segregation principles isp clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use

514695
lisp	scheme
this is something languages like lisp are really good at
it is much easier to do in a language that supports real macros not c++ macros but rather ones that can manipulate the code they output such as ruby lisp scheme etc

515088
xna	slimdx
the xna game studio stuff is focused around solving game centric problems though i would question any poster that says the performance of the xna game studio stuff is any worse than managed direct x without seeing some decent metrics
an independent group outside of ms have created a project called slimdx - if you are writing an application rather than a game which i expect you are not by the other questions then that might be worth considering

515297
children	parent
if your tree is approximately full that is every level has its full complement of children except for the last two then you have between n l-2 and n l-1 leaf nodes and between n l-1 and n l nodes total
if your tree is not full then knowing the number of leaf nodes doesn t help as a totally unbalanced tree will have one leaf node but arbitrarily many parent

515333
inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties
but you already have a reference to b if b is what you pass to your function so you don t need to cast from i to b unless were talking about a different object then no don t do it going from i to b is the same as going from a to b you re trying to cast up the inherited chain which really is something you shouldn t do
needing to do this is a code smell it tells you that you should try and solve this problem in a different way possibly by redesigning you classes adding more properties methods to i or just deciding that the function will only work with the sub class - working with the subclassing b will give you access to all the methods of a i

515501
union	distinct
so there is no need to use select distinct combined with a union
probably better for performance to not use distinct too

515589
for-loop	loops
the correct syntax for the for-loop is the preceding declaration in your code is superfluous as well as the extra semicolon in the for-loop heading. whether you use this syntax or the while loops is a matter of taste both translate to exactly the same
the generic syntax of the for-loop is which is equivalent to edit actually the above two forms are not entirely equivalent if as in the question the variable is declared with the init statement

515998
junit	testng
you should be able to collate the xml files from the two runs and combine it into a single html report using the ant junit report task
if you aren t happy with the output you get from this it could be because testng organises its junit xml output oddly

515998
junit	testng
if you aren t happy with the output you get from this it could be because testng organises its junit xml output oddly
you get better results in my opinion if you use the junitxmlreporter from my reportng project and run junit report on that

518902
emacs	textmate
textmate works like emacs but has fewer features
i try not to use my mouse so the eyecandy and os x integration don t buy me much. netbeans and eclipse are nice for managing java projects but on the rare occasion that i have to do java i still find emacs easier to use

518902
vim	emacs
no viper is not a vim clone
it s emacs with modal editing. anyway jmho

519090
cvs	svn
an important thing to remember with svn compared to other version control systems like cvs or git is that svn doesn t really have a concept or branching or tagging
as far as svn is concerned it s all just a bunch of folders and files

519191
emacs	jedit
emacs is all right
it doesn t quite do everything i like jedit to do but i m not interested in spending time writing macros and plug-ins for my editor - i like getting stuff done instead

521670
folder	directory
on most versions of iis you can convert any folder on your web site to an application root open iis and navigate to the appropriate folder right-click on the folder select properties under application settings and beside application name click create apply and close if this does not fix your problem there may be another configuration error either with iis or your application
it is likely that your web.config file is placed in a directory that is not the root of the application

521782
ant	maven
two ant and xml do not scale well to large complex builds
in fact i have written a lot here at so about my experiences in that arena and with maven

522572
actionscript	mxml
take this example of two identical login panels in mxml and in actionscript seven lines of code vs 62
that s a pretty simple example but hopefully you can see how you might benefit by laying out many portions of your application in mxml whether you re using the design mode in flex builder or not

525128
srp	principles
i m not sure that it was regarding srp but the idea is the same
solid principles may lead to counterintuitive decisions and it s hard to get though this barrier

525661
jsf	seam
seam combines jsf and hibernate
what is it providing for you that the seam stack doesn t

525713
nsstring	nsxmlparser
you can then remove the processing instruction convert the nsstring to an nsdata and pass it into the nsxmlparser
dbr the original poster is using nsxmlparser not nsxmldocument so there is no setcharacterencoding method for him to override. to the op to test your situation i wrote a simple command-line utility that uses nsxmlparser to parse an xml document with the processing instruction

525745
des	aes
des is extremely easy to crack nowadays
please use aes or at least 3des if aes is not available

525795
free	malloc
not free but good on low resource systems and their products kastor and cascades
it only requires a pointer to video memory malloc and something that looks like a file system

525909
cpu	hyperthreading
however the fact that your benchmark is not consuming 100 cpu time does open the door for speculation about what is going on
if your application is single-threaded and your test system is multicore hyperthreading multi-cpu then you should expect to see around 50 idle cpu time for two cores 75 for four etc

525980
width	margin
this is where width 33 may not work because you will need to factor in the amount of margin that element has
this will cause it not work as expected because of the margin added to each div

526303
margin	height
the trick is to add bottom padding to all columns to the max amount of size you expect that could be the difference between the shortest and tallest column if you can t work this out then pick a large figure you then need to add a negative bottom margin of the same number
you ll need overflow hidden on the parent object but the result will be that each column will request to render this additional height suggested by the margin but not actually request layout of that size because the negative margin counters the calculation

526303
margin	height
you ll need overflow hidden on the parent object but the result will be that each column will request to render this additional height suggested by the margin but not actually request layout of that size because the negative margin counters the calculation
this will render the parent at the size of the tallest column whilst allowing all the columns to render at their height + the size of bottom padding used if this height is larger than the parent then the rest will simply clip off

526471
hide	show
i m not exactly sure why your adding the extra calls to show hide
when you add an item it will show it

526604
stopwatch	chronometer
if you need something like a stopwatch you ll have to subclass chronometer or maybe create your own version using the source
if you look at the source of the chronometer class you ll see that it doesn t store the elapsed time in a field and it calculates it internally every time it needs to update the display

527416
nginx	lighttpd
i d recommend switching to nginx or apache+mod_wsgi
i don t use lighttpd or flup so this isn t an answer as much as it is hints

528064
folder	directory
.egg code elementtree .py ... in your top-level script s include the following code at the top from scriptcustomize import apply_pth_files apply_pth_files __file__ add scriptcustomize.py to your project folder import os from glob import glob import fileinput import sys def apply_pth_files scriptfilename at_beginning false at the top of your script from scriptcustomize import apply_pth_files apply_pth_files __file__ directory os.path.dirname scriptfilename files glob os.path.join directory .pth if not files return for line in fileinput.input files line line.strip if line and line 0
# path os.path.join directory line if at_beginning sys.path.insert 0 path else sys.path.append path add one or more .pth file s to your project folder

528363
super	implements
before i learned about design patterns i was pretty much in the dark about how to use objects effectively other than as a super type structure
remember that implements interfaces is just as important if not more important than inheritance

528848
uiview	calayer
basically the presentation layer is core animation s closest approximation to where the actual layer is at any given time so its frame is the frame of your uiview at that instant
i m not sure that touch events will find their way to the view as it s moving across the screen so if you need to have the uiimageview respond to touches you may need to replace it with a calayer insert it as a sublayer of your main uiview s layer and call the hittest method on the presentationlayer of that main layer

528908
decimal	ieee
all have their limitations and this includes both the standard ieee floating point and signed decimal
the ieee floating point is more accurate per bit used but that doesn t matter here

529314
treeviewitem	listboxitem
the real problem is that you cannot set bindings on the treeviewitem that is automatically created for each databound object using xaml
the various itemscontrols including treeview let you override the creation of the item such as listboxitem treeviewitem etc

529344
profiling	instrumentation
now profiling
the general rule is that if you don t tell aqtime to instrumentation the routine it will not be instrumented

529700
internationalization	localization
one person mentions l10n feeding back to internationalization but if you are doing quality i18n testing and creating pseudo-localized content then iterating on development issues during localization should be the exception not the rule
interface resizing and particularly adapting pages to support bi-directional languages like arabic and hebrew also tend to blend both localization issues and internationalization engineering

530155
int	chars
qsort is good except your compare function needs to compare byte by byte for entry_size bytes not just cast from void to int which is unsafe and probably incorrect
fgets and fprintf deal with strings which in c are char-arrays ending with the special chars 0

530700
x86	64bit
and on x86 in 32 and 64bit mode that is 32-bit integers
64bit values are generally not more expensive but they do mean longer instructions

530759
lisp	prolog
some older lisp do not
plain vanilla prolog does not support objects and i can t name a logic oriented language that does i don t do logic oriented programming it is on my list of things to do when i have some copious spare time

530875
int	chars
or instead of invoking int 21 with which prints one chars at a time you can set to print a string set ds dx to a block of memory which contains
later you suggested the following solution and asked for criticism .model small .stack 100h .data .code main proc call defineuser1 call defineuser2 mov cx 5 userdefine1 proc l1 mov dx 0 mov bx 2 add dx bx mov ah 02h loop l1 int 21h endp userdefine2 proc mov ah 4ch int 21h userdefine2 endp my criticisms are as follows defineuser1 doesn t exist i think you mean userdefine1 setting cx needs to be inside not before the procedure invoking int 21 needs to be inside not outside the loop you need special handling for 10 as i mentioned above there s a difference between 0 the ascii chars digit and 0 the number .

531083
swt	swing
i ve developed both with swing and with swt but not with qt
with swing your code will be automatically cross-platform

531083
swt	swing
familiar look-and-feel. the disadvantage of swt is that it uses all native widgets
not as many widgets as swing has whether this is more an advantage or a disadvantage depends on what you are doing and what your goals are

531083
swt	swing
however there are a few things that swt does that swing doesn t do as well or at all -- such as launch the system s native browser and execute javascript scripts in this browser
if you consider swt consider it carefully

531083
swt	swing
with swt there is a smaller community supporting it
with swing a larger community but this does not mean that fixes will get more quickly into a development release

531260
folder	dir
if you put the images directory into the public folder of the rails app for example public images then you shouldn t have any problems with mime types unless your web server is configured wrongly
according to your examples you want the images dir in the root of the app

531765
keydown	keyup
you ll have to store whether or not the key in question is already down and ignore the respective keydown event
the keyup event isn t actually fired for all keys not just arrow keys etc. until you release the key there are just many repeated keydown events

532031
ready	each
it is a low proirity project so i can t give an estimate on when its ready
just to explain why this isn t a trivial task read the source create a model that contains enough information for each symbol usage

532828
int	chars
if you can waste a little storage well 25 you might gain from adding a fourth dummy unsigned chars to the structure imgrgb provided that this would increase the size of the structure to the size of an int
native ints are usually fastest to access and if you re looking at a structure of chars that are not filling up an int completely you re potentially running into all sorts of interesting access issues that can slow your code down noticeably because the compiler might have to generate additional instructions to extract the unsigned chars

533739
strlen	realloc
oh i didn t bother to fix the fact that reverse is probably not null terminated when you try the strlen - i ll leave that as an exercise for the reader
you can t realloc memory that wasn t malloced in the first place

533777
inherited	properties
if that doesn t work - i d also try to inherited from databoundcontrol instead of usercontrol and see if that gets you anywhere
you could try adding the idreferenceproperty attribute to your properties definition.

534837
nullpointerexception	runtimeexception
the kind of exceptions that you shouldn t be catching are things like nullpointerexception and arrayindexoutofboundsexception these indicate bugs in your code
java has two types of exception checked exceptions and unchecked exceptions those that inherit from runtimeexception

534939
temp	tmp
suddenly other system process deletes your temp folder and you cannot write anymore
there is nothing you can do to prevent this programmatically in some systems that operation could happen in unix the root user may perform rm -rf tmp and there is nothing you can do about it

535035
put	get
if it s reasonable for you to put the corelib and non-corelib files in separate repositories or even separate directory trees within the same repository that is almost certainly the best and most efficient solution
from reading it doesn t seem like subversion can do that - you d probably have to search all files in the repository manually to get a list of the ones with the property set and just check those out

535496
std	ostream
edit true manipulator semantics a persistent quoting state could also be achieved by wrapping an std ostream rather than deriving from it as noted by benôit in the comments. to the best of my knowledge this cannot be done directly without either deriving a new class from std ostream or similar or wrapping such a class in another class that forwards most methods to its contained std ostream object
that s because for the code example you provide to work you will need to somehow modify the behaviour of which is defined somewhere in the iostreams hierarchy or possibly wherever std string is defined

535826
implements	extends
with poco you have to use the runnable interface and the usage is close to what you would get with java threads if you implements runnable not extends thread boost threads recommended are a little different
instead of implementing extends an interface it depends on the operator being defined

535933
apache	nginx
not only is nginx supposedly faster than apache at delivering static content but this also offloads your rails application for every image stylesheet javascript or whatever other static content
i typically use nginx as a frontend and apache passenger as a backend

536290
subclass	superclass
the subclass object itself remains intact
slicing means that if you assign a subclass instance to a superclass variable the extra information contained by subclass is sliced off because the superclass variable doesn t have the extra space to store this extra information of the subclass

536620
hash	salt
the strength of a hash function is not determined by its input
using a salt that is known to the attacker obviously makes constructing a rainbow table particularly for hard-coded usernames like root more attractive but it doesn t weaken the hash

536620
hash	salt
using a salt that is known to the attacker obviously makes constructing a rainbow table particularly for hard-coded usernames like root more attractive but it doesn t weaken the hash
using a salt which is unknown to the attacker will make the system harder to attack

536756
hash	salt
this already makes it known to any attacker with access to the password hash
using the username as salt or not does not affect that knowledge and therefore it would have no effect on single-system security

537334
dxcore	coderush
dxcore is the framework on which refactorpro and coderush are built which should give you an idea of what sort of graphical capability they are capable of
that said you do not need either of these tools to use the dxcore

537491
submit	submission
to stop the submit if you don t intend on it submission
you need to use val to get the value in jquery the dom object is not readily accessible off of it is stored in by jquery so if you wanted to access the value the traditional way you would do additionally i don t think the form would submit right away in your case because of the alert but you should return false

537806
inherited	properties
it can be used as a kind of inherited to call another class s constructor on your own class and this method is taught in some js object-orientation tutorials
however it really isn t a very good way of doing it because you end up with multiple copies of the same properties

537920
prepare	execute
i m not familiar with pdo but i d bet it provides a mechanism for running parametrized queries with the values given in the same function call if you don t want to prepare then run as a separate step
something like or similar. also if you look under the hood most db abstraction layers will prepare the query then run it even if you just tell it to execute a static sql statement

538074
hash	md5
md5 is considered weak in the sense that it is possible to construct two documents with the same hash with a much lower amount of cpu time needed than it would take for a brute-force search collision resistance of md5 has been broken
but it s not as far as i know weak from the standpoint of if you have an arbitrary document x someone else can create a document y with the same hash with a much easier time than a brute-force search md5 still has preimage resistance

538439
photoshop	paint.net
paint.net is a nice graphics package not quite up to photoshop but impressive nonetheless written in c#
because you mentioned photoshop .

538931
vmware	virtualbox
trying to figure out what vmware products i was allowed to use and how i was allowed to use them would have taken more time than getting everything set up in virtualbox did
sorry it doesn t really answer your question but i personally chose to use virtualbox instead of vmware partially because of the exact issue you ve run into

538940
vmware	esx
vmware server is great i use it for compartamentalizing different projects which require different setups and would recommend it if you require different environment setups and your machine has enough resources
vmware esx is not free thus not for you

538940
vmware	esx
vmware esx is not free thus not for you
vmware esxi is free but can t run on top of an os installation thus might not be for you

539082
min	max
finally if you put the min max occurs on the sequence and you later add an additional element then this may allow the following xml which is probably not what you intend whereas if you have then it is clear and unambiguous what you intend a sequence of one or more book elements followed by a sequence of one or more ebook elements
in almost all circumstances you want to put the min max occurs on the element within a sequence and not on the sequence

539523
downcasting	upcasting
downcasting needs an explicit cast and may throw an exception if the object is not of the correct type
upcasting however needs no explicit cast and is always safe to do

539609
rss	feed
each entry in the so rss feed has a category node which contains all of its tags and pipes would allow you to build and or not expressions based on those categories
even if you don t want the pop-up notifications you get with e-mail the pipes solution will let you monitor what you want in an rss feed

539828
hash	md5
your hash is the first letter of the name which then makes it quicker to search through
md5 sha1 are used to derive hashes that are used to verify that data has not been tampered

540045
expression-blend	silverlight
in expression-blend 2 the toolbox is called the asset library and it can be accessed by left clicking the double right arrow at the bottom of the list on the left of the screen once the asset library is open a good tip if you can t find the control you are looking for you mention you cannot find the button control in expression-blend 2 is to type it s name in the search area at the top left or click the show all... checkbox as shown above
this blog post is a good place to start for a first look at using expression-blend with silverlight 2 with plenty of screenshots

540108
memcpy	memmove
be careful not to use memcpy - its behaviour is undefined in this situation since source and destination usually overlap
use memmove to move the tail then put 0 at the new end position

540138
cpu	processors
this effectively optimizes out the trip from memory back into the cpu that would follow the movntdq version and all of the instructions following the call will run faster
but on the other hand if the destination buffer is large compared to the processors s cache that optimization doesn t work and the movntdq version would give you faster application benchmarks

540373
postgresql	mysql
you might like to look at the chapters in the mysql manual and postgresql manual on indexing
do not worry about what mysql is doing internally to locate records quickly

540486
daemons	systemd
it goes on to describe when a program exits in execution - program exit 12.8 a program terminates all its activity and exits when one of two things happens all the threads that are not daemons threads terminate
some thread invokes the exit method of class runtime or class systemd and the exit operation is not forbidden by the security manager

540760
put	get
if you put a comment marker at the end of each sentence emacs knows not to move the next line inside the comment chat chat chat. a new sentence with goofed up wrapping that needs to be fixed. mumble mumble then m-q fills each sentence separately at least in auctex 11.85
if you test this in emacs there seems to be a bug where if this is the first paragraph in the buffer and you type m-q you get an error message

541075
tapestry	wicket
tapestry doesn t separate markup and code properly in a manner which could be easily validated between the two which will cause problems in the future
my opinions are quite heavily biased towards wicket because i ve been using it for a while after tripping over jsp mines far too many times

541094
vmware	esx
we were trying to spoof the mac to vm a license server and newer versions won t let you do it. also this won t guarantee you aren t running on a physical box with a nic spoofed to look like vmware but that would be an odd thing to do in most circumstances anyway
i think depending on the version of esx you can inspect at the mac address of the nic

541417
xsl-fo	xslt
in some cases maybe xslt is not right for the job you could then consider using code to generate xsl-fo
i have used xsl-fo a lot professionally both from java and .net environments. it indeed gives you total control over the printed document pdf. i myself have generated very complex pdf s ready for mass-printing brochures and papers . they included complex structures like text floated in columns graphs using embedded svg and tables

541417
xsl-fo	xslt
xsl-fo is definitely way to go when generating pdf s or printed documents
edit i only answered part of your question i guess. xsl-fo is not natively supported within any common browser as of today. i don t think there any plans for implementing native support in ie i d be very surprised if it was. xsl-fo is just xml so you won t need any further xsl-fo support by the .net framework then as of today. typically xsl-fo is generated using xslt and then the transformation result is passed to a formatting objects processor such as fop. in some cases xslt at least not 1.0 is not enough if your xsl-fo document is very complex

541417
xsl-fo	xslt
edit i only answered part of your question i guess. xsl-fo is not natively supported within any common browser as of today. i don t think there any plans for implementing native support in ie i d be very surprised if it was. xsl-fo is just xml so you won t need any further xsl-fo support by the .net framework then as of today. typically xsl-fo is generated using xslt and then the transformation result is passed to a formatting objects processor such as fop. in some cases xslt at least not 1.0 is not enough if your xsl-fo document is very complex
you might then consider using xslt extensions written in languages such as c#

541456
document.write	window.open
firefox at least puts a temporary skeleton document in until you first call document.write but i can t see that this is actually documented anywhere so it s probably best not relied upon
var popup window.open popup height 400px width 400px

541500
implements	extends
edit this originally said implements an interface requires less resources. as well but you need to create a new thread instance either way so this was wrong
i m not an expert but i can think of one reason to implement runnable instead of extends thread java only supports single inheritance so you can only extends one class

542257
ssl	https
the telnet client is not going to know to send a properly constructed request to initiate an https handshake so i imagine the ssl secured server is just waiting for more data
the telnet client is certainly not going to know what to do with the response from a ssl secured server it s certainly not going to prompt you for data to send along

542257
ssl	https
the telnet client is certainly not going to know what to do with the response from a ssl secured server it s certainly not going to prompt you for data to send along
communication can only happen once the https handshake has completed

543581
actionscript	mxml
good to know is that mxml is compiled down to actionscript so it is perfectly possible to write everything in actionscript and avoid mxml although i wouldn t recommend that in most cases
it is just a layer on top of actionscript

543905
cvs	svn
you can almost entirely scrub the my usb flash drive was lost broken stolen excuse for students who do not hand in assignments since students should be doing regular commits to the repository in some subjects marks are allocated to correct use of cvs
the downside is that you cannot assume that students will know how to use cvs svn at the beginning of the semester

543905
cvs	svn
the downside is that you cannot assume that students will know how to use cvs svn at the beginning of the semester
most subjects here dedicate the first week s practical to a cvs tutorial so people can make sure that a the sysadmins have setup their accounts correctly and b that they can add and commit files correctly

544062
width	margin
afaik setting padding and width explicitly to a textarea and an input element will give the exacts same pixel width in all browsers
ie6 does add a 1px margin to the top and bottom i believe not the sides

544441
post	put	post	get
in your code you a specify the post method which sends the data to the php file without putting the data in the web address
when you put the information in the address bar that is not the post method that is the get method

544441
post	get	put	get
when you put the information in the address bar that is not the post method that is the get method
the name may be confusing but get just means that the data is being sent to the php file through the web address instead of behind the scenes not that it is supposed to get any information

544559
versioning	upgrade
this will occasionally occur if you do not upload wp-config.php or all of the other files that have changed between versioning
download a clean copy of the wp version you are trying to upgrade from the wp release archive

545819
getter	setter
humans say this is a getter and this is a setter but tools don t
in fact getname is not a getter because getters don t accept arguments

546316
vbscript	jscript
you can call vbscript from jscript and the other way around
try to do what you want to do in a cmd-file it that doesn t cut it use windows scripting host to call a wsh-file with jscript and or vbscript in it

546316
vbscript	jscript
try to do what you want to do in a cmd-file it that doesn t cut it use windows scripting host to call a wsh-file with jscript and or vbscript in it
if you prefer the jscript-look use that as your primary language and use vbscript for things you copy from the net or cannot find a jscript solution to

546987
union	distinct
that should not be the case if you use union only if you use union all
select distinct ans from select right as ans from answers union select wrong1 as ans from answers union select wrong2 as ans from answers union select wrong3 as ans from answers union select wrong4 as ans from answers as temp the distinct is superfluous because the union will not return rows that are identical for all columns

union	distinct
select distinct ans from select right as ans from answers union select wrong1 as ans from answers union select wrong2 as ans from answers union select wrong3 as ans from answers union select wrong4 as ans from answers as temp the distinct is superfluous because the union will not return rows that are identical for all columns
when you want duplicated or if you know that no duplicates exist use union all for faster performance this will give you a single list containing all the answers

548034
777	tmp
here is one series of steps to accomplish the workaround to be typed in at the terminal 1-3 done on every machine you ll be developing on 4-6 once in your nfs-mounted home directory sudo mkdir usr local iphone-dirs sudo chmod 777 usr local iphone-dirs mkdir usr local iphone-dirs my-dir cd library application support rm -rf iphone simulator ln -s usr local iphone-dirs my-dir iphone simulator there are obviously many variations on this theme
i suspect that using a locally-hosted directory in tmp would be fine and not require admin privs but would have to be redone every time the system is rebooted

548312
int	chars
the value of an int chars constant containing a single chars that maps to a single-byte execution chars is the numerical value of the representation of the mapped chars interpreted as an int
the value of an int chars constant containing more than one chars ab or containing a chars or escape sequence that does not map to a single-byte execution chars is implementation-defined

548312
int	chars
the value of an int chars constant containing more than one chars ab or containing a chars or escape sequence that does not map to a single-byte execution chars is implementation-defined
if an int chars constant contains a single chars or escape sequence its value is the one that results when an object with type chars whose value is that of the single chars or escape sequence is converted to type int

548312
int	chars
the value of an int chars constant containing a single chars that maps into a member of the basic execution chars set is the numerical value of the representation of the mapped chars interpreted as an int
the value of an int chars constant containing more than one chars or containing a chars or escape sequence not represented in the basic execution chars set is implementation-defined

548422
delphi	oxygene
delphi prism aka rem objects oxygene formerly chrome provides the gc version of delphi that those who need it are looking for along with asp.net and wpf silverlight ce with the readability and lack of curly braces of delphi
for those like me for which unicode support isn t a major factor delphi 2007 provides asp.net and vcl.net as well as native win32 support

548779
boost	stl
if there s functionality provided by the stl but not boost concentrate on learning those bits of the stl
it depends entirely on whether you re going to be able to use boost in all your work

548781
boost	stl
mastering all the boost is really hard check with boost for any library that is not available with c++ out of box.like parsing library graph library
first go with stl because that is what you will be using most of the time

548859
boost	stl
if you understand them then moving right on to boost may be of use to you
if not i would start with the stl

548909
boost	stl
boost provides many powerful features is widely used and has a good reputation
most of the things it provides share the same generic-programming concepts with which the stl was designed so in that sense it should not be very confusing

548921
g++	gcc
libstdc++ for that reason is tightly coupled with gcc and code compiled with one version of g++ will in general only work with the libstdc++ from with this or a very similar version of g++
as you will surely notice if you ever try to build a program with gcc 4 with any non-trivial library on your system that was built with gcc 3 this is not just libstdc++

549212
ienumerable	icollection
here s a small function i m using to determine if an object is a collection which will be enumerable as well since icollection is also ienumerable
i ve tried to use a similar technique as darren suggested however just beware that not just collections implement ienumerable

549447
nettcpbinding	net.tcp
the nettcpbinding uses a custom wire-level framing format that is not really documented though nicholas allen started a series of blog posts on the topic recently
the series start here to be honest net.tcp is really currently more useful for wcf to wcf communication

549572
swt	swing
swt could also be an option but so far i ve been happy with swing
people like to bash swing for being old slow and ugly but it s just not true

549817
equals	compareto
linkedlist.contains uses equals so you have to make sure that the method has been implemented correctly
equals should also be consistent with compareto though this is not strictly necessary

550097
versioning	upgrade
keep in mind this is not upgrade proof - you will probably have to do this again if you upgrade your versioning of wp
in versioning 2.7.1 these items are created in wp_install_defaults of wp-admin includes upgrade.php

550365
getter	setter
rather the expectation is that you ll access and mutate properties via getter setter methods
in objective-c 2.0 it s easy to declare these properties and automatically synthesize the getters setter so there s not much excuse for not using them

550468
multiplying	multiplication
the combination of the them would transform a point from space a to space b hence this is a transformation matrix m_ab now the location of the camera is in space a and so it is not the valid transformation for space b so you need to multiplying this location with the rotation transform
well if you write the 3 dots on a paper you d discover that 3 dots with x y and z is exactly like multiplication with a rotation matrix

550568
int	double
using your operator long double myclass operator long double built-in using your built-in conversion int to long double
i assume you are comparing against a literal int and not a long double if that is the case both alternatives are as good complex

550690
integer	fractions
anyway there are two easy ways to do it either way if you have 64-bit integers or floating points the former are more likely on an embedded system obviously both are only integer approximations because most values in one scale cannot be represented as integers in the other scale
and in one direction you may be losing some precision because the fractions form can represent much finer times - one increment of the fractions form is less than 0.00024 microseconds

550901
pull	push
this is the default remote used when you type git fetch or git pull to retrieve new commits into your local repository and the default destination when you git push to push your new local commits out to a remote repository
you do not need to include ssh username url.com username workfolder in your push command if that is where you cloned from

550997
subclass	inherited
but now you are tying this logic to the customer and you need a subclass for each type of customer just to implement the different behaviour
last time i checked this is not how inherited should be used

550997
inherited	properties
last time i checked this is not how inherited should be used
you would want the type of customer to be a properties of customer or have a function that can decide the type of a customer

551301
vim	emacs
vim does only text editing and that very well without plugins
its up to you if you like emacs or not

551394
emacs	textmate
but this isn t necessarily an argument for emacs specifically
on os x for example textmate is an awesome editor for these tasks

551489
post	get
however now i am dealing with a similar problem where a post request appears out of nowhere where it shouldn t and the only difference is in the accept header
i have seen this with the web application we are supporting - a stray get request out of the blue for an already logged in user wrecking the server-side state and resulting in an error on the subsequent legitimate post request

551877
vmware	virtualbox
however there are some hacks that allow installing os x under vmware
it might be also possible to install it under virtualbox or virtual pc although i have not seen specific instructions

553144
maven	pom.xml
not necessarily the easiest way but i managed to get this working using jboss s embeddable ejb3.0 container with major assistance from java persistence with hibernate for a start i don t know of maven plugins dependencies for this so i had to install my own locally 1 download jboss-ejb-3.0_embeddable_alpha_9.zip from downloads 2 this zipfile contains two important jars jboss-ejb3-all.jar thirdparty-all.jar 3 install these jars into your local repository use your own initials instead of nkl 4 if all has gone well you should now have two directories in your local repository
5 now add the following dependencies to your pom.xml 6 i also needed to add dependencies for hsqldb and slf4j 7 you need to copy some files from the conf directory of the zipfile to the src main resources directory of your project default.persistence.properties ejb3-interceptors-aop.xml embedded-jboss-beans.xml jndi.properties 8 i created my own beans.xml and persistence.xml files in src main resources meta-inf 9 i created a unit test like the following using additional infomation from here

553601
stretchblt	bitblt
that is exactly what stretchblt is for and stretchblt compared to any other graphics resizing operation is insanely fast as in most cases it can use the graphics card to accelerate its performance
bitblt will only perform mathmatic operations or xor etc on the individual pixels in question it will not resize the image in any way

554564
inherited	properties
for example public mustinherit class parent public mustoverride properties foo as string end class public class readonlychild inherited parent public overrides properties foo as string get end get private set byval value as string end set end properties end class note the private scoping on the setter
this will not work as vb.net is insisting that since you re overriding the base classes properties your entire properties must have the same scope as the properties you re overriding in this case public

554564
public	protected
this will not work as vb.net is insisting that since you re overriding the base classes property your entire property must have the same scope as the property you re overriding in this case public
attempting to make the base class s abstract property protected will not work either since you would then be required to implement the property at the same level of scoping as it s declared in your base class protected

554564
inherited	properties	public	protected
therefore public mustinherit class parent protected mustoverride properties foo as string end class public class readonlychild inherited parent protected overrides properties foo as string public get end get set byval value as string end set end properties end class note the public scoping on the getter
doesn t work either due to the public scope being less restrictive than the overall properties scope of protected and moreover not of the same scoping level as defined on the base class s abstract properties declaration

554801
getter	setter
python folks don t use getter and they re not burning in hell
getter setter is a way to expose part of the class to java s simple introspection

555072
implements	extends
the original class would be class myclass object implements isomething def do_something self return foo then imagine interface isomethingelse has a method do_something_else
an adapter could look like this you then would register that adapter with the component registry and you could then use it like this what that gives you is the ability to extends the original class with functionality which the class does not provide directly

555148
put	get
generally to add a command to the context menus you d do the following tools | customize on the toolbars tab put a tick next to the context menus item - this will add a new toolbar to your ide with buttons for editor context menus class view context menus debugger context menus etc then switch to the commands tab select the command you want and drag it to the appropriate menu and you re done - in this case in the left hand pane select view and then in the right hand pane scroll down until you get to view markup
that being said in this instance i can add the button to the context menu for the code editor but it s greyed out and unusable - i guess it needs some context that it gets from the solution explorer that it doesn t get from the code window - which is odd because it s pulling the same details through for view designer and view code

555179
ssl	https
that line tells apache to include the ssl variables in the environment for your scripts php
_server https isn t there switched on or not no matter if you re looking at the site via ssl or non-ssl

555179
ssl	https
_server https isn t there switched on or not no matter if you re looking at the site via ssl or non-ssl
for some reason the hosting has chosen to serve all the https requests encrypted but down port 80

555670
post	get
there s no way to do a post in this manner the src url must be a get so you can pass arguments that way
i m not sure if wcf has a get only method of access

556089
integer	fractions
if you want integer rounding for positive floating point values so that values with a fractions component below 0.5 round to the next lowest integer and values with a fractions component of 0.5 or greater round to the next higher integer add 0.5 to the value you are casting
all the above suggestions not to use floating point values for integer mathematics are worth noting

556131
serializable	deserialization
option 1 is suited if you can ensure that the client always sends serializable representations of data contracts to the server
however if you need some flexibility in the serialization deserialization logic and not get tightly coupled with datacontracts then option 2 looks good

556712
filtering	grouping
added value though the fact that the filtering on support and status only needs to be set in one place
as an alternative to the grouping by clause you can do select distinct which would increase readability this may or may not affect overall performance i suggest you measure both variants against each other

556757
x86	mips
some processors families such as the x86 have special instructions for manipulating the stack of the currently executing thread
other processor families including powerpc and mips do not have explicit stack support but instead rely on convention and delegate stack management to the operating system s application binary interface abi

556770
x86	mips
from nils pipenbrinck it s worthy of note that some processors do not implement all of the instructions for accessing and manipulating the stack push pop stack pointer etc but the x86 does because of it s frequency of use
in these situations if you wanted a stack you would have to implement it yourself some mips and some arm processors are created without stacks

557079
soappy	suds
soappy has support for attachments on its todo list
suds does not mention the word attachments anywhere

557726
for-loop	loops
keep in mind that the for-loop and foreach-loop are not always equivalent
list enumerators will throw an exception if the list changes but you won t always get that warning with a normal for loops

557838
xslt	sgml
that helps a lot since you can use a lot of tools originally designed for xml such as xml parsers xslt xpath xquery .
normal html is a sgml dialect and that is not parsable without knowledge of the schema

558159
apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx
just because apache is widely used doesn t mean other products are just optimization
in my experience lighttpd and nginx are easy enough to configure and you can use fcgi bindings for most programming languages

558654
put	get
make the server s ip address static and hard-code or put in a configuration file look-up via dns or netbios name of the machine
i have not done any socket programming in a long time but with timeouts and such this might not get much better

559018
post	get
based on your feedback questions i would add to the post
i m not sure how you d get the shared linestrings from your shapes

559971
pull	push
publicly visible repository model perhaps you are using a different more gittish model where you just want people to be able to pull from your repo
in this case git push --force isn t too bad because then they can deal with keeping up with it

561272
comparator	icomparer
this can work where icomparer comparator cannot because it operates on an entire collection instead of individual items
it might look something like this then i could implement a shuffle from the iarranger interface using a proper fisher-yates algorithm and also have implementations that wrap each additional ienumerable.sort comparator icomparer varieties that i care about

561450
disk	ram
it indicates the amount of virtual memory that is currently resident on disk whether or not it s actually in the swap space
the os is very good about keeping active pages in ram and the only cures for swapping are 1 buy more memory or 2 reduce the number of processes so it s best to ignore this number

561534
int	chars
so you wouldn t gain anything for a single int
base64 takes 4 bytes chars to encode 3 bytes and can only encode multiples of 3 bytes and adds padding otherwise

562510
bash	zsh
it works ok when i start it under bash
maybe there s something in your zsh configuration that s mucking it up or it s not sourcing your zsh s startup files

563391
inherited	subclassing
i think your problem may be coming from being confused about the inherited hierarchy of your memberlist class
it isn t actually a subclassing of member at all it is a subclassing of list of t

563472
lisp	scheme
it s popular it s actively developed it has many libraries offering the features of a modern programming environment and scheme is somewhat simpler not to say better just simpler than common lisp
lisp s biggest problem is that there s no overriding standard everyone sticks to

565155
getter	setter
in general you should also find that you need to supply a setter much less often than a getter - especially if you are trying to make your objects immutable - which is a good thing but not always the best choice - but even if not
if you need external access to individual values of fields use getters and or setter

565189
traceroute	packets
those links go to java implementations of bgp and traceroute
lots of hops in a traceroute do not indicate closeness just devices the packets routes through

565212
getter	setter
the jvm is smart enough to inline trivial getter setter even non- final ones as long as they aren t actually overridden
just fyi in addition to all the excellent answers in this thread remember that of all reasons you can come up with for or against getter setter performance isn t one as some might believe

565290
getter	setter
if the array were a public field it just won t be immutable to implement a truly immutable array a getter for the array getarray method should be written so it returns a copy of its array and even if the following occurs the immutablearray is indeed immutable
exposing the variables of an object will allow it to be manipulated in ways which aren t intended but only exposing certain ways getters and setter the object can be manipulated in intended ways

565697
int	chars
but it does not always work note how all of a d and statically resolve to an int - apart from and which declare a reference thus it needs to be initialized and a pointer to a class member respectively
technically it makes sense to write because is the declarator in that while the chars is the declaration specifier which specifies a basic type of all the declarators

565891
division	multiplication
the result in step 3 will be exactly 1000 though so the inexactness of the division isn t important
the inexactness of the multiplication in step 4 is though

566000
visualvm	jrockit
use visualvm to debug a memory leak
each time you reload an application it uses additional perm gen memory which cannot be reclaimed in sun jvm others like jrockit don t have this problem

566356
background-repeat	background-position
even with the transparent png support its worth keeping in mind that transparent background images cannot be tiled repeated using background-repeat or positioned using background-position
this hinders any ability to use css rollovers using background-position

567408
jobs	cron
this box just does jobs and is not accessible to the outside world
on this separate box a cron job runs all outstanding jobs every 60 seconds unless jobs are still running from the last invocation

567812
wav	caf
the iphone only supports the following codecs amr adaptive multi-rate a speech codec ilbc internet low bitrate codec also a speech codec ima adpcm also known as ima-4 linear pcm µlaw and alaw your wav files may contain audio that is in a different format so even though the iphone supports wav files it might not support your specific wav file
the best option is normally to use the command line program afconvert to convert everything to caf files which is apple s default format

568356
wxhaskell	gtk2hs
when wxhaskell was first announced at the haskell workshop the development of the native haskell api looked extremely promising but was still incomplete
it looks as if the haskellized api for wxhaskell is still being worked on whereas the gtk2hs project doesn t mention this issue at all

568612
ubuntu	linux
i d stick with ubuntu if it was more compatible with windows programs
.net development while in school typically isn t done on a linux distribution

568661
put	get
wouldn t it be easier just to put everything in a signed jar
there are already standard java libraries and tools to do this and you get compression and verification provided

568702
versioning	upgrade
of course it could be argued that this are what vm s are for but we ve chosen the other way around use vm s to test for older versioning
our company has 6000 computers so we offered to not get corporate support on the software we ve upgrade ourself

568764
put	get
i actually find this to be the most significant limiter of how many statements i want to put on a single line
if you get a nullpointerexception in this statement from your production logs you re really in trouble getcustomer .getorders .iterator .next .getitems .iterator .next .getproduct .getname although i agree with your thoughts adding an extra variable can introduce an extra concept in the method and this concept may not always be relevant to the overall goal of the method

569361
boost	stl
quite frankly for beginners i think boost isn t that well-suited
i think a beginner is better off understanding how the basics work before moving up the food chain using higher level tool libs like boost or even stl

569618
fflush	gets
thus even if you are in blocking mode your send operation will only block for as long as it takes to fflush the buffer out
since udp does not know anything about the network it will write it out at the earliest opportunity without checking the network speed or if it actually gets to where it is supposed to be going

569648
actionscript	mxml	mxml	haxe
if correct imports are missing java.lang.nullpointerexception missing of a code formatter or automatic get setter but there are solutions with other eclipse plugins like monkey scripts cfeclipse flexformatter flexprettyprintcommand ... sometimes a bit sluggish if background tasks in eclipse are working no package explorer as2 and as3 only - no haxe flashdevelop pros free and open source developed with c# lightweight and snappy best available code assist for actionscript supports all flash languages - as2 as3 haxe auto code for automatic getter setter variables code for event handlers code snippets with integrated snippet editor extendible with plug-ins support for asdoc comments package explorer show classes symbols from a swc file basic refactoring multiple source code folders per project useful plugins ant integration swc creation mini map quick navigate cons only for windows no visual designer for mxml no support of virtual folders files inside the project weak refactoring changing classpaths must be done manually plug-ins often not working in newer versions and many plug-ins are only rarely updated limited support for debugging haxe applications common pros projects for full range of flash apps websites air desktop mobile debugging of fp air apps with breakpoints and stepping debugging with watch windows and locals support for asdoc comments automatic adding of imports and organizing of imports class wizard svg git integration cons no editing of graphics or animation use flash ide for that summary for debugging visual design of mxml forms flash builder for coding as2 as3 haxe projects under windows flashdevelop

569854
floating-point	fixed-point	floating-point	integer
be aware that this fpu mode rounding is applied to floating-point operations in situations that might not be obvious when thinking in terms of the currency type which is a fixed-point type scaled 64-bit integer
a small imprecision in intermediate floating-point calculations such as 82.000000000000001 will end up rounding up even when the value as currency is anticipated to be 82.00

570440
stdout	stderr
the 1 is not extraneous it is inserted by cmd.exe meaning stdout instead of you can also write 1
contrast this to redirecting stderr 2

570495
serializable	deserialization
also the serializable events are covered in programming wcf services 2nd ed by juval lowy in chapter 3 pgs 107-110
i m not sure if you can completely short-circuit deserialization though.

570644
stdout	fflush
it appears as if stdout is in fact redirected to another junit stream
the real problem however was that the the streamhandler s buffer was not fflush until after stdout was reset to its original output stream resulting in the log messages not appearing in junit s output for stdout

570707
boost	stl
clarification boost did not boost up my ood skills
stl boost is a tool for the job

570896
put	get
i suspect it has somthing to do with pyunicode_asencodedstring however that returns a pyobject so i m not sure how to put that into my buffer.
the pyobject returned is a pystringobject so you just need to use pystring_size and pystring_asstring to get a pointer to the string s buffer and memcpy it to your own buffer

571801
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
oh and google-chrome
google-chrome still doesn t know what it wants to be safari or firefox

572589
installation	upgrade
resharper is great and i get a little angry now when i have to use a vs installation that doesn t have it
fwiw resharper had a good upgrade policy between 3.x and 4.x

572748
ssms	sqlcmd
you can not automate it in ssms or use an environment variable the code the job the alerts etc all must exist on the server
you can put the scripted trace into a batch file and run it via osql sqlcmd but it has to be invoked manually

573582
required	placeholder
that is our quite simple bind object would not fit into the small buffer and would required operator new to be stored
if the bind object above would use a compressed_pair it can actually reduce its size to 8 bytes or 4 bytes for non-member function pointer often because the placeholder is nothing more than an empty object

573743
post	get
activemq has a web console for sending test messages like mentioned above but if your provider doesn t have this it might be easiest to just write a console app web page to post test messages
sending a message in jms isn t too hard you might get the most benefit just writing your own test client

573928
inherited	subclassing
i find multiple inherited particularly useful when using mixin classes
as stated in wikipedia in object-oriented programming languages a mixin is a class that provides a certain functionality to be inherited by a subclassing but is not meant to stand alone

574548
std	ostream
change std cout to a std ostream and then pass your file or std cout as required
then you cannot use std cout anywhere else to print stuff from your program

574640
profiling	debugging
but in reality you shouldn t normally be running the service from a project s bin folder anyway - the files should be put somewhere project and profiling independent for example under program files
for debugging purposes when it will be in the bin folder you can detect whether it is a service in main and if it is being run interactively just run the service code directly rather than the usual service-start setup

574741
opera	google-chrome
it is tested with ff3 ie7 opera 9.6 and google-chrome 1
but as i said since google-chrome does return the real source code for most functions it isn t useful to test it in that browser

575461
put	get
in the first place you can put the clustered index on unique name it doesn t have to be onthe id field
if you do little or no joining to this table you could get rid of the id

575811
rank	max
edit below i see in the comment that you want to see the rank not the score. for this i don t know the ansi sql answer but database specific in mysql in oracle you can use the rank statement
looks like you want to query this select userid max score from leaderboard group by userid order by max score desc this returns the leaderboard with 1 entry for every user

575830
jtable	jlayeredpane
as you say the basic jtable rendering mechanism does not support this a cellrenderer is used to paint a cell or part of a cell as necessary and won t allow repaints it draws on demand
method 1 - jlayeredpane if i needed to do this i would use a jlayeredpane to draw my animated renderers on top of the the jtable

575958
google-chrome	firefox
i consider google-chrome browser to be a great first run experience because it is simple installs nicely and is super fast
for some others especially many reading stackoverflow.com it might be flawed because their expectation is that google-chrome can also seamlessly import their firefox or whatever other plugins which was not part of google-chrome s original features

576418
graphics2d	jcomponent
it does not have a method with the signature paintcomponent graphics2d
overriding the paintcomponent graphics method can be accomplished by the following however defining a method with the signature with paintcomponent graphics2d like the following is legal but it won t ever be called as it is not overriding any method that is defined in jcomponent the java api specifications for the jcomponent class which is the superclass of jpanel has a method summary which lists all the methods that are part of the class

576597
rss	feed
rss atom feed does not allow for historic information to be retrieved
it is up to the publisher of the feed to provide it if they want such as in the blogger or wordpress examples you gave above

576667
cpython	ironpython
in addition to that ironpython doesn t have the gil an issue that prevents cpython threads from taking full advantage of multi-core architectures
if you want to code in python and get great threading support you might want to check out ironpython or jython

577199
maple	mupad
the version of matlab you are using uses mupad as it s symbolic computation engine but they used to use maple
i have the most recent version of the maple version of the symbolic toolbox and when i put your expression into it i get so i would suggest that there is no solution to this system of equations and the new mupad symbolic engine simply doesn t handle this fact very elegantly

577436
notepad++	jedit
it seams notepad++ is not capable of highlighting columns
for jedit i found some possibilities but not finished yet the plugin columnruler version 1.0.2 author brad mace but it is shown in all file modes

577475
public	protected
if you define a struct and derive it from a class or struct it will be a public inheritance by default if you wonder how you should wrap c structs - i would embed them as a member into the class
because the c structs were not designed to be inherited from think of the neither protected nor virtual destructor in the c structs - they can t have one

577817
16-bit	64bit
although c is close to the low-level manipulation of 8-bit 16-bit 32-bit 64bit data there are a few mathematical operations not supported by c which can often be performed elegantly in certain assembly instruction sets fixed-point multiplication the product of two 16-bit numbers is a 32-bit number
but the rules in c says that the product of two 16-bit numbers is a 16-bit number and the product of two 32-bit numbers is a 32-bit number -- the bottom half in both cases

578530
qtableview	qheaderview
since you use a qtablewidget which is a child of qtableview everything works out
i am not sure whether this is the best way to do this but the qheaderview documentation recommends this method

578530
qheaderview	qtablewidget
i am not sure whether this is the best way to do this but the qheaderview documentation recommends this method
to quote the pyqt4 docs- appearance qtablewidget and qtableview create default headers

578733
bash	tcsh
one of your comments betrays that you are not using bash
you re using csh or tcsh

579864
subclass	base-class
regarding your update you could subclass your object
the base-class would return null if the field has not been set and the sub-class would return your default value

580455
inherited	properties
apparently the default implementation will only return direct properties from an interface and not the inherited ones
luckily this mechanism is extensible and you can write a typeconverter class with custom properties information implementation

580634
innodb	myisam
for tables with ratios lower than about 5 1 you will probably benefit from innodb because then inserts won t block selects
but if you aren t using transactions you should change innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit to 1 to get performance back over myisam

580692
int	boolean
sqlite has no built-in boolean type - you have to use an int instead
also when you re comparing the value to true and t you re comparing it to those values as strings not as boolean or integers and therefore the comparison will always fail

580736
folder	directory
ctrl-click on frameworks folder and select add existing frameworks
the default framework directory in system frameworks may not contain the new avfoundation framework file so you will need to navigate very deep into the iphone sdk directory to find the file

580881
implements	extends
if you need random access to the values then implements an indexer may be a good idea but i don t see what benefit this would give you without more context on the question
have a read of the liskov substitution principle your collection is a very poor candidate to extends list it is not even a great candidate to implement ilist

581386
sorting	grouping
however the modelmaker website contains a page that shows the most up to date sorting functionality and it appears they extended the sort functionality with many new options
maybe you can grouping your getter setter methods with their latest mmx tool. handy functionality drag and drop sorting in the mmx class explorer you drag the method to the new location and modelmaker moves the code sorting hints mmx will inform you if a method is not sorted according to your default sorting template question 2 i want the implementation section to be in the same order as the interface

581896
freebsd	centos	freebsd	opensolaris	centos	linux
it may not be a bad first step to deploy into a lx branded zone think freebsd jails or linux vserver for a comparison as the lx branded zones can run linux binaries and are explicitly centos rhel based
other than that opensolaris is a xen dom0 since b77 or something and putting centos rhel into a domu is dead simple if that s an option

582076
submit	submission
you should allow users to save their work then submit the data to the rules engine when it is valid
the quality of your warning will not prevent users from submission invalid data

582314
subclass	superclass
you can end up calling a subclass implementation before the subclass has been initialized if you need helper methods be sure to make them private or final be explicit in your calls to super you would be surprised at how many java programmers don t realize that super is called even if you don t explicitly write it assuming you don t have a call to this ... know the order of initialization rules for constructors
it s basically this ... if present just move to another constructor call super ... if not explicit call super implicitly construct superclass using these rules recursively initialize fields via their declarations run body of current constructor return to previous constructors if you had encountered this ... calls the overall flow ends up being move all the way up the superclass hierarchy to object while not done init fields run constructor bodies drop down to subclass for a nice example of evil try figuring out what the following will print then run it i ll add comments describing why the above works as it does.

582585
portrait	landscape
when users are on devices with hardware keyboards or game pads a la the droid 1-4 xperia play or the nvidia shield forcing portrait can make your app a giant usability hassle especially on the shield
if your app doesn t have an extremely specific use case that would lead to an outright negative experience for supporting other orientations you should probably not force landscape

582585
portrait	landscape
this forces landscape on most tablets and portrait on most phones but i still wouldn t recommend this for most normal apps some users just like to type in the landscape softkeyboard on their phones and many tablet users read in portrait - and you should let them
if you still need to force portrait for some reason sensorportrait may be better than portrait for android 2.3+

582823
google-chrome	safari
for some reason safari runs a combo of border-radius with box-shadow just fine but google-chrome doesn t render the combination correctly
so it would be nice to find a way to detect google-chrome even though it is webkit to disable the combination

583239
sudo	passwd	passwd	visudo
or you can configure sudo to not need a passwd for etc init.d postfix
sudo configuration via visudo allows nopasswd to allow the command without a passwd

584796
tapestry	struts
i ve used both and i would strongly recommend that you try to keep tapestry from having to deal with struts urls
with struts you can pretty much hand-code the url so it shouldn t be a problem to link to tapestry pages but if you want tapestry to link back to struts urls you may have trouble using it the standard way

584822
goto	break
that is they must all end with either a break statement or an explicit goto
that means that while this code is legal that this code would not be legal in order to create a fall through from case 1 to case 2 it s necessary to insert a goto like this this is arguably something that would violate the expectations of c++ programmers who are leaning c#

585102
mockups	balsamiq
the resulting gui mockups look like sketches making it a great tool for communicating the idea that this is not the final gui but merely a visualization of gui concepts
i d still recommend balsamiq mockups

585786
int	chars
so if static inline unsigned int foo const chars bar
does not improve things over static int foo its time to revisit your optimizations and likely loops or argue with your compiler

586490
pipe	freopen
you might want to be sure to set up a handler for sigpipe in case your program finds itself on the blocking end of a pipe not fifo pipe
so . your_program --stdout tmp stdout.txt --stderr tmp stderr.txt should be easily accomplished with freopen and keeping the same actual file descriptors

586620
children	parent
so if the composite s size does not change but the relative positions and sizes of the children need to be updated you call layout on the composite
if however the size or position of the composite itself needs to be updated you will have to call layout on its parent composite and so on until you reach the shell

586867
inherited	properties
as you noted usercontrol doesn t inherited from page which is where the preload event lives
usercontrol does however contain a page object as one of its properties which in turn exposes preload as an event to which you can assign a handler

586988
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
on the other hand if the options themselves differ by only a few words and lose meaning if they are truncated a list of options like peanut butter and grape jelly sandwich with carrot sticks and soy milk and peanut butter and boysenberry jelly sandwith with carrot sticks and 2 milk maybe you would be better served by displaying all the options sequentially accompanied by a checkbox or radio button as appropriate
if you re using asp.net basically i m saying using a repeater instead of a dropdownlistfor this second approach might also allow you to incorporate other elements that you wouldn t be able to in a dropdown

587627
httpresponse	request
as for ruby style you could move the headers inline like so also note that in ruby 1.8+ what you are almost certainly running net http#get2 returns a single httpresponse object not a resp data pair
if you have access to the server logs try comparing the request from the browser with the one from ruby and see if that tells you anything

587718
getter	setter
this allows much more centralized handling of exceptional conditions than the getter setter example i gave above
i don t believe that that is what is meant when people talk about getters and setter because this is not simply setting a member to the given value

587914
xslt	xquery
and the xslt version from .net is 1.0 as well not 2.0 yet
fn lower-case is defined in xquery 1.0 and xpath 2.0

588060
imperative	declarative
t-sql is not designed to be an imperative language
its designed to be declarative

588139
int	chars
an int is 4 bytes wide - so any chars value larger than 4 bytes requires more disk i o cache space etc
obviously a chars 5 wouldn t affect much but a chars 4000 would be extraordinarily wasteful

588253
apache	lighttpd
as has been said assuming prefork apache - maxclients max processes at once
if you find you are getting hammered with real traffic and not a mis-configured startservers min maxspareservers there are some other things you can do set up a separate lightweight apache process or lighttpd for your static content

588648
conio	ncurses
leaning on conio won t get you cross platform as that is a dos windows specific api
edit apparently the ncurses library itself is not easily built on mingw at least as observed from a quick attempt to google it up

588729
typedef	struct
you have to use the structure name as in the following test program although it s probably a lot more complicated than this in the standard you can think of it as the compiler knowing about struct cell on the first line of the typedef but not knowing about tcell until the last line - that s how i remember that rule
in c you cannot reference the typedef that you re creating withing the structure itself

588874
clang	llvm
you can find the llvm clang static analyzer here llvm clang static analyzer
it s not a 100 solution but the llvm clang static analyzer can be a big help in tracking down incorrect manual memory management usage

588922
accessor	properties
by default properties accessor are atomic
atomic accessor in a non garbage collected environment when using retain release autorelease will use a lock to ensure that another thread doesn t interfere with the correct setting getting of the value

589326
hid	keyboard
here s some example code for it straight from my app to give you the gist granted you ll need a barcode scanner that supports the usb hid pos and isn t just a keyboard wedge
if your scanner is just a keyboard wedge i recommend picking up something like a used honeywell 4600g off ebay for like 25

589618
filtering	grouping
for my purposes i predict that most nodes are visible to most users so i feel that it is acceptable to simply to make the grouping by use the index as the filtering doesn t need it so badly
in other words the approach i ll take for my original query may be something like grouping by can use an index if it starts at the left most column of the index and it is in the first non-const non-system table to be processed

589684
range	minimum
for example this is how you will find maximum range for int c c++
the c++ standard does not specify the size of integral types in bytes but it specifies minimum ranges they must be able to hold

589684
range	minimum
the c++ standard does not specify the size of integral types in bytes but it specifies minimum range they must be able to hold
you can infer minimum size in bits from the required range

589684
range	minimum
minimum range required by the standard page 22 are and data type range on msdn signed char -127 to 127 note not -128 to 127
this accommodates 1 s-complement and sign-and-magnitude platforms unsigned char 0 to 255 plain char same range as signed char or unsigned char implementation-defined signed short -32767 to 32767 unsigned short 0 to 65535 signed int -32767 to 32767 unsigned int 0 to 65535 signed long -2147483647 to 2147483647 unsigned long 0 to 4294967295 signed long long -9223372036854775807 to 9223372036854775807 unsigned long long 0 to 18446744073709551615 a c++ or c implementation can define the size of a type in bytes sizeof type to any value as long as the expression evaluates to a number of bits high enough to contain required range and the ordering of type is still valid

590267
post	get
you can do this remember that javascript post always send data in utf-8 format so be sure you re expecting that on the backend if you plan to send text with international characters
it s not necessary to iterate over each field to get the form values

590309
firefox	safari
ie and firefox fire the onmouseover event just fine
i m doing something similar dragging from the parent doc to drop targets in the iframe and can see the onmouseover events fire for the targets in ie and firefox but not safari

590692
winpcap	wireshark	libpcap	wireshark
option to use raw sockets is via jni and there are few libraries that can help for example jnetpcap - wrapper around the native libpcap winpcap libraries exposing all of their functions and structures rocksaw - api for using raw sockets
if you are up to some coding and not just running the wireshark tcpdump then you have few choices

590698
serializable	deserialization
well the serializable shouldn t be a problem the xmlserializer constructor takes a type argument even calling gettype on an instance of a derived class through a method on the abstract base will return the derived types actual type
so in essence as long as you know the proper type upon deserialization then the serializable of the proper type is trivial

590769
superclass	subclassing
as the javadocs for abstractsinglespringcontexttests one of the superclass of abstracttransactionalspringcontexttests state this class will cache contexts based on a context key normally the config locations string array describing the spring resource descriptors making up the context
unless the setdirty method is called by a test the context will not be reloaded even across different subclassing of this test

590867
versioning	upgrade
as long as you customize through plugins or themes and use auto update when a new versioning is available you shouldn t have any problem at all
the last versions of wordpress 2.7 branch have auto update for core and plugins making it really easy to upgrade when a fix is available

591265
exponent	addition
then you need to shift the mantissa to the left and decrement the exponent by as much as it takes to get 0.1e-4
if your addition code is correct and your subtraction isn t the problem is presumably in the two s complement and addition

591334
for-loop	loops
let s take a generic for-loop in pseudo-code for the sake of demonstration loops is composed of four parts initialization which initialize the context usually variables
test which is a boolean expression that checks wheter or not loops is finished

591900
codeigniter	cakephp
i ve been using codeigniter myself after using cakephp for some time
the main reason for switching was due to performance but cakephp has come a long way in the last few years so that s probably not a valid reason anymore

591900
cakephp	qcodo
the main reason for switching was due to performance but cakephp has come a long way in the last few years so that s probably not a valid reason anymore
edit apparently it still has performance shortcomings see post by ryeguy and comments. i ve never found zend to be intuitive and have never looked into qcodo

591937
children	parent
single view containers create all their children in one go and you shouldn t face this problem
from flex 3.0 docs i could retrieve this the default creation policy for all containers except the application container is the policy of the parent container

592292
emacs	aquamacs
a very good emacs for mac os x is aquamacs
there is not much emacs support in mac os x and xcode

592346
installation	upgrade
xcode 3.0-3.1 templates can be found in dev installation library xcode likely developer library xcode
if you want to modify these templates or add your own use the following directories to save your new modified templates so that they are not wiped out by future developer tool upgrade file templates library developer shared xcode file templates target templates library developer shared xcode target templates project templates library developer shared xcode project templates i think that you can also use the library developer shared xcode file|target|project templates directory for templates shared by all users

592562
submit	submission
i solved this with another way using a button rather than a submit and using javascript to check the value before submission
i realise there still needs to be server-side validation for the file but this is only to prevent a user clicking on the submit button and not seeing anything happening

592780
ati	nvidia
this issue was not seen on any ati cards where development occurs
just to add what we did to fix this issue we upgraded to the latest nvidia drivers solved the problem

593989
getter	setter
if we had setter for name and surname but only a getter for fullname the test could look like this
how do i unit test a property that just has a getter like name in the example really not so different from testing if you had a setter

594027
int	chars	fgetc	isspace
but to make this more robust i would save the value of fgetc stdin to an int variable then test it to make sure it s a blank using isspace reporting an error if not
use an int not a chars because fgetc returns eof at end of file which cannot fit inside a chars

594436
int	double
the second is that trackbar.value is an int value and dividing an int by an int results in an int no matter what type of variable you assign it to
in this case there is an implicit cast from int to decimal or double - because there is no loss of precision when you do the cast - so the compiler doesn t complain but the value you get is always 0 presumably since trackbar.value is always less than 5000

594436
int	double
in this case there is an implicit cast from int to decimal or double - because there is no loss of precision when you do the cast - so the compiler doesn t complain but the value you get is always 0 presumably since trackbar.value is always less than 5000
the solution is to change your code to use double the native type for opacity and do floating point arithmetic by explicitly making the constant a double - which will have the effect of promoting the arithmetic - or casting trackbar.value to double which will do the same thing - or both

594444
put	get
also rather than saying click here now do this put them on the spot and ask them what would you do here
you can often get a useful insight into the usability of your application this way since the new person isn t tainted by all the history that you and your existing team has

594601
cout	cin
even the ones who design graphical interfaces may use cout for debugging
no such questions are not very relevant but yes people use std cin and std cout all the time

595476
getter	setter
the best practice for getter is to not allow them to throw exceptions at all
setter s are another matter

595623
coalesce	isnull
so if it s null then it equals itself and wont filter edit i like marc miller s coalesce example and you could use either and i really shouldn t comment on the performance of one verses the other but.
my gut tells me isnull should win out but have a look at some of the debates on this issue if you have nothing better to do or if performance is really critical in this query

595698
ready	each
if you can do your parsing and such in a separate thread and make the parsed data ready to present accessible to cellforrowatindexpath you shouldn t have any performance problems
you didn t say if you were using a custom uitableviewcell subclass but if you are deep view hierarchies can also present a performance problem since each view in the hierarchy gets drawn

595860
goto	break
the thought of not using break since it is just as evil as goto is pretty nonsensical
that s just a non-local and non-deterministic goto

595863
int	chars
it supports matching of not only strings of chars but also arrays and lists of int and arbitrary objects
there is absolutely nothing in the theory of regular expressions that prevents them from being applied to something else than just strings of chars

595930
unsigned	short
edit use unsigned short - not signed short .
well you could pack it all in an unsigned short that s 2 bytes 5 bits for day 5 bits for hour 6 bits for minute .

596154
allocator	stl
if users doesn t like the default allocator strategy they can specify one of their own now when the constructor allocates it will use a mycustomallocator instead of the default
here are some details on writing your own stl allocator

596828
superclass	subclassing
implementations using getclass do not allow comparison of sub- with superclass objects not even when the subclassing does not add any fields and would not even want to override equals
such a trivial class extension would for instance be the addition of a debug-print method in a subclassing defined for exactly this trivial purpose

596828
subclass	superclass
such a trivial class extension would for instance be the addition of a debug-print method in a subclass defined for exactly this trivial purpose
if the superclass prohibits mixed-type comparison via the getclass check then the trivial extension would not be comparable to its superclass

597036
qpushbutton	qobject
if you do this then you would need to include the header file for qpushbutton where mywidget is declared instead of in the implementation file
the example you gave also relies on the parent-relationship of qobject s to keep track of the memory for the button and delete it on destruction so it doesn t need to be specified as a member in the class

597316
stdout	fflush
the c stdout stream internally buffers data
it s likely that your this is child message is being buffered and the buffer isn t being fflush by execlp so it just disappears

597847
northwind	adventureworks
talk about sql server 2005 adventureworks is better than northwind
northwind is not the best database due to few new features of analysis and reporting service of sql server 2005

597847
northwind	adventureworks
northwind is not the best database due to few new features of analysis and reporting service of sql server 2005
msdn book on line bol uses the adventureworks in all of their example and it makes it easy to follow up if proper understanding of adventureworks schema is developed

598449
scons	autotools
but if you compare to make alone not autotools scons alone is superiour
i used scons for some time and found it had several problems

598723
multiplication	modulo
for integers to be a group under multiplication you have to be modulo a prime number
eg z mod 7 2 4 1 so 2 and 4 are each other s inverses for floating point values simple multiplication or addition saturates to + - infinity and there are no values which are the inverses of infinity so either the set is not closed or it lacks invertibility

598723
addition	modulo	multiplication	modulo
eg z mod 7 2 4 1 so 2 and 4 are each other s inverses for floating point values simple multiplication or addition saturates to + - infinity and there are no values which are the inverses of infinity so either the set is not closed or it lacks invertibility
if on the other hand you want something similar to integer multiplication modulo a power of 2 then multiplication will do - there are elements without an inverse so it s not a group but it is closed - you always get a floating point value back

598788
squash	merge	squash	fast-forward	squash	branch
and here the old commit the initial commit and the new commit result of the squash will have no common ancestor
that mean you can not commit --amend the initial commit into new one and then rebase onto the new initial commit the history of the previous initial commit lots of conflicts that last sentence is no longer true with rather with a the original initial commit and b a subsequent commit needed to be squashed into the initial one go back to the last commit that we want to form the initial commit detach head reset the branch pointer to the initial commit but leaving the index and working tree intact amend the initial tree using the tree from b git commit --amend temporarily tag this new initial commit or you could remember the new commit sha1 manually git tag tmp go back to the original branch assume master for this example git checkout master replay all the commits after b onto the new initial commit remove the temporary tag git tag -d tmp that way the rebase --onto does not introduce conflicts during the merge since it rebases history made after the last commit b to be squashed into the initial one which was a to tmp representing the squashed new initial commit trivial fast-forward merge only

599122
base	fractions
using decimal you will have fewer surprises than you will using the base 2 double type
double uses half as much memory as decimal and double will be much faster because of the cpu hardware for many common floating point operations but it cannot represent most base 10 fractions such as 1.05 accurately and has a less accurate 15+ decimal digits of precision

599181
for-loop	loops
rewriting to the above code to will only instantiate the stringbuilder once outside of loops and only make the two calls to the append method inside loops as evidenced in this bytecode which shows the instantiation of stringbuilder and loops so indeed the hand optimization should be better performing as the inside of the for-loop is shorter and there is no need to instantiate a stringbuilder on each iteration
basically using a loops to iterate over the arraylist is the only option do not use this code continue reading to the bottom of this answer to see why it is not desirable and which code should be used instead in fact a string concatenation is going to be just fine as the javac compiler will optimize the string concatenation as a series of append operations on a stringbuilder anyway

599181
for-loop	loops
here s a part of the disassembly of the bytecode from the for-loop from the above program as can be seen the compiler optimizes that loops by using a stringbuilder so performance shouldn t be a big concern
ok on second glance the stringbuilder is being instantiated on each iteration of loops so it may not be the most efficient bytecode

599235
haskell	sml
mutable data structures like arrays and real hash tables are used much less because they don t fit in as well with haskell
sml which is also functional but not lazy can use arrays more naturally than haskell but lists are still more common because they map well to recursive algorithms

599322
profiler	yourkit	yourkit	jprofiler
i ve not used netbeans profiler but tried jprofiler yourkit and jprobe
i found yourkit slightly better mainly bought by the usability aspect

600548
packets	pcap
if i remember correctly the dsniff tools use libnids to reassemble ip packets and tcp streams
packet or stream reassembly is not mentioned in pcap 3

601187
graphics2d	bufferedimage
the fact that you casted g to a graphics2d doesn t make a difference unless you actually store it in a variable of type graphics2d
you ve declared g2d as a graphics object and graphics doesn t have the drawimage bufferedimage bufferedimageop int int method

601301
polymorphism	specialization
basically c# just doesn t want you to work with specialization except for polymorphism here bar.foo will always resolve to the correct override
in c# the closest to specialization is to use a more-specific overload

601614
post	get
the only wrong thing to do is to not listen to what they are saying - or to listen and not really hear them see the post on here about ie on the mac - it s the height of arrogance
of course you are going to get some people who just don t like change and will whinge about anything but in general if a user will take the time to point out something in your software which bugs them then you should listen

601635
coalesce	nvl
the equivalent to the nvl command in hql is the coalesce command
coalesce a b will return a if a is not null otherwise b

601753
wxhaskell	gtk2hs
a consideration is that currently it is slightly easier to get wxhaskell to work natively on mac os x
gtk2hs depends on gtk which does have an implementation using native widgets on mac os x but that implementation is not as easily built as the wxwidgets implementation for mac os x is

601996
wxhaskell	gtk2hs
wxhaskell is probably a little easier to build if you are not on linux gtk2hs is likely easier if you are linux hosted but both are pretty complex to build to be honest as there are a significant number of dependencies in both cases
it is slightly easier imho to distribute applications based on wxhaskell simply because it has fewer library dependencies

603150
g++	gcc
if you only installed c compiler you would have command gcc but not command g++
g++ is c++ compiler not c compiler

603431
ant	maven
ant doesn t have a lifecycle
maven uses conventions

603506
ant	maven
the difference between a declarative build tool and a more traditional one like ant or make is you configure what needs to get done not how it gets done
for example you can say in a maven script that a project should be packaged as a war file and maven knows how to handle that

603616
gridview	rowdatabound
edit i guess one potential alternative to this would be to create a third column in your resultset that contains a cssclass name that you could declare based on the the likesburritos column and you could bind the cssclass to that in your gridview but this is going to require you to have access to the sql statement or to intercept your databinding process to modify the resultset coming down
use the rowdatabound event built into the gridview then you could do something like this in vb.net i m not quite sure what your implications are about not wanting to iterate through all the data but this rendering of the white or blue row is occurring at the same time as the data is written to the page so you re not losing any performance here

603783
arraylist	treeset
you have to either put all the values into a treeset with a comparator that uses the fileid or put them into an arraylist and sort them with collections.sort again with a comparator that compares the way you want
the treeset method doesn t work if there are any duplicates and it may be overkill since you re not going to be adding things to or removing things from the set

604041
cvs	svn
cvs
it is svn that determines whether a file is conflicted not tortoise

604166
inherited	properties
there is no difference with regard to the inherited and substitution rules
there are a few technicalities a abstract class cannot be instantiated abstract methods are only allowed in abstract classes but an abstract class can have non-abstract methods properties and fields

604265
folder	directory
check any files are listed under .svn prop-base directory remove any files which are not under the folder cleanup update now the update should work
svn normally updates its internal structure .svn prop-base of the files in a folder before the actual files is fetched from repository

604314
width	margin	margin	height
edit someone else suggested css and i believe that using the height and width directives from css will give you the same result as using the same attributes of the tag but doesn t limit you strictly to images and a will play nicer with any margin or padding directives you might use
if the problem is strictly with images i believe you can use the height and width attributes of the tag to tell the browser what size the images will be

604469
for-loop	loops
once you have finished your for-loop placing each item accordingly then use tweenlite or your favorite tweening package
it is important to note that screen updates do not happen within code blocks such as for and while loops

604528
installation	upgrade
a couple of final things that an installer tool should provide are ways to apply upgrade to an existing installation and a way to uninstall the program undoing all those installation tasks deleting files restoring backups unregistering com servers etc.
i think the theme to the answers you ll see here is that you should use an installation program and that you should not write the installer yourself

605547
int	double
it gives you the nearest int rounded towards -infinity
at least as long as your input is in the range representable by ints. i m not sure what you mean by adding .5 and whatnot but it won t have the same effect and std floor returns a double because that s the most general

prepare	execute
for more information see this document prepare by kenneth lundin ericsson ab for erlang user conference stockholm november 13 2008
answer depends on the vm which is used 1 non-smp there is one scheduler os thread which execute all erlang processes taken from the pool of runnable processes those who are not blocked by receive 2 smp there are k schedulers os threads k is usually a number of cpu cores which execute erlang processes from the shared process queue

605631
queue	fifo
answer depends on the vm which is used 1 non-smp there is one scheduler os thread which executes all erlang processes taken from the pool of runnable processes those who are not blocked by receive 2 smp there are k schedulers os threads k is usually a number of cpu cores which executes erlang processes from the shared process queue
it is a simple fifo queue with locks to allow simultaneous access from multiple os threads

606347
subclass	abstract-class
the only difference between virtual and abstract is that an abstract method or propery has no implementation in the class where it has been defined the abstract-class and that it must be overriden in a subclass
whereas a virtual method or property has an implementation in the class where it has been defined and so it is not mandatory to override it in a subclass

606476
actionscript	mxml
the mxml and even actionscript is not understood by the flash player
that being said there is a jsp library that you can use for dynamic mxml

607459
folder	dir
you can also set a backupdir if you still want those backup files but in a central folder
this way your working dir is not littered with files

608187
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
you set up the now loading in viewwillappear but you never see it since by the time viewdidappear completes it s done with the heavy work
i could be wrong but perhaps your problem is that by doing the time-consuming work in viewdidappear you re blocking the main event thread so that the view doesn t update until the work is complete

608207
base	fractions
the key is that excel stores numbers as base 2 floating point numbers
most decimal fractions cannot be represented as base 2 floating point numbers

608728
int	double
int int + double is essentially int double + double and you cannot do that without casting.
the int + double forces the result to an int while the other one requires casting

608848
qmainwindow	qdockwidget
you ll need to dig abit into qmainwindow code to see exactly how to do this and probably to inherit from qdockwidget which is something you usually are not supposed to do
this is probably not possible since qdockwidgets are heavily integrated with qmainwindow

609632
versioning	upgrade
the dialog that pop-up has a section for a minimum required versioning for this application which lets you enforce that a user upgrade to a specific versioning
once you ve set that users shouldn t be able to roll back to a previous versioning

609632
versioning	upgrade
once you ve set that users shouldn t be able to roll back to a previous versioning
they ll also be forced to upgrade if they re running a versioning older than the minimum

610090
hash	salt
to store passwords just using a simple hash function is not enough
you should add some random salt per user and iterate enough times so that it would be computationally expensive to brute force

610104
hash	salt	hash	md5
it also isn t guaranteed to return the same hash value on different versioning of the .net framework meaning that an upgrade could potentially produce a different hash for the same string rendering your passwords unusable to you
it is recommended that you use a salt hash or even md5 at a push

610260
memcpy	strncpy	strcpy	strncpy	strlen	strcpy
but for the example you give it doesn t matter - if it s going to fail it will be in the initial strlen so strncpy doesn t buy you anything in terms of safety and presumbly strncpy is slower as it has to both check bounds and for nul and any difference between memcpy and strcpy isn t worth changing code for speculatively
i d tend to use memcpy if i have already calculated the length although strcpy is usually optimised to work on machine words it feels that you should provide the library with as much information as you can so it can use the most optimal copying mechanism

610288
strcpy	strncpy
the reason why people use strncpy not strcpy is because strings are not always null terminated and it s very easy to overflow the buffer the space you have allocated for the string with strcpy and overwrite some unrelated bit of memory
with strcpy this can happen with strncpy this will never happen

610565
gif	png
if png isn t smaller than gif then your software may be saving it poorly - look for png optimisation progams like pngout and pngnq
for buttons icons logos use png

610597
gif	png
png should be used when you need transparency either 1-bit or alpha transparency lossless compression will work well such as for a chart or logo or computer generated image jpeg should be used when lossless compression will not work well such as a photograph gif should be when png is not available such as on very old software or browsers animation is necessary despite myths to the contrary png outperforms gif in most aspects
png is capable of every image mode of gif apart from animation and when using the same image mode png will have better compression due to its superior deflate algorithm compared to lzw

610597
gif	png
png is capable of every image mode of gif apart from animation and when using the same image mode png will have better compression due to its superior deflate algorithm compared to lzw
png is also capable of additional modes that gif cannot do such as 24 bit color and alpha transparency but this is where you need to be careful if you forget to convert to palette mode your png image may be saved in 24 bit color which will take more space

610597
gif	png
png is also capable of additional modes that gif cannot do such as 24 bit color and alpha transparency but this is where you need to be careful if you forget to convert to palette mode your png image may be saved in 24 bit color which will take more space
png modes include this is just a small subset palette colour of 2 to 256 colors like gif palette colour of 2 to 256 colors with transparent color like gif true color 24 bit color true color with alpha channel 24 bit color + 8 bit alpha transparency for best compression in png for the web use a palette mode

610769
gif	png
png should be used when you need transparency either 1-bit or alpha transparency lossless compression will work well such as for a chart or logo or computer generated image jpeg should be used when lossless compression will not work well such as a photograph full color is needed gif should be when png is not available such as on very old software or browsers animation is necessary despite myths to the contrary png outperforms gif in most aspects
png is capable of every image mode of gif apart from animation and when using the same image mode png will have better compression due to its superior deflate algorithm compared to lzw

610769
gif	png
png is capable of every image mode of gif apart from animation and when using the same image mode png will have better compression due to its superior deflate algorithm compared to lzw
png is also capable of additional modes that gif cannot do such as 24 bit color and alpha transparency but this is where you may run into problems on the web

610769
gif	png
if you find that your png files with transparency aren t working properly in ie6 while your gif files are then you are using 24 bit color + alpha transparency in png and palette mode with a transparent color with gif
you will have to make sure that you convert your png into a paletted color mode with a transparent color

611158
portrait	landscape
anyway i found portrait mode not really better when coding and only with my old 17 widescreen in portrait mode was viewing editing documents better
with two large screens in landscape mode you can put two pages on a screen when viewing documents and have many tool windows open at both sides of the ide s text editor

611821
division	subtract
to do division shift the divisor until it s not quite bigger than the dividend
subtract shifted divisor from dividend and increment the result with appropriate shift

612035
post	get
typically query strings are used to sort or filter a get request like but i suppose it makes sense on a post to also limit the scope perhaps like
if your action is not idempotent then you must use post

612285
serializable	deserialization
it will work if nothing else happens to the element but if requested to serializable the name is not serializable
so when i said that forced a serialization which lost the name so it was not recovered upon deserialization

612476
typedef	struct
in this ddj article dan saks explains one small area where bugs can creep through if you do not typedef your struct and classes
if you want you can imagine that c++ generates a typedef for every tag name such as typedef class string string

612668
super	self
incidentally unless you are planning on some in-depth multiple inheritance work and again now may not be the time for that you probably don t even need to use super
the usual iplugin.__init__ self ... method of calling a known superclass is the straightforward thing to do

613148
collabnet	svn
it doesn t require a bunch of registration information like the collabnet one does
i use slik svn

613186
post	put	post	get	put	get
in a nutshell get should be read only have no effect on server state. post is used to create a resource on the server. put is used to update or create a resource. delete is used to delete a resource
in other words if your api action changes the server state rest advises us to use post put delete but not get

613186
post	put	post	get
in other words if your api action changes the server state rest advises us to use post put delete but not get
user agents usually understand that doing multiple posts is bad and will warn against it because the intent of post is to alter server state eg

614028
for-loop	loops
continue does not skip the incrementing part of the for-loop
all it does is go directly to it skipping the rest of the body of loops

614255
inherited	properties
all js object s so not strings numbers true false undefined or null inherited from a base object type -- the exact implementation varies it could be c++ inherited or manually in c there are benefits to doing it in either way -- the base object type defines the default properties access methods eg
this object type handles all the standard properties access logic the prototype chain etc. then the array implementation becomes now when you create an array in js the engine creates something akin to the above data structure

614255
put	get
if it is not then the put method is forwarded to the base object implementation and the standard put logic is done
otherwise the value is placed into the array s own storage if the data is sufficiently compact then the engine will use the flat array storage in which case insertion and retrieval is just a standard array indexing operation otherwise the engine will convert the array to sparse storage and put get use a map to get from propertyname to value location

614483
int	chars
create table binary id int unsigned auto_increment primary key password binary 20 not null
create table chars id int unsigned auto_increment primary key password chars 40 not null

614732
tostring	referenceequals
the call to tostring returns an object of string class which has overloaded operator which does string comparison
the operator if not overloaded is identical to referenceequals -- that is it determines whether two given object s are the same instances

614983
public	protected
public - if you can see the class then you can see the method private - if you are part of the class then you can see the method otherwise not
protected - same as private plus all descendants can also see the method

615426
put	get
btw we ve put this call on our apps wcf rest interface so it s easy to do
just to save anyone else the bother here s the port of the above to c# i ve not found a way to get a list of all managed threads in c# only processthreads so it does look like you need to maintain the list of threads your interested in yourself

616660
put	get
a little investigation will probably allow you to discover any relevant formatting if you re not already aware of it and should put you well on your way to constructing a useful hash
if the hash functions don t get you all the way or they require input of some sort to define a metric distance then there are several binary delta algorithms and implementations available on the web

616941
qsort	strcmp	bsearch	strcmp
the standard function pointer expected by qsort or bsearch has the prototype the qsort1 defined in the code expects the comparator functions defined in the code do not have that prototype and there is no automatic conversion between different function pointer types
so fixes for qsort1 are either introduce a cast or rewrite the comparators obviously the call to qsort1 would reference str_cmp instead of strcmp

617234
delphi	oxygene
unfortunately it isn t backwardly compatible with delphi code
rem objects the actual owners of the prism compiler formerly known as oxygene has made available a utility application that attempts to convert the syntax differences automatically but i haven t tried it on anything yet

617385
versioning	upgrade
in addition to making sure the file versioning are different as stingyjack mentioned you have another problem
from the vs documentation sorry not online if you have set both install and uninstall custom actions in an application s setup project and you have enabled the removepreviousversions property in visual studio 2005 the previous version of the product is uninstalled during an upgrade

617385
uninstall	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
from the vs documentation sorry not online if you have set both install and uninstall custom actions in an application s setup project and you have enabled the removepreviousversions property in visual studio 2005 the previous versioning of the product is uninstalled during an upgrade
however this behavior changed in visual studio 2008 as follows in visual studio 2005 the custom actions were called as follows on an upgrade from v1.0.0 to v1.0.1 v1.0.0 custom action uninstall v1.0.1 custom action install in visual studio 2008 the uninstall action is not called as follows v1.0.1 custom action install if you created custom actions relying on the old behavior you need to modify your code for the new behavior. this behavior change affects only updates not uninstalls

617385
uninstall	upgrade
however this behavior changed in visual studio 2008 as follows in visual studio 2005 the custom actions were called as follows on an upgrade from v1.0.0 to v1.0.1 v1.0.0 custom action uninstall v1.0.1 custom action install in visual studio 2008 the uninstall action is not called as follows v1.0.1 custom action install if you created custom actions relying on the old behavior you need to modify your code for the new behavior. this behavior change affects only updates not uninstalls
so you are installing a service using a custom action - but when upgrading the uninstall part is not being called as you expect and you are trying to install over an existing running version

617482
prng	random
if instead of simple sequential scan you use some function i just have to follow the function which if it is difficult enough to follow it turns into a prng in it s own right
if you are not concerned about the cryptographic strength of your generator then there are much more compact ways of generating random numbers

617578
versioning	upgrade
if you re developing backwards or not worrying what the versioning is then you might want to use the older functions
you upgrade your ide and also upgrade your microsoft libraries

617895
uiview	subviews
to do this a scrollview has a few extra properties over a normal uiview - but it is like a uiview in one imprtant respect it doesn t render any content directly itself
you need to add a subviews to draw your text

618034
dependencyobject	freezable
dependencyobject could and should have been a very clean ubiquitous reusable class. instead it is structurally and behaviourly bound to it s inheritors and even contains specific constants fields methods and work-arounds to help freezable co-exist with the rest of the sub-classes which not only strays far from good oo design but also makes an otherwise superb class utterly unusable outside of the wpf framework
after much research and muddling through the source code for dependencyobject here s the short answer the inheritencecontext the property which reveals the logical parent of an instance is like 90 of the useful implementation of dependencyobject marked as internal and thus kept hidden from all code outside of windowsbase.dll it is possible to use reflection to set the _contextparent field as well as to call this hidden methods to set the inheritencecontext but at the end of the day its not a clean solution

618524
ant	maven	put	get
if you however put enough effort in your poms and few custom plugins you ll get a much better build environment as with ant for example depends on you project of course but it gets more and more true for bigger projects
well maven is not supposed to be good in doing fine granular tasks it is not a scripting language like bash or ant it is rather declarative - you say - i need a war or an ear and you get it

618563
monodevelop	sharpdevelop
the answer to my question then is no monodevelop on windows is not ready for normal use
i guess i ll make do with visual studio and sharpdevelop on windows and wait patiently or maybe even have a look at the outstanding bugs..

618971
width	margin
try if this fits you you would change the .box widht to 100 n -1. i don t exactly know why the -1 but it probably has something to do with the margin and border not being counted towards width and the fact that a single pixel can t be devided into subpixels
--edit-- reviewed code after comments. comment decomment box width line for self-fitting fixed number of boxes per line

619483
bash	subshell
try or even removing the previous line edit - testing this properly it works fine in ksh but not in bash for some reason
i think it might be something to do with subshell

619572
ienumerable	ienumerator
ienumerable has just one method whereas ienumerator has 2 methods movenext and reset and a property current
for easy understanding consider ienumebale a box that contains ienumerator inside it though not through inheritance or containment

619848
folder	directory
this fixed the issue - i was able to see the .htaccess files - but i also saw my .svn folder as well as additional meta files
i checked the box saying name filter patterns and put in the following string .cache .settings .svn .project .projectoptions as detailed in xcc for plugins which do not offer a name filter pattern through gui one can locate the directory of the eclipse plugin being used for editing

620348
int	double
i i + d does not work because you would be assigning a double to an int and that is not allowed
the + operator casts the double automatically to an int so that is why it works

620434
cpu	processors
to expand a little on what oscar reyes said data transport is actually a crucial factor in performance even at lowest levels so that not just the number but the types of operations being performed by the cpu are crucial to overall performance
this is particularly true of cisc processors like x86 where instructions themselves may have varying cycle counts although modern designs mostly mitigate this

620500
gitolite	gitosis
the installation process i recommand is one done from a client post in order to copy the full installation of gitolite on the server from-client method install from the client to the server remember gitolite manages authorization not authentication ssh it can be used without ssh but its natural deployment is through ssh and the forced command mechanism
like gitosis was but with many more features old references for gitosis here is a step-by-step tutorial

620670
swt	nebula
to improve the thing you will have to add a listener on swt.traverse to both tables which syncs them if the user navigated using keys something like this i wouldn t go with another table implementation since you lose the biggest advantage you have with swt using a native widget which looks and feels right in each os
if you want to do that anyway grid from the nebula project is much more mature than the alpha tag implies

620816
post	get	put	get
there are several http commands get post put delete head connect trace the only ones that will do what you want according to the specification are put and post
you shouldn t use get to send data back to the server for storage

620999
for-loop	loops
there are workarounds as discussed here but honestly if you need to guarantee the order then just use a regular old for-loop and have it iterate length numchildren etc. number of times
as stated in essential actionscript 3.0 by colin moock the order of a for each in loops is not guaranteed unless enumerating an xml or xmllist object

621617
int	chars
the reason why it may not be a machine word is that there are no elements within it that actually require it to be aligned on a word boundary such as an int
for example if you place chars x

621658
put	get
use random characters something like in the choice put all the acceptable characters
while using a real hash function such as sha1 will also get you nice results if used correctly the added complexity and cpu consumption seems not justified for your needs

621891
innodb	myisam
innodb does
you ll find people who are using myisam or those that are using innodb but aren t using it anyway

621905
post	put
after that build the not-so-important pages in case of a blog that could be an archive of post
if you have that done put the code together with a design or do that while coding if you do not seperate code from html css js

622496
ant	maven
ant did not help with these problems this was before ivy which i haven t used
by using maven and deploying jars we are managing to reduce the dependencies and get many fewer problems

622949
hash	md5
you can try to create your own hash it would probably not be as good as md5 and security through obscurity is likewise not advisable
if you want security hash with multiple hash algorithms

622949
hash	whirlpool
being able to simultaneously create files that have hash collisions using a number of algorithms is excessively improbable
and in the light of comments let me make it clear i mean publish both the sha-256 and the whirlpool values for the file not combining hash algorithms to create a single value but using separate algorithms to create separate values

623228
typedef	typename
i can think of typedef typename in ancestor types aren t inherited by template classes
the need to sprinkle typename and template keywords in appropriate places

623610
pop-up	dialog
once the user clicks ok the first dialog is dismissed you check the result in your application and if the expected file doesn t exist pop-up an error dialog informing them that the chosen directory was not correct
you could give them the option of retrying which would just pop-up the first dialog again

623614
disk	ram
the counters you should look at that are more meaningful in telling you if adding ram to the server will help are sql server instance buffer manager- page life expectancy in seconds a value below 300-400 seconds will mean that pages are not in memory very long and data continually is being read in from disk
servers that have a low page life expectancy will benefit from additional ram

623631
getter	setter
it seems fairly straight forward that the add instance method is not a getter nor a setter
by accessors i tend to think of getters and setter

625559
hash	salt	hash	md5
md5 has shown to be vulnerable to hash collision but i believe sha-1 has not so far
adding salt to your hash function doesn t really serve any purpose if the digest function has been compromised because the salt will have to be made public to be used and the attacker can adjust their file to factor this in too

625559
hash	salt
adding salt to your hash function doesn t really serve any purpose if the digest function has been compromised because the salt will have to be made public to be used and the attacker can adjust their file to factor this in too
the solution to this problem is to use a secure hash function

625585
hash	salt	hash	md5	salt	md5
salt are used for password verification - they prevent an attacker performing an offline attack against the password database - each user s password has a salt attached to the plain-text before the hashing - then a pre-computed rainbow table of plaintext - hash text is useless
the attack against crc-32 is irrelevant if the hash you are using is not crc-32 - md5 and sha-1 are not vulnerable to that kind of attack yet

625585
hash	md5
the attack against crc-32 is irrelevant if the hash you are using is not crc-32 - md5 and sha-1 are not vulnerable to that kind of attack yet
the current attacks against md5 are where an attacker creates two documents with the same hash

626083
post	put
this is either the entity referred to by the request-uri or by the location or content-location headers if present . these methods are - put - delete - post it s not clear to me how these specifications can allow meaningful caching
the corresponding rfc 2616 in section 9.5 post allows the caching of the response to a post message if you use the appropriate headers

626101
post	get
while like others point out you could cache the results of a post it wouldn t make semantic sense because a post by definition is changing data
if it s something that doesn t actually change data on your site it should be a get request

626135
post	get
other than get method s semantics the post method itself is semantically meant to post something to a resource
post cannot be cached because if you do something once vs twice vs three times then you are altering the server s resource each time

626443
uilabel	uibutton
as to brent s idea of putting the title uilabel as sibling view it doesn t seem to me like a very good idea
i keep thinking in interaction problems with the uilabel due to its touch events not getting through the uibutton s view

626443
uilabel	uibutton
i keep thinking in interaction problems with the uilabel due to its touch events not getting through the uibutton s view
on the other hand with a uilabel as subview of the uibutton i m pretty confortable knowing that the touch events will always be propagated to the uilabel s superview

626686
system.configuration	system.web
add a reference to system.configuration and try something like
you need to add a reference to system.web then the goes would go something like if you want to access a configuration section that does not have a public interface like system.diagnostics then you can use the generic configuration classes

626952
punctuation	words
if say you want this ...string changed to this ...string you want words capitalized even if there is punctuation before them try something more like this same thing but it split s on words w+ so that the captured elements of the list are word-only
same overall effect but will capitalize words that may not start with a words character

627228
free	malloc
variables on the heap are not automatically free
malloc create variables on the heap

627262
free	malloc
when the function returns the stack does not need to be cleaned up free or otherwise processed because it was just a temporary space anyway and now goes out of scope
in contrast calling malloc allocates memory from the heap which explicitly sets aside memory for the program and remains in scope for as long as the program is running

627266
versioning	upgrade
imagine you have an application that needs versioning 1 of libfoo but another application requires versioning 2
if you install everything into usr lib python2.4 site-packages or whatever your platform s standard location is it s easy to end up in a situation where you unintentionally upgrade an application that shouldn t be upgrade

627576
free	malloc
and this is done by using the standard functions malloc or derivatives and free
strictly speaking you do not have to call free

627576
free	malloc
an implementation in c might look like where at the the computer would decide that the last reference temp to the allocated object was lost and that it would be a good idea to free it
it is a trade-off where you don t have to worry about free ing objects which is not a minor thing as simple examples might make you think but where gc_malloc here is more complex than a simple malloc and there s invisible code executing at that where temp goes out of scope

627922
freebsd	linux
executable files with this bit set will run with effective uid set to the uid of the file owner. directories with this bit set will force all files and sub- directories created in them to be owned by the directory owner and not by the uid of the creating process if the underlying file system supports this feature see chmod 2 and the suiddir option to mount 8 . please be aware that this is a security risk and know what you are doing when you enable it in freebsd but i believe linux as well it requires special mount flag to be enabled and will change the way files in that directory behave
as a followup on node s answer i will post the following from the freebsd man page for mount 8 suiddir a directory on the mounted file system will respond to the suid bit being set by setting the owner of any new files to be the same as the owner of the directory

628746
post	get
what you describe is the ultimate battle to get more information of the httpfileupload in html 2.0 specs as that the is html spec you are referencing for a form post
unfortunately httpfileupload does not allow you to get this - not even in javascript

629185
hex	binary
uxxxx where xxxx is the hex unicode value is most appropriate
generally this is the easiest way you could do another binary encoding not sure if base64 includes reserved characters.

630084
tostring	getter
since entity classes has to satisfy the java bean specification there shouldn t be any more public methods except hashcode tostring .
getter and setters are called when hibernate creates the entitites and fills in the data from the database

630475
post	put
you can update or create a resource with put with the same object url with post you can have 2 requests coming in at the same time making modifications to a url and they may update different parts of the object
an example i wrote the following as part of another answer on so regarding this post used to modify and update a resource note that the following is an error if the url is not yet created you should not be using post to create it while specifying the name

630475
post	put
you could though do something like this to create a resources using post post questions http 1.1 host www.example.com note that in this case the resource name is not specified the new objects url path would be returned to you
put used to create a resource or overwrite it

630510
versioning	upgrade
if a user has auto updates set to on for java or if he she decides to upgrade to a higher versioning that will break my other application that only works with java 1.6u11
by embedding the jre files folder structure with the installation of my application and pointing the ini files to execute the application using that versioning of java i ll make sure that versioning is the one used by the application and not the one defined in java_home whichever that is higher or lower than 1.6u11

631115
maven	pom.xml
maven has some non-written implicit assumptions like - always inherit submodules from the pom.xml in the parent directory the inheritance tree must match your directory tree otherwise some plugins won t work release plugin or some report plugins
the short answer is - in maven you cannot have a module twice in your project hierarchy tree

631690
children	parent
if you want to catch an asynchronous signal like sigchld when some children terminate but not others you can t decide to ignore it for some in advance
you will need to handle the signal every time in the parent then decide whether you want to ignore it in your handler

631975
folder	directory
i think the default is to put the actual dlls in folder in the solution directory not the project directory i think the assumption is that you want all the dlls that you build for a solution to go to the same place
i d look up a little higher in the directory structure the one that the solution is in and see if your debug release folder with the dll are there

633235
post	get
so take two minutes and create a picture library to post wiki pictures in
remember the main goals for a wiki - not to compete with other wiki tools but to get ideas written down quickly and without stopping to structure them

633329
cvs	svn
it cannot because cvs doesn t record such information. so after the conversion you will have to explicitly tell subversion about merges that were done under cvs
the easiest way to do that is by using svn merge --record-only .

633651
initializer	class-method
so here s what abap objects offers you over procedural abap better encapsulation support for multiple initializer better techniques for reusing code better interfaces an explicit event concept there are only two purposes for which procedural abap is found essential encapsulation of classic screens in function modules
when you want to make functions available to other systems but are not able to make class-method available externally using xi server proxies

634976
jar	war
you could use an overlay although that requires that the sibling be of type war rather than jar
there s also using the dependency plugin to unpack the jar but it will only unpack the version in your local repository not the one you just packaged

635198
floor	exp
not sure but the identity n m exp10 m log10 n exp q m log n q where q log 10 comes to mind along with the fact that the first k digits of exp10 x the first k digits of exp10 frac x where frac x the fractional part of x x - floor x
to be more explicit the first k digits of n m are the first k digits of its mantissa exp frac m log n q q where q log 10

635747
int	chars
also concepts like numbers abstracting over int half a dozen kinds of floats rationals etc. imagine what a nightmare this would be if higher level code was given the mantissa format and so forth and left to fend for itself
the nix abstraction of chars streams disk files pipes sockets ttys etc. into a single entity the everything is a file model allows a wide range of tools to be applied to a wide range of data sources sinks in a way that simply would not be possible without the encapsulation

637051
button	checkbox
there are a few cases where there s no action for a user take and thus the compatibility view button will not show if you re viewing an internal-to-internet explorer page such as about inprivate if you re viewing a page that has declared it s ready for internet explorer 8 through use of the versioning tag http header it doesn t matter if this tag triggers quirks ie7 standards or ie8 standards the button won t be displayed if you re viewing an intranet page and you have the display intranet sites in compatibility view checkbox selected if you re viewing any webpage and you have the display all websites in compatibility view checkbox selected if you re viewing a webpage that is included on the microsoft-supplied compatibility view updates list and you have the include updated website lists from microsoft checkbox selected if you ve toggled either the document mode or browser mode settings via the developer toolbar so you re probably after the versioning tag http header which is described in more details in that blog post and over here
from here sometimes the compatibility view button isn t displayed

637520
range	max	range	minimum
friday is in range if start is wednesday and end is monday it may take a second to see which probably isn t good because readability is usually the most important but i think it does work
here s the basic trick legend 0 minimum time m maximum time s start time 1 2 3 input time test points e end time the s e not in range 2 in range 3 e not in range the s e case 0 m original -1--e----2---s--3-- add max -------------------1--e----2---s--3-- subtract startdate ------1--e----2---s--3-- max s--3--1--e----2---- 1 in range 2 e not in range 3 in range if you really want to go nuts and be even more difficult to decipher which ought to be slightly faster trading modulus for a bitwise and which we can do since the value of max doesn t really matter as long as it exceeds the maximum well-formed value and we re free to choose one that makes our computations easy

638050
range	median
or if they re continuous values you could distribute them into bins - that wouldn t tell you the exact median but it would give you a range and if you need to know more precisely you could iterate over the list again examining only the elements in the central bin
if the values are discrete and the number of distinct values isn t too high you could just accumulate the number of times each value occurs in a histogram then find the median from the histogram counts just add up counts from the top and bottom of the histogram until you reach the middle

638126
profiler	vtune
the rational purifyplus suite includes both a well-proven leak detector and pretty good profiler
i m not sure if it does go down to the level of cache misses though - you might need vtune for that

638446
udp	tcp
especially since you can give tcp the same sort of latency as udp by disabling the nagle algorithm for example if you re transmitting real-time sensor data and you re not worried about congesting the network with lot s of small packets
in some applications tcp is faster better throughput than udp

638568
post	get
sorry i can t be of anymore help if i had the code handy i d post it here
i encountered this in the past feel like a previous life to be honest and couldn t get by it either

638640
implements	extends
you should only be using extension methods if you cannot add the method in the original source and cannot extends the class with a sub-class if it is declared sealed the page on extension methods states in general we recommend that you implements extension methods sparingly and only when you have to
whenever possible client code that must extends an existing type should do so by creating a new type derived from the existing type

638936
ssl	https
with ssl you would get a warning error that the site does not have a valid certificate which would alert you that all is not as it should be
personally i tailor my passwords to whether or not information travels over https

639027
folder	directory
this problem can occur if one or more of the dlls in the asp.net temporary files folder are corrupted
sometimes asp.net does not refresh files here if there are no changes in the dll residing in the virtual directory

639452
ubuntu	debian
the problem you will face as an ubuntu user is that there s always been a slight tension between debian packagers users and the main exim user base because debian chose to heavily customize their configuration
their reasons for customizing it are sound but it results in debian users showing up on the main mailing list asking questions using terms that aren t recognizable to non-debian users

639452
ubuntu	debian
unfortunately this ends up causing you a problem because ubuntu adopted all these packages from debian but doesn t support them in the same way as debian does and debian packagers seem to feel put upon to be asked to support these ubuntu users
so ubuntu user goes to main exim list and is told to ask their packager for help

639452
ubuntu	debian
so ubuntu user goes to main exim list and is told to ask their packager for help
so they go to the debian lists and ask for help and may or may not be helped

640972
mbunit	mstest
i am not sure that this feature is possible in mstest out of box like in other test frameworks mbunit
if i have to use mstest then i am solving this by defining abstract class testbase with testinitialize attribute and every test which needs this behaviour derives from this base class

641215
pascal	delphi
if you want to port a delphi project to the mac free pascal is your best solution
it s not 100 compatible with delphi but it s good enough for a lot of things and you specifically mentioned that you don t need to port the delphi gui stuff

641330
inherited	properties
because of metabase properties inherited checking for any of the three properties listed above doesn t guarantee the object you re examining is actually an application - whether it be by using the adsi wmi or directoryservices api s
even if the object you are checking is just a virtual directory not application you ll still get values returned because they would be inherited from the parent application

641330
inherited	properties
for example if myvdir is a virtual directory not application located in the default website you would still see a value for appisolated this is because it is inherited from iis localhost w3svc 1 root
the same applies with the appfriendlyname and approot properties

641396
backgrounding	multitasking
possibilities push notifications with a good ui message stack in addition to badging sound whatever - if they have to have an extra approval step so apps can t be obnoxious so be it multiple full processes not possible with current os i realize but then i ve never seen a good explanation why the iphone doesn t support virtual memory smaller backgrounding versions of apps that can run in the backgrounding - no gui and a significantly tighter memory constraint
better multitasking is absolutely key at this point

641422
put	get
this code works perfectly fine in a header because everything is truly constant and therefore has internal linkage this code cannot safely be put in a header file because each line has external linkage either explicitly or because of not being truly constant
get rid of the extern and you re set

643018
loops	if-statement
also note that inside a loops is not necessarily very expensive
modern cpu assumes upon first visit of an if-statement that the if-body is to be taken or said the other way it also assumes a loop-body to be taken multiple times

643072
cdr	cons
perhaps we can use reduce define pairwise-call fun init-element lst reverse cdr reduce lambda a b append list b - b car a cdr a cons list init-element lst disclaimer quick hack untested
define pairwise-call fun init-element lst map fun lst cons init-element lst edit jleedev informs me that this is not the case in at least one scheme implementation

643808
unicode	ucs
unicode is just a standard that defines a character set ucs and encodings utf to encode this character set
but in general unicode is refered to the character set and not the standard

643829
ubuntu	linux
this is not supported for ubuntu or virtualpc but may work
personally i m using virtualbox for linux guests

643936
int	chars
note that integral is another term for int but is not the same as int
chars for example has int integral type but is not the int type obviously

643936
int	chars
chars for example has int integral type but is not the int type obviously
so concretely the following is allowed 10 or 10l or anything like that sizeof chars of course any other template parameter as detailed above any of those can be used as a template argument for a parameter that has an integral type of the corresponding type

644735
x86	64bit
this allows compilers to omit a single shift instruction on x86 for shifts
64bit shifts cannot be done in one instruction on x86

644791
folder	directory
remember unix has directory not folder
edit a folder is two pieces of cardboard glued together that contain files

645424
cvs	rcs
so i still use rcs not even cvs for most of my personal work
one day i may switch to git - but it will be a jolt and it will take a lot of work to retool the release systems configured around sccs and rcs

645985
serializable	deserialization
also do not forget that you can read xml documents directly and write code to de serializable
original answer if you need to completely override one of serialisation or deserialization and thus implement ixmlserializable then you have to do both yourself

646702
pascal	delphi
what you can t do is debug those dlls symbolically in a 3rd party debugger which would have to understand object pascal name mangling at the very least
debug formats are not standardised - basically you can t use delphi to debug ms compiled code or vice versa

646780
inline	inlining
it s up to the jit the c# compiler doesn t do any inlining as far as i m aware but i believe the jit will inline trivial properties in most cases
note that it won t inline members of types deriving from marshalbyrefobject which includes system.windows.forms.control via system.componentmodel.component

646805
ienumerable	ienumerator
a similar case might be made for ienumerable
in c# 1.0 it was supported by foreach but the foreach loop wouldn t dispose of the ienumerator at the end

647083
put	get
you can however put the method in a category that s part of the class s implementation file
that way you ll get a class may not implement this method warning if you try to call it anywhere else

647519
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationitem
when pushing a new view a uinavigationcontroller will inject references to itself and to a uinavigationitem containing metadata about the navigation back button with the title of the view behind it etc...
generally you want to initialize your uinavigationcontroller with interface builder using the nib name field to specify the root view controller the first view to appear which should not have a back button

647557
folder	directory
if your application files are not in a subfolder of wwwroot you can create a virtual directory pointing to your project folder
make sure that this virutal directory has execution permission and is created as an application

647558
consistency	acid
the biggest limitation of most stores is that they are not transactionally safe see scalaris for an transactionally safe store and you need to ensure data consistency by yourself - most use read time consistency by merging conflicting data
rdbms are much easier to use for consistency of data acid joining data is much harder too

647731
posix	getcwd
microsoft has decided to include some of the most commonly used posix functions in their c standard library but prefix these functions with an underscore to essentially discourage their usage
as others have already pointed out getcwd is not included in iso c++ but is part of posix ieee std 1003.1

648412
inline	inlining
in c# you cannot force a method to inline but you can force a method not to
if you really need access to a specific callstack and you need to remove inlining you can use methodimplattribute with methodimploptions.noinlining

648951
realloc	malloc
i would only return a length of -1 if it failed realloc didn t work and make sure the old string is preserved if that happens
4 you re not storing the tmp variable into even though it can change - it rarely re-allocates memory in-place if you re increasing the size although it is possible if the increase is small enough to fit within any extra space allocated by malloc

649132
config	ini
if you don t need to do anything special conditionals etc. it doesn t look much different from other config styles
i could make a file config.py with stuff like and the only burden on the user compared with say ini files is that they need to put around strings

649732
inline	inlining
see hallvard vassbotn s article about inline routines
extracted from that site the rest of the inlining restrictions are common for both platforms and the most important ones are no inlining across package boundaries the inline routine cannot access implementation section identifiers the call site must have access to all identifiers used in the inline routine note the last point means that unless the call site unit uses the units required by the routine the routine cannot be inline

650717
free	realloc
and no it won t get free when it goes out of scope - when you use malloc or realloc it s all up to you
update your edit doesn t change anything - you re still trying to realloc something that wasn t malloced in the first place

650721
realloc	strncpy
you need to initialize your mystring char pointer to null before using it in realloc
you should be passing 4 into strncpy not 5 if you had a larger string you d be overwriting memory

650721
free	realloc
if size is 0 either a null pointer or a unique pointer that can be successfully passed to free is returned
if there is not enough available memory realloc returns a null pointer and sets errno to enomem

650721
realloc	malloc
if there is not enough available memory realloc returns a null pointer and sets errno to enomem
re-alloc will work like malloc when you pass in null if ptr is a null pointer realloc behaves like malloc for the specified size

650846
client-side	server-side
so to answer your question i think that jquery usage will likely expand into most of the areas that asp.net ajax s client-side library currently occupies but asp.net ajax s client-side library will evolve to become other useful things that jquery doesn t provide
keep in mind that asp.net ajax is comprised of both the client-side javascript library microsoftajax.js and the server-side components in system.web.extensions

651145
ssl	https
see readme specifically this part not all php installations support ssl
you can find out if yours supports ssl by reading the http fetching section of the output of examples detect.php. if your installation does not support ssl then https identity urls and server urls will not be supported by the library

652317
hash	md5
but if you just want to hash something using md5 on an iphone this should give you the information you need from calculate md5 on iphone
well first off md5 isn t encryption

652636
implements	extends
my approach would be to take a particular part of the system what exercises all the technical layers - db ui web services whatever and document how that should be implements maybe using class diagrams maybe just suggesting the specific libraries and approaches
in this way your tech spec isn t too big compliments and extends the architecture document which can be a bullet point list if you don t want too much doco

653147
range	max
in determining when to show the ... show a literal control when the link range is not next to the first or last pages.
do the same for above for max pagecount

653457
bids	ssis
you are not able to debug the internal .net code that makes up any of the other built in ssis components the ftp task within bids so i doubt a custom component will be any different
debugging ssis packages within the bids environment is not the same ball game as working with visual studio

653457
bids	ssis
debugging ssis packages within the bids environment is not the same ball game as working with visual studio
you may find it useful to consult the reference debugging how-to-topics ssis if you have developed your very own custom component from within visual studio then you should be able to debug the specific functionality of that component within the visual studio environment prior to making the component available for use within bids

653854
inline	inlining
it s not useful for complex things but for simple lines of code that you want to inline it s not bad
it s good for inlining code and avoiding function call overhead

655110
post	get
not sure exactly what the question is - i think that post has the right solution. as you stated the issue is that the standard memcpy routine reads a byte at a time which does not work correctly for memory mapped hardware registers
that is a limitation of the processor - there s simply no way to get a valid value reading a byte at at time

656559

foo.p12 - keystore in pkcs#12 format

658120
int	double
it produces an int which will be even quicker to comapre and is faster to calculate
but you will have to double check the results of this query by actually testing the string values because the crc function is not designed for this sort of usage and is much more likly to return duplicate values

658156
rpyc	pyro
i have not tried rpyc
yet another approach use pyro python remoting objects

658177
tapestry	wicket
from the other side that could make transitions to the future versions easier for tapestry then for wicket
unfortunately tapestry 5 tutorial does not stress that tapestry code example like t loop source 1..10 ... can be a bad practice

658177
tapestry	wicket
so some effort should be put into writing tapestry usage conventions good practices if your team is not very small
my recommendations use wicket when your pages structure is very dynamic and you can afford spending 10-200 kbs of httpsession memory per user these are rough numbers

658234
many-to-many	one-to-many
has_many through on the other hand is meant for indirect one-to-many relationships or many-to-many relationships with properties
if you re only looking for a simple many-to-many relationship i can t see any reason not to use has_and_belongs_to_many

658480
post	get
it has nothing to do with asp.net mvc but when a check box is left unchecked it is not included in the post collection
you get two values because you have both a checkbox and an input with the same name and the ones you have two values for are most likely the ones with checkboxes checked

658702
prng	random
there s also bruce schneier s yarrow prng server
not truly random but considered cryptographically secure

658773
maven	pom.xml
one word of caution when considering using maven or ivy for managing dependencies is that the quality of the repository directly affects your build experience
if the repo is unavailable or the meta-data for the artifacts pom.xml or ivy.xml is incorrect you might not be able to build

659128
xstream	jackson
works nicely with jersey and i am use it myself current jersey version does not bundle full pojo data binding by default but will in near future i would actually not use any of xml libs to produce json xstream and jaxb jettison can produce kind of json but it uses ugly conventions that are rather non-intuitive
edit 18-jul-2011 jackson actually has an extension called jackson-xml-databind that can read write xml similar to jaxb

659723
for-loop	loops
your bind expression is bound to the curr variable outside of your for-loop not to the one inside your for-loop
and the one outside of your loops doesn t change so the bound expression will not change

659749
post	get
you would need knowledge in the following fields use of an html parser http knowledge get post head web scraping i suggest you focus on www mechanize since it s capable of all these things and more edit another solution that doesn t need programming is this login with your browser on yahoo groups store the cookie and then run wget passing the stored cookie as a parameter
this way you ll get the task accomplished very fast

659799
try-catch	exception-handling
method exception-handling wrapping all methods should be wrapped with an outer try-catch which trap provide a place to recover identify locate log and make a decision to throw or not
it is the unexpected exception-handling that cause our applications to crash - by wrapping every method trapping all unhandled exception-handling we guarantee identifying and logging all exception-handling and we prevent our application from ever crashing

660080
hash	salt	hash	md5	salt	md5
but none of this is relevant to validate the data for database insertion because you aren t going to store plain-text passwords - you re going to store a hash of them in some way md5 md5 + salt whatever
instead you might make sure that you have a 32 character hexadecimal string so that it is very likely to be a properly created md5 hash

660452
rpm	yum
regerding your question you could try to override dependency checking by downloading rpm of the required package an doing rpm -i --force file.rpm since yum does not have any option for forced installations
as a rule of thumb it s better to have one package management in the system so you ll be better off packaging everything in rpms and managing it via yum

660864
unsigned	short
when you convert a signed type to an unsigned type if the number is negative the result of the conversion must be the 2 s complement representation of the integer
in short there is not a faster way than -a

660920
cpu	processors
negating a number is a very simple operation in terms of cpu hardware
i m not aware of a processors that takes any longer to do negation than to do any bitwise operation - and that includes some 30 year old processors

661143
folder	directory
therefore if you wish to have the compiler access com.stackoverflow.example.class present in the classes directory under project a but not in the build path of project a then you should add classes as a class folder and not classes com stackoverflow as a class folder
you can add a directory containing the class files to the eclipse project only if it is inside one of your eclipse projects either in a generated directory or in one you have created

661568
lisp	scheme
this style of programming does not work in plain emacs lisp
emacs lisp uses dynamic binding and languages like scheme and common lisp are using lexical binding

661964
icefaces	tomahawk
icefaces is not an implementation but a component library
other libraries exist such as richfaces myfaces tomahawk and so on

662414
spaces	linefeed
instead of a spaces replace the 0 s with a rare whitespace character that shouldn t normally be in the column s text
a linefeed is probably good enough for a column like this

663125
listview	gridview
the previous data option only works with a listview and only if you don t have a gridview associated with it
i believe this may be because with a view hooked to the listview control it doesn t create an itemscontrol collection

663290
pycrypto	m2crypto
m2crypto is built on top of openssl supports mostlyl everything you need is still maintained and up to date while pycrypto issues several deprecation warnings
pycrypto doesn t add the mentioned padding

663290
pycrypto	m2crypto
pycrypto doesn t add the mentioned padding
m2crypto instead does

663500
goto	break
if you have used on error resume next then you can use on error goto 0 to make sure you aren t suppressing errors here is my take
break this into it s own file if you can for debugging

663946
put	get
i don t think it is a good idea to not put then in the code
you can get into trouble with certain xml element hierachies depending on which one you miss

664235
super	implements
as for simplexml itself i m not sure if it actually implements the arrayaccess interface or if there s something else going on behind the scenes in the php source that gives it these super powers
you can provide array like access to your object by implements the arrayaccess interface which is part of the php standard library

664490
cells	tablecell
unfortunately that still doesn t fire the event i need which is the gotfocus on a tablecell although it is possible to get the event to fire by putting a button in the cells and clicking on it
that bubbles the gotfocus event up the ui tree to the tablecell

664679
rss	feed
atom and rss are flexible enough to allow you to define your own xml namespaces to add whatever elements and attributes you need
if your data produced doesn t map onto the feed entry data model then maybe they aren t the best fit for you

664892
int	boolean
you can loosely cast string values to their int equivalent thus your first example works
javascript doesn t cast false to boolean false only to the string false

664996
inherited	properties
the correct application of a typed datatemplate looks like this contentpresenter inherited directly from frameworkelement and does not have a template properties
in addition the template properties commonly refers to control.template of type controltemplate which is something entirely different than a datatemplate

665042
postgresql	mysql
postgresql has better foreign key support better referential integrity transactions views subselects etc
but that doesn t mean mysql doesn t have its place

665209
cpu	processors
the power of the mainframe lies not in it s cpu grunt the individual processors aren t that powerful but they come in books of 54 cpus with hot backups and you can run many books in a single system z box but in the fact that all the cpu does is process instructions
everything else is offloaded to specialist processors ziips for db2 zaaps for java workloads other devices for i o and i o is where the mainframe kills every other system using fibre optics and very large disk arrays

665249
awt	swing
the un-j d names were already taken by awt and we thought it useful to use a common prefix to distinguish components from other classes in the package. the already taken part does match with what i said about the compiler but does not confirm it
when sun started working on swing they had things like javax.swing.button

665252
awt	swing
the j was first put out by the kl group now quest.com whose revolutionary bwt forms the basis of today s improved awt called swing jfc
so it comes from the ancestor of today s kl jclass not so according to tofubeer s answer i leave the rest as a community answer because it details what was jclass but the j may not come at all from the integration of their library into swing. jclass swingsuite a new set of extensions and enhancements for swing in sun microsystems inc. s java tm development kit jdk tm version 1.2 it coincides with sun s announcement of the availability of jdk 1.2 made today during the java sm business expo sm in new york

665472
nullreferenceexception	argumentnullexception
edit just to save me having to write it yet again elsewhere the call to subjects.count will throw an argumentnullexception not a nullreferenceexception
count is another extension method here and assuming the implementation in system.linq.enumerable is being used that s documented correctly to throw an argumentnullexception

665673
lisp	scheme
in lisp-1 lisp like scheme and clojure they do
in lisp-2 lisp like common lisp they do not

666057
trie	tree
this way the last trie you have will contain all the matches that are contained in all files
depending on how similar the entries within one file is it might be possible to create a trie not tree from it

trie	tree
depending on how similar the entries within one file is it might be possible to create a trie not tree from it
using this trie you can iterate the other file and check each entry if it is inside the trie

666253
vb.net	vb6
and those who use vb.net surely have .net framework installed
all the answers are very useful but they all suggest that i create this callback redirector in vb6 which is not very convenient since i may have to redistribute the vb6 runtime with the client application

667207
width	margin
i believe this blog post should help you out here s a solution it s not neat since it has to be done for every instance of a tab but it makes the tabs take up less space and preserves the formatting for copying out of the browser obviously replace a single tab here with a real tab this blog software automatically removes tabs from entries it seems basically replace every instance of a tab in your code with that code snippet after choosing a suitable width you could do it in a stylesheet pretty easily
the code artificially inserts the margin whilst keeping the original tab in the code ready for copy pasting

668439
accessor	properties
if you want to prevent that you need to make them immutable on insertion or perform a depp-copy of the array in the readonlyarray accessor
the contents of somearray are modifiable although the properties is not a call cannot change the value of the somearray instance variable by assigning to the properties

668572
g++	gcc
you also want to make sure that the g++ and f77 commands in your makefile are running the commands that you expect them to be running not accessing executables in unexpected directories or different incompatible versions
edit from your recent edits to your question you appear to be trying to link the sun compiler s f77 with the gcc g++

668916
ftp	telnet
i m not sure i understand your comment on using ftp to log in and monitor log files - surely you d be logging in with telnet and its brethren rather than using ftp for that purpose
i m not aware of windows ftp client having a similar functionality to the unix .netrc file although i ve been wrong before just ask the wife -

didreceivememorywarning	imagenamed
things you should in general take care of release any variables which you do not need always handle didreceivememorywarning and release any variables not in use stop any memory-heavy processes in applicationdidreceivememorywarning like audio video playing uiimagepickercontroller etc edit this does not apply any more
imagenamed had caching issues prior to 3.x os versions

669298
post	get
w3c http standard says that get is idempotent the same url get executed multiple times should always result in same response and consequently can be cached along the way while post is not and must reach the url target
response of an openid html form post or saml html form post should not be cached

669381
udp	tcp
despite client protocol name of tcp ip mssql uses udp for bitbanging
you may not have the udp port open vpn-forwarded it s port number 1433

669888
hash	salt
salt causes the same password to yield different hash and thwarts dictionary attacks where a hacker has pre-computed hash values for common passwords and built a reverse-lookup index so that they can quickly discover a password for a given hash
like an iv the salt used is not a secret

669910
maven	m2e
i m not certain on this part but i ve used it to deploy web apps to tomcat within eclipse for a maven project
you can effectively run any maven command including ones with profiles through the m2e plugin

670666
integer	unsigned
the size of php ints is platform dependent the size of an integer is platform-dependent although a maximum value of about two billion is the usual value that s 32 bits signed . php does not support unsigned integers
integer size can be determined using the constant php_int_size and maximum value using the constant php_int_max since php 4.4.0 and php 5.0.5

670668
integer	unsigned
from the php manual the size of an integer is platform-dependent although a maximum value of about two billion is the usual value that s 32 bits signed . php does not support unsigned integers
integer size can be determined using the constant php_int_size and maximum value using the constant php_int_max since php 4.4.0 and php 5.0.5

670716
wmv	asf
it s not so much that flash doesn t support wmv asf
it s more the fact that wmv asf is not a flash movie so you can t pretend that it s one by putting it in the src attribute when you re using the application x-shockwave-flash type

670908
put	get
and put it back in
it isn t boxing - simply that when you get the rectangle out you are manipulating a standalone copy of the rectangle

670993
public	protected
this extra level of indirection allows you to provide a read only view of your variable to a public interface while not allowing your data member to be changed
you could still use a private or protected setter

670993
getter	setter
with a getter you can also obtain different views of your data example getminutes when your data member is actually stored in seconds
this is not the reason to use them but a nice side effect of using getters and setter is that you can set a breakpoint inside your modifier for example to see exactly when it is changed

671250
post	put
so it really uses only get and post and on server it reads this hidden field and reacts on it
i ve heard that delete and put is not fully supported in all browsers i didn t check it

671268
put	get
taking a look into the xmlhttprequest object specification currently just a working draft too used for asynchronous requests in javascript ajax it supports the put and delete methods too but doesn t say anything about the actual support by current browsers
the html 4.01 specification describes only get and post as valid values for the method attribute

671284
post	put	post	get
a post doesn t have to be through a form
the best way to learn about this and also get put and delete is to use a rest client to make your http requests and see the responses

671301
post	put	put	get
however if you really want to do it from a browser you can use ajax to send put s and delete s yui s connection manager allows you specify any of the following http methods get post head put delete
c moran is right if you want to be truly restful a browser isn t an ideal client due in part to the lack http methods beyond get and post

671534
put	get
get the next item from the source if it matches the regex if a block was given call the block and whatever the block returns put it in the return values
if a block was not given put the item in the return values goto 2 repeat until no more items in the source

671852
udp	tcp
sql doesn t listen on tcp 1434 it listens on udp 1434
you can t test udp ports using telnet

671852
udp	tcp
have your isp open udp 1434
check the client connection order on the server and i ll get that named pipes is above tcp ip but ssms isn t use named pipes for some reason

671988
inherited	properties
in example 1 the span element is not directly targeted so we must look into how css inherited is handled
color is an inherited properties so we need to look at the span s closest parent element to determine color

672072
hash	md5
since you re already calling a stat on each node i m assuming you re using ftw ftw64 you may as well have ftw s callback insert the name of the node into an array that has structure members that can store a hash of the file which is unlikely to collide
md5 isn t going to cut it for this

672695
yacc	sablecc
my experiences with yacc for c and happy for haskell have both been pleasant
i ve used sablecc in my compiler course though not by choice

672924
vim	emacs
code blocks is less used because it isn t extensible as emacs vim
during my work in emacs with different programming languages i often create a new scripts that make my work much easier

673674
gif	png
gif images are not very efficient for photographic images
you should experiment with other formats like jpg and png to see if you can get the same quality with smaller file size

674037
hash	salt
if you need to migrate hash you can intercept people with an old password format and make them change their password the next time they log in
as others have mentioned you want to be careful with your hash since it s easy to do something that s not really secure h salt password is far weaker than h password salt but at the same time you want to balance the effort put into this with the value of the site content

674037
hash	salt
as others have mentioned you want to be careful with your hash since it s easy to do something that s not really secure h salt password is far weaker than h password salt but at the same time you want to balance the effort put into this with the value of the site content
i ll often use h h password salt password

674275
put	get
whichever the tool avoid having it put a date time on the files as it gets in the middle of knowing what have changed when looking at the source control log
whichever the tool you use the developers should be able to work with it with no hassles if not it will get in the middle specially on an ongoing project

674852
rpm	yum
you can either bypass rpm s dependency resolution by installing the package using rpm --nodeps and hope it works
or install the php version you compiled yourself in another directory so it can coexist with the old version from yum so everyone is happy not sure if that s possible i guess it depends on whether your apps use a hardcoded path to php or not

675203
hash	salt
storing the per-user salt in your database is not a security issue using a site-wide hash is
if using a cryptographically secure hash it shouldn t matter whether you pre- or postfix

675293
for-loop	loops
there s really no reason except maybe to save some space in the file to write a for-loop like that since this is equivalent
the generalized format of a for-loop not a for-in loops is for expression_1

675708
hash	salt
onebyone.livejournal.com the attacker has rainbow tables consisting not of the hash of dictionary words but of the state of the hash computation just before finalising the hash calculation
it could then be cheaper to brute-force a password file entry with postfix salt than prefix salt for each dictionary word in turn you would load the state add the salt bytes into the hash and then finalise it

675708
hash	salt
for a simple hash function that scans linearly through the input string such as a simple linear congruential generator this is a practical attack
but a cryptographically secure hash function is deliberately designed to have multiple rounds each of which uses all the bits of the input string so that computing the internal state just prior to the addition of the salt is not meaningful after the first round

676753
folder	directory
just make a hidden folder in your homedir so it doesn t clutter your homedir too much this creates a directory in your homedir called .paths which contains symlinks to all your long directory locations which you regularly use then sets the cdpath bash variable to that directory in your .bashrc and re-reads the .bashrc file
now you can go to any of those paths from anywhere leaving you with a short cdpath no cluttering aliasses and more importantly a really easy way to navigate to those long paths from other applications such as ui applications by just going into .paths or adding that directory into your ui application s sidebar or so

677315
superclass	subclassing
unlike c++ templates java generics work by type erasure so it only generates one class for all values of t and translates all references to type t in this class to the super type of t in this case superclass then uses virtual dispatch to provide the variance for calls to object methods and static dispatch to calls to static methods
so when you do the compiler does not make a global replace of t with subclassing in dummy

677459
config	ini
ini is really a much simpler format than xml if you have less than fifty config options and they are not nested
i had a similar need and found this to be extremely useful and simple. it is an ini file reader and writer you just specify the header tag and the item name and it will read or write from a file

677633
int	chars
if you cannot find a good big int library for c# it s not against the rules to calculate the number in a language like python which already has the ability to calculate large numbers
you could then put this number into your c# program via your method of choice and iterate over each chars in the number you will have to store it as a string

678138
subnet	packets
off-net routing is done by the client machine knowing which ip addresses are on the local subnet to which it is connected
if the requested ip address is not local then the client machine refers to its routing table to find out which gateway to send the packets to

678216
hash	md5
i presume cryptographic strength is not an actual requirement so that flawed but widely used hash schemes like md5 would be adequate - and readily available in many libraries
any cryptographically strong hash will have the properties you want but generate more bits but simple truncation of the result to 32 bits would be fine

679042
post	get
this way they will not accidentally re-send the post request if they hit reload or hit their back button later in their browsing session
you should never change anything in your database other than logging information or other ephemeral data from a get request

679048
post	get
if you re going to link to a get for deletion you should return a confirmation page with that get that actually does a post upon confirmation
you don t want to use get because of the rest principle of not allowing gets to change the state of the system

679511
put	get
insofar as not removing all the files check the reference count under if you ve used msizap aka the windows installer cleanup utility you ve basically put your machine into an unknown state and you ll need to manually remove everything from the registry in my company we have a utility that removes all known registry entries from the last 10 releases of the product basically consisting of a 1000 line .reg file and some other tools before you can reliably test your setup again
see for a bit more information about what happens when you get your machine into an unsupported state and how you ll need to manually clean up things or reformat before continuing

679705
post	get
i recall struggling with this issue long ago wondering why i simply couldn t redirect with a modified post header
the reason is a redirect is actually considered a get

679875
post	get
a href javascript function ... that said all the other reasons for using post over get apply crawlers and the like
post is not a protection from all malicious behavior as some people have implied

679875
post	get
post is not a protection from all malicious behavior as some people have implied
malicious users can still create links that contain javascript to do the post and cause the same cross-site scripting problems as with get

680357
integer	unsigned
incidentally to handle a 64-bit integer replace the if value 0 line with these two
if you re trying to avoid a loop and you care about speed you can use a method like this java doesn t have unsigned integers so that first if value 0 is a little questionable

680700
cpu	hyperthreading
the main problem here was that the cpus would have to expose some of their internal data to the other cpu so they wouldn t get in their way
the next step was hyperthreading

681377
int	chars
however consider just checking if the text is numeric with a regular expression like and then converting to an int and checking the int is within range
regular expressions work on chars in this case digits not numbers

681872
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
furthermore all thread synchronization locks monitor readerwriterlock mutex semaphone autoresetevent manualresetevent etc. call interlocked methods internally
so it would seem that as wekempf pointed out that the result variables do not require the volatile keyword in the example as shown since the manualresetevent ensures cache coherency

681984
ienumerable	iqueryable	ilist	iqueryable
usually for me the choice between ienumerable or ilist usually ends up being whichever is easier to implement in the standard case
iqueryable would have a rather heavy requirement on it -- you couldn t for example return an array

682052
subclass	metaclass
i would second the notion that you may wish to consider a subclass instead of the approach you ve outlined
however not knowing your specific scenario ymmv - what you re thinking of is a metaclass

683158
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
furthermore all thread synchronization locks monitor readerwriterlock mutex semaphone autoresetevent manualresetevent etc. call interlocked methods internally
so it would seem that as wekempf pointed out that the result variables do not require the volatile keyword in the example as shown since the manualresetevent ensures cache coherency

683524
treemap	linkedhashmap
a linkedhashmap keeps the keys in the order they were inserted while a treemap is kept sorted via a comparator or the natural comparable ordering of the elements
since it doesn t have to keep the elements sorted linkedhashmap should be faster for most cases

683642
post	get
but it not used enough to deserve to make this post even longer -
string formatting slicing an iterable you can get any part of an iterable using a very concise syntax logical checks you can check the way you do in c# but there are pythonic ways shorter clearer - combo print on one line all the words containing an o in uppercase output good to some code easier to ask for forgiveness than permission python coders usually don t check if something is possible

683703
subnet	packets
calls to select the outbound interface send to the specific broadcast address for each known interface the latter is however not suitable if you re trying to do some sort of discovery mechanism such that the devices you re expecting to respond aren t actually correctly configured with an ip address in the same subnet as the interface they re connected to
you can t have a single sendto generate a packets on every interface - in general fragmentation notwithstanding it s one packets transmitted for each sendto

683908
serializable	deserialization
in binary serializable you can get both old new version of the app to be able to read each other serializable info .net 2.0+ but if you save it back you will loose the extra info the version doesn t handles
starting at .net 2.0 the deserialization process ignores the extra data if you combine that with optional fields you can effectively get both apps to read other version s formats

683923
tostring	string.format
but when you alert element alert calls tostring on the element and htmllinkelement.tostring returns the contents of the href attribute so alert link spits out the same results as alert link.href
which is a bit weird and confusing but that s how javascript 1.0 worked so there s not much can be done about it now. i check the value of ele after calling getelementbyid it prints string.format javascript showhideelement..... that shouldn t happen with the exact example you ve given.

683930
free	realloc
if the address of a local variable is passed to realloc it may attempt to free its memory and allocate it elsewhere
since the address is not from the heap and realloc operates on the heap this will fail

684202
public	protected
most important are public api methods especially published api methods
private methods are sometimes not documented although i think they should be just for clarity - same goes with protected methods

684342
put	get
you cannot guarantee when someone might access your control which is why you would put in ensurechildcontrol calls before any access to a control in your controls collection
in a normal page lifecycle createchildcontrols will get called when asp.net gets around to adding your composite control to the page

684735
hash	md5
edit i forgot to mention that if you were hashing pixel values you d probably want to include the dimensions of the image in the hash too
just to a similar thing-- write two ints to an 8-byte bytebuffer then update the messagedigest with the corresponding 8-byte array. the other thing is that somebody mentioned is that md5 is not collision-resistent

684816
unix	bsd
also the bsd platform is not easiest of the unix family to begin from zero
good sources to learn absolute bsd book

686023
for-loop	loops
see the code comments if i ve got that backward. this suggestion may be controversial because of the less conventional condition in the for-loop could be said to be low on the self-documenting scale but if that doesn t bother you a concise way of writing what i think you you want is
i m taking #2 case to mean that you want to not perform skip loops body in the #2 case and not that you want to reset loops to 0

687283
folder	directory
then go to the target folder you want to write the pdf to right-click and go to properties security add and add write for the account listed for the app pool
in iis 6 manager go to application pools and get the properties of the application pool your web site is running under if you re not sure it s on the web site properties dialog home directory tab

687708
inherited	subclassing
i m not going to argue the merits of delegation over inherited but suffice it to say that there are many who feel that delegation is cleaner than inherited
delegates to my understanding provides a way of specializing the behavior of a class without subclassing it

688509
free	malloc
unfortunately c++ does not provide a good mechanism to do this so you often end up with such malloc free hacks in real world applications
if you never add a constructor destructor assignment operators or virtual functions to your structure using malloc free for allocation is safe

688767
folder	directory
thus you should have your source control ignore everything inside the cache folder but not the cache folder itself
you can delete the contents of the cache directory but not the directory itself

689320
xna	slimdx
unfortunately microsoft no longer supports managed directx and it s successor xna does not support 64bit either
slimdx is an open source alternative to managed directx and it supports 64bit

689576
google-chrome	firefox
and also i assumed that since it didnt work in google-chrome that safari would be the same but you know what they say about assuming it works in safari but not google-chrome
total facepalm moment in firefox tools options content tab advanced button next to enable javascript check the box named raise or lower windows this is turned off by default and must be enabled

690376
put	get
i know it s not what you want to hear but the entry point s config file is the logical place to put these setttings
if every library required its own config file then it would get tedious to have to edit every single file instead of just one

690400
profiling	instrumentation
a tracing profiling adds code to your program a process known as instrumentation to essentially log what is going on
tracing profilers are slower but more accurate they also require that the program be changed the instrumentation process which could potentially introduce bugs not that i have heard of it happening.

690628
webclient	webrequest
with the webclient class i doubt you can change it out-of-the-box so that it does not allow redirects
what you could do is derive a class from the webclient class and then override the getwebrequest and the getwebresponse methods to alter the webrequest webresponse instances that the base implementation returns

690802
jar	war
you have three simple steps to accomplish this place the jar file in the ear we typically create a lib directory but that is not necessary
update the manifest for the war to include this jar file

690802
jar	war
edit as an alternative since you are only using the ear to wrap the war and not actually sharing the jar file
put the jar in the lib directory of the war

691373
geshi	mediawiki
also you ll probably need an extension for mediawiki to show code something like syntaxhighlight geshi
all this doesn t really explain how to convert the output of phpdocumentor into something usable with mediawiki ie using wiki syntax

691468
post	get
if not post some code from the simplified version
maybe because output caching is enabled for the page if the page is cached server-side with varybyparam none all users will get the same copy from the cache

691893
post	get
his solution is best but you could also change it to a form post and then the url variables you are passing through the action attribute will be passed through
paolo is right but i would also add that the reason you are having this trouble is because when you do a form get any url variables in the action url are not passed along

692310
octal	binary
octal numbers in c are preceded by the character 0 so 0123 is not 123 but is instead 1 64 + 2 8 + 3 or 83
in binary where the digits are 0 and 1

692639
factors	mean
this will cause the tree to rebalance incorrectly because the upward scan for balance factors will be working with incorrect balance factors
it could mean updating the balance factors but not balancing

692639
factors	mean
it could mean updating the balance factors but not balancing
this means you would end up when you did decide to delete something with balance factors greater than 2 or smaller than -2

692804
cpu	processors
what the other answers say about it being impossible to accurately predict the performance of code running on a modern cpu is true but that doesn t mean the latencies are unknown or that knowing them is useless
the exact latencies for intels and amd s processors are listed in agner fog s instruction tables

692972
children	parent
also .cshort is a child of .chead so you look through .chead s children not at its siblings via .next
try changing this to this .chead and .cbody are siblings so you don t need to look at .cbody s parent

693986
apache	nginx
clients hit the reverse proxy using ssl on 443 and the reverse proxy decrypts the whole thing and forwards it off to your apache server who doesn t know a thing about ssl
both squid and nginx support it

694304
hash	salt
for example to generate a hash of user s row id you could use something like however basing your pseudorandom string only on a row id is not very secure as the user could easily reverse the hash try googling 77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb of such a short string
a simple solution here is to salt the hashed string add the same secret string to every value that is hashed

695018
config	ini
the registry is a fine place to put config data of all types
in general it is faster than most config files and more reliable individual operations on the registry are transacted so if your app crashes during a write the registry isn t corrupted - in general that isn t the case with ini files

695326
onclick	onmousedown
if anyone actually knows why ie doesn t like onclick i d be interested to hear
the fix appears to be using the onmousedown event instead of onclick

696246
post	get
but not use get for updating data as pointed out above take for example a cms you ll often see the following structure or pages about_the_company the display action is the default action pages about_the_company edit get will display the edit page while post will perform an update of course in a cms the controller would be defaulted to pages so the url s would be even shorter
besides from the comments pointed out in the post above i think it is perfectly ok to change the structure around a bit

696286
post	put	post	get	put	get
rest is not about having clean uris it is about having the correct semantic attached to http methods get post put and delete
get should only be for safe idempotent operations post should be for creation or processing put should be for updating an existing resource and delete to hmm delete a resource

696966
accessor	properties
i m not sure if you just picked a bad example for your struct name since nullable is a framework struct but if not the error is due to the fact that you have no set accessor in your properties
automatic properties added in c# 3.0 need both a get and set properties

697617
put	get
for example if you put non-numeric characters in a number field you can get a parsing error
if you put a zero in where it isn t anticipated you can get a divide by zero error

697617
put	get
if you put a zero in where it isn t anticipated you can get a divide by zero error
if you put a much larger value in than is expected or a negative when not expected or any number of other things you can get an error of some sort

697668
pop-up	dialog
i m not really sure i totally understand your problem but what i think you are trying to say is that when you drag a portlet it s supposed to be binding a click event listener to the setup wrench button on your portlet so that when it s clicked a dialog pop-up
and you are saying that when you click on that wrench a dialog pop-up for all your portlets and not just the one you clicked the button inside of

697952
pascal	delphi
is a typical method of concatinating strings and has been used in pascal delphi for the past few decades without any significant problems
delphi does not require a string builder class but one is provided for delphi 2009 if you so desire to use it

698119
matlab	simulink
not mentioned in the book is matlab which in the last few years has gone from a simulation tool to a model driven development system for realtime systems. matlab simulink is in effect a dsl for linear programming state machines and algorithms
matlab can generate c or hdl for realtime and embedded systems

698265
client-side	server-side
this can be a huge problem because html can include client-side scripts that will take over the user s access to the site a cross-site-scripting attack
at this point you might be tempted to sniff the file on the server-side for example using the file command to check it doesn t contain html

699126
maven	pom.xml
a project which follows maven conventions and doesn t require any dependencies or customization
if we wanted to start customizing the behavior our pom.xml is going to grow in size and in the largest of projects you can see collections of very complex maven poms which contain a great deal of plugin customization and dependency declarations

699266
boost	stl	inline	inlining
because boost function is polymorphic it cannot be inline
the design of the stl is aimed at maximum potential for the compiler to do inlining of code which is easy on expanded templates

699350
spaces	delimiter
you can use afterwards which will replace all spaces with nothing
but you can also do that with commas but keep in mind that a the delimiter changes it s a dot for me not a comma

699357
int	chars
see section 6.4.4.4 paragraph 10 of the c99 standard an int chars constant has type int
the value of an int chars constant containing a single chars that maps to a single-byte execution chars is the numerical value of the representation of the mapped chars interpreted as an integer. the value of an int chars constant containing more than one chars ab or containing a chars or escape sequence that does not map to a single-byte execution chars is implementation-defined

699357
int	chars
the value of an int chars constant containing a single chars that maps to a single-byte execution chars is the numerical value of the representation of the mapped chars interpreted as an integer. the value of an int chars constant containing more than one chars ab or containing a chars or escape sequence that does not map to a single-byte execution chars is implementation-defined
if an int chars constant contains a single chars or escape sequence its value is the one that results when an object with type chars whose value is that of the single chars or escape sequence is converted to type int

699408
spaces	delimiter
this condition means that your data should contain of only digits spaces and tab characters basically it should be digits and spaces or digits and tab only
for this just load the data to variable and check if it matches if it matches - it will mean that you will have set of integers delimiter by spaces or tabs it s not really relevant which character was used to delimit the integers

699484
cpu	processors
keep in mind that doing this calculation directly affects how much the cpu is in use
cpu usage cannot be directly measured because unlike an x86 the arm processors doesn t have a register for it

699980
post	put
the basic scheme would be something like take picture convert to jpg there s a function for this construct http post using the nsurl classes set jpg data as post body or one part of a mutipart form post converting to base64 should not be necessary
if you ve never put together any kind of server api there are any number of examples available

maven	pom.xml
using typed super poms isn t something compatible with the way that most organizations use maven
usually there is a corporate pom.xml or a top-level pom.xml in a project

701208
implements	extends
that means you have two options how to achieve what you want implements your own subclass of fieldeditor which would represent the group widget
do not extends fieldeditorpreferencepage but only a preferencepage instead

701847
inherited	properties
the listbox and the button do not inherited their background setting from the parent although they do inherited font properties
the fontsize properties of the container should be inherited by child controls unless they explicitly override the properties

702058
width	margin
if you did not specify a width ie will default to 100 of the available room within its parent
the following code with background colors clearly displays in ie6 with the list items floated all the way to the right within the ul and actually 30px off the display window with a double margin on the left

702254
httphandler	httpmodule
without iis7 and on shared hosting you would have to creare a handler that mapped a .net file extention that you are not using like .asmx and in the web.config specify that .asmx files go to your httphandler which is set to rewrite the path to .jpg or whatever and set the header there too
in iis7 all requests go to .net so you would have to create an httpmodule that added those headers to all responses

702791
post	put
a .ascx can t be accessed directly becasue the default handler is the class system.web.httpforbiddenhandler .asmx files can be called directly they are webmethods though you usually have to make post request unless you specify to allow get s in the web.config b the .ashx extention is defined in a config file it s just not the web.config its in the machine.config why use .ashx the difference is that the .net class that handles a .ashx reads the page directive in the .ashx file to map the request to a class specified in that directive
this saves you from having to put an explicit path in the web.config for every handler that you have which could result in a very long web.config

704209
spweb	splist
as you enumerate over that result each spweb will be disposed when the enumerator moves to the next item
this means that it is not safe to use that spweb reference or any sp object created from it splist etc outside of your foreach loop

704209
splist	spsite	spweb	spsite
this means that it is not safe to use that spweb reference or any sp object created from it splist etc outside of your foreach loop
also sw would not be safe to use outside of that using block because the iterator s spwebcollections will be tied to the now-disposed spsite

704390
actionscript	mxml
flex has a markup piece mxml and a programming language piece actionscript
there isn t much of a learning curve for the mxml part

704548
put	get
it provides an eventually consistent guarantee so if you put something there is no guarantee that you will see the item on your next get
see this is fine when you want to use simpledb to do indexing on data that does not need to be immediately up to date and can be reconciled later but in the case of session state you d likely want something with acid guarantees like sql server as you want to know that once you have committed something you will get it back on the next read

705058
post	get	put	get
this allows user agents to represent other methods such as post put and delete in a special way so that the user is made aware of the fact that a possibly unsafe action is being requested
naturally it is not possible to ensure that the server does not generate side-effects as a result of performing a get request

705272
appfuse	spring
i ve figured it out by reverse-engineering appfuse appfuse.org which does not seem to be affected by mojibake with its file upload form
it solved it by setting the charset encoding to utf-8 in the server side with spring s org.springframework.web.filter.characterencodingfilter

705926
cvs	svn
this is the approach i am using for interacting with cvs from git
if git-svn is not part of msysgit i recommend using a small unix server to host your gateway repository that clones your svn repository and then clone that repository onto your windows machine

706036
postgresql	mysql
in oracle in ms sql up to 100 rows or using hint up to 32768 in postgresql in mysql nothing
hate to say this but mysql is the only rdbms of the big four that doesn t have this feature

706697
put	get
granted i may not have put it through its full paces but i have hit a wide range of abilities over the past year or so since moving to vs2008 edit nevermind i just remembered crashing it when a former coworker insisted on using source safe which ran off a laggy server the lag alone brought vs2008 down
considering i ve never gotten vs2008 to crash on any os id say its hard to get any better than that

708271
boost	stl
you can use boost bind as an alternative
if you want stl strings you need to include is not a standard signature

708575
post	get
you should use post for that this way if anyone crawls your page they won t have 10 times the same page with just the select box changed
you shouldn t use get s to change form values on a page

709209
http	spdy
the overhead of using http side-wide is not seen as much of a big deal anymore
the new spdy protocol pioneered by google now evolved into http 2 is supported cross-browser and by major web servers and improves http speed

709465
nunit	mstest
if not or you don t mind converting existing mstests i would standardize on nunit
i strongly prefer nunit over mstest

709498
nunit	mstest
one other advantage of nunit is that it doesn t require that you add anything to your test classes
mstest requires the presence of a testcontext property

709950
createfile	getlasterror
if you specify no sharing access 0 to the dwsharemode parameter of the createfile call then you will not get a file handle if any other process is currently using that file in any way
getlasterror in this case would return error_sharing_violation 32 to see if there is a security problem with accessing the file to see if there is a permissions problem accessing that file the createfile call will also fail but with a different getlasterror

710096
opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
you could use a solution that incorporates both jamie s and shoban s answers and adds some conditional comments the above works on windows in ie6 7 8 firefox 2 3 opera 9.6 and google-chrome 1
it does not work in safari for windows 3 or 4

710144
folder	directory
then you use names for the folder that would help identify it as the common ones that are distinct from the individual web apps
commonusercontrols instead of just usercontrols in your other web apps you create a virtual directory to the commonusercontrols etc and add a file based reference to the commoncontrolswebapp.dll this requires you to use iis for development not casini and visual studio won t believe that the controls really exist but it will work at runtime and you can build just fine with only warnings about blahblah.ascx or blahblah.master path invalid

710597
superclass	subclassing
i m facing the exact same problem. my superclass does not handle any jaxb annotations it doesn t have to and i would like my subclassing not to include superclass properties while marshalling
adding the xmlaccesortype on superclass cannot be the solution as i have no way to modify the superclass

711038
profiler	hprof
your kit java profiler is able to read hprof snapshots i am not sure if only for memory profiling or for cpu as well
it is not free but is by far the best java profiler i ever used

711052
implements	extends
you can t explicity implements interface members void ifoo.doa when implicitly implements the interface
in other words because bar only implements ifoo by virtue of extends foo you cannot use explicit implementation

711707
google-chrome	safari
this is definitely a google-chrome bug and you just need to report it and wait for solution. i checked your page in safari which uses same engine as google-chrome webkit and the page works fine
my good advice is to not create such long pages because it is not only bad for google-chrome but also for your s site visitors

711712
super	self
not sure why they have super and parent mean the same thing typical confusion super is the receiver not the parent of its class
just like self is not the receiver s class

711945
int	double
since memory is cheap you would probably be best off just using an int
probably not as long as you don t do it with a float or a double

712169
children	parent
there s a great article on it here not only is retrieving data from such a structure extremely efficient single select and you get all the children you ll be able to delete a whole branch of the tree in a single delete statement as well
if your data is linearly hierarchical only one parent relation per node and high-read low-write you might consider migrating it to a modified preorder tree traversal structure

712372
nant	cruisecontrol
i m not sure about gac but iis seems controllable via .vbs files for services we use psexec.exe via nant anyway there s probably dozens of ways to approach this - the internally-automated external-manual-step-required setup works for us
richard we didn t want to put cruisecontrol anywhere near staging or production servers

712420
noscript	meta
adding a refresh in meta inside noscript is not a good idea
because noscript tag is not xhtml compliant the attribute value refresh is nonstandard and should not be used

712636
int	double
the problem is that your code has an int as the first argument and c++ doesn t know whether to promote it to a double or long double
double pow double base double exponent

712638
int	double
from error c2668 pow ambiguous call to overloaded function in vc++ 2005 only alex.m wrote pow any overload takes a floating point type number single double or long double precision as first argument not an int
this is where the error comes from since the compiler can t guess the way you want your long int to be converted

713155
hash-collision	key
therefore unless you are performing a lot of key based operations on huge dictionaries with many hash-collision the speed of key to key comparisons will not be a major factor
the collections are fairly small but they get iterated lots of times if you are iterating there are no key to key comparisons

713257
int	chars	int	double
chars short int and long are of different size each just like float double and long double
int is not 32 bits

713257
int	chars
int is not 32 bits
chars is neither signed nor unsigned

713978
folder	directory
before you do this i learned the hard way that you should not create remove folder under a running application or you will cause your app pool to recycle
so make sure that you are creating directory somewhere else on the server

714085
int	boolean
.net also has value types int double datetime etc
value types cannot be null you so you normally compare those to their default value which is very often type.minvalue but might be something consider boolean for example

714864
tao	jacorb
if the software currently works with the jdk orb there is no reason why it would not work with tao
if you encounter any problems you can drop in replace the jdk orb with jacorb

715314
subclass	superclass
no but you can subclass dict to provide notification on change
note that the superclass watcher defined here doesn t check to see if there was a real change or not

715574
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
below exception there is runtimeexception also an unchecked-exception
the way that the designers of java intended exceptions to be used is exception things that can go wrong error low level things that can go wrong and a program cannot recover from runtimeexception programmer errors like going past the end of an array or calling a method on null

715574
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
the way that the designers of java intended exceptions to be used is exception things that can go wrong error low level things that can go wrong and a program cannot recover from runtimeexception programmer errors like going past the end of an array or calling a method on null
the idea behind not having to catch unchecked-exception is that they indicate failures vm level or programmer that either you cannot handle vm error or should not exist in a properly debugged program programmer mistake

715609
disk	ram
they are individually started via java -jar batch1.jar or some such. therefore sharing library .jar files only saves you disk space not ram
if the apps are not sharing a single jvm then ease-of-deployment should take precedence over disk space

715928
domcontentloaded	onreadystatechange
the correct way around the issue would be to use the domcontentloaded event which isn t supported in all browsers
hacks eg polling doscroll or using onreadystatechange exist so libraries are able to provide this functionality across browsers

716333
punctuation	words
as such you have to be aware that funky punctuation and stuff can make it in--it s not just words
for example i ve seen partial words that end in a hyphen that obviously occurred on the end of a line as well as dollar-signs numbers like 1

716388
for-loop	loops
use variable names for objects and stick with i and j for-loop index variables like our masterful fortran forefathers for i in grouplist servers+ getservers i becomes for section in grouplist servers + getservers section containers can be tested for contents without getting their length while len threadlist 0 becomes while threadlist and if command.strip becomes if command.strip splitting a tuple is usually not put in parenthesis on the left hand side of a statement and the command logic is a bit convoluted
if there are no args then the .join ... is going to be an empty string options args parser.parse_args if options.verbose print floep 0.1 command .join args if command.strip parser.error no command given becomes options args parser.parse_args if options.verbose print floep 0.1 if not args parser.error no command given command .join args a python for-loop has an unusual else clause which is executed if loops goes through all of the elements without a break for server in threadlist foundone false if not server.isalive ...snip... foundone true if not foundone time.sleep 0.010 becomes for server in threadlist if not server.isalive ...snip... break else time.sleep 0.010 getting a list of lines and then joining them back together is a bit long winded result proc.readlines strresult for line in result strresult+ line self.result strresult becomes self.result proc.read your library use is good check out the subprocess module it s a little more up-to-date

716454
webclient	httpwebrequest
if you are worried though you may want to use webclient which is idisposable
httpwebrequest doesn t implement idisposable since it can create a stream which does implement idisposable

716593
rss	feed
i ve worked with rss not atom feed in the past and have never had to change the header as long as the feed was formatted correctly
well your feed need only conform to the atom specifications

716674
versioning	upgrade
but you re connecting to a database that was defined as some past versioning not the versioning you have checked out
the migrations allow you to upgrade or downgrade the database schema from any versioning and to any versioning incrementally

717112
factors	mean
that s probably not an important factors unless you re dealing with millions of entries however
if you mean a java.util.list it s an interface

718367
chunked	transfer-encoding
this is defined in http 1.1 which is what firefox is using while wget is using http 1.0 which doesn t support chunked transfer encoding so the server has to send the whole file at once
looks like it s because of the chunked transfer encoding transfer-encoding chunked this will send the video down in chunks each with its own size

718586
int	double
if they re both int then the lines initializing angx and angy will be evaluated using int arithmetic
this can be fixed by casting one of the operands the fovy and fovx variables are already double though this isn t the problem

719159
lisp	scheme
note that this was not just lisp for scripting - it was lisp all the way down
one the scheme side there is also a new interesting implementation called ypsilon scheme

719187
automake	autotools
a number of projects eventually got rid of the automake abstraction and reverted to writing makefiles manually because you lose control over your makefiles and you might not need all the canned build targets that obfuscate your makefile
now to the alternatives and i strongly suggest an alternative to autotools based on your requirements cmake s most notable achievement is replacing autotools in kde

719403
implements	extends
put all your own new methods in a new interface and create a class which implements this interface too
here it would be you could then let this class extends the class you want but i would consider it better to have a private member of mymap being of class treemap as you then only expose those methods you actually want and not all those that treemap has additionally

721444
hash	salt
if it s two-way it s not really a hash
it s encryption and from the sounds of things this is really more of a salt or cypher not real encryption. a hash is one-way by definition

721444
hash	md5	salt	md5
it s encryption and from the sounds of things this is really more of a salt or cypher not real encryption. a hash is one-way by definition
so rather than something like md5 or sha1 you need to look for something more like pgp

722860
boost	stl
your expression is captures by i m no boost fanatic but their regexp library is nice
not the stl solution you asked for

722984
daemons	systemd
so all of these should display the expected string if you do decide to use asl note that while it accepts strings in utf8 format and passes the correct encoding to the syslog daemons so it will show up properly in the console it encodes the string for visual encoding when displaying to the terminal or logging to a file handle so non-ascii values will be displayed as escaped character sequences
nslog s s format specifier is in the systemd encoding which seems to always be macroman and not unicode so it can only display characters in macroman encoding

723040
.htaccess	httpd.conf
if so you shouldn t be using .htaccess files at all
it s a security risk not to have your server configured properly but all that configuration should be done in the main configuration file like etc apache2 httpd.conf for example

723343
goto	break
in other words if you don t know whether you should use goto for something you shouldn t
i have only ever found two uses for goto to break out of nested loops

724079
folder	directory
your error is in this line your images are in the input folder but this is setting the variable to just the image name so when you try calling imagecreatefromgif and getimagesize it is not finding an image resulting in the black output you are getting
to fix just add the correct directory before the name tested with this change and it works

724115
pop-up	dialog
i do not think an actual pop-up window is a solution you want
you can look into creating a jquery dialog

724269
union	distinct
thus each member of a union is a different view of the same memory
this does not happen with a struct because all of the members are distinct and separate from each other

724407
udp	tcp
the config file actions.txt uses the format action-name corresponding-shell-command # hash denotes a comment webroot nautilus var www ftp filezilla edit_homepage gedit var www homepage htdocs index.php this code doesn t check the originating ip of the incoming udp packets as i have it running on localhost i am firewalled of from anyone else and checking would provide no protection against spoofing anyway
i don t have time to rewrite it to use tcp ip but python is a language that s worth getting to know so if you really want that functionality i ll leave it to you to have a google for python and sock_stream

724938
postgresql	mysql
i didn t take very long to switch from mysql to postgresql back when i first started using postgresql in anger at a previous company
i found it very nice and very refreshing not that mysql was bad compared to mysql which i had used previously

725027
disk	ram
obviously replacing with whitespace so the size of the file as a whole doesn t change is the best choice here otherwise you must stream through the entire file to update in on disk
if this was for a unix environment i would look into using mmap to map a suitable part of the start of the file into ram then edit it in-place and be done

725161
subtract	add
the length of a year is more or less 365.242196 days. so we have to subtract more or less a quarter of a day to make it fit 365.242196 - 0.25 364.992196 by adding 1 day in 4 years but oops now it s too small
lets add a hundreth of a day by not adding that day once in a hundred year - 364.992196 + 0 01 365.002196 oops a bit too big let s add that day anyway one time in about 400 years 365.002196 - 1 400 364.999696 almost there now just play with leapseconds now and then and you re set

725388
profiling	benchmarking
if you re seeing a huge difference try using profiling to see what s taking the time
assuming you re not using a variable-length text encoding such as utf-8 you can use array.array but since you re dealing with the contents of a file mmap should be more efficient here s a quick benchmarking script you ll need to replace dd with something else for non-unix oses output i got on my several-year-old laptop matches my intuition 5+0 records in 5+0 records out 5242880 bytes transferred in 0.710966 secs 7374304 bytes sec do_mmap 1.00865888596 do_array 1.09792494774 do_split 1.20163106918 so mmap is slightly faster but none of the suggested solutions is particularly different

726454
disk	ram
drawbacks include the fact that you ll have to read everything into memory at startup give the user a pretty loading bar and they won t even notice and perhaps have to do a little extra work to ensure everything is reflected to disk when the user thinks it is so that data isn t lost
in this analysis i m making some generic assumptions about android dalvik i don t really know that much about so hopefully it s somewhat accurate remember the g1 has 192mb of ram

726688
inherited	subclassing
the idea behind inherited is that each class defines their methods how they need so you don t need to be inspecting any code
it seems like you re subclassing here just to re-use code and that s not the idea of subclassing

726918
maven	pom.xml
so the config files that maven was just pushing in the archive without injecting them shouldn t even be there in the first place in my case
but here is the new content of my src.xml file that gets included within the pom.xml that still outputs a jar and a zip archive but since the zip contains the snapshot jar everything should be fine now

727624
ssl	https
this will be a parameter after -h in the next command httpcfg.exe set ssl -i 0.0.0.0 801 -h 35c65fd4853f49552471d2226e03dd10b7a11755 then run a service host on and it works perfectly
what i cannot make work is for https to run on self-generated certificate

727794
put	get
there are pros and cons with html.actionlink however it isn t so good if you want to put a link around an image for instance
in this case the syntax would be also with your action in the controller you would ideally be looking to have this go and get the model to pass to a view strongly typed to this model

728038
subclass	inherited
subclassing foo means that you re saying that a subclass bar is always acceptable to use where a foo could be used
in particular it means you inherited not necessarily foo s implementation you can override that or foo may be abstract and give no particular implementation for a method

728093
postgresql	mysql
now on to your real question you are a sql guy albeit one who has not yet had experience with postgresql
this is a completely realistic task for you and a good one since you ll expand your understanding of the varieties of dbmss and gain a perspective on mysql that you can t get from working solely within its sphere

728326
postgresql	informix	teradata	informix	informix	ingres
c style comments are standard in sql 2003 and sql 2008 but not in sql 1999 or before . the following dbms all support c style comments informix postgresql mysql oracle db2 sybase ingres microsoft sql server sqlite 3.7.2 and later teradata and aster that is not every possible dbms but it is more or less every major sql dbms
i ll willingly add notes about any other dbms that does - or does not - support c style comments. the sql 2003 standard documents comment notations thus ibm informix dynamic server ids or informix supports c style comments

728435
post	get
update actually i have to sign off for a while so i ll post my solution so as to not leave you in the lurch
the confusion i referred to before was the fact that you re loading up two addresses into t1 and s0 then adding them together to get another address - this is likely to be well beyond your data area you should really be adding an address and an offset

728716
width	height
unfortunately using nsstring -stringwithfont forwidth linebreakmode doesn t work - which ever wrap mode you choose the text wraps with a width that is less than the current width and the height becomes 0 on any overflow lines
to get a real figure fit the string into a frame that is taller than the one you need - then you ll get a height that is greater than your actual height

728800
textarea	textbox
maybe you can combine textarea and div to do what you want
you can not display html result in textarea textbox control

729016
vim	emacs
the coding form is recognized out of the box by gnu emacs but not vim yes without a universal agreement it s essentially a turf war
check the docs here if a comment in the first or second line of the python script matches the regular expression this comment is processed as an encoding declaration the recommended forms of this expression are which is recognized also by gnu emacs and which is recognized by bram moolenaar s vim. so you can put pretty much anything before the coding part but stick to coding with no prefix if you want to be 100 python-docs-recommendation-compatible

729183
daemons	launchd
find the sql server full-text daemons launchd entry right click and select properties then enable it and start the service
if you believe you installed it but it isn t working you may find that your sql server full-text daemons launchd service is disabled

729256
uilabel	uitextview
update i use sizetofit with uilabel and it works just fine but uitextview is a subclass of uiscrollview so i can understand why sizetofit doesn t produce the desired result
you can still calculate the text height and use setframe but you might want to take advantage of uitextview s scrollbars if the text is too long

730468
strlen	substr
pseudo-code select substr field max 0 strpos field all men are equal - 20 strlen all men are equal + 40 from yourtable where field contains all men are equal with this you re finding the position of the substr only for those records containing the phrase and returning a string 40 chars longer so something like that should work
well i m not familiar with sql server sintax but you could find the occurrence inside the field and return a substr for it

730857
equals	gethashcode
the equals method contains the implementation to perform the actual comparison and return true if the object values are equals or false if they are not
the gethashcode method should return a unique hash value that may be used to uniquely identify identical objects that contain different values

731100
filtering	grouping
i wouldn t restrict yourself to one filtering per assembly
you may well want to grouping assemblies which implement similar functionality - colour contrast together while keeping them separate from very different kinds of filters edge enhancing

731269
post	get
if it is not the post back and binding happens automatically then roughly speaking the value of the controlparameter is retrieved when datasourceview calls select on databind right before onselecting event
the sequence for the gridview and any given control for that matter is as follows page.processrequest page.prerenderrecursiveinternal ... gridview.ensurechildcontrols gridview.createchildcontrols gridview.databind gridview.performselect datasourceview.select comes from either sqldatasource or linqdatasource datasourceview.executeselect for linq linqdatasourceview.getparametervalues whereparameters for sql sqldatasourceview.initializeparameters selectparameters parameters.getvalues parameters.updatevalues this is where values get retrieved using reflection datasourceview.onselecting follows almost immediately ...get data... datasourceview.onselected so for each control in a control hierarchy the framework recursively calls databind which then triggers retrieval of parameters onselecting data retrieval and onselected

732540
joystick	keyboard
if you want to go for polling the joystick just because you are not able to capture the keyboard event i think you need to re-work your strategy
even if your form doesn t have the focus there are ways that you can make sure you know of the keyboard state

732591
prepare	execute
i am not extremely versed in security but here is an explanation that i hope will help you let s say you have a statement like select integer from mydb pretend when you prepare it the statement is compiled down to bytes in our imaginary sql implementation
01 00 00 23 opcode for select prepared bytes number of mydb for your integer now when you execute you will insert the number into the space reserved for your prepared statement

732595
merb	ruby-on-rails
merb is being merged into ruby-on-rails so pretty soon there shouldn t really be any reason to use one over the other
it was originally designed to be a bit lighter weight and more decoupled than ruby-on-rails

732646
merb	ruby-on-rails
i can t speak much for merb but sinatra is highly effective for small or lightweight solutions
if you aren t working with a whole lot of code or don t need a huge website you can code a very effective site with sinatra either as fast or twice as fast as on ruby-on-rails in my own opinion

732870
comparator	comparable
the most general type-safe way to declare your mergesort function above is this enforces that the type t s comparator method can accept an argument of type t
in theory a type could implement comparable but not be comparable to itself like so it is important to have the requirement on the type parameter of comparable

732870
implements	extends
this is important because if you have a class a which implements
and then you have a subclass b which extends a b cannot implement because b already implements inherited from a and a class cannot implement an interface twice

733017
firefox	safari
some of the most end-user visible innovation has come from a new browser war examples would be html5 several vendors canvas apple xmlhttprequest microsoft s outlook web access team input range safari s built-in rss reader and the video element firefox --these came from the proprietary level on up not from the standards tower on down
and these new standards were forged by looking at these past individual implementations firefox copied microsoft largely for xmlhttprequest and so on not by some wide-eyed think tank pondering the future

separation-of-concerns	principles
almost invariably it is far better from a maintenance flexibility and separation-of-concerns point of view not to modify the style of an element directly but to change it s class and let css do the work for you
e.g i want to change to this border+background style so i ll define a class in my css and then i ll modify the element where i need to like so now in practice i d actually wrap that class modifying code in a more general wrapper to protect myself from assigning the same class twice and make removing it again easier but in principles you can see that it would now be trivial to change the effect of highlight at just a single point it allows for normal cascading and it s much easier to detect the element has a highlight class than it is to check if it s got a background colour of foo and a border of bar

733527
vim	textmate
and now i ve had my vim rant i m going to rant some more
textmate doesn t have a built in compiler

733972
postgresql	mysql
the only downside to postgresql is that it shares some of the same dba guru requirements as oracle where as ms sql can often be managed by a regular it person and mysql doesn t need much management besides restoring the old backups everytime it decides to become corrupted and lose your data
as mentioned mysql can provide high read performance assuming simple queries with few or no joins as long as you use the default table type

734018
folder	directory
the workspace itself is just metadata in eclipse that points to your project folder
if the projects are not actually in the workspace directory you aren t actually copying them just references to them

735392
int	chars
of unique hash codes avilable 2 32 4294967296 assuming an 32-bit int is used for hash codes size of chars set 2 26 + 1 53 26 lower as upper case letters in the latin alphabet plus underscore then you must consider that a string of length l or less has a total of 54 l representations
note that the base is 54 rather than 53 because the string can terminate after any chars adding an extra possibility per chars - not that it greatly effects the result

735665
x86	64bit
edit for gcc-only code you can use __i386__ to check for 32-bit x86 chips and i suggest trying __x86_64__ or something similar to check for 64bit x86 chips
note it has come to my attention that the previous answer involving __ia86__ is actually a different chip not a 64bit x86 chip

735697
put	get
according to comments other validated usage no error cs1061 system.web.httpserverutility does not contain a definition error also is important to always put the closing tag
i would use something like server.resolveclienturl common css global.css this will get a proper url for you at all times

735995
maven	pom.xml
you have two version control systems maven s which quite frankly isn t very good and your source code control s which assuming it s cvs or better supports real workflow
here s how we do it we use the maven release plug report s pom.xml during development would have a snapshot version matching what s in core s pom.xml

736062
cpu	processors
on these intel xeon processors two cores on each cpu share their l2 caches i do not remember whether the processors has an l3 cache
i think that the virtual processors 0 and 2 shared one l2 cache 1 and 3 shared one 4 and 6 shared one and 5 and 7 shared one

736836
innodb	myisam
if your application needs to not block when it s writing audit records to the database you should make the audit writing asynchronous and keep your own queue of audit data on disc or in memory so you don t block the main worker thread process innodb may allow concurrent inserts but that doesn t mean they won t be blocked by contention for resources or internal locks for things like index pages
myisam allows one inserter and several readers concurrent inserts under the following circumstances the table has no holes in it there are no threads trying to do an update or delete if you have an append-only table which you recreate each day or create a new partition every day if you use 5.1 partitioning you may get away with this

737382
put	get
if not implements a class extends the authentication interface on which you can put your authentication parameters a user identifier timestamp signature etc. extends a custom springsecurityfilter which ties the above two classes together
for example the filter might get the authenticationmanager and call authenticate using your implementation of authentication as input

737438
getter	setter
the legwork is not more if you implement just the default setter getter inline in the class declaration which i tend to do - more complex setter move to the body though
some notes constness yes the getter should be const

738662
inherited	subclassing
you can then rearrange your classes inherited with less hassle and less danger of introducing obscure bugs
you cannot assume that the parent constructor has been called because you have overridden this in your subclassing

739462
httphandler	httpcontext
once that dependency is removed you can implement the page with an asynchronous httphandler running the parallel operations during between ihttphandler.beginprocessingrequest and ihttphandler.endprocessingrequest
since httpcontext is part of the .net library i would expect that all static functions are threadsafe but any non-static members are not threadsafe when calling against the same instance of the object

739530
for-loop	loops
when using a for-loop you are making a sequence if calls to get a particular item by index
there isn t an outside context such as the enumerator that knows that you re in a loops

739734
implements	extends
alternatively you could implements your own wrapper around that interface more generally you could get the same effect using reflection so you wouldn t need to hardcode youcannotchangeme_iamnotyours in your wrapper class
you could extends the foreign class assuming it s non-final and make that class implements the interface

739794
free	malloc
function in libc and performing accounting on its own you would get this output 6955 invalid free delete delete 6955 at 0x402265c free vg_replace_malloc.c 323 6955 by 0x80483d2 main bla.c 5 6955 address 0x418a02c is 0 bytes after a block of size 4 alloc d 6955 at 0x4022ab8 malloc vg_replace_malloc.c 207 6955 by 0x80483c0 main bla.c 3 6955 6955 error summary 1 errors from 1 contexts suppressed 11 from 1 6955 malloc free in use at exit 4 bytes in 1 blocks. 6955 malloc free 1 allocs 1 frees 4 bytes allocated.
well imo the segfault you get at this point is not because you try to free memory which you have not allocated before the segfault occurs because you try to reference a memory address which the operating system has not granted you permission you to you that is the definition of a segmentation fault

739794
free	malloc
well imo the segfault you get at this point is not because you try to free memory which you have not allocated before the segfault occurs because you try to reference a memory address which the operating system has not granted you permission you to you that is the definition of a segmentation fault
some experiments say you would run your sample code in valgrind you would get this as output 6945 invalid free delete delete 6945 at 0x402265c free vg_replace_malloc.c 323 6945 by 0x80483d5 main bla.c 6 6945 address 0x7 is not stack d malloc d or recently free d 6945 6945 error summary 1 errors from 1 contexts suppressed 11 from 1 6945 malloc free in use at exit 4 bytes in 1 blocks. 6945 malloc free 1 allocs 1 frees 4 bytes allocated. so this is a memory leak pur sang

739794
free	malloc
some experiments say you would run your sample code in valgrind you would get this as output 6945 invalid free delete delete 6945 at 0x402265c free vg_replace_malloc.c 323 6945 by 0x80483d5 main bla.c 6 6945 address 0x7 is not stack d malloc d or recently free d 6945 6945 error summary 1 errors from 1 contexts suppressed 11 from 1 6945 malloc free in use at exit 4 bytes in 1 blocks. 6945 malloc free 1 allocs 1 frees 4 bytes allocated. so this is a memory leak pur sang
now suppose you would change the code so the pointer you try to free is near the pointer you allocated so the operating system still know you have access to it operating system don t grant memory access on byte boundaries

739895
pull	push
this allows me to link to another repository git svn etc but not save the source to your repository you just use git submodule to pull it
when you push your main repo it doesn t include the submodules

740641
for-loop	loops
using dollar signs in strings where what follows isn t a valid expression more than one initializer in a for-loop more than one increment in a for-loop breaking up some expressions using newlines hint use a backslash line-continuation in groovy ending switch with a case that has no body having a default in a switch with no body applies in both cases where default is at the end or somewhere in the middle annotations with lists hint use groovy list-literal syntax instead native method declaration public native int nativemethod
class per enum in 1.6 valid in later groovy versions do loops equality while technically is valid groovy and java it s semantically different

740950
postgresql	mysql
sqlite just does not scale anywhere near as far as apache etc with mysql postgresql
in some cases the way that sqlite handles data types or rather glosses over data types can lead to issues with a django app that is subsequently deployed with mysql postgres.

741350
vmware	virtualbox
not as powerful as vmware though
if you don t have the cash for vmware if you do it s the best money can buy try virtualbox

741660
rss	feed
similarly feed is commonly used for rss feed but the underlying transport protocol is still http
so itms and feed are not url schemes in a strict sense

741772
outputstream	inputstream
just as you can t store a string object in a double or a double in a string not without converting it you can t send data from one type of outputstream in this case a printstream to a different type of inputstream
your server s outputstream is a printstream but your client s inputstream is a datainputstream

743349
disk	ram
if it s similar to what you have with vmware + ram disk it would be much easier for you to maintain
ram disk is a great idea in principle but you might not gain as much as you think

743656
accessor	properties
however you can t just synthesize this properties you would have to write your own accessor because the compiler has no idea where you want to get this value from
from a class design point of view i m not sure that the idea of a private properties makes sense i personally think of properties as something that are exposed publically by a class

743940
try-catch	exception-handling
use finally that way you can use try-catch and still clean up your unmanaged memory
and while it is true that you should avoid try-catches when they aren t necessary check instead of letting x throw nullreferenceexception you will find that especially on web applications there are tons of times were try-catch statements are absolutely required because sometimes you will lose connections or the user will do the wrong thing and exception-handling will be thrown whether you like it or not

744039
put	get
and when you re picking side projects pick something that you can put on your resume
things that are easy to get are not valuable

744415
post	get
so as dmitry suggests your controller action for the form post needs to look at the customer they are trying to edit a and verify that the logged in user is actually allowed to edit that customer
you probably also want to do a similar check in the controller action that generates the edit form in the first place and don t even let them get to the form if they are not allowed to edit the requested customer

744502
typedef	struct
here s a good tutorial on typedef for struct
the compiler does not calculate type equivalence between struct that may have the same structure so as far as it is concerned the second struct has nothing to do with the first one

744701
udp	tcp
reliable udp is not the same as just using tcp
there are a number of differences but the most predominant is that you are guaranteed to always receive an entire udp message or not receive it at all

744701
udp	tcp
there are a number of differences but the most predominant is that you are guaranteed to always receive an entire udp message or not receive it at all
whereas it is not only possible but very common to receive partial tcp messages

745401
versioning	upgrade
i favour appending a versioning identifier to interface and coclass names whenever i want a clear upgrade path and anticpate any changes
for plain binary dll api s appending versioning numbers is an idea but not one i ve ever seeen well executed and quite terribly executed in those old 16 bit vb runtime dll s

745753
put	get
put up a please wait div while the function is performing
that way the user knows that the browser isn t just locked up and they know when they can get back to work

745927
daemon	cron
so you will have 5 lines in your crontab 0 0 6 12 18 command 12 1 7 13 19 command 24 2 8 14 20 command 36 3 9 15 21 command 48 4 10 16 22 command the other option of course is to create a wrapper daemon or shell script that executes and sleeps for the desired time until stopped
since cron runs jobs time-based not interval-based there s no blindingly simple way to do it

745963
innodb	myisam
that said a very hot table lots and lots of select s will benefit from being migrated to innodb because myisam does not support concurrent read
myisam almost always survives a database crash with nothing more than a repair table needed

745963
innodb	myisam
innodb is not always so lucky
the myisam can also be backed-up out from under the database

745963
versioning	upgrade
versioning 5 is not so forgiving
so we took the opportunity to scour the app and upgrade all the join s to explicit join s

746203
16-bit	64bit
note all algorithms below are in c but should be portable to your language of choice just don t look at me when they re not as fast options low memory 32-bit int 32-bit machine from here from the famous bit twiddling hacks page fastest lookup table you can extend this idea to 64bit int s or trade off memory for speed assuming your l1 data cache is large enough and reverse 16-bit at a time with a 64k-entry lookup table
others simple faster 32-bit processor faster 64bit processor if you want to do this on a 32-bit int just reverse the bits in each byte and reverse the order of the bytes

746318
put	get
not sure how your form and data source is setup but you would do something like this on one of the form events edit in your fishinfo query you must give the an alias - you can t have two fields with the same name - call it fish_animal_id then in the form_beforeupdate event put this
yes - when you enter data on child records dogs and cats access will automatically fill in the parent id animal_id since there is no data entry for the fish record it does not get created

746496
stdout	stderr
if you don t provide a handle stdout is the default of course - unless you ve asked perl to use a different default handle...
if not write to the one you re not piping print stderr this goes to standard error

746606
udp	tcp
udp is unreliable more or less by definition - ipso facto
you aren t going to get anywhere making the os-side implementation of the protocol more reliable. a great many applications that use udp use it because they need the low-overhead low-latency nature of it much more than they need the precise reliability of tcp

746606
voip	sip
think about sip in voip telephony for example
tcp s latent three-way handshake and very gradual congestion control aren t really acceptable for decent call setup time or qos but some way of acknowledging messages is definitely needed that s what provisional responses are for in sip terminology

746664
datarow	dataview
i expect that for that to work you d need to use a datarowview not a datarow
try getting this from the dataview rather than the datatable

746955
dictionary	map
it reduced me from a dictionary of 200 000 keys to only 2 000 keys simply during the input pass
this at the very least reduces memory overhead and that s sure to map to a speed increase somewhere as memory isn t infinitely fast

746999
png	tga
i wouldn t want to attempt tiff png gif or jpg in fortran without the help of external libraries however
you might find that one of the family of netpbm formats is easier to write and they would be easily converted to tga or any other format you might need for display or further processing with simple commands

747420
hash	salt
if the salt and the password are combined within a hash it would greatly reduce the use of offline attacks and you wouldn t need to take any special precaution of protecting it
the point would be that you would salt the password in the same way when you are comparing it while logging a user in and while storing the password

747828
int	chars
it is not intrinsically an int
it is just an identifier for something and it could just as well have been a series of four chars

748341
children	parent
stop when all nodes have been added to the tree or the number of remaining nodes remains the same from one iteration to the next - this means the remaining nodes are not children of your root node
alternatively if your database supports recursive sql queries you can use that and it will only select the nodes that are children of your parent node

748568
daemons	systemd
the socket file should be created automatically when the mysql daemons starts
if it isn t found most likely the directory which is supposed to contain it doesn t exist or some other file systemd problem is preventing the socket from being created

749109
post	get
check my blog post writing java hello world for google app engine for details
you get this error if java the runtime is not enabled

749458
implements	extends
the function form.getinputbyname is declared final as shown in the javadoc here the object htmlinput is abstract thus on runtime time it is always implements by an object that is extends htmlinput
due to the nature of final methods it is never overridden so there is no callstack the error comes beceause the compiler sees it as just htmlinput and not an implements htmlinput. ref he thinks there will be no callstack assigning it to a new htmlinput object correctly invokes the callstack and thus makes the code viable again

749614
versioning	upgrade
if a direct upgrade to .net 2.0 or greater is not an option i would use a development vm with the older vs versioning to maintain the .net 1.1 projects
microsoft does not support visual studio 2003 on vista anymore no matter whether 32bit or 64bit versioning

749957
many-to-many	one-to-many
you ll see that a many-to-many relation can in fact also model one-to-many and one-to-one
ask yourself why given that all relations are not many-to-many

750068
realloc	malloc	free	realloc
also these two calls are equivalent to each other but not to free realloc null size malloc size
realloc ptr 0

750075
free	malloc
if the requested size is zero then you get back whatever malloc 0 might return which is often usually a null pointer but might be a non-null pointer that can also be returned to free but which cannot legitimately be dereferenced
actually the last of those is equivalent to a call to free

750075
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc
if ptr is a null pointer the realloc function behaves like the malloc function for the specified size
otherwise if ptr does not match a pointer earlier returned by the calloc malloc or realloc function or if the space has been deallocated by a call to the free or realloc function the behavior is undefined

750152
put	get
these are just markup languages and chances are they ll barely be glanced at if you put them on a resume
flash not so much and java are more impressive but you might want to look into the following additional topics technologies to really spice up that resume get comfortable with oo object-oriented principles inheritance polymorphism abstract vs concrete classes encapsulation etc. java is a great open-source beginner programming language

750481
implements	extends
for example a datatable implements ilistsource returning defaultview when requested
tweaks typedescriptionprovider still replaces metadata not extends can also be added be typedescriptor.addprovider can be applied per-type as well as per-instance making it possible to apply to lists without having to implement itypedlist typeconverter for propertygrid this is also the mechanism used to obtain metadata

750763
int	chars
create table id int not null primary key abbv chars 4 name varchar 64
but it s not a key it doesn t hash like a integer key it takes up four chars compares and a look for the null terminator to compare it to edtr as opposed to one subtraction to compare two integers

750846
ssl	https
have a look at the jetty ssl socket connector instead of the often use socket connector. its not that difficult
just add the sslsocketconnector to your server after configuring it and after this your application should respond to https requests

751173
int	chars
in the case of i we can cast from void to int without a problem although again using placement new would improve type checking
another point he makes is about alignment requirements memory returned by new chars ... will not necessarily meet the alignment requirements of a struct intlist

751387
post	get
you need to use .post in that call datatobesent could be anything you want although if are sending the contents of a an html form you can use the serialize method to create the data for the post from your form
the .getjson method does an http get and not post

751449
factors	mean
it takes roughly 10 bisection steps to cut the interval length by a factors of 1024 2 10 but only 20 steps will cut the interval by a factors of 2 20
log complexity does not always mean an algorithm is fast on all problems

751550
interbase	firebird
the interbase dbx driver doesn t support firebird 2.1 you ll have problems with certain field types - blobs for example
there are rumors that d2010 which must enter in beta soon will support firebird

752242
client-side	server-side
you should never rely on client-side features
the feature you re working on is usually implemented storing the session id client-side and the real user info server-side its id whether he s logged in or not his personal info etc

752754
vb.net	vb6
edit ant has correctly pointed out that on error goto -1 is a vb.net statement and isn t valid in vb6
edit arvo and onenerd have written answers with some interesting discussion of emulating finally teardown blocks in vb6 error handling

753945
hash	salt
also think about using salt hash for the passwords instead of just storing it plaintext if that s not the case already
added as mehrdad correctly comments ...even in case of salt hash it s still vulnerable to replay attacks.

754122
voip	rtp
it s sepcifically designed for carrying real-time data such as voip and video
edit i ve looked around quite a few times in the past for a .net rtp library and apart from wrappers for non .net libraries or half completed ones i did not have much success

755716
versioning	upgrade
you can then use diff to see changes between versioning not to mention have comments explaining your changes
this will also make you virtually immune to mysql upgrade

756817
factors	mean
various factors in the internal operating system and tcp stack may cause the application to get some bytes in one read call and some in the next
yes the tcp stack has to re-assemble the packet before sending it up but that doesn t mean your app is going to get it all in one shot it is likely will get it in one read but it s not guaranteed to get it in one read

756894
profiling	debugging
jvm ti supports the full breadth of tools that need access to jvm state including but not limited to profiling debugging monitoring thread analysis and coverage analysis tools
note jvm ti replaces the java virtual machine profiler interface jvmpi and the java virtual machine debugging interface jvmdi

757141
put	get
if not then you could just put all your repetitive queries in script files including only those needed in each request
however concatenating and that kind of stuff is hard to get rid of

758037
superclass	subclassing
it s all about the contract of superclass and about subclassing implementing this contract
if your superclass has such method then not supporting this method is still ok with the contract

758503
inherited	subclassing
it looks to me like he she isn t asking about what inherited is
he she is asking about subclassing implementing functionality that is not a natural fit for a base class and the resulting mess that can ensue

759970
cpython	ironpython
note that the above is only true for cpython
jython and ironpython uses the jvm clr gc mechanism and does not use refcounting at all i believe

761223
inherited	properties
when you inherited from this pure abstract class you are defining a hierarchy - inherited if you implement the interface you are not and you can implement as many interfaces as you want but you can only inherited from one class
2 you can define a properties in an interface so the class that implements that interface must have that properties

761929
accessor	properties
the only time to not use your accessor methods synthesized or otherwise is in init and dealloc since you would be talking to a half- init ed or - dealloc ked object
once you re using your own accessor methods to mutate the array and thereby getting the free kvo notifications things should just work the view when mutating its properties will automatically notify the array controller which mutates its content properties which notifies your controller

762308
apache	mod-jk
the ajp protocol is much more efficient compared to using http proxy requests and as a benefit jboss will see the request as coming from the original client and not apache
if you have the capability to do so i would recommend using either mod-jk or mod-proxy-ajp to pass requests from apache to jboss

763534
for-loop	loops
as posted your hover call isn t within your for-loop so it s only running for i 21
edit i m going to expand this and actually propose a different method first loops through all your area maps and add some information to them using jquery s data call

763841
inline	inlining
a big function that is called often probably shouldn t be inline because you end up copying a lot of code resulting in a larger executable and more instruction cache misses
inlining is always a tradeoff and often the compiler is better at weighing all the factors than you

764063
post	get
inputs without names are not sent back with the form post
give the inputs a name as well as an id and you will be able to get the values from request.form

764160
lang	http-equiv
dive into accessibility s identifying your language page recommends adding as much as possible to handle as many screen readers as you can depending on your doctype if you re using any variant of html 4 change your tag to this use your own language code if not english if you re using any variant of xhtml 1.0 change your tag to this use your language code in both places if you re using xhtml 1.1 change your tag to this again insert your own language code the same article also references iso 639.2 to determine what the value of xml lang should be although the xml specification references a separate document rfc4646 best current practice - tags for identifying languages which seems to indicate your value of en-gb is valid
google s web authoring statistics 2005 have the following to say about it next is the content-language value used on the http-equiv attribute . almost as many people use this as specify the lang attribute on the html element

764215
hash	md5
an md5 hash is a form of validation
if a single bit in the file is different the provided hash will not match the one generated from the file you downloaded

764349
.htaccess	httpd.conf
to answer the basic question of how to modify sys.path from .htaccess you can use the pythonpath directive in .htaccess
according to ticket #2255 for django you need admin access to httpd.conf in order to use django with mod_python and this is not going to change so you may be dead in the water

765289
nss	gnutls
also there is mozilla s nss
gnutls please note that it is mainly lgpl not gpl so you can link to it

765722
g++	gcc
g++ gives me the warning warning converting of negative value -0x00000000a to unsigned int without any -w directives
gcc you must use gcc main.c -wconversion which will give the warning warning negative integer implicitly converted to unsigned type note that -wall will not enable this warning

766465
inherited	subclassing
in c# you can do a form of multiple inherited by including instances of each parent object within the child
the main con is that if two classes have a method with the same name the new subclassing doesn t know which one to call

766614
listview	gridview
i ended up retrieving the key value for the updated item from the datakeys collection using the editindex of the listview
the listviewupdatedeventargs object that s passed in to the itemupdated event handler for the listview does not have a keys collection like the gridviewupdatedeventargs object passed into the rowupdated event handler for a gridview

766633
for-loop	loops
but a for-loop probably isn t what you want
when you use two for loops your inner loops keeps going back to the start every time the outer loops loops

766664
put	get
then have an aspect that looks for the annotation and put an around on it so that any reading which is when the parameter is null or writing parameter isn t null is done then it will take the appropriate action
this would be pretty easy to write but then you have to get buy-in for aop which may be challenging

767015
zlib	libpng
it depends on zlib which you probably already have shared libraries for but if not you ll have to get that too
here s a guide to compiling libpng on mac os x

767651
versioning	upgrade
it turns out it was added in versioning 1.3
jquery implements it as peter suggests having put a lot of faith in jquery already especially their techniques for cross-browser compatibility i will either upgrade to versioning 1.3 and use their function providing that upgrading doesn t cause too many problems or use this suggested method directly in my code

767975
put	get
if i were to take over your code i think the important thing is probably following a convention either always or never put validation in both places
at least that way i wouldn t get confused

769116
auto-generate	edmx
for me that was a viable solution to reducing the clutter from auto-generate code and configuration and increasing my own control over the product
the ultimate solution even after recreating the database on two other machines as well as the edmx and other sundries was to not use the first edition of entity framework

769129
stdout	stderr
redirects stderr to stdout at the end makes the command run in background
to make it complete it should be without redirecting stdout to a file or to dev null running in background from system doesn t make much sense as your command would get killed as soon as php terminates reaching time limit

769575
google-chrome	firefox
also i seem to recall having read that google s google-chrome browser uses a similar technique to do automated regression testing
using firefox it should be possible to implement much of it with its powerful support for addons and enhancements however that wouldn t really mean to run headless but really be a real scripted browser

int	double
if there is no suffix and it is an integral type 5623 it is assumed to be an int
if it is not an integral type 3.14159 it is assumed to be a double

770885
cdr	cons
cdr x ... both lists are affected
remember that each variable doesn t hold a list they hold just a cons cell

770923
hash	md5
but once broken a hash algorithm only gets worse never better
if you care at all about security it would be better to choose an unbroken hash algorithm such as one of the sha-2 family sha-1 has also been weakened though not broken as badly as md5 is

770923
hash	md5
if you care at all about security it would be better to choose an unbroken hash algorithm such as one of the sha-2 family sha-1 has also been weakened though not broken as badly as md5 is
edit the technique used in the link that i provided you involved being able to choose two arbitrary message prefixes and a common suffix from which it could generate for each prefix a block of data that could be inserted between that prefix and the common suffix to produce a message with the same md5 sum as the message constructed from the other prefix

770923
hash	md5
while the current attack against md5 may not work against the protocol you describe md5 has been severely compromised and a hash will only ever get weaker never stronger
it would probably be easier to start with something that is currently stronger than md5 to reduce your chances of having to deal with md5 being broken further

771662
expression-blend	silverlight
learning xaml will be very beneficial to you although is not absolutely required to use expression-blend
have a look at jesse liberty s silverlight video tutorial series which includes a couple of videos on expression-blend

772170
postgresql	mysql
i d strongly suggest getting your mysql to as strict an ansi compliance as possible before converting to postgresql then checking for any warnings when you run your applications
before converting set your mysql to ansi-strictness by starting the server with --transaction-isolation serializable --sql-mode ansi make sure you re not using myisam tables

772170
postgresql	mysql
postgresql gives you a choice of languages for these but you have to install the languages
it s not as user friendly as mysql

772170
postgresql	mysql
in particular postgresql uses || to mean string catenation
basically postgresql is pretty strictly ansi mysql isn t

772196
postgresql	mysql
case sensitive text lack of insert ignore and replace explicit casting needed almost everywhere no backticks load data infile copy is close but not close enough change autoincrement to serial although bad form in mysql in postgresql an inner join without an on clause can t happen use cross join or the like can be crazy slow databases are encoded with character sets not tables you can have multiple databases with multiple schemas mysql really has just one database and multiple schema partitioning is different mysql interval vs
postgresql interval for time intervals implicit column renaming postgresql requires as cannot update multiple tables at the same time in postgresql postgresql functions are powerful

772304
folder	directory
or just call directory.delete folder true of course
if the directory isn t empty you ll need to go in enumerate all the files and delete those first

772593
icommand	ivalueconverter
you either need to modify your myhyperlink class so that viewmodelcommand is also an icommand or write an ivalueconverter that will find the correct icommand implementation given the command name in your view model
i think that your code above doesn t work because hyperlink.command is of type icommand not string

772667
pull	push
if you just want to learn it start with a simple ajax pull app then try to program one using ajax and push
and yes most probably you ll need a database tough i successfully implemented a very simple ajax pull solution that works with text files for fun but i certainly wouldn t use it in production

772674
superclass	subclassing
they are inherited from the superclass and since they are not declared private they are visible to the subclassing
it s generally bad practice to refer directly to a superclass s fields and unless there is good reason they should declared private

773152
udp	tcp
when you receive a udp packet maybe you should spawn a new thread to take care of dealing with the message received
udp connections are not like tcp connections

773152
udp	tcp
udp connections are not like tcp connections
they do not remain active and such is the design of udp

773560
typedef	struct
to make the typedef declaration correct you have to specify a name for the whole type as if you were declaring a variable of that type like so
i m not sure whether this is also a problem in your actual code but is not a complete typedef declaration in c as it does not give a name to the type only to the struct struct tags are not in the same namespace as type names in standard c

773931
implements	extends
there isn t one as far as i know and set by its mathematical nature is meant to be unordered or at least implementationally meant not to guarantee order - in fact its usually implements as a hash table so it does mess up order
however it s not hard to either extends array directly or subclass it to do this

774113
invalidoperationexception	argumentexception	invalidoperationexception	argumentnullexception
so in the later case an invalidoperationexception is a reasonable choice
depending on the actual value and what exception fits best argumentexception something is wrong with the value argumentnullexception the argument is null while this is not allowed argumentoutofrangeexception the argument has a value outside of the valid range if this is not precise enough just derive your own exception class from argumentexception

774613
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
html does not support a dropdownlistfor with checkbox
you can have a dropdownlistfor or a checkbox list

774698
udp	tcp
the udp case is simpler and quite different since udp sockets are not necessarily connected
if you are really interested then i would advise you to read tcp ip illustrated volume 2

775035
temp	tmp
in principle you just need a temp branch to use as a save area that you push to the hub repo--- i think you already know that
i don t believe so although you could experiment with pushing your local head ref to oddly-named refs on the other end git push central refs heads master refs remotes tmp master this would try to create refs remotes tmp master which is a valid refname but not what is usually considered a branch

775138
post	get
there doesn t seem to be a lot of info out there but this blog post does indicate how you can load .txt files through code using xna
hopefully this can help you get the file into memory from there it should be straightforward to parse it in any way you like

775169
implements	extends
you can create a completely custom class to function as the renderer given it implements certain required interfaces or in most cases you extends an existing component
since the default renderer for adg cells doesn t support background colors you have to create or extends a component that does and use that as the renderer

775347
put	get
merging and copying with history saves repository storage at least until rep-sharing is put in
the following statement is not true files that were added to a branch and then changed on the branch don t get added when doing a merge across number of revisions that would imply merging is totally broken

775646
accessor	properties
ultimately i think you just need to get over whatever hangup you have about using get and set for things that aren t properties accessor
properties getters and setters don t have names starting with get and set because it s some convention reserved for naming getters and setters

775693
cpu	processors
in other words if you do on cpu 2 you might see location b modified before location a is
also if you re writing a value that s larger than the native word size 32 bits on an x32 processors the writes are not atomic - so the high 32 bits of a 64 bit write will hit the bus at a different time from the low 32 bits of the write

775719
queue	fifo
consumer producers usually need queue for synchronization anyway
i agree that it might work - so it might be safe but not sane. the main question is if this low-level sharing is really needed - i am not an expert on linux but i would consider to use for instance a fifo queue for the master shared memory segment so that the os does the locking work for you

776084
children	parent
settop sets the attached property on a child control of the canvas so doing this parent2.settop root 100 sets the canvas.top property of root to be 100 not parent2 so will hence move all of the children of root too
what you should be doing is root.settop parent 0 which will set the canvas.top property of parent to be 0

776133
versioning	upgrade
of course if you don t mind breaking existing clients it might be more convenient to go with the latest versioning
if that s not an option then you have to go with the oldest versioning otherwise if you upgrade and don t maintain backwards compatability you ll break existing clients

776141
int	chars	int	double
you can do this with backticks create table do.not.do.this col int
or using double quotes if you set the following option not strictly true - you have to quote any chars that s not alphanumeric or _ or but

776523
16-bit	64bit
gcc and icc not clang also provides __rolb __rorb for 8-bit rotate left right __rolw __rorw 16-bit __rold __rord 32-bit __rolq __rorq 64bit only defined for 64bit targets
for narrow rotates the implementation uses __builtin_ia32_rolhi or ...qi but the 32 and 64bit rotates are defined using shift or with no protection against ub because the code in ia32intrin.h only has to work on gcc for x86

777656
rss	feed
if it does then the problem is there if it doesn t put half the rss entries back in the file and repeat
your problem could lie with unicode characters i see some o s with two dots above them in the feed the code you have doesn t respect cdata sections correctly to find out which is the case save the feed file to your local disk and load it via your code to make sure the error happens

778224
textmate	aptana	textmate	radrails
plus a lot of developers are using textmate for rails and therefore creating scripts and features that you can import and use
i m using aptana with radrails when i m on windows but it s not as good

778759
client-side	server-side
server-side validation is required simply because client-side validation can be disabled
client-side validation isn t required but it makes your application more responsive during error handling as you no longer need to do a form submit to the server and wait for the resulting page to come back

778797
stdout	stderr
the following should work just as well without deadlocking and it ll be faster too since we can begin processing the program s stdout immediately rather than waiting for the program to finish
with any of these you can change file descriptors before the call or you can use bourne shell file-descriptor redirection you can also use file-descriptor redirection to make stderr a duplicate of stdout note that you cannot simply open stderr to be a dup of stdout in your perl program and avoid calling the shell to do the redirection

778797
stdout	stderr
with any of these you can change file descriptors before the call or you can use bourne shell file-descriptor redirection you can also use file-descriptor redirection to make stderr a duplicate of stdout note that you cannot simply open stderr to be a dup of stdout in your perl program and avoid calling the shell to do the redirection
this doesn t work this fails because the open makes stderr go to where stdout was going at the time of the open

778797
stdout	stderr
this doesn t work this fails because the open makes stderr go to where stdout was going at the time of the open
the backticks then make stdout go to a string but don t change stderr which still goes to the old stdout

779059
multicastdelegate	delegation
however only the system and compilers can derive explicitly from the delegation class or from the multicastdelegate class
it is also not permissible to derive a new type from a delegation type

779293
apache	nginx
this has performance ram usage very close to fastcgi and mod_wsgi recently became the officially recommended way of hosting django see in general i would suggest using apache mod_wsgi if possible it is a stable and flexible combination
be sure that you re not prematurely optimizing by using nginx where apache + mod_wsgi would do just fine

779293
apache	nginx
be sure that you re not prematurely optimizing by using nginx where apache + mod_wsgi would do just fine
for a performance overview of mod_wsgi in daemon mode see nginx is awesome but for a django solution nginx is imho a better fit as a load balancer for many apache instances or a separate server for static files

779895
postgresql	mysql
quick postgresql optimization query optimizing short read explains a lot of things well and works a real example which is nice for those of us that learn better that way
after seeing the wiki link to postgresql figured i d edit this post with links for mysql oracle docs not really an optimization guides specifically but both are good resources especially the mysql one

780175
atomic	interlocked
interlocked instructions provide atomic and inter-processor synchronization
both writes and reads must be synchronized so yes you should be using interlocked instructions to read a value that is shared between threads and not protected by a lock

780251
udp	tcp
unlike tcp this does not mean that the peer closed the connection because with udp there is no connection
actually you can send a udp datagram of 0 bytes length

780404
post	get
if you want to get all post at once or some subset with a where the following will surprisingly work
it assumes that comments have a monotonically increasing id as a datetime is not guaranteed to be unique but allows for comment ids to be interleaved among post

780538
versioning	upgrade
i m really not sure why it doesn t work but you could try upgrading jquery to versioning 1.3
if you ve already upgrade to 1.3 then your script will be failing because the before the attribute name was deprecated in jquery 1.2

781040
button	checkbox
therefore for important fields it may be a better idea to use radio button so that the user does not accidentally miss it
i agree that checkbox have more of an implicit true false meaning another point is that for radio button you can force the user to make an active choice by having neither option selected

782164
spaces	delimiter
consider the string the quick brown fox additional spaces if it s not obvious
using a delimiter of a single whitespace character will give a word count of six not four

782283
put	get
dr of the link timeboxing means allocate a time slice then work cutting out what would put you behind
it is meant to get rid of the motivation for procrastination by not making the tedious task take up more time than it is worth

782449
opera	firefox
illustration of one solution this is one solution to the problem tested in opera firefox and internet explorer 7
table of contents illustration of problem illustration of one solution illustration of problem copy the following html into your browsers at least firefox and internet explorer 7 but you should try opera too notice that the td element does not hide the overflowing content

782533
post	get
for most webapps a new thread is spawned for each new request and if you want to share data between two requests you normally - use the get post parameters to pass the data - use the session to share data to answer your question i m pretty sure the spring container does not spawn threads for most components
can i store something in the threadlocal and get it in another bean

782874
qtkit	quicktime
it doesn t look like their is an easy way to do this with qtkit as of now
using only qtkit you have a couple of options what you could do is simple stream the data from your camera into a quicktime movies using qtcompressionoptionslosslessanimationvideo and then convert the file to h.264 at the resolution you want using the qtmovie class

783526
vb.net	vb6
it s not like it s terrifically hard to translate c# code to vb.net especially if you re not copy-pasting
i m sure most of the time the reason companies go forward with vb.net is exactly as you mentioned - large amounts of vb6 in the organization both in terms of codebase and developers

783533
vb.net	vb6
-p i have nothing against vb.net - i simply feel that c# allows me to do my job more elegantly
re the books etc - i wonder if there isn t a contingent of ex-vb6 developers who are still writing vb6 in vs2008

783534
vb.net	vb6
we re not standardized on vb.net and i often have to go back and forth between vb.net adn c#
i m unusual in that i come from a c c++ background know c# but actually prefer vb.net i severely dislike vb6 vbscript

783534
vb.net	vb6	vbscript	vb6
i m unusual in that i come from a c c++ background know c# but actually prefer vb.net i severely dislike vb6 vbscript
i say all this because it s important to remember the vb6 is not vb.net

783534
vb.net	vb6
i really hated vb6 but i fell in love with vb.net almost instantly
however vb.net did inherit some things from vb6 and not just a syntax style

783581
vb.net	vb6
finally the people who are crap are not crap because they are vb.net programmers that s just vb.net is easy to code and it s not a bad thing
also it s been said that most of these people coming from classic asp and vb6 background which are again really low entrance threshold languages

784538
subtraction	addition	division	addition	addition	multiplication
it s a basic arithmetic operation - like addition subtraction multiplication division except it s not usually taught in elementary school
it combines two integers bit by bit - like addition but we don t care about the carry-overs

784578
int	chars
if cin reads an invalid number it will go into a failed state which can be checked with if cin.fail however it is easier to read the input as a string and then convert the input to an int or floating point number afterwards
isdigit c should be called on a chars not an an int

785072
sctp	tcp
in my experience i would not expect all systems to have sctp installed on them and i would expect them not to if it were windows
if you include sctp in the application itself then that will more than double the number of messages being passed into an out of the kernel which will impact performance when compared with using the pre installed tcp

786007
int	chars
that will convert a single hex chars upper or lowercase independent into an int
you should be aware that this doesn t perform any validation against the chars - for example if the chars was a then you would get 91 - 48 49

786074
post	get	put	get
this allows user agents to represent other methods such as post put and delete in a special way so that the user is made aware of the fact that a possibly unsafe action is being requested
naturally it is not possible to ensure that the server does not generate side-effects as a result of performing a get request

786973
post	get	put	get
using post isn t a cure for such things as you can put together a form post in javascript pretty easily but it s a good start
in addition to spiders and requests having to be idempotent there s also a security issue with get requests

787394
vbscript	jscript
vbscript has that ability as a global function but other windows script host languages might not
for instance jscript does not have a global createobject function i believe it does however have a syntax so you do not need to use wscript.createobject in jscript either

787469
snmp	mib
all of the request reply stuff is done using snmp messages
if your company does not have a specially designed assigned oid for the server software you ll need to look into the standard mib definitions to determine which oid s are appropriate

787579
udp	tcp
i haven t seen this one per se but i have seen similar problems with large udp datagrams causing ip fragmentation which lead to congestion and ultimately dropped ethernet frames
since this is tcp ip i wouldn t expect ip fragmentation to be a large issue since it is a stream-based protocol

787841
post	get
there are several ways to reduce the risk which you should test for - get requests should not have side-effects - all actions should be done using post requests only
it s more difficult for an attacker to generate a post request originating from the user

787876
int	chars
so answer column in your table has to be int decimal etc. not chars 1
edit min and max work for chars data type

787939
int	double
you might argue that since the second operand is long int that should be the preferred conversion target but that s not the way things work. so some advice first don t supply so many implicit conversions
since the class can only hold long double and string those are the only three conversions i d supply

788008
mbunit	mstest	nunit	mstest
not nunit mbunit xunit.net etc
mstest

788233
nullreferenceexception	argumentexception
while it may seem on the surface to make sense to throw a nullreferenceexception on an extension method it does not make sense to do so for a static method
it s not possible to determine the calling convention in the method and thus argumentexception is the better choice

788445
implements	extends
when generic are compiled you end up with object in the above example as the implements type
as int and byte etc do not extends object you cannot use them inter-changeably even if the code involved would be identical again generics are not templates the only class int and object share is object

788462
put	get
one option is to put a shipment_count on order where it will be automatically updated with the number of shipments you attach to it
then you just alternatively you can get your hands dirty with some sql test that prior to using it as sql isn t exactly my bag but i think it s close to right

789318
onclick	onchange
another issue to consider is that the onclick event isn t supported for option elements atleast not in ie though firefox supports it fine
you should instead handle the onchange client side event

789442
folder	directory
but you don t know how to build when the library is not in the same folder
assuming your library has precompiled .lib and .h files move the library source code to a separate directory menubar project menu properties will open a dialog box for all the project properties there will be a list on the left

789595
children	parent
mouseenabled means that that particular movie clip can t get mouse events but doesn t affect the movie clip s children such as the textfield inside it
mousechildren means it s children don t register mouse events they just dispatch from the parent

789596
vim	emacs
check what you have as term echo term and check the vim docs for how to fix the backspace issue
what you re seeing is that the terminal setting term in your shell vim session doesn t match what the emacs terminal is doing

789596
vim	emacs
what you re seeing is that the terminal setting term in your shell vim session doesn t match what the emacs terminal is doing
mine works fine with the exception that the delete key is mapped to del 0x127 while vim wants h 0x8

789896
mbunit	nunit
however in t type in ienumerable is more complex than string or valuetype in mbunit assertnoteqaual a b will not fail
i didn t look at nunit source code to see how nunit guys coded arenotequal. however i can tell you how it s done for mbunit that has the same behavior

790079
keydown	keyup
but in addition to this the actual sequence of characters that appears changes as the input is typed t t と to とう tou とうk touk とうky touky とうきょ toukyo とうきょう toukyou if memory serves when i implemented this in webkit it was necessary to make the keycode be 229 on keydown for all keys typed in an ime for compat with ie -- but i cannot recall what the behaviour of keyup is
it s also worth noting that in some imes you won t necessarily receive keydowns keypress or keyup

790099
keydown	keyup
but in addition to this the actual sequence of characters that appears changes as the input is typed t t と to とう tou とうk touk とうky touky とうきょ toukyo とうきょう toukyou if memory serves when i implemented this in webkit it was necessary to make the keycode be 229 on keydown for all keys typed in an ime for compat with ie -- but i cannot recall what the behaviour of keyup is
it s also worth noting that in some imes you won t necessarily receive keydowns keypress or keyup

790216
bash	subshell
just to expand on this a bit bash has fairly complicated rules for dealing with metacharacters in quotes
in general almost nothing is interpreted in single-quotes shell substitution is done inside double quotes but file metacharacters aren t expanded everything inside backquotes is passed to the subshell which interprets them

790303
hide	show
instead i would use a class and css to hide them and add to the page s style so the browser is aware that those will not appear when the page first renders
then adding the will show the appropriate

790473
rar	zip
it s in public domain it s fast on decompression it has fully managed implementation it s much better compressing than zip rar it has very small footprint it can work as a stream
i will be second to recommend lzma sdk but it s not zip

790545
google-chrome	firefox	webkit	gecko
google-chrome uses a fork of webkit if you didn t know which is also used by safari
here s a few questions that are of the same vein embedding webkit with c# embedding gecko firefox engine with c# the webkit one isn t great as the other answer states one version no longer works the google code one and the mono one is experimental

790658
int	double
comment that sqlite doesn t differs int and floats is wrong - it has only 2 numeric types - 8-bytes floats and 8-bytes int
sqlite is not using single single precision 32-bit it s actually using double 64 bit

790724
unix	solaris
this feature was introduced in 4.3bsd in 1986 and today it is found in most modern unix systems
in addition solaris as of solaris 2.5 defines special behavior when the sticky bit is set on non-executable files those files when accessed will not be cached by the kernel

791465
min	max
the signature for your method is declared as but you are calling it as - mymethod min max .
which includes an extra min that s not in the declaration

792529
config	ini
thanks for your answers. this question as naive as it may seem at first glance was not so naive personally i don t like xml for config files i think it s hard for people to read and change and it s hard for computers to parse because it s so generic and powerful
ini files or java propery files are fine for only the most basic applications that does require nesting. common solutions to add nesting to those formats look like not a pretty sight a lot of redundancy and hard to move things between nodes

793123
nexus	artifactory
we used to use artifactory but ended up switching to nexus a while back
the main problem was that the disk space used by artifactory kept growing and we couldn t find a way to stop it

793280
implements	modifiers
an internal interface creates a contract that is not intended to be implements outside the assembly that defines the interface
a public type that implements a method of an internal interface using the virtual modifiers allows the method to be overridden by a derived type that is outside the assembly

793819
post	put
if this doesn t help you can post your code here so others can take a look
i agree with scott the easiest way to find out what s happening is to put some traces in the start-up code maybe it doesn t even come to your start-up code

793996
directwrite	direct2d
for details on directwrite in particular being released for vista but not xp see this msdn blog
direct2d is built on directx 10.1 so will not work on xp since directx 10 is vista+ only

793996
directx	directwrite	directx	direct2d
direct2d is built on directx 10.1 so will not work on xp since directx 10 is vista+ only
direct2d and directwrite technical previews are both currently available in the march 2009 directx sdk

794474
post	get
if you want to avoid it you need to use get method instead of post
this doesn t have anything to do with variables it has to do with you transferring information between pages using post method

794693
profiler	yourkit
inside the profiler you could visually compare the two snapshots and see what objects had survived the process and follow their references back to the gc root
i have no experience with other profilers but i know there are a few out there if yourkit doesn t fulfil your needs

794794
lisp	scheme
actually common lisp is not only the extension language but large parts of the application are written in common lisp plus some c++
other than that lisp is a family of diverse dialects with diverse implementations scheme common lisp emacs lisp visual lisp clojure logo ... and several others

794998
comparator	comparable
whether or not equals and hashcode are consistent with comparator is a different matter
from the javadoc for comparable it is strongly recommended though not required that natural orderings be consistent with equals

794998
equals	compareto
from the javadoc for comparable it is strongly recommended though not required that natural orderings be consistent with equals
this is so because sorted sets and sorted maps without explicit comparators behave strangely when they are used with elements or keys whose natural ordering is inconsistent with equals if you want to have compareto inconsistent with equals it is recommended that you instead use an explicit comparator by providing a class that implements comparator

795304
folder	directory
you can apply a similar approach to a file share make a upload.aspx that will check the auth then grab the file from a folder that is not accessible from the web
you can create a virtual directory as a sub-directory to the main site

795480
cassini	iis
browse 20 of your pages on cassini and you ve used that time anyway
one thing i ve noticed isn t always in the guides is that if you want to debug on a different address than you need to manually set the host to your local iis

797664
hash	salt
a salt is used in conjunction with a cryptographic hash not merely tacked on the front of the password
you don t store the salt password or the password but rather the hash of the salt password

797664
hash	salt
you don t store the salt password or the password but rather the hash of the salt password
the purpose of a salt is to protect users from bad password choices not obscure the password

797664
hash	salt
to clarify a salt will not protect against a dictionary attack. it can protect against a rainbow table style attack where a large table of hash and a corresponding input text is generated
good passwords protect against guesses dictionary attacks salt help protect against someone getting a hold of your hash passwords by making it expensive to use precomputed tables

797665
hash	salt
the real value in a salt is not only in protecting a single record against attack but rather making it so that if multiple users have the same password they will appear different in their hash form
for that to be effective you have to use a per-record salt

797860
git-am	git-apply
for various reasons it would be nice to do the entire temporary tree dance directly inside of git-apply as it can benefit say the git-sequence s apply command speed up git-am processing by forking less etc
from the git-am doc -3 --3way when the patch does not apply cleanly fall back on 3-way merge note from git google summer of code 2009 there is a project to teach git-apply the 3-way merge fallback git-am knows when git-apply patches file s the files may not patch cleanly

git-am	git-apply
from the git-am doc -3 --3way when the patch does not apply cleanly fall back on 3-way merge note from git google summer of code 2009 there is a project to teach git-apply the 3-way merge fallback git-am knows when git-apply patches file s the files may not patch cleanly
in such a case git-apply currently rejects the patch

798427
put	get
not clarifying your business idea - put together a business plan - it will help clarify what you are doing
read the book the art of the start by guy kawasaki to get the business perspective of starting a business

798668
moq	typemock
also the syntax of the language for lambdas does not lead to something as clean as c# readability-wise no flames please i m a vb user and i miss some c# features every day and that s partly the attraction for moq
the only testing framework i know of that did something with regards to vb is typemock

799092
udp	tcp
the big thing to know when attempting to use udp is your packets might not all make it over the line which means there is going to be possible data corruption
if you re working on an application where 100 of the data needs to arrive reliably to provide functionality use tcp

800105
stdout	stderr
open run a process and create a pipe to its stdin or stderr use open when you want to write data to a process s stdin or read data from a process s stdout but not both at the same time
ipc open2 run a process and create a pipe to both stdin and stdout use ipc open2 when you need to read from and write to a process s stdin and stdout

800551
hash	md5
and when they enter their new one use the new hash algorithm on it instead
md5 is a cryptographic hash function not necessarily an encryption method

800551
hash	md5
md5 is a cryptographic hash function not necessarily an encryption method
a hash is designed to only be performed in one direction and cannot be reversed other than by dictionary attack

800574
versioning	upgrade
if you are using several versioning of subversion on your machine be careful about which versioning you use in which working copy to avoid accidentally upgrading a working copy
but note that this auto upgrade behavior does not occur with the repositories only working copies. if you accidentally upgrade a 1.5 working copy to 1.6 and wish to downgrade back to 1.5 use the change-svn-wc-format.py script

801116
hash	md5
a hash function for securing passwords on a server will usually only require preimage resistance while message digests require all three
it has been shown that md5 is not collision resistant however that does not preclude its use in applications that do not require collision resistance

801177
wxpython	pyqt
this may not answer your question directly but i chose pyqt because there were no good ui designers for wxpython
apparently you either write your guis by hand or switch to pyqt

802163
onmouseover	onclick
no not far as i know. the ie redraws the part that are changed and therefore reset the design surface. thats why this happens. what you can do add the options on the onmouseover event
that should occour bevore the onclick

802476
typedef	struct
at least for me the following code works if you can t change the original declaration do something like this typedef struct collect_conn collect_conn_t
it seems the cdt parser doesn t like the portion offsetof struct ... . if you declare collect_conn using a typedef the error goes away

803494
super	extends
the difference between this and your implicit super interface is that object has a number of final and protected methods and you couldn t have those modifiers in an interface
since interfaces can only extends other interfaces and object is a class not an interface there must be some implicit interface that is being extended

804038
int	double
long s and int s in the same tree will completely destroy you
consider not making k a generic but using an interface that wraps the primitive wrapper a double wrapper

804348
ecj	javac
for the record i tried to compile the sample code with javac javac 1.6.0_13 and ecj eclipse java compiler 0.894_r34x 3.4.2 release and javac complained loudly and failed to produce any .class files while ecj only complained about some unused variables warnings and produced all the expected .class files
i don t claim to easily understand those complex generic types but if you find some code that compiles in javac and doesn t in ecj the eclipse compiler then file a bug report with both sun and eclipse and describe the situations cleary best if you also mention that you filed both bug reports and mention their respective urls although for sun it may take a while before the bug is publicly accessible

804685
prng	random
make sure the documentation promises the output is suitable for cryptography not just a regular prng
for example dev random on unix systems is a good source

805578
inherited	subclassing
if the base class in question is ten years old and too fragile to be inherited from the real answer is to fix it
i m tired as crap can barely keep my eyes open so there s probably a more elegant way to do this and i m certainly not endorsing the bizarre idea that a base should have at most seven subclassing

805929
translation	globalization
i know there are tools out there that aid in the translation process but i m not famliar with any off them off hand
yep the entire globalization framework in .net is based of resx files and the satelite assemblies they create

806384
translation	localization
note a localization tool only manages translation not the original language
summary you should use a localization tool

806458
hash	salt
if you have a slower hash sha-512 cracking will be slower
note that a good password hash function not only includes salt it also applies the hash function several thousand times

806783
mouse	keyboard
i use viemu with visual studio which has helped me reduce but not eliminate the need for using the mouse
learn the keyboard short cuts also some editors are better suited for mouse free operation

806907
put	get
if you are not using votive then you can put the wix xsd into visual studio xsd repository to get intelisense
because then you get intelisense when working on wxs

807033
range	max
if the reult so far is between max 7 and max-1 then the result will be uniformly distrubuted in that range
if not we use the remainder which is random between 0 and max 7-1 and another call to rand to make a new number and a new max

807966
calloc	malloc
calloc allows you to initialize the memory block you allocate while malloc does not
the main difference between new and malloc i can recall is that you cannot reallocate memory allocated by new using realloc

808361
implements	sealed
if it were sealed and i don t think picturebox is you d probably want to build a wrapper class that implements the interface that you re interested in and contains a picturebox control exposing only the members that you re interested in
if the class you re interested in creating an interface for is not sealed then your could create a new class and inherit from the non-sealed class implementing the interface

808732
put	get
secondly you re going to need to put thread synchronization around your uri collection
you could get a race condition where one two threads pass the this uri does not exist yet check and they add duplicates

808850
hide	show
so when javascript was first released a technique was needed to hide the code from older browsers so they wouldn t show it as text in the page
the hack was to use html comments within the script block to hide the code. using html comments in script is bad no browsers in common use today are ignorant of the script tag so hiding of javascript source is no longer necessary

808952
invokerequired	begininvoke
edit if you check invokerequired and handlecreated before calling invoke you shouldn t get that exception
the method in the post you link to calls invoke begininvoke before checking if the control s handle has been created in the case where it s being called from a thread that didn t create the control

809244
integer	unsigned
is better because 0xffffffff assumes that unsigned int is a 32-bit integer
i am not sure using an unsigned int for flags is a good idea in the first place in c++

809490
put	get
unless moving the join condition to the where clause changes the meaning of the query like in the left join example above then it doesn t matter where you put them
sql will re-arrange them and as long as they are provably equivalent you ll get the same query

809616
stdout	stderr
the reason why your program hangs is that the read function waits for the daemon to write something to its stdout stderr
if the daemon including the child process of your program and also the child process forked children who keep their stdout stderr doesn t write anything and there is at least one process holding the writable end of the pipe open read will never return

809915
puts	gets
this works as for the double quote issue it does seem that cmd does not like the quotes around arguments that powershell puts
it gets this cmd c echo foo so i think it treats everything after c as the exact command so like so echo foo some command line programs and funky parsing of the command line that is why powershell takes over this job for functions and cmdlets

809968
mousemove	mouseleave	mousemove	mousehover
the reason for removing the mousemove events on mouseleave would allow you to only receive events while the mouse is over your control
why not subscribe to the mousemove events in the mousehover event then unsubscribe in the mouseleave event edit one way to determine if the mouse is stopped would be to start a timer every time you get a mouse move event when the timer has elapsed then you could consider the mouse stopped

810013
for-loop	arrays
you might want to clean up the coding style a bit though edit oh i see when you re referencing the arrays in the for-loop it doesn t know that the arrays has prodid and name indices
when you make an arrays you have to define the indexes using the operator

810069
switching	screens
screens is acting as a terminal emulator inside a terminal emulator and it s just not possible for screens to switching the scrollback buffer in terminal.app whenever you switching between screens
you re going to have to use screens s scrollback features

810597
jikes	javac
jikes does not support the new java 5 things so it is not an option for projects using these facilities
the best alternative to javac these days is in my opinion the eclipse compiler which is available in a stand-alone version

811689
int	chars
edit int - uint32_t
and no it does not cast a chars to uint32_t

811797
firefox	safari
i ve heard but cannot validate for ie that both ie and firefox support the view-source pseudo-protocol
firefox on mac indeed understands it but safari does not

811801
haskell	sml
while your class likely wouldn t use them anyways haskell s typeclasses are still an extra bump to get over -- getting them to understand the a versus a distinction in sml is tough enough
sml has a truly interactive interpreter in which functions can be both defined and used

811814
inline	inlining
if it s just returning a class member variable then chances are that the compiler will inline it
if getcontext has to perform a more complicated operation such as looking up the context in a table the compiler probably isn t inlining it and you may wish to only call it once as in your second snippet

811832
stdout	stderr
also while tempting i ve found that sending different things to stdout vs
stderr is not always useful

811858
daemons	systemd
on linux the back-end daemons may be replaced by gamin but a program linked with fam will work with gamin just fine
behind the scenes fam may be using polling and gamin may be using inotify or dnotify or kqueue but you shouldn t need to worry about the implementation. os x.5 has fsevents which is very different in that it monitors the whole systemd instead of specified files and directories but would also satisfy your needs

812084
median	minimum
however i have not heard of any median filtering algorithms in image processing that take advantage of this fact
alex stepanov s new book elements of programming talks at some length about finding order statistics using the minimum number of average comparisons while minimizing runtime overhead

812117
maven	pom.xml
assuming you don t want to download everything don t want to run another server process only want to track a limited number of projects you might want to create a separate pom.xml file with dependencies like this this will tell maven to use jfoo 1.0.0 up to jfoo 2.0.0 so when jfoo releases version 1.2.17 you ll be fetching that in the next build assuming your settings are set to check versions each time
this pom.xml doesn t have to actually build anything

812701
accessor	properties
also just as a side note you may or may not know this already but there s no point to synthesizing a properties if you re just going to write all the accessor methods anyway
yes the properties syntax calls the setter

814251
comparator	comparable
now adding to student will also make the compiler ensure that there s a public int comparator method on student
but without the implements comparable even if the compiler knows there s a method student.compareto it doesn t know that that comparator is the comparable.compareto

814317
subclass	superclass
note that the implementation of the subclass requires the drawrect method be called
i m not sure if this is a bug or not since i d expect the drawrect method to be called in the superclass

814811
actionscript	mxml
from a programmer s viewpoint the big difference between flash and flex is not so much which ide application you use for programming but whether you program in actionscript as only or use the flex framework and mxml to program your applications
i would say pure actionscript is better for programming whether you use flash ide or flex ide is not that relevant and mxml is better for non-programmers to combine the components programmed in as

814811
actionscript	mxml
i would say pure actionscript is better for programming whether you use flash ide or flex ide is not that relevant and mxml is better for non-programmers to combine the components programmed in as
i would add to your list these pros cons flex pros easier for non-programmers to get into application development you can quickly combine components to create small applications components can provide an advantage in large-scale projects cons customizing the look of components can take a lot longer than anticipated depending on the visual style you re looking for when you find out you need a custom component that doesn t exist you might need to go back to flash to do the real programming work and packaging of the component the flexibility of flex means you will be reading a lot of documentation bugs in the flex framework you eventually will need to compromise with the architecture of the flex framework flash or flex ide in actionscript project mode pros easier for someone with a programming background

815048
memcached	apc
memcached is a distributed caching system whereas apc is non-distributed - and mainly an opcode cache
if and only if you have a web application which has to live on different webservers loadbalancing you have to use memcache for distributed caching. if not just stick to apc and its cache

815048
memcached	apc
if and only if you have a web application which has to live on different webservers loadbalancing you have to use memcached for distributed caching. if not just stick to apc and its cache
you should always use an opcode cache which apc is also apc will get integrated into php6 iirc so why not start using it now

815381
hash	md5
i echo chris comment about not using a hash at all your database engine can hopefully index 140-character fields efficiently
if you did want to use a hash md5 would be my first choice as well 16 bytes followed by sha-1 20 bytes

815657
put	get
when i need to travel i unplug all the cords and put it in my bag
since i use the same machine i don t have to worry about migrating files or settings back and forth and while the screen is somewhat small it s not bad to get a bit of work done on the go

815816
put	get
you can put the value in a javascript variable like this now you can use that variable in your javascript code
even if you manage to get the value the code doesn t do anything at all with it

816386
typedef	struct
i suspect that it s impossible without the struct because c requires types to be defined before they are used and there s no opaque syntax for typedef
you can wrap the function pointer in a struct i m not sure if this is an improvement on casting

816676
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
browsers firefox 2 mac firefox 3 mac firefox 3 windows firefox 2 windows webkit nightly mac safari 3 windows safari 4 mac google-chrome latest version windows opera latest version windows opera latest version mac internet explorer 6 on the xp part of the windows machine internet explorer 8 w ie7 compatibility mode on the vista part of the windows machine e-mail clients covered apple mail thunderbird firefox rendering engine on the xp machine outlook express ie6 rendering engine outlook 2003 on the xp machine outlook 2007 on the vista machine all the popular web clients on all the browsers mentioned above live mail gmail yahoo
mail things this setup doesn t cover i don t have mac os 10.4 i only test the latest version of opera not any earlier versions due to it s small userbase i test safari 3 and safari 4 both one on windows and one on the mac not both versions on both platforms

816676
opera	safari
mail things this setup doesn t cover i don t have mac os 10.4 i only test the latest version of opera not any earlier versions due to it s small userbase i test safari 3 and safari 4 both one on windows and one on the mac not both versions on both platforms
now safari 4 is still in beta anyway

817121
hash	md5
it is possible for a third party to generate 2 messages one of which is evil and another of which is good that both hash to the same value
collision attack nonetheless the current rsa recommendation is not to use md5 if you need pre-image resistance

817285
free	malloc
to me the current level of concurrency language support is roughly equivalent to the memory management support in c not integrated but some things can be delegated to the os malloc free
i wish some language would come up with a suitable abstraction that either makes the threads + synchronization model easier or that simply completely hides it for us just as automatic memory management make good old malloc free obsolete in java

817530
maven	pom.xml
this tells maven that you will manually take care of providing this artifact at runtime and so it will not be packaged
for instance side effect you must specify a version of the artifact-to-be-ignored and its pom.xml will be retrieved at build-time

818284
stdout	stderr
here is one way to remember this construct although it is not entirely accurate at first may look like a good way to redirect stderr to stdout
however it will actually be interpreted as redirect stderr to a file named 1

818320
inherited	subclassing
you can t extend linq-to-sql entity types in this way via inherited - you should instead use a partial class to add extra methods to the existing generated entity
because linq-to-sql supports inherited for discriminated tables etc it expects an exact match to a known entity type - not unexpected subclassing

818786
versioning	upgrade
i have seen people shipping libraries to all platforms when the fix is only for a particular platform just to avoid the versioning confusion
but it is not that simple customer often has a different angle to how he she wants to upgrade patch which is also to be considered

818854
jruby	mri
some gems target specific platforms mongrel there s a mri one and a jruby one
also jruby cannot use gems that have native extensions c code unless they use the ffi which most do not - yet

819327
int	chars
int is usually bigger than chars more suitable for calculations but not so suitable for byte-level manipulation
chars is the smallest addressable chunk of memory suits well for manipulating data buffers but can t hold more than 256 distinct values if chars is 8 bits which is usual and therefore not very good for numeric calculations

819988
put	get
that s not going to be fast especially if you put doubles in them
you re probably not going to get a commercially viable product

820351
typemock	nmock
typemock can do this because it utilizes the clr profiler to intercept and redirect calls
rhinomocks nmock and moq cannot do this because these libraries are simpler

820823
punctuation	words
if there are other characters besides spaces that you don t want to match some kinds of punctuation stick them in the construct as well of course
aniz in organization is not a complete words -- it s a part of a words

821202
administration	activation
the user class would contain the following attributes givenname surname email activation reference to an activation object the activation class would contain the following attributes activationcode string senton when was the email sent activatedon defaults to null set to current date time when the user clicks the activation link tells the system if the user has activated his account when not null you could use an hql query to know which company has at least one activated user this query assumes that you have defined an administration attribute in your office class
the administration would be a reference to the user who created the office

821614
realloc	strcpy
also dont forget you should check that realloc doesn t return null
i take this is a code snipet consequently i guess that you are alredy including string.h strcpy is defined as in lines num_righe-1 is a char not a char so it should be strcpy lines + num_righe-1 line

821980
int	chars
op wrote my goal originally was to come up with a specific method to pack 1..n large int aka longs together so that their string representation is notably shorter than writing the actual number
think multiples of ten 10 6 and 1 000 000 are the same however the representation s length in chars isn t

822786
int	boolean	int	chars
the difference between the scalar type int and the boxed type int is surprising to someone new to java
java has always made a distinction between the scalar types which are not classes boolean true false chars unsigned 16-bit short signed 16-bit int signed 32-bit and long signed 64-bit

822929
vmware	esx
we run sharepoint and sql server on separate vms on vmware esx in our datacenter
esx does not add much of a disk i o performance hit but the trick is to use fast drives 15k rpm

823338
haskell	ocaml
haskell s type system is ambitious and powerful but it is continually being improved which means there is some inconsistency as a result of history
f# essentially uses the .net type system plus ml-like hindley-milner polymorphism see question what is hindley-milner . ocaml is not quite consistent on whether it thinks variants should be statically typed or dynamically typed so it provides both algebraic data types and polymorphic variants

823380
config	ini
the zend framework contains a config parses that parses files that are written in the ini format zend_config_ini it sounds like this is what you are using
the config file should not be located in your document root and if it is not in your document root then no re-write rules are required since no-one can access it anyway

823380
config	ini
the config file should not be located in your document root and if it is not in your document root then no re-write rules are required since no-one can access it anyway
the ini format is specialized to provide both the ability to have a hierarchy of configuration data keys and inheritance between configuration data sections

823689
hide	show
if your users really like your icon application they can always choose to not hide your application
the only difference is that only the user can choose which icon is show instead of every application claiming it s real estate

824178
post	get
http post requests aren t meant to return resources
the rest way to do it will be to create the image with a post request and then load it with a get request

824405
pop-up	dialog
it looks like you want a simple model dialog a dialog which pop-up and doesn t allow the user to do anything else until it s closed
java makes this really easy - just use joptionpane s static methods to create the dialog you want

824472
daemons	systemd
bugs with thread.sleep under windows if timing is crucial to your application then an inelegant but practical way to get round these bugs is to leave a daemons thread running throughout the duration of your application that simply sleeps for a large prime number of milliseconds long.max_value will do
this way the interrupt period will be set once per invocation of your application minimising the effect on the systemd clock and setting the sleep granularity to 1ms even where the default interrupt period isn t 15ms

824586
mvp	presenter
based on what you ve told me i would recommend that you use the passive mvp model mentioned in the article above
my main assumptions are your dealing with an existing codebase of webforms apps you need to use thirdparty .net controls for existing functionality your working on existing apps and don t have time to re architect them any asp.net web apps you work on in the future you can incrementally apply the passive mvp and get the benefits of tdd straight away your view codebehind + aspx essentially become dumb and just perform simple tasks take information given by the presenter responds to events and provides information back to the presenter i ve used this model extensively for web forms development and i couldn t imagine not being able to unit test my model and presenter code

824603
set	bag
this is done like this create your class like this in your mapping you specify this since you use inheritance you should definitly have a look at the different posibilities regarding inheritance-mapping in nhibernate and choose the strategy that is best suited for your situation inheritance mapping regarding set bag semantics - when you map a collection as a set you can be sure that all the entities in the mapped collection are unique
that is nhibernate will make sure that while reconstituting an instance the collection will not contain duplicates. - when you map the collection as a bag it is possible that your collection will contain the same entity more then once when loading the object from the db

825218
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome
if the user has ie without javascript or is using opera then tough luck they won t get rounded corners but in the spirit of progressive enhancement this shouldn t ever be a problem
this is what i m doing on several projects for firefox and webkit based browsers although beware google-chrome has bugs in this area use their css border-radius based styles for native rounded corners -webkit-border-radius 20px

825345
versioning	upgrade
if that s not the answer you can always try to upgrade your rails versioning to 2.3 and see if the problem persists
are you running the latest versioning of passenger 2.2.2 at the time of writing

826128
folder	directory
what ended up working was cp -r a a # backup since a was not in the repo rm -rf a # removed locked directory svn rm a # remove a from pending commit mv a a # restore backup svn add a # re-add to pending commit svn cleanup # had to cleanup several parent folder higher as well
we had this problem today when i tried to add a folder a in which i didn t have write permission so it couldn t create the a .svn folder

826469
put	get
if it breaks your app and you can t code for it then at least put some javascript on the navigate away event to let the user know that the back button isn t supported and using it might cause loss of work
it s frustrating when you click a back button and get to a non working page and you end up losing something you were working on

826813
webkit	gecko
webkit and blink-based browsers support the -webkit-user-select property
this of course is not supported in browsers that do not use the gecko rendering engine

827588
wtl	atl
atl mfc might be included in the windows sdk or other free products that i am not aware of. wtl 8.0 is available as a free download
you can also get wtl sources from source forge wtl project

827682
put	get
just put the new user s username as part of the link and randomly generate an authentication token of whatever length you want and store that in the database linked to their username until they authenticate
so the link they get in the email is something like it really doesn t matter if there are any collisions it s a fairly low risk event anyway

827859
haskell	sml	haskell	ocaml	ocaml	sml
sml ocaml f# and haskell allow closed sealed algebraic types to be defined to strengthen static typing by conveying more specific constraints implicitly
ocaml and f# also allow open sum types whereas sml does not and haskell requires an elaborate workaround described by oleg kiselyov

827960
yacc	bison
i ve not used bison but yacc allows you to override the error handling and i would hope the equivalent gnu tool was at least as powerful as our old unix clunkers
i ve done this before with a config file yacc grammar

827981
range	minimum
you have to look at every single line in the range you want to tell if it s in the range you want so i m guessing you mean not every line in the file
at a bare minimum you will have to look at every line in the file up to and including the first one outside your range i m assuming the lines are in date time order

829258
vim	kate
for editing in a shell when i cannot use vim i look immediately for pico or nano but i would not recommend them for continuous development for rapid editing they are perfect
i love kate because it has several interesting features already cited usually found in heavier ides

830320
inherited	properties
see this for more tip 12 - how to choose an inherited strategy hope this helps alex
i am assuming properties doesn t also inherit from propertyobject

830320
inherited	properties
i am assuming properties doesn t also inherited from propertyobject
given that these tables properties case quote and message leads to a table per concrete class or tpc inheritance strategy which i generally don t recommend

830320
inherited	properties
given that these tables properties case quote and message leads to a table per concrete class or tpc inherited strategy which i generally don t recommend
my recommendation is that you use either table per hierarchy or tph - case and quote are stored in the same table with one column used as a discriminator with nullable columns for properties that are not shared

830360
hide	show
to change the setting right click on the desktop select properties click on the appearance tab click the effects button uncheck the box labeled hide underlined letters for keyboard navigation
in windows there is a setting whether or not to show the underline

830428
innodb	myisam
unfortunately you cannot disable at least i don t know how the key-updates with an innodb table
with a myisam table you could do something like i actually did not test if these settings would affect the query duration

830798
superclass	subclassing
for example in your superclass def filename # return default file name end and in your subclassing def filename # return custom file name end
i m guessing this is due to the fact that the controller superclass does not know of the existence of the subclassing s methods

830798
superclass	subclassing
i m guessing this is due to the fact that the controller superclass does not know of the existence of the subclassing s methods
you can confirm this by inspecting the methods array of the subclassing

831299
versioning	upgrade
you have three options not open the solution file in 2008 and thus never upgrade it not mix client versioning against the same files ie
stick to 2005 or everyone upgrade keep separate solution files for 2005 and 2008 make sure all the same projects are present in both thanks to will dean for reminding me that project files can indeed be shared

831653
spaces	linefeed
spaces characters for unused positions in the field aren t stored
as hypoxide suggested they may not in fact be spaces edit i suspect that the last character in the field is a carriage return or linefeed character

832236
post	get
post is for when you want the origin server accept the entity enclosed in the request as a new subordinate of the resource identified by the request-uri in the request-line. in this case there s no need for the server to permanently accept remember the addends so post is not appropriate
i think get would be appropriate for a random number

832495
post	put
vanilla ajax calls use get or post and it is completely up to you how to handle them
rest uses the verbs get head post put delete http verb rest crud post create get read put update create delete delete you want to use post over get when you are worried about csrf not xss

832495
post	put	post	get	put	get
rest uses the verbs get head post put delete http verb rest crud post create get read put update create delete delete you want to use post over get when you are worried about csrf not xss
a good rule of thumb is always use post and only use get if you are absolutely sure you want to share that data with other sites or the data is not sensitive

832495
post	get
a good rule of thumb is always use post and only use get if you are absolutely sure you want to share that data with other sites or the data is not sensitive
but just using post alone won t protect you 100

832711
ant	pom.xml	ant	maven
i can take a person that has never seen ant - its build.xml s are reasonably well-written - and they can understand what is going on
i can take that same person and show them a maven pom.xml and they will not have any idea what is going on

833270
put	get
this means you need to remember to delete the memory afterwards please don t put pointers to stack objects into the map
polymorphism doesn t work in that case because the std map stores the base as a value type so the objects get sliced

833363
put	get
usage it comes together with a non-extension static method if you don t have a instance but the call doesn t look as pretty of course you can put it on codeplex if you want
getmembername allows to get the string with the name of a member with compile time safety

833377
post	get
since this is a client-side api i did the following on the server side check for a custom session cookie holding the time offset value and if it s not available reload the page only during get and not post calls with some javascript logic added to generate the time offset and save it in the cookie
from the client-side this is almost transparent once during session i reload a page on get

833745
int	chars
simply casting from int to chars only works if you want iso-8859-1 if you re reading bytes from a stream directly
edit if you are already using a reader then casting the return value of read to chars is the right way to go after checking whether it s -1 or not .

833871
direct3d	directx
with direct3d 10 they ve split many of the functions that were in idirect3d9 relating to for example adapters into the directx graphics infrastructure dxgi
in other words direct3d 10 still uses com but no there isn t a counterpart of idirect3d9

835052
config	ini
i tend to use define for environmental config since referencing a constant should be faster than calling a new function
it s also conceptually in line with what i m doing another option is to use ini files make sure they are not in the web root and the parse_ini_file function although you should only run this once and use a singleton to access the variables after that

835841
int	chars
simplest form minimum code no int overflow no extra checks just a little more memory usage but who doesn t have 32 spare bits lying around
while i suppose has fewer chars i can t really say that it is simpler

835853
getter	setter
i used to bypass the getter setter too until i figured out that the bindings doesn t work when directly accessing the variable
in other words key-value coding only works when accessing a property with the getter setter functions

836670
gif	png
lawyers are the most important people to talk to in this case. but i d still say don t store it. if necessary i d suggest storing the contract in a format from which you cannot extract the original gif
such as taking a png file for the whole document or some other solution

837564
allocator	stl
generally try to reduce the number of allocator that stick around
it reduces overhead. assuming stl look at the overhead difference between std map and std unordered_map the latter may or may not be available to you at the moment

838071
g++	gcc
you can have multiple versions of gcc on your box to select the one you want to use call it with full path instead of g++ use full path usr bin g++ on command line depends where your gcc lives
for compiling projects it depends what system do you use i m not sure about xcode i m happy with default atm but when you use makefiles you can set gxx usr bin g++ and so on

838225
int	chars
there is absolutely no difference at all between the chars constant a cast to an int and the int 65 so it would be completely impossible to distinguish the cases
update from pax i would argue that explicit casting is not passing a chars it s the caller converting a chars to an int then passing the int

838225
int	chars
update from pax i would argue that explicit casting is not passing a chars it s the caller converting a chars to an int then passing the int
this solution catches the inadvertent passing of a chars

838648
int	boolean
if you allow any int values then this does not work either
in java the operator indeed does do logical xor when used on two boolean operands just like and | in java do non-short-circuiting logical and and or respectively when applied to boolean

838734
integer	unsigned
i don t think c++ deviates from the way c handles signed unsigned conversions conversion rules are more complicated when unsigned operands are involved. the problem is that comparisons between signed and unsigned values are machine-dependent because they depend on the sizes of the various integer types
k r one important factor to consider is whether one of the types is a long integer or not because that will affect integer promotions

838734
integer	unsigned
k r one important factor to consider is whether one of the types is a long integer or not because that will affect integer promotions
for example if a long int is compared to an unsigned int and a long int can represent all the values of an unsigned int then the unsigned int will be converted to a long int

839544
addition	modulo
this is true but doesn t explain why a plus-like symbol is used for something that isn t addition
the answer is that for modulo addition of 1-bit values 0+0 1+1 0 and 0+1 1+0 1

839604
inherited	subclassing
the definition of subclassing is that it extends another class and inherited the state and behaviors from that class
a class cannot extend itself since it is itself so it is not a subclassing

839848
put	get
i have seen reports that show mysql to be faster for some simple scenarios put to single table get from single table
but the speed difference is not going to be enormous. my experience is that any perceptible slowness in a website is due to one of 1 insufficient hardware for the db simply not enough disk i o or enough ram or 2 complexity of database needs related to necessary contention for what you want to get done

840803
hash	hmac
i m not sure why you want to hash the message before computing the hmac
hmac does that for you

840806
xmpphp	libpurple
these two doc pages seem to be fairly readable core instant messaging and presence also you might already be heavily invested into xmpphp but if not you may want to take a look at phurple
it gives you access to the libpurple library the code-base for pidgin from php

841279
inherited	properties
you should use an imagesource instead or a bitmapimage like you did since bitmapimage inherited from imagesource
it doesn t really makes sense to have a data properties of type image since image is a control if you really want to do that you could bind to photo.source

841589
range	minimum
to save memory use xrange instead of range
unfortunately xrange doesn t work with large numbers it s an implementation restriction example raises overflowerror for i in xrange 1 600851475143 print i you can have large minimum or maximum values in your interval with range if their difference is small

841985
submit	submission
this is important because clicking a button element does not trigger the browser s form submit event
instead of relying on a browser form submission asp.net will render a client-side call to __dopostback within that button element s onclick handler

842089
inherited	subclassing
you should use inherited when subclassing is-a superclass both structurally and functionally when it can be used as superclass and you are going to use that
if it is not the case - it is not inherited but something else

842610
interpolation	splines
finding a local maximum of an interpolation splines is an easy enough thing
note that you should generally use a true splines here not a pchip interpolant

842900
int	boolean	int	chars
most primitive types in java are signed and byte short int and long are encoded in two s complement
the chars type is unsigned and the concept of a sign is not applicable to boolean . in this number scheme the most significant bit specifies the sign of the number

842969
hash	md5
md5 sha1 and many other hash functions are also using this davis-meyer construction and hence they are in principle based on a block cipher
just in case of md5 or sha1 that block cipher does not have a name and i m not aware of much research on how suitable these constructs are

842984
set	bag
if you remove the id column but don t wipe out duplicates you end up with a bag of rows not a set
if the application somehow doesn t prevent duplicates from getting into that bag then the bag is not in 1nf

843077
hide	show
edit using collapsed will hide the menu item and not reserve space in the menu - you don t really want blank spaces in a context menu
thanks to botz3000 for this then in your code where the property value is changed you ll to find the menu item you wish to show hide using the linkage i described above

843116
punctuation	words
then you process one sentence at a time after removing all punctuation commas semi-colons colons and so on
then when you re left with an array of words it becomes simpler that s it pretty simple after initial massaging of the text block which may not be as simple as you think

843131
cairngorm	mate
i m not in favor of using any mvc framework cairngorm puremvc in flex code
mate is a better candidate

843331
rss	feed
your best bet would be to see if any of the big rss aggregators offer lists of feed they know about - but that is commercially important information so i doubt they ll be giving it away and certainly not for free
you ll never be able to get a complete list of all rss feed on the internet

843739
getter	setter
along with synthesize you can still override one of the getter setter by defining your own
the naming convention for these methods is setpropertyname for the setter and propertyname or getpropertyname not standard for the getter

843978
icefaces	tomahawk
icefaces allows to integrate tomahawk components although the skinning is not really compatible
integration is one of the key features with icefaces

844286
typedef	struct
typedef struct mytype1 mytype1handle
i think you can just declare but not define the source structures struct mytype1

844431
folder	directory
do not confuse this directory with the desktop folder itself which is a virtual folder. msdn - special folder enum msdn - getfolderpath
if the selectedpath property is set before showing the dialog box the folder with this path will be the selected folder as long as selectedpath is set to an absolute path that is a subfolder of rootfolder or more accurately points to a subfolder of the shell namespace represented by rootfolder . msdn - selectedpath the getfolderpath method returns the locations associated with this enumeration

844627
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
however you have to pass touchesbegan to uiscrollview because you want it to remember a base coordinate for future horizontal scrolling if you later decide it is a horizontal scrolling
you won t be able to send touchesbegan to uiscrollview later because you cannot store the touches argument it contains objects that will be mutated before the next touchesmoved event and you cannot reproduce the old state

844627
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
you won t be able to send touchesbegan to uiscrollview later because you cannot store the touches argument it contains objects that will be mutated before the next touchesmoved event and you cannot reproduce the old state
so you have to pass touchesbegan to uiscrollview immediately but you will hide any further touchesmoved events from it until you decide to scroll horizontally

845194
put	get
you can make a decorator and put the cloning behaviour in that
this is not the most robust way and doesn t handle key-value arguments or class methods lack of self argument but you get the picture

845427
postgresql	mysql
the generated identification numbers will be unique. regardless of whether you use sequences like in postgresql and oracle or if you use another mechanism like auto-increment of mysql
however sequences are most often acquired in bulks of for example 20 numbers. so with postgresql you can not determine which field was inserted first

845933
floating-point	integer
while pow base exp is a great suggestion be aware that it typically works in floating-point
this may or may not be what you want on some systems a simple loop multiplying on an accumulator will be faster for integer types

845979
int	double
pow long double int
now you can t just do pow 2 n with n being an int because it doesn t know which of float double or long double version it should take and you would get an ambiguity error

845979
int	double
now you can t just do pow 2 n with n being an int because it doesn t know which of float double or long double version it should take and you would get an ambiguity error
all three would need a conversion from int to floating point and all three are equally costly

846356
postgresql	mysql
setting a delimiter is easier than using postgresql s dollar sign quoting when writing a stored proc
in mysql you connect to all databases not just one at a time

848039
for-loop	loops
the scope of the variable in the test of the while loops is wider than the scope of variables declared in the header of the for-loop
therefore if there are performance implications as a side-effect of keeping a variable alive longer then there will be performance implications in choosing between a while and a for-loop and not wrapping the while up in to reduce the scope of its variables

848165
inherited	subclassing
this being said my impression of adc s emphasis against subclassing is not putting forth a case for designing an application s class hierarchy without inherited but instead to point out that in the new way of doing things ie osx there are in most cases more appropriate means to go about customizing standard behavior without needing to subclassing
so by all means design your puzzle program s architecture as robustly as you can leveraging inherited as you see fit

848282
maven	pom.xml
maven is following the convention over configuration principle which means that if you are following their conventions then you do not need to redefine basic information such as your project structure
as far as i am concerned i prefer to have the shortest pom.xml i can write and i don t like to define the information like where to find the sources the resources and so on

848997
collabnet	svn
if they are not important to you and you re comfortable using standard svn command line commands collabnet is a nice option
collabnet works great but it doesn t have the visual interfaces for management that are included in visualsvn

850076
put	get
the problem isn t that you re running it in a script it s that you put the command in a variable and then run the expanded variable
and since variable expansion happens after quote removal has already been done the single quotes around your exclude pattern never get removed.

850361
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
as tormod suggested the preferable methods would be changing the collection to an observablecollection or implementing inotifycollectionchanged in the collection would take care of refreshing the ui
however if those options aren t available then you can force a refresh by using inotifypropertychanged in whatever class contains the collection

850487
processors	hyperthreading
this has the effect of making things seem like they require more processors cycles than they normally would
as you can read on wikipedia with the advent of multi-core hyperthreading cpus systems with multiple cpus and hibernating operating systems the tsc cannot be relied on to provide accurate results

850487
cpu	processors
even then the cpu speed may change due to power-saving measures taken by the os or bios or the system may be hibernated and later resumed resetting the time stamp counter
reliance on the time stamp counter also reduces portability as other processors may not have a similar feature

851329
agile	sprint
scrum is the agile process for project management and so it doesn t have an impact on code quality other than its tight focus on always having a potential deliverable system at the end of each 2-4 week sprint
by keeping sprint short and getting daily feedback the project manager gets a much better sense of how much effort new features take to implement and the team gets a good feel for the relative importance of each new feature

852630
afp	smb
i d go with smb for the simple reason that i d trust apple or whoever to correctly implement smb before i d trust microsoft or whoever to properly implement afp
not because of relative competence but because afp is strange and does things in unexpected ways

853042
sorting	grouping	sorting	filtering
from bea s post on sorting a collectionview is created if your source implements ienumerable
if the source implements ienumerable only you will not be able to sort or grouping the collection you can only filtering it

853042
sorting	filtering	filtering	grouping
it supports sorting and grouping but not traditional filtering
instead it has an additional customfilter property that delegates filtering to the dataview see my post on ado.net for more details

853492
serializable	deserialization
not too much code and you get to use the serializable techniques already tested and coded in the .net framework
you could use the .toarray property on the list and then serialize the array - that could then be dumped to disk or network and reconstituted with a deserialization on the other end

853583
hash	md5
java s standard hashcode implementation of say string is probably not suitable aside from any issues about the quality of the hash its 32-bit width means that you ll expect a collision after just 16 000 items or so
usually for duplicate file data detection md5 is a good tradeoff between speed and chance of collision

853803
integer	unsigned
a conversion to any other integer type is lower ranked and overload resolution won t prefer it
and it prints this one here int unsigned int int unsigned int it s not of particular interest to this serialization problem since the size of the data serialized is not of constant width and this can cause problems when the enumeration and its underlying type is changed but it is generally interesting to figure out a type storing the whole of an enumeration

854180
comparator	comparable
the treeset uses the comparator try this make the comparator always return 0 and everything will be removed
same happens if not using a comparator but implementing comparable

854460
folder	directory
if you have windows xp or windows 2000 then temporary internet files are in this location note that on your pc they can be on some drive other than c c documents and settings username local settings temporary internet files if you have only one user account then replace username with administrator to get the path of the temporary internet files folder
if you have windows me windows 98 windows nt or windows 95 then index.dat files are in these locations c windows temporary internet files c windows profiles username temporary internet files note that on your computer the windows directory may not be c windows but some other directory

854511
ocaml	sml
i am amazed you are not considering ocaml and f# given that they address so many of your concerns
sml is way behind and f# is way ahead of all other fpls in that respect

854912
hash	md5
in short since md5 is a 128bit hash you need 2 64 items before the probably of a collision rises to 50
there s an assumption there that md5 is distributed evenly over that 128bit space which i would believe it doesn t do but gets close

854986
hash	salt
edited answer because i misread the article initially and thought he was just mixing the salt together with an unsalted hash his techniques do seem fine they ll work but they re not really any better than normal salting methods
it s just an attempt to do security by obscurity it s no better than making up your own random hash scrambling method and hoping that the attacker doesn t figure it out

855148
hash	salt
the consensus was this it doesn t matter how you salt so long as you salt before you hash use a random salt unique per password use a large enough salt to make rainbow tables prohibitive
you can even store your salt right next to your hashed passwords and feel pretty darn confident

855510
actionscript	mxml
each mxml file is a full fledged actionscript class
you re not including those mxml files you re actually creating properties in your main mxml class and those properties types are of the child mxml objects

855685
komodo	aptana	komodo	radrails
komodo edit is one of the best ides i ve ever used and it has rails support although maybe not as good as aptana radrails
if you have money to spare i d highly recommend komodo ide as it has some great extra features but if not komodo edit has everything you need

855856
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
look at tutorials regarding uiviewcontroller or viewcontrollers in general they will have discussion about uitabbarcontroller
1 i m not sure if you can modify the size of the tab bar of uitabbarcontroller - i don t think that displaying just text will shrink the tab bar size for that you probably need to look at other solutions

855885
vb.net	vb6
notice vb.net collection is not included thread 179998
if you are using vb.net you are not using vb6 collections

855885
vb.net	vb6
if you are using vb.net you are not using vb6 collections
the vb.net collection is functionally equivalent to the vb6 collection but they are not the same

855885
vb.net	vb6
the vb.net collection is functionally equivalent to the vb6 collection but they are not the same
has a comparison of the various .net collection types with the vb6 collection including the vb.net collection

855978
hash	salt
i don t understand the details but it has to do with finding two prefixes that produce the same hash
it doesn t matter when you digest the salt prefix postfix infix all produce different hashes but achieve the same purpose of defeating rainbow tables or other pre-hashed dictionary attacks

855978
hash	md5	salt	md5
it doesn t matter when you digest the salt prefix postfix infix all produce different hash but achieve the same purpose of defeating rainbow tables or other pre-hashed dictionary attacks
i think that the comment has to do specifically with a vulnerability in md5 not hashing in general

856170
mvp	presenter
the idea behind mvp is decoupling presenter from views so that you can switch the view more easily if you need to for example supporting both web application and a desktop application but that doesn t mean you have to make it dynamic
one suggestion i usually supply the iview as a constructor parameter to the presenter

856834
post	get	asihttprequest	cfnetwork
asihttprequest was originally designed just for this purpose tracking post progress since in the 2.x api this isn t possible with nsurlconnection
it will definitely be easier to integrate than rolling your own with cfnetwork and you get lots of other stuff for free progress tracking across multiple requests resuming downloads etc

857827
button	checkbox
i assume your select all and deselect all button are using javascript to set or unset all the other checkbox in the form
unset checkbox are not passed on

858183
csc	vbc
go to the project directory i assume .net framework is in your path if you want to compile a bunch of c# source files not in a project you d use the csc command
vbc is vb.net compiler

858549
client-side	server-side
if so passing id is not enough as .net does not assign the same server id as client-side id
you need to access the clientid property of the .net control server-side to get it s real client-side id the above code shows how you would attach some javascript please don t call it java

859880
netcdf	proj
i have not done any performance check but it is a simple way to get netcdf in c#
in a proj we are using the ucar netcdf implementation in c# using ikvm

859989
int	double
but it does not call it with an int and a float
instead it first converts both of them to a type which does not loose precision for either value double and then compares the resulting double values

860202
vsto	add-in
the bottom line is that you need to use visual studio 2005 or visual studio 2008 plus visual studio tools for office vsto plus outlook 2003 of course to build an adddin for outlook
add-in are quite complicated to write mostly because outlook has eccentricities that are not well documented

860296
client-side	server-side
if it is i would attach the javascript handler for the client-side stuff to the button and have the handler return false to prevent postback
when javascript is not enabled the button will perform the standard html form function of triggering a postback and that will then let you do things server-side instead

860296
button	checkbox	checkbox	dropdownlistfor
if you change the state of a checkbox you always have to hit the submit button to postback you simply can t do a postback on checkbox state change without javascript
several controls in asp.net including dropdownlistfor have the option to auto-postback upon client change this is done via javascript and if that is not available the only way to gracefully degrade is to have a button that the user clicks to force a standard html postback so your server can respond to the changed control state

860296
button	checkbox
several controls in asp.net including drop down lists have the option to auto-postback upon client change this is done via javascript and if that is not available the only way to gracefully degrade is to have a button that the user clicks to force a standard html postback so your server can respond to the changed control state
if you find you are struggling to have a coherent flow in your ui if you don t have the auto-postback on checkbox combos etc then you might need to rethink your ui design and move to a more wizard-based layout

860406
apache	nginx
if you re concerned about memory usage you should see a smaller footprint from nginx than apache and the lastest version of passenger will download compile and install nginx for you with minimal headaches
if you are not tied to apache for something else i would also try nginx with phusion passenger

860899
integer	unsigned
you need to use the appropriate suffix in your case edit as andrew hare points c# integer literals are not int32 only but int uint long ulong depending on size as described here c# inger literals - msdn
mixing signed and unsigned values without explicit programmer intent can lead to subtle bugs

860961
hide	show
imo using noname is useless for this purpose - it does not hide dependencies
dependencies would still be show by using ordinals

861277
executable	upx
executable image compactors like upx are not recommended for dlls in particular and for executable that may have many instances running because the in-memory decompression acts like relocation in preventing the in-memory image from being shared between multiple processes
executable images exes and dlls and other things that are dlls in disguise like bpls and ocxs are loaded by the os loader at their preferred load address image base if possible

861710
versioning	upgrade
this is not possible on the same system vs 2008 standard edition vs 2008 professional edition this is possible on the same system vs 2005 standard edition vs 2008 professional edition if you have msdn versioning install over
you can install professional versioning over standard. vs doesn t support on the fly upgrade - fill new licence key new version. but you can t two different editions of one versioning visual studio

861915
ant	maven
it is more like okay ant not really easy to get started ivy has some issues
but at least we don t have to wrestle with maven

861970
oci	sqlplus
sql developer is using java and oci so you might have different issues i am just guessing something can be wrong
if you feel something is not running right i advise you to get that query and run it in sqlplus instead of visual query tools because it will give you the right feeling

862344
maven	pom.xml
i have been working for 6 month exclusively trying to migrate a rather big project project to maven and it clearly shows the limits of the tool
in my experience maven is good for external dependency management centralized management of the build pom.xml inheritance lots of plugins for lots of things very good integration with continuous integration tools very good reporting capabilities findbugs pmd checkstyle javadoc ... and it has some problems with all or nothing approach hard to migrate slowly to maven complexe dependencies intermodules dependencies cyclic dependencies i know bad design but we can t fix 5 years of dev ... coherence version ranges don t work the same everywhere bugs again with version ranges reproducible builds unless you fix the versions number of all the plugins you can t be sure you will get the same build in 6 months lack of documentation the doc is quite good for the basics but there aren t a lot of examples of how to handle large projects to give some context there are around 30 developers working on this project and the project has been around for more than 5 years so lot of legacy lots of process already in place lots of custom proprietary tools already in place

862886
ant	maven
chiefly standardized project structure. given a new developer joining a project when you say it s a maven project then developer knows the project layout and how to build and package the project when you say it s an ant project then developer will have to wait for you to explain more or will have to go through the build.xml to figure things out
of course it s always possible to impose on company-wide standard with ant but i think more often than not you will be re-inventing the proverbial wheel

863294
debian	linux	ubuntu	linux
it works on ubuntu debian 5 and mac os x
on linux it will report that it cannot delete non-empty directories which is exactly the desired result

863442
crypt	hash
alright so here is the answer php uses the glibc implementation of the crypt function
attached c# implementation the reason my old passwords are not matching the hash is because the linux box my old website hosted by godaddy sat on had a non-standard hashing algorithm

863699
inherited	properties
you can determine whether a dependency properties inherited by looking at the dependency properties information section for that dependency properties in the sdk reference
see the dependency properties information section of the maxheight which does not inherit parent s value and fontsize which does propagates as you describe maxheight fontsize from msdn webpage properties value inheritance an element can inherit the value of a dependency properties from its parent in the tree

863699
inherited	properties
see the dependency properties information section of the maxheight which does not inherited parent s value and fontsize which does propagates as you describe maxheight fontsize from msdn webpage properties value inherited an element can inherited the value of a dependency properties from its parent in the tree
note properties value inherited behavior is not globally enabled for all dependency properties because the calculation time for inherited does have some performance impact

863699
inherited	properties
note properties value inherited behavior is not globally enabled for all dependency properties because the calculation time for inherited does have some performance impact
properties value inherited is typically only enabled for properties where a particular scenario suggests that properties value inherited is appropriate

863842
getter	setter
the little naming convention gives away that it is not the regular getter
i say if such a logic is needed in your application the setter is the place to put it

863891
inherited	properties
anywhere outside including inherited classes should get and set the properties but within the declaring class i say it s ok to assign the private member
you could give yourself a private set on the properties which would retain visibility or lack thereof while allowing you to use properties syntax but that doesn t really address the point

864100
inherited	properties
if you pass a usercontrol into a function by its actual type it loses all of its usercontrol base class i know vb6 doesn t have inherited but when creating a usercontrol you expect certain features
so if you private sub adjustcontrolproperties ocontrol as myusercontrol ... end sub once the control leaves your your subroutine it will behave as a control not as a usercontrol you will have no access to usercontrol properties anymore and attempts to access them will cause an error

864611
range	max	range	min
more to the point though there is no support for exclusive range you cannot give a range 0 to 1.0 unless you want to be able to use the values 0 and 1.0 as well
instead once you have decided on your step size you could potentially set your min and max like this however this could be undesirable since the user can choose values between the step sizes by typing directly into the spin box

864651
profiler	visualvm
neither visualvm nor the netbeans profiler will help you with this so that s it folks
this was from jiri sedlacek - one of the visualvm develpers there s nothing like netbeans profiler api the profiler doesn t have any api for public usage

864692
prepare	execute
using prepare statements with bind variables is much faster because it means that oracle doesn t have to parse compile sql statements again and again
oracle stores all the execute statements together with the execution plans in a shared hash table for reuse

865005
freebsd	linux
you can with pain handle this by running the svn connection through a bandwidth-throttled virtual router such as dummynet on freebsd
you can also route the traffic through an http proxy such as squid that can limit bandwidth or use built-in linux iptables functions using tc for traffic control to limit bandwidth but this is often not easy to configure use

866415
ant	maven
i ll admit that i know ant far better
i m in the process of groking maven 2 but i m not all the way there yet

866914
pop-up	dialog
from the selenium faq selenium apparently works with some types of dialog but not others i can t interact with a pop-up dialog. my test stops in its tracks
you can but only if the dialog is an alert or confirmation dialog

867031
accessor	properties
the synthesize directive on properties generates accessor methods for properties so we don t have to do it manually and because this code instructs the compiler to generate or synthesize the accessor methods
the compiler will generate the accessor methods using well-tested fast algorithms that are ready for multi-core and multi-threaded environments including locking variables in setter methods. not only does using properties reduce the amount of code that you have to write it replaces that code with the best possible accessors for today s modern multi-core systems

867031
accessor	properties
the compiler will generate the accessor methods using well-tested fast algorithms that are ready for multi-core and multi-threaded environments including locking variables in setter methods. not only does using properties reduce the amount of code that you have to write it replaces that code with the best possible accessor for today s modern multi-core systems
later if you need to provide an alternative implementation for a properties accessor you can simply add the appropriate code to your class

867031
accessor	properties
you can override accessor and add checking to it
because of the above i would say that defining properties has benefits even when the variable is not used outside of the class

867301
sorting	grouping
i think trying to apply a classical sorting algo might not work here because of the typically human multi-compare approach
i d argue that you should have a round robin type approach and try to bucket things into their most consistent grouping each time

867665
extjs	smartgwt
for user interface extjs gwt is good
smartgwt is a good library and it has a lot of examples but the user interface is not that sleek

868174
put	get
put two value mapping label them incoming and default on the map and drag the output from both to your destination you will get a warning at compile time
put a logical not on the map label it novalue

868958
datagridview	tablelayoutpanel
the datagridview has good support for adding user controls in edit mode but the view i m creating is intended to be always interactive and is probably not appropriate for a datagridview
the solution that i came up with was to use a tablelayoutpanel

869153
multiplying	multiplication	multiplying	add
it doesn t need to multiplying them now because it already has the results
it s an optimization and presumably an important one on the iphone all those multiplication operations add up when you do a million or two of them

869340
children	parent
so the query translator doesn t join in the child collection instead it requeries for the children
if you skip and take then the query translator kicks in with some rownumber logic over the parent rows.

869492
inherited	subclassing
the way you are trying to do it doesn t make a whole lot of sense since static methods don t deal with inherited in quite the same way as normal methods
why don t you go all the way and make your factory in the base class pass in a parameter indicating which subclassing you want it to return

871002
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
in oo this isn t an issue when you re using inherited to extend a type because when you call a function for which there is no specific overload it can just use the implementation for a superclass
i.e. you can call printperson person p just fine with a student object if student is a subclassing of person

871320
versioning	upgrade
imagine you have an application that needs versioning 1 of libfoo but another application requires versioning 2
if you install everything into usr lib python2.4 site-packages or whatever your platform s standard location is it s easy to end up in a situation where you unintentionally upgrade an application that shouldn t be upgrade

871372
union	distinct
if you put an order by limit after a union it gets applied to the whole union and indexes cannot be used in this case
if id is a primary key this query will be instant but this one will not also a union all takes longer than a union distinct

871443
stateless	stateful
you could view static methods as a bunch of simple stateless services that execute locally
a service has a much broader meaning that includes but is not limited to being stateful

871802
boost	stl
i m not particularly familiar with the boost libraries so there may be a more standard way to do this but i think you can do what you want with iterators and the stl transform function template
the introduction to the ublas library documentation says its classes are designed to be compatible with the same iterator behavior that is used in the stl

872111
typedef	struct
also you ll notice that this doesn t work if inputiterator is a pointer -- pointers don t have nested typedef
so you can use a special struct called std iterator_traits from the standard header that can sort out these problems for you finally unless the first string is always the longest you could end up accessing a string past the end of its array inside the second for loop

872315
trojan	virus
if either of those doesnt open its window as expected you have the js redirector trojan
you can also verify that the anti virus programs avast and malware bytes can not connect to updates for some reason sneaky trojan that is

872315
trojan	virus
you can also verify that the anti virus programs avast and malware bytes can not connect to updates for some reason sneaky trojan that is
plus you ll notice that the security program of the control panel was disabled you wouldn t have seen a notification in the tray icons to tell you that the virus protection was disabled

872315
trojan	virus
3 because this is a trojan that sends back your ftp password it doesn t matter how good your password was
4 try to lceanup your pc with malware or avast it will find a file ending with .ctv you must have a virus database dated 14 may or more recent

873374
g++	gcc
the easiest way to avoid undefined symbols while linking is to link with g++ not gcc
you can still compile your .c file with gcc though

873439
.htaccess	httpd.conf
if not make sure you specify rewriteengine on somewhere in your .htaccess
edit just noticed you said mod_rewrite.s instead of mod_rewrite.so - hope that s a typo in your question and not in the httpd.conf file

873692
equals	gethashcode
the equals method is intended for value equality so it s not wrong to implement it that way
if you have a mutable object there isn t much point in overriding the gethashcode method as you can t really use it

874032
free	malloc	free	calloc	free	strncpy
you should make sure you free it unconditionally right before the return
as to your comment on strncpy not nul-terminating the string which is true if you use calloc to allocate the string rather than malloc this won t be a problem if you allocate one byte more than you copy since calloc automatically sets all values including in this case the end to 0

874142
disk	ram
the bottle neck is not processing but disk i o
have a lot of ram and do as much as you can in memory

874937
inherited	properties
but the problem is that listitem class is sealed so you cannot inherited from it
even if you inherited from the dropdownlist you cannot add this properties because you have to add it to the listitem control

875407
floor	sqrt
floor sqrt floor 2 floor sqrt 2 floor 1.41... without the outer floor the result would be 1.41.
the outer floor is not redundant

875442
floor	sqrt
obviously the outer floor is not redundant since for example sqrt 2 is not an integer and thus floor sqrt 2 sqrt 2
it is also easy to see that sqrt floor x sqrt x for non-integer x

875474
floor	sqrt
thus the inner floor is redundant
if the inner floor were not redundant then we would expect that floor sqrt n

875474
floor	sqrt
if the inner floor were not redundant then we would expect that floor sqrt n
floor sqrt m where m floor n note that n - 1 m n

877560
lxml	libxml2
i just tried my app uses py2app and lxml with a similar setup on another mac without development libraries installed and it works so there must be something wrong in your system
my guess is that py2app picks the wrong version of libxml2 i see it comes bundled with the iphone sdk for example which is probably not the version you want

877692
int	double
the implementation class actually implements the method with int thus complying to the contract of both interfacea and interfaceb
no problem here either. the commented out case of methodb being implemented as returning a double however would not work while it would satisfy the contract of interfacea it would conflict with interfaceb which demands an int

879306
salt	md5
the answer to the lack of examples is in my opinion you don t really need to salt it
the hash algorithm like md5 takes a table of bytes of arbitrary length and converts it to a table of bytes of known length - the operation is not easily reversible and small changes to the input table cause unpredictable changes in the output table input md5 output the purpose of salting is protection against attacks where user has already precomputed table of hash results rainbow tables

879306
hash	salt	hash	md5
the hash algorithm like md5 takes a table of bytes of arbitrary length and converts it to a table of bytes of known length - the operation is not easily reversible and small changes to the input table cause unpredictable changes in the output table input md5 output the purpose of salting is protection against attacks where user has already precomputed table of hash results rainbow tables
by introducing small changes in the input the results are change drastically so even if attacker knows the hash result and the salt it is very difficult to guess the input input + salt md5 output the reason for hashing files is to compute a checksum

879306
hash	salt
it would be very difficult to tamper with the file because each manipulation would change the resulting hash
salting is not necessary here because you would have to publish the salt with the resulting hash so that the user can repeat the hashing operation

880415
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
observablecollection implements inotifycollectionchanged which notifies the ui when there is a change to the collection add remove replace move reset
these are all changes to the collection not the contents of the collection and so the updates you were seeing before were due to your class implementing inotifypropertychanged

880612
gtk	cairo
gtk is huge and very useful but not at all shoes-ish
_why has written shoes mostly on top of cairo which is what recent versions of gtk use for widget drawing also so it appears he purposely stepped back to the core of ui design and created a different framework from the ground up for a solidly different reason than one would use gtk for

881185
cvs	svn
it seems that the tools to do those respective transitions have been more thoroughly shaken out than a direct cvs to git transition
i ve not tried this myself but friends have reported good success converting first from cvs to svn and then from svn to git

881292
datagridview	tablelayoutpanel
it doesn t take much to make the table layout panel to look like a datagridview if that is the layout style you want
rather than use a datagridview how about using a tablelayoutpanel instead

881424
maven	m2e
btw - it s usually not too difficult to convert an eclipse project into a maven project
m2e can do it for you and you just have to create a few new folders like src main java and adjust the build path for source folders

881433
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
the view will not appear until just before viewdidappear bool animated is called
if you have dynamic content configure it in viewwillappear bool animated

881435
children	parent
the result is that the parent process doesn t need to be aware of the forked children and it also makes it possible to fork long running processes from libs etc
one reason is that the parent process can immediately wait_pid for the child and then forget about it

882140
range	minimum
the range on schar_min and schar_max ensure that representation of a signed char uses at least eight bits
from the c standard describing limits.h some reformatting required number of bits for smallest object that is not a bit-field byte char_bit 8 minimum value for an object of type signed char schar_min -127 maximum value for an object of type signed char schar_max +127 char_bit minimum of 8 ensures that a character is at least 8-bits wide

883011
atoi	strcmp
alternatively you can write a lexcmp function that compares two numbers using 10 and 10 but that s basically the same thing as calling atoi many times so not a good idea
i d just turn them into strings and then sort then sort using strcmp which does lex comparisons

883367
int	double
however it is possible to perform typecasts so it is possible to cast a int type which are int values to a double type a floating type value
however it is not possible to try to cast an int directly to a string like

883376
cruisecontrol	teamcity
oh and if cruisecontrol does not support a command line runner or project types other than java you should have a look at teamcity as a replacement
i don t know cruisecontrol since we re using teamcity but cruisecontrol should be able to perform a command line build just call make

883866
ready	each
then the branch would have all of the sub-projects both the ones you re shipping and the ones that aren t ready yet
and you could apply the technique from the link above over and over to trunk for each of the revisions you want to undo

884249
uiview	calayer
in the case of uiview the view itself is the delegate and like you found should not be changed
if you create your own calayer then you can use the delegate to provide contents or manually draw to the layer

884951
hash	salt
edit the second wayne thoughtfully mentioned that you should salt your password before you hash
here are some basic tips it doesn t matter if your salt is a prefix postfix or infix your salt should be large random and complex

885424
freebsd	linux
on the freebsd box could give you the login name from the failed login
on my linux machine i get the lines like the following from the frequent ssh attacks this is from sshd but i would be surprised if not rshd is not able to log something similar although it might be off by default and needs to be enabled

885785
vim	emacs
as far as i know vim vi has always had the set nu feature to show line numbers along-side the lines themselves
by default emacs only had line-number-mode which showed the line-number of the current line in the mode-line not the same thing

886145
int	double
because you get an int doesn t mean you got the right int
classic example public static double sqrt double a is the signature for the java square root function

887477
implements	extends
in the example above fooobject is an abstract class which doesn t implements the bar method
instead of creating a private class that extends fooobject we create an instance of the abstract class and provide the implementation of the abstract method in line with the rest of the code

887527
inherited	subclassing
ensure that the subclassing inherited from the base class both in the cs code-behind file and in the first tag of the xaml as shown above
ensure that you have changed the first tag in the xaml to also inherited from your new basetype so becomes so to summarise the complete answer including the extra details from the comments below the base class should not include a xaml file

888286
folder	directory
this was put in so that old applications trying to save files in folder where there were no permissions wouldn t fail
most people run into this with legacy apps that try to save their files in the program files directory

889611
unbind	livequery
of course if that s not an option you might just have to add some logic into your code that will unbind and then rebind all forms submit actions to do what you want
this is what had to be done for all event listeners before the live method was added if you didn t use the livequery plugin of course

890536
ready	each
yui s strength is it s top-notch ready to use widgets
both projects have written very solid code that will not interfere with each other

891820
inherited	properties
all inherited relationships are is-a relationships
employee also shadows the title properties from person meaning employee.title will return the title for the employee not the person

891908
inherited	subclassing
disadvantages of inherited you can t change the implementation inherited from super classes at runtime obviously because inherited is defined at compile time
inherited exposes a subclassing to details of its parent s class implementation that s why it s often said that inherited breaks encapsulation in a sense that you really need to focus on interfaces only not implementation so reusing by subclassing is not always preferred

891908
inherited	subclassing
inherited exposes a subclassing to details of its parent s class implementation that s why it s often said that inherited breaks encapsulation in a sense that you really need to focus on interfaces only not implementation so reusing by subclassing is not always preferred
the tight coupling provided by inherited makes the implementation of a subclassing very bound up with the implementation of a superclass that any change in the parent implementation will force the sub class to change

892017
gridview	objectdatasource
i m not sure exactly what your question is you need to be more specific but the general flow is as follows your gridview is linked to an objectdatasource
your objectdatasource is linked to a biz logic layer via the typename property - this is the class that will be instantiated for performing data operations

892502
hash	salt
no hash are not used that way
client first sends password i suggest ssl is used server then calculates hash based on that password with salt and compares it to its data in password storage

893063
isometric	draw
drawing in a diamond approach by drawing an isometric map using drawing in a diamond which i believe refers to just rendering the map by using a nested for -loop over the two-dimensional array such as this example advantage the advantage to the approach is that it is a simple nested for -loop with fairly straight forward logic that works consistently throughout all tiles
disadvantage one downside to that approach is that the x and y coordinates of the tiles on the map will increase in diagonal lines which might make it more difficult to visually map the location on the screen to the map represented as an array however there is going to be a pitfall to implementing the above example code -- the rendering order will cause tiles that are supposed to be behind certain tiles to be draw on top of the tiles in front in order to amend this problem the inner for -loop s order must be reversed -- starting from the highest value and rendering toward the lower value with the above fix the rendering of the map should be corrected zig-zag approach advantage perhaps the advantage of the zig-zag approach is that the rendered map may appear to be a little more vertically compact than the diamond approach disadvantage from trying to implement the zig-zag technique the disadvantage may be that it is a little bit harder to write the rendering code because it cannot be written as simple as a nested for -loop over each element in an array also it may be a little bit difficult to try to figure out the coordinate of a tile due to the staggered nature of the rendering order note the illustrations included in this answer were created with a java implementation of the tile rendering code presented with the following int array as the map the tile images are a box with a box inside

893266
textmate	jedit
textmate - costs money people love this program but i haven t used it enough to see what all the fuss is about
jedit - java based text editor has some nice features but the startup time isn t great due to java

893323
inherited	properties
basically your generic type becomes a base class and il is dynamically written creating a concrete class that inherited from the generic but with the new properties added in
of course the object that is returned would be really anonymous and you d only be able to access it through reflection since you wouldn t have a type to actually cast to using it would then require which is hardly a step up from a simple t selecteditem properties

894032
int	chars
so if your object contains an int 4 bytes 4-aligned followed by a chars 1 byte any alignment followed by an int 4 bytes 4-aligned followed by a chars 1 byte any alignment then chances are this will occupy 16 bytes in memory
the size and alignment of int isn t the same on every platform by the way but 4 is very common and this is just an example

894063
post	put
see for the specifics you ve probably copy-pasted the code from a blog googling mcrypt_generic_init cipher_iv only gives this post and a blog
the iv is a parameter that you need to specify to the function not a constant that the first blogger put in misinterpreting the second blogger s article

894493
next	except
if it does not find custard the next call will be on twice as many elements as the previous call
this is kind of like binary search except only in one direction since it does not know how many items it is searching for

894539
opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and opera have this feature
ie doesn t apple safari doesn t either

894839
perl	tcl
languages that support regular expressions java perl python php
c# visual basic.net asp powershell javascript ruby tcl vbscript vb6 xquery xpath xsds mysql oracle postgresql ides and editors that support regular expressions eclipse intellij netbeans gel visual studio ultraedit jedit nedit notepad++ editpad pro vi emacs hapedit pspad and let s not forget grep and sed

894936
versioning	upgrade
but you need to remember that in order to recreate your stuff you will probably need your exact configuration you did it with in the first place and that not only means your source code but also your build environment your ide maybe even other libraries generators or stuff in the exact configuration versioning you have used
i have run into trouble in projects were we upgrade our build environment to newer versioning or even to another vendors where we were unable to recreate the exact binaries we had before

895692
post	get
as you can see this is not the limitation of dropdownlist the problem is that you cannot pass all department data to the dropdownlist and have it recreated during save like with the person because of a nature of the post request and that is why the dropdownlist takes only two values from each department value and name
my usual solution as normally my models are not the same classes as my business objects i do this by having two properties on the model get only ienumerable property and another departmentid property get set

895923
distance	polygons
then to test for the distance to closest forest edge you could try something like this google has a wealth of results for distance from point to polygons edge
if you aren t sure that the point is within the outer polygons test that first

896288
inherited	properties
grails will see these inherited properties as it would if they were written in the simpler groovy style
you ll be able to specify how to validate each properties using either simple validation checks not null not blank etc. or with closures that do more complicated things perhaps calling existing methods in their pojo superclasses

896380
hash	md5
why not use encryption to store the passwords in the database such as md5 because they will return different hash versions for example md5 of password123 482c811da5d5b4bc6d497ffa98491e38 md5 of password123 bbac8ba35cdef1b1e6c40f82ff8002ea and when you compare them 2 they are clearly different
i think you are using asp therefore i dont know if it has an md5 function built in but php does have it

896538
inherited	properties
so if such properties is inherited by the object you can not test its existence like this
the other way is to test the properties against undefined value

897472
children	parent
on linux there s a prctl call which is explicitly designed to send a signal to all of a process s children when the parent dies for whatever reason
i need to check and can t do it where i am at the second but i m really not sure that ypnos assertion about sigpipe sigterm and sigabrt being propagated to all children is correct

898272
cpu	processors
for the former you ideally want an os that will simply let you take over the cpu s completely for as long as you like so you don t have to waste cpu cycles on the os itself not to mention any other processes that might be running
for the latter well i ve been writing some some code lately that uses poorly designed cpu-bound algorithms and the new intel i7 processors has been my saviour

898419
post	get
where as a post is recognized as something that performs an action and isn t followed automaticly
on the other hand if your button is just doing a query of some sort then a get is just fine

898867
implements	sealed
when programming a class that uses idisposable generally you should use two patterns when implements a sealed class that doesn t use unmanaged resources you simply implements a dispose method as with normal interface implementations when implements an unsealed class do it like this notice that i haven t declared a finalizer in b
you should only implements a finalizer if you have actual unmanaged resources to dispose

898867
suppressfinalize	finalizer
the clr deals with finalizable objects differently to non-finalizable objects even if suppressfinalize is called
so you shouldn t declare a finalizer unless you have to but you give inheritors of your class a hook to call your dispose and implement a finalizer themselves if they use unmanaged resources directly if you re not using unmanaged resources directly safehandle and friends doesn t count as they declare their own finalizer then don t implement a finalizer as the gc deals with finalizable classes differently even if you later suppress the finalizer

899292
post	get
i had the same problem and unfortunately it looks like the answer is this is a feature. read more here ok i tried to post a link to the issue description but it says new users can t post links. so instead the best i can do is this do a google search for iis 6 form post data missing in 404 405 custom error handler make sure it s in quotes and at least at the time of my writing this the top result should be the page i was referring to
in summary what is happening is 1 your non-existent url is post d to mydomain.com somepage 2 iis receives the request notes that somepage doesn t exist and it then fires up a second request to your error handler and the method for that request is internally get

899292
post	get
in summary what is happening is 1 your non-existent url is post d to mydomain.com somepage 2 iis receives the request notes that somepage doesn t exist and it then fires up a second request to your error handler and the method for that request is internally get
and none of your post data is passed along

899292
post	get
while php does not receive the post variables from iis as you would expect php still has access to a raw input stream identified by php input which it can read the original request body from
this will contain the post variables in a raw format--i was able to use php s parse_str function to get the post variables out of that raw string

899356
hash	salt
i can t view the link in the original question the website just returns a 404 not found error but the method described in the question is not really using a salt hash
in essence this method is just using a non-standard hash given a specific password there is one unique value that will be stored in the database

899356
hash	salt
then random salt used and the hash are stored
even if i know the password i cannot predict what the hash will be since there will be a different hash for each of the many possible salt values

899926
public	protected
the only important part left to my answer is that controller methods that are not actions should not be public or at least your routes should protect them
single table inheritance is a perfect example of when protected is helpful in the model tier as it s one of the most common uses of inheritance there

900178
listview	gridview
in a project i was developing i was using a gridview but replaced with the listview as i wanted very specific paging requirements that couldn t be provided by the gridview
i could have used a 3rd party gridview to provide the paging requirements but i wanted to minimise the reliance of 3rd party code

900203
passenger	thin
sinatra doesn t have to be deployed with passenger but can easily be custom tailored to be fast
if you use things like enterprise ruby and thin you could proxy to either nginix or lighthttpd

900203
passenger	thin
it ll give you more control than i think passenger would
not to mention better performance. i find passenger on dreamhost to give relatively poor performance when compared against running threads by either rack mongrel or thin

900236
hex	binary
some will show it up as a stream of hex which probably isn t very meaningful
you could use pl sql and perhaps utl_file to write the binary data out to a file on the server

900468
waitpid	posix
there are various options to waitpid to help you quotes from the posix standard wcontinued the waitpid function shall report the status of any continued child process specified by pid whose status has not been reported since it continued from a job control stop
wnohang the waitpid function shall not suspend execution of the calling thread if status is not immediately available for one of the child processes specified by pid

900970
uilabel	nsstring
when the data comes back it calls a custom delegate method on itself to update its internal uilabel objects and then calls setneedslayout
in the case where the data needs to change inside of the cells i do not use the dequeuereusablecellwithidentifier nsstring identifier method

901077
hash	md5
that said if you actually will use the file s md5 hash in the described way your service will become vulnerable to attacks
a hacker doesn t like a particular photo he ensures that this is plain md5 that you are using md5 of image+secret_string can scare him out he uses a magic method of colliding a picture of use your imagination here hash with the photo he doesn t like he uploads the photo like he would normally do your service overwrites the old one with the new one and displays both someone says let s not overwrite it then

902955
put	get
i put this in my .bash_profile file
oh and the reason you need to type bash again to get the new alias is that bash loads your .bashrc file when it starts but it doesn t reload it unless you tell it to

903063
abc	subclassing
i don t see why an abc couldn t properly have per-instance aka non-static data members as needed to support the methods it supplies to subclassing
take the common case in which an abc exists to supply a template method dp the hook methods being abstract -- if part of the function of the organizing method is to update some instance variables for example a count of how many times the method was called then obviously those variables should also be supplied by the abc

903439
short	base
short answer you aren t using inheritance properly
long answer you defined base as being a type with individual preferences

903569
post	get
if this should not help post more details as to what is going wrong
to get this to compile add #define cfree free into r8 src defns.i and change line 51 of r8 src average.c to pass 1 to the exit command

hide	show
i think you ought to disable or hide any actions that a user is not able to perform
in the case where the user hand-enters a url or uses a bookmark from when they had the privilege show an error message rather than redirecting to the login page

904358
post	get
you may not see the headers for other-sites because they may use ajax post method or another client-side mechanism to authenticate
the information has to get to the server from the client some how

904397
post	get
still as an intermediate measure i would change your app to send username and password stuff as a post not a get so that you don t end up storing usernames and passwords in your webserver logs - it s no use using https over the wire if you re doing something that then writes the username and password to an insufficiently protected logfile on the server
you re seeing it for your site and not for others because livehttpheaders shows the url for get requests but doesn t show the content for post requests

904397
post	get
you re seeing it for your site and not for others because livehttpheaders shows the url for get requests but doesn t show the content for post requests
sending login information through get requests is a minor extra security hole over sending them post in that the urls for get requests are often logged in various places whereas almost no one logs post content

904759
uiview	subviews
i made the uiview 0.01 x 0.01 big while it does not clipstobounds
as i clicked on subviews that were drawing outside the bounds of their superview the uiview no touch events where received on these subviews

905058
content-disposition	content-type
you may be sending the page with a content-disposition header that instructs the browser not to display it inline such as content-disposition attachment
you may be sending the page with a content-type header that the browser does not recognise as something it can display inline - ie within the browser

906474
.htaccess	httpd.conf
g day as mentioned above the context for the virtualhost directive explicitly excludes its use in .htaccess files from the apache 2.2 manual server config .
means that the directive may be used in the server configuration files httpd.conf but not within any or containers

907220
java.util.calendar	java.util.date
also java.util.calendar is pretty slow so getmonth and getyear on date might be be usefully quicker
while i wouldn t recommend doing so i think it s worth pointing out that although many methods on java.util.date have been deprecated they do still work

907447
let	curry
let s use the definition of dot from with points this is and is exactly what we need to make every fully points-free sadly due to restrictions in the haskell type system this one needs an explicit type signature
the definition of is let s fully parenthesize your function and your curry version as you noticed these are not identical

908571
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
oh for animations you should look at css animations and they perform much better than any js implementations but they re only present in safari and by proxy google-chrome and firefox 3.5 -- definitely not in ie - in terms of javascript performance avoid with and getter setter like the plague and you should be fine in most modern js implementations
this sounds more like you want to improve the dom interaction performance rather than javascript so in that vein yes document.write is bad it blocks additional loading any js executing before your pages has finished loading basically requires all other processing to stop -- modern browsers like safari and by proxy google-chrome and firefox do a degree of content preloading in order to prevents loads from blocking but subsequent style resolution etc is largely blocked

908571
firefox	safari

document.createelement is in general the best solution although their are certain cases where just manipulating innerhtml on an element may be faster -- but that is not yet cross browser compatible i think innerhtml doesn t exist till firefox 3.5 and the perform characteristics are tricky

908784
strdup	malloc
so using strdup doesn t help
worse you don t know in advance how many words there are going to be so it is not trivial to malloc the space you need

909132
min	max
create view with_inverse_animal_friends select id animal_id animal_friend_id created_at updated_at status_id from animal_friends union select id animal_friend_id as animal_id animal_id as animal_friend_id created_at updated_at status_id from animal_friends if you dont want to have double entries for friends with relations both ways you could do this create view unique_animal_friends select min id animal_id animal_friend_id min created_at max updated_at min status_id from select id animal_id animal_friend_id created_at updated_at status_id from animal_friends union select id animal_friend_id as animal_id animal_id as animal_friend_id created_at updated_at status_id from animal_friends as all_animal_friends group by animal_id animal_friend_id you would need a way to decide which status_id to use in case there are two conflicting ones
i chose min status_id but that is probably not what you want

909269
erlang	lisp
and there are even more fields specially supported by languages that are important to understand parallelism in erlang or scala declarative templates in c++ or prolog dynamic languages javascript at at last you should always know what goes on under the hoods so you better have a look at assembler
it is not the languages rather the paradigms you should know procedural like c pascal object-oriented like java c++ smalltalk functional like lisp ml scala if you understood one of these paradigms in one language it is easy to learn another language in the same paradigm

909860
stdout	stderr
if it writes directly to the display buffer instead of stderr stdout then it might not be possible without a lot of work
have you tried checking stderr

909959
ant	maven
in this step you can do anything using the normal ant syntax which you d use in build.xml
maven is not a generic tool it s a tool to make your build process reusable

910171
integer	fractions
with k being an integer
if both assumptions are true we can proceed find the number of n n beign integer smallest squares squares with size n small-size the big-size n small-size in the else condition is there becouse if the bigsquare isn t divided by n when griding the big square with gid-width of n we will have an fractions part left

910522
serializable	deserialization
this means that less storage would be needed to save the serializable object
of course this may or may not be desirable depending on the requirements of the system -- this is just an example. at the time of deserialization the readobject method is called to perform any operations necessary to restore the state of the object back to the state at which the serialization occurred

910788
daemons	systemd
as jimb mentions you have the daemons write a pid file
you can tell if it s running or not by sending it a signal 0 via either the kill 2 systemd call or the kill 1 program

911526
free	malloc
since you weren t responsible for allocating it - you shouldn t free it
you can t free file it wasn t allocated by malloc

911527
hash	md5
you can grab the modified times for the files and hash them how you like by doing something like this yes it will take some time to run
from what i know you cannot get an md5 of a directory

911855
tput	tcsh
having decided that you are talking to terminal then you can use tput to retrieve the correct escape codes for the particular terminal you are using - this will make the code more portable
an example script in bash i am afraid as tcsh is not my forte is given below

912286
required	placeholder
pro dead easy works with existing show actions etc might even be faster depending on savings w parallel vs sequential requests and memory load etc cons you can t always easily save the page together with whatever-it-is iframes will break out of the host page s javascript namespace so if they required that you may need to give them their own minimalist layout
they also won t be able to affect the surrounding page outside their iframe might be slower depending on ping time etc potential n+1 efficiency bug if you have many such modules on a page version 2 do the same thing using js calls to replace a div with a partial à la same as above except pro doesn t lock it into an iframe thus shares js context etc allows better handling of failure cases con requires js and placeholder divs

912729
inline	inlining
next if you want to mark a function as inline there s no reason not to do it in debug builds as well
the inline keyword has almost nothing to do with the compiler actually inlining functions

912729
inline	inlining
and that makes it easire for the compiler to inline calls to the function
finally inlining is not always a performance improvement

913051
valgrind	memcheck
there may be two approaches writing a test tool that will use valgrind api through its library pretty much creating a custom front-end replacing the valgrind executable seems like a headache valgrind can also output xml for memcheck the --xml yes option use expect to automate your commandline valgrind actions and inspect the output write shell scripts that run valgrind and grep the output maybe look into adding this functionality to something like dejagnu which uses expect and tcl maybe these tools could automatically create bug items in your tracker although it might fill up quickly
not seen anything myself but as a valgrind user it would be handy

913108
pull	push
this can t happen when you push only when you pull confusingly pull isn t quite the opposite of push fetch is the opposite of push- a pull is a fetch followed by a merge or a rebase
so if you re in this situation whoever is trying to push their changes first needs to pull back from the updated origin master merge or rebase their version of master and then push

913360
filesystems	ntfs
compressed filesystems might not overwrite the original blocks because the data with which shred overwrites is either random or extremely compressible on each pass and either one might cause the file to radically change its compressed size and hence be relocated
ntfs stores small files in the mft and when shred rounds up the filesize to a multiple of one block its first overwrite will typically cause the file to be relocated out to a new location which will then be pointlessly shredded leaving the little mft slot untouched

913380
typedef	struct
just remove typedef
you declare a new struct and the typedef keyword isn t used for that

914482
filesystems	hfs
moreover this depends not only on os but also on filesystems
on pre os x macs hfs filesystems files were stored on two forks data and resources

914936
post	put
person returns to page not a post back gridview binds with default value page load check your session variable if a value is found set your dropdownlist selected value call .databind again for the gridview datasource to force it to rebind
you could put an ajax timer on the page enable it when they return causing an ontick autopostback as soon as the page renders and then disabling it but to be honest.

915822
fileoutputstream	filewriter
i suspect it is an oversight - note that filewriter is a subclassing of outputstreamwriter that does nothing except pass a fileoutputstream to the superclass constructor
note also that you should almost never use filewriter since it does not allow you to specify the encoding

915986
post	get
as far as i can tell from your question your problem is this your page is hit from adobe flash and apparently not with a post request as the code that you wrote expects
if the request is not a post it is most likely a get

915986
post	get
if the request is not a post it is most likely a get
you can then simply get the username and password from the _get array as follows you shouldn t actually code it like this though

916151
cpu	hyperthreading	processors	hyperthreading
i didn t work on such processors but i think you can get about 10 -20 additional cpu time
it isn t hyperthreading renamed - it is hyperthreading it is written on this webpage you gave link to

916640
equals	gethashcode
just a quick list at a glance you should be overriding gethashcode as well as equals
your equals override shouldn t perform a cast unconditionally as that will throw an exception if the object is of the wrong type

916923
icomparable	compareto
therefore we must have an icomparable constraint now the class will compile and work correctly as an array of t is valid for array.sort and there is a valid .compareto method defined in the interface
however if you are sure that you will not want to use your class with a type that does not also implement the icomparable interface you can extend your constraint to this means that when areequal is called it will use the faster generic compareto method and you will see a performance benefit at the expense of not being able to use it with old .net 1.0 types

917312
post	get
it was stable enough for the washington post the new york times and the s p sites and i would expect stability not to be an issue today
from the original press release fatwire software announced the rollout of firstsite which is a set of tools and best practices that helps companies using fatwire content server get their first web site or application running quickly while providing a foundation for future expansion

917574
division	modulo
if monthcount is a calculated value which counts the number of months since a specific dec 31 and mod is modulo division output the remainder after dividing in sql server for example you could use the datediff function in sql server the percent sign is the modulo this will group all the record into buckets which each contain six months of data
correction had it backwards need to use modulo not integer division - sorry.

917599
arp	snmp
you would do it via arp a signed java applet or activex control would be the easiest solution
it would be able to almost passively get all the networking info you need ie doesn t even prompt to run a signed applet if you are fully aware of the network that is using the service then you could probably query a gateway s client-list via snmp or cdp

917912
nstextfield	nstableview
the nstextfield deals with the actual user input whilst using the text field cell to simply implement its user interface and similarly the delegate methods to provide notification when the editing of text has ended is provided through the nstextfield class and not through the nstextfieldcell class
if you want to be notified of when editing ends in an nstableview then you need to register yourself as an observer of the nstextdidendeditingnotification you might want to read the nsnotificationcenter class reference if you are unfamiliar with notifications

918099
textarea	textbox
edit for a textarea the input#output selector does not work
this only works for a textbox

918741
int	chars
only c variable types like int float bool etc
will not require a pointer except for c strings like chars arrays

918857
sorting	grouping
if you do not use the grouping header footer it is basically the same as sorting and you should simply use the record sort
in general to conditionally grouping fields you would use formulas

919047
calloc	malloc
or alternately use calloc which will zero out the memory
the value returned by malloc is not guaranteed to be set to any specific value

919137
omnixml	nativexml
if you are open to other libraries here is a non-exhaustive list of other options you may want to consider dixml - commercial - current and very feature complete www.yunqa.de delphi doku.php products xml index xmlpartner - open source - not sure of current status check cg ngs for recent updates sourceforge.net projects tpxmlpartner omnixml - open source good design similar api to ixmldocument iirc www.omnixml.com nativexml - commercial non-validating very fast non-standard but easy api www.href.com nativexml note
nativexml is by nils haeck of simdesign.nl nils site is down at the moment..a long story behind this

919586
submit	submission
you just need to call submit on the form that the textarea is contained within edit after reading your update you just want to validate that the textarea is not blank before submission the form
it would probably be a good idea to use that object to perform the submit

919638
subnet	packets
if the first dns resolving server address in the resolver configuration is in one of the local ipv4 subnet ranges or in a locally attached ipv6 prefix with the l 1 bit set in the router advertisement and the arp nd6 cache already contains an entry for the address in question then the first packets the host will send is a direct dns query for either an a record or a aaaa record matching the first fully-qualified domain name in the domain search list
alternatively if the first dns server is not addressable on-link and a default router has an arp nd6 cache entry already then the dns query packets will be sent to the default router to forward to the dns server

919858
pull	push
pull changes into old-dot-net never push from old-dot-net to new-dot-net
should you at some point find that a change in new-dot-net is not needed in old-dot-net then you still need to pull it in and merge it

920371
prepare	execute
if you re using prepare statements do the following if you re not using prepare statements do the following when you call executeupdate stmt.executeupdate sql statement.return_generated_keys
after you execute your statement you can call this will give you a result set that contains any of the keys that were generated

920673
ienumerable	ilist
on the other hand if you are exposing a property for external consumption then do so with the most complex type ilist or icollection instead of ienumerable since this gives the client the most flexibility in the way they use the object
i m finding the conversation between myself and drjokepu in the comments fascinating but i also appreciate that this isn t supposed to be a discussion forum so i ll edit my answer to further outline the reasons behind my choice to buck the trend and suggest that you expose it as an ilist well a list actually as you ll see

921521
folder	directory
the convert extension is not enabled by default so add the following to your repo s hgrc file or your mercurial.ini file then create a map.txt file with include libs foo rename libs foo . note you can use forward slashes even on windows and run that will make foo a repository with the full history of the libs foo folder from your-big-repo
if you want to delete all evidence of foo from your-big-repo you can make another conversion where you use exclude libs foo to get rid of the directory

921679
children	parent
however since you said that your graph is stored as a list of lists of children you have no real way of traversing the graph backwards
a node does not know what its parent are

921954
children	parent
edit 3 since binding doesn t seem like an option due to your requirements the least bad option is to just add the children directly
you can do that by searching through the visual tree using visualtreehelper.getchild use it like this this code recursively searches through the visual tree of parent for a control of the specified type and name

922657
inherited	properties
both enforce that you inherited your classes from their base class as you d expect and activerecord is not intended for production use - ayende has said in a video that s meant to be a prototyping tool for nhibernate
you won t get errors providing the properties names haven t changed as most people use hql for their queries in nhibernate.however if you do change the properties names and not the hql you will indeed get broken queries change the surname properties to lastname and it ll break

923533
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
however django inherited does provide a way to get the subclassing version from the superclass which would then allow you to do i happen to think this is a weakness in django s inherited implementation since it doesn t exactly mirror the behaviour you d expect from object inherited in python generally but at least there is a workaround
since i m hardly rushing out to submit a patch with my version of the right behaviour i can t complain - i agree with carl meyer s comment it could expensive to automatically fetch the subclassing without altering the parent model s db table and returning the instance of the subclassing from the parent class query would be inconsistent with django s promise that a queryset returns the model on which the queryset was run

924105
setinterval	settimeout
edit you can also call the function with setinterval if you need to stop the loop later just do this
this should work how it works this line makes an ajax call to yourpage.php and fills the div with the results of that page note that the result of calling yourpage should not be a whole page but just a snippet settimeout arguments.callee 10000 settimeout schedules a function call in the future in this case 10 seconds

924160
floating-point	integer
to get the same feeling of certainty about the floating point answer i d have to do more and possibly more complicated thinking about whether there is any conditions under which the floating-point precision might get in the way and whether math.ceiling perhaps does something undesirable on just the right inputs
the path travelled replace note i replaced the second myint1 with myint2 assuming that was what you meant int math.ceiling double myint1 myint2 with myint1 - 1 + myint2 myint2 the only caveat being that if myint1 - 1 + myint2 overflows the integer type you are using you might not get what you expect

924160
int	double
the path travelled replace note i replaced the second myint1 with myint2 assuming that was what you meant int math.ceiling double myint1 myint2 with myint1 - 1 + myint2 myint2 the only caveat being that if myint1 - 1 + myint2 overflows the int type you are using you might not get what you expect
reason this is wrong -1000000 and 3999 should give -250 this gives -249 edit considering this has the same error as the other int solution for negative myint1 values it might be easier to do something like that should give the correct result in div using only int operations

924308
int	boolean
some comments on your code examples -- your first one looks like this while it s defined as an int when you create a cancellable event it s really not at all -- it s a boolean and to cancel the event you have to set it equal to true -1
i think this is actually a holdover in access vba from the days of access before vba when access basic lacked a boolean data type

924349
octree	quadtree
i would probably build an octree in euler geocentric xyz space because that allows me to get true distance not warped lat lon distance
however in practice a quadtree in lat lon space will probably work well enough

925387
submit	submission
note that if you submit the form by using submitelement.click then the submit that you had a reference to is considered active
this doesn t really fall under the remit of your question since here the submit button is unambiguous but i thought i d include it for people who read the first part and wonder how to make a submit button successful via js form submission

925387
submit	submission
the specs don t say anything about submission a form using the enter key while in a text entry field if you tab to a button and activate it using space or whatever then there s no problem as that specific submit button is unambiguously used
all it says is that a form must be submitted when a submit button is activated it s not even a requirement that hitting enter in a text input will submit the form

925451
atomic	interlocked
if you want todo byte bit level atomic access there are pleanty of ways todo this with the existing intrinsics interlocked and8|or8|xor8 any operation where your doing high-perf locking using the machiene code like you discuss should not be operating un-aligned performance anti-pattern xchg optimized instruction with implicit lock prefix optimized due to ability to cache lock and avoid a full bus lock to main memory
can do 8bit interlocked operations

927797
redmine	trac
i know redmine has an additional feature that checks for these bug numbers in the commit logs and attaches the revision to the bug so you can see from the bug all the revisions that were involved in fixing it
i d be suprised if trac doesn t have something similar

928013
inherited	base-class
it isn t called for you automatically like in c++ use a new-style class inherited from object with a new-style class use the super method available this will look like using super is recommended as it will also deal correctly with calling constructors only once in multiple inherited cases as long as each class in the inherited graph also uses super
it s also one less place you need to change code if when you change what a class is inherited from for example you factor out a base-class and change the derivation and don t need to worry about your classes calling the wrong parent constructors

928188
put	get
this is not a complete solution but it will put in the right direction to achieve your end goal
you will still need to go back and tweak the ejs.xsd file and make more modifications to get to behave exactly as you want it

928716
post	get
this is the kind of operation i wouldn t typically even worry about batching or people subscribing in the middle of the post operation - basically assuming publisherid known msg known on sql server
if 10000 inserts into a narrow many to many table linking the recipients to the messages recipientid messageid status is slow i expect you ve get bigger problems with your design

930006
multiplying	add
check1 goes like this but remember when you multiplying something with zero you will get zero
this means that counting the frequencies of words that aren t in both sets is a waste of time - we multiplying the frequency by zero and that will add nothing to the score

930194
asterisk	freeswitch
this may not be the answer you expected but if you plan to create a proper application for doing stuff over the phone have a look at other solutions apart from asterisk
both yate and as far as i know - never tried this one for anything serious freeswitch implement a more asynchronous interface where you can connect an incoming call to whatever sound source you want without losing control over it

930281
jndi	jta
solving this ended up requiring me to use the tomcat in-process jndi provider as well in order to associate the transaction with a jndi name
due to a limitation of that provider i could not use the default name for a jta usertransaction which isn t immediately apparent from the documentation

930489
preorder	postorder	preorder	inorder
for example pseudocode preorder function treetolist linkedlist l tree t if t not nil l.add t.element treetolist l t.left treetolist l t.right endif end function remenber if you perfomed an inorder on a binary search tree you would get the elements in sorted order
there are always different ways to iterate over a tree as there are inorder preorder postorder you can choose either of them to form your list.

930490
merb	ruby-on-rails
i know that this doesn t directly answer your question so appologies in advance but you may want to consider looking at an alternative ruby framework like merb
ruby-on-rails is great but sooner or later you bump into edge of the framework - sounds like that s where you are now

930728
vbscript	jscript
edit following further clarification in question javascript isn t or rather wasn t the only language supported by browsers back in the internet explorer dark ages you could choose between javascript or vbscript to run in ie
technically ie didn t even run javascript - it ran jscript mainly to avoid having to pay sun for the word java oracle still own the name javascript

931034
post	get
the problem is self.redirect cannot carry along the payload of a post http request so from a post method the redirection to the login-url c is going to misbehave in fact i believe the login url will use get to continue when it s done and that there s no way to ask it to do a post instead
if you don t want to stash that post payload around somewhere session or otherwise you can make your code work by changing the def post in your snippet above to def get and of course the in the html written in other parts of the example that you haven t snipped to

931176
lisp	scheme
then after reading and asking a lot i ended up choosing common lisp
not because it s better than scheme in an absolute way but because it had features i knew i d probably use in the next 2-3 years in my projects a very efficient compiler for numerical computation sbcl the condition system and.

931197
lisp	scheme
cs teachers at colleges and universities today particularly the young ones were educated using java c and c++ and they probably learnt either scheme or common lisp in a course called comparative studies of programming language or programming paradigms which was probably taught by someone who doesn t like any lisp language and taught them about functions lists symbols and higher-order functions
period. then they end up teaching what they learned lisp is one programming language lisp is interpreted lisp is slow lisp is an ai language the last time i checked robert sebesta s book it still claimed that -- but there is a new edition so he may have fixed this lisp has no oo support

931286
postgresql	mysql
all this is irrelevant to postgresql
not only is the straight_join syntax keyword specific to mysql but its function of influencing the internals of the optimizer is too

931287
transifex	django-rosetta
another interesting new translation site which i believe was built using django pinax is transifex although i m not sure if it allows direct editing of the .po files
my suggestion is django-rosetta which gives you a web based interface to editing your translations

931544
nsis	prerequisites
windows service and here sql express if it isn t installed and the user doesn t have a sql server dundas charts - call silent installer asp.net ajax v.1.0 - call silent installer reportviewer control for 2.0 framework check framework prerequisites 2.0 - check nsis system func configure iis and app.config data connection strings etc. - i do this with preconfiguring the files in the installer and writing those during install time
most of the best open source tools and programs for windows are distributed using nsis asp.net website no listing - bug in stackoverflow - code not formatting while list above

932271
int	double
use a floating point number between 0 and 1 instead of an int
it has a nice domain which doesn t change with the number of entities you have and double have a 52 bit mantissa which gives us approximately 2 26 objects before we can expect a collision

932360
postgresql	mysql
edit so it seems the only possible need for full-text search might be on description and that looks like it s probably limited enough that either mysql 5.1 or postgresql 8.3 will serve it well
me i have a sweet spot for postgresql even though i m reasonably expert at mysql too but that s a general preference not specifically connected to full-text search issues

932360
postgresql	mysql
me i have a sweet spot for postgresql even though i m reasonably expert at mysql too but that s a general preference not specifically connected to full-text search issues
this blog does provide one reason to prefer postgresql you can have full-text search and still be transactional while in mysql full-text indexing only work on myisam tables not innodb except if you add sphinx of course also see this follow-on for a bit more on full-text search in postgresql and lucene

932484
sicp	infinite
it s never too late to start sicp
and it doesn t really require any higher maths at all except perhaps in the signal processing with infinite streams parts

932746
hash	hmac
briefly some mac algorithms hmac use a hash function and include a secret key as part of the hash input
thus even if the admin knows the hash function that is used he can t reproduce the hash because he doesn t know all of the input

934267
innodb	myisam
i ve never heard of mysql with innodb disabled even by cheapest of the hosters
make sure your tables use innodb engine myisam does not support transactions

934267
innodb	myisam
make sure your tables use innodb engine myisam does not support transactions
comment update innodb is one of two major storage engines used by mysql the other one being myisam

934570
inline	inlining
sometimes the compiler can do a better job than you can possibly do at choosing what to inline especially in complex architectures like ia64 a compiler might use its own heuristics to decide that despite the hint inlining will not improve performance
compilers usually disable inlining in debug builds because they make debugging harder

934570
inline	inlining
the compiler is not required to inline the function
there are a number of reasons why any compiler might decide to ignore an inline hint a compiler might be simple and not support inlining a compiler might use an internal algorithm to decide on what to inline and ignore the hints

folder	directory
you can use environment variables as well as this folder . shortcut and up one folder .. shortcut for this setting to not be bound to a certain directory structure
you should add a path into additional include directory in the c++ section of the project options the general tab

935173
listener	eventhandler
if you don t care having the listener s thread executing the callbacks
just call the event as is but your listener thread can be blocked if an eventhandler takes a while to execute or just die if an event handler throws an unhandled exception if you want the handlers run in threads different than the listener s thread but don t care in which threads as long as it s not in the listener in the onxxx method that actually calls the handlers get the invocation list of the event and queue each handler in the threadpool

935862
width	height
what i ve done is to take the barcode and make it fit the width that i want by resizing it down
what then happens is that the height is not good enough for most readers so i copy the image and duplicated it above it so it now is the width i want and double the height of the generator

uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i know that when you assign a delegate to a uinavigationcontroller the component uiviewcontroller delegate methods are not called
it seems likely that the same is true of uitabbarcontroller

935948
gridview	rowdatabound
it looks like you are binding the same data on each rowdatabound event of the gridview
this is unneccesary if the drop-down items are the same in each row and are not impacted by any other information in the gridview row

936650
put	get
criscuolo is the closest however its still not quite right - in my usage of sdk2.2.1 i find that i have to do the following to your uitableviewdelegate which is often your uitableviewcontroller add both of the following and and if you don t put the top two delegate methods the above will cause the delete icons next to each row and the indentation of each row
you shouldn t need to do anything with textfield delegates as brian indicated unless you have multiple rows and you want to respond to a didselectrowatindexpath event - which you don t seem to get while in edit mode - then you will need to also do as he suggests

937376
queue	fifo
you should probably wrap it to protect the integrity of the queue fifo only
it would not be hard to wrap a list and do a removeat 0 when you want to pop an item out of the queue

937376
queue	fifo
it would not be hard to wrap a list and do a removeat 0 when you want to pop an item out of the queue
that would give you fifo and let you index in anywhere you want

dependency-injection	factories
i am aware that this is an example of the service-location pattern not the dependency-injection pattern but the point was to illustrate interceptors and registering them with a container not to illustrate dependency-injection.
you might think about containers very smart factories and advice to handle all the messy details

937696
floating-point	fractions
short answer python uses binary arithmetic for floating-point numbers not decimal arithmetic
decimal fractions are not exactly representable in binary

937728
base	fractions
if you re familiar with the idea that the number thirteen point two is written in base ten as 13.2 because it s 10 1 1 + 10 0 3 + 10 -1 2 then try to do the same thing with a base of 2 instead of 10 for the number 173.2
here s the whole part 1 2 7 + 0 2 6 + 1 2 5 + 0 2 4 + 1 2 3 + 1 2 2 + 0 2 1 + 0 2 0 now here s the start fractions part 0 2 -1 + 0 2 -2 + 1 2 -3 that s .125 which isn t yet 2 10ths so we need more additions that are of the form 1 2 -n we can carry this out a bit further with 1 2 -4 + 1 2 -7 which gets us a bit closer .

938222
put	get
create views in the db to access data in a more logical format make small refactorings to tables code when you get a chance if you can get away with it i wouldn t put derogatory comments in the code because it will most likely come back to haunt you
in your data access layer you could put in objective non-offensive comments explaining why you are abstracting away a particular design and how it could be designed differently

938795
post	get
i m not certain about tomcat but this post looks pertinent
however if your web server replies with www-authenticate basic for a particular resource which would involve sending the creds in clear text encoded note not encrypted as base64 you ll get an argumentexception as it s considered a security exception to send your account s credentials over basic auth

try-catch	exception-handling
this is done by simply not implementing a try-catch block in the function
catch the exception-handling do something with it such as logging it and then re-throw it

mp3	ogg	mp3	wav
p invoke can be used in a cross platform way once you have your pcm data using a ogg c lib or managed code something like this of course there are licencing issues with mp3 you will need a way to play it unfortunatly .net does not provide any direct assess to your sound card or methods to play streaming audio
you could convert the ogg files to pcm at startup and then use system.media.soundplayer to play the wav files generated

rss	feed
google s feedfetcher claims it polls rss feed slightly less than once per hour
from feed crawl frequency as the google ajax feed api uses feedfetcher feed data from the ajax feed api may not always be up to date

939691
rss	feed
rss is there to keep you up to date
if a feed publishes 10 items an hour but only shows five you ll miss five of those items and the feed isn t serving its purpose

939755
post	get
sti - example from agile web development with rails 3rd edition so if you create a customer you can then find it via person so you could have and then you could find them all by post.all but you would get back photo and video objects and post objects if you have post that are not photo or video don t forget the string type in your db table
if i understand you correctly you have post and post can be either video or photo

939808
calloc	malloc
calloc does set the entire buffer to 0 but i can t imagine it being noticeably faster than malloc+memset
allocating memory via new or malloc does not clear it

put	get
mkdir tmp out extract src.zip in jdk installation directory to tmp src cd src if you use eclipse you don t need -xbootclasspath p instead just put your debug jar to bootstrap entries before jre in launch configuration
it used to be that you can get debug rt.jar from http download.java.net jdk6 binaries but not any more

941927
folder	directory
do a ls -l on the parent directory and see what user and group has access to this folder
it could also be that the apache server running if it is apache does not have access to change the permissions on that directory

942291
folder	directory
you should definitely be able to do clean builds and have teamcity delete everything in the folder
the checkout directory should not contain any files you care about

943494
ant	maven
i never had an experience like that with ant
having said all of that i do think that maven is a very interesting and useful system i m not calling it a tool like ant is maven is broader than that for software development configuration and build management

943494
ant	maven
having said all of that i do think that maven is a very interesting and useful system i m not calling it a tool like ant is maven is broader than that for software development configuration and build management
the dependency management is a blessing and a curse at times but it s refreshing -- and certainly not the only advantage maven offers

943861
post	get
disadvantages of post page that used post data cannot be bookmark
if you so desired. longer version directly from the hypertext transfer protocol -- http 1.1 9.3 get the get method means retrieve whatever information in the form of an entity is identified by the request-uri

944281
range	minimum
in the case of an integer the variable definition is restricted to whole numbers only and the range will cover every number within its range including the maximum and minimum
however for other numeric types such as floating point numbers the range only expresses the largest and smallest number that may be stored - within the range there will be many numbers that cannot be represented

944706
inherited	properties
however if your derived class is not sealed classes that inherited from it could introduce the same types of problems by hiding the delivery properties with a version of their own
as some of the other posts have already mentioned you could use generics as a way to achieve different delivery properties types

944831
versioning	upgrade
imho the cleanest solution is not to install .tar.gz svn versioning with straightforward sudo python setup.py install or use easy-install but to make a .deb package
this way you should get the maximum benefits 1 all the bleeding edge features you want 2 proper debian ubuntu package which you may easily uninstall upgrade and deploy to any number of debian machines

945009
mp3	ogg
you need a mp3 decoder and a ogg encoder and a little bit of glue code around that opening files setting up the codecs piping raw audio data around ect. for the mp3 decoder i suggest that you take a look at the liblame library or use this decoding lib as a starting point
for ogg there aren t many choices

945073
x86	64bit
here are the explanations x86 - 32bit - can not be loaded into a 64bit process
x64 - 64bit - can not be executed on a 32bit machine

945533
postgresql	mysql
you have to use an other database like postgresql to get real blob support sorry
i do not know which client api you use but when trying to use blobs from own java and objective-c clients it seems mysql does not really support streaming of blobs

945832
perforce	svn
as i see it the main reasons for using perforce are mature merge tracking
svn isn t quite there yet

946249
int	double
there really isn t much advantage to making this something other than an int or long other than potentially allowing a larger set of hash values ie if you go to an 8 byte or larger type for your hash
if you mean using floats double as keys in your hash that s easy

946404
floating-point	integer
it s not hard to write a simple polynomial type hash function that outputs a floating-point value rather than an integer value but it s difficult to ensure that the resulting hash function has the desired properties without getting into the details of the particular floating-point representation used
at least part of the reason that hash functions are nearly always implemented in integer arithmetic is because proving various properties about an integer calculation is easier than doing the same for a floating point calculation

946447
folder	directory
you can ask for appdata folder path or for temp path
your program should not write temporary files or anything else for that matter to the program directory

946750
int	boolean
1 0 both of which clearly say that you are using an int and not a bool
in c integers are frequently doubly used as a normal number and a boolean such as for loops that run while a certain number is not zero

946750
int	chars
in c int are frequently doubly used as a normal number and a boolean such as for loops that run while a certain number is not zero
that s a use which clearly has its merits for concise code like a naïve strlen routine but while short it masks the true purpose of that snippet which essentially says loop while the chars i am looking at is not the null chars

947744
hash	salt
for each credential set store a salt along with the hash data
this is used to prime the hash such that two identical passwords do not produce the same hash - since that gives away that the passwords are the same

947750
hash	salt
use of an expensive hash is not a problem for authentication scenarios since it will have no effect on a single run of the hash
in addition to hashing salt the hash with a randomly generated value

947775
ubuntu	opensuse
ubuntu doesn t have mono 2.4 packages yet
if you require 100 up-to-date packages your best bet is to use opensuse

948313
implements	extends
if for some reason that i can t think of you re creating a custom collection class that does not relate to java.util.collection or java.util.map in any way you should still implements iterable so people can use your class in for loops
if you re writing your own collection class and you re extends any of the existing classes or implementing any of the collections framework interfaces you basically have no choice but to use iterator

948540
int	double
in the above chart the int type is represented by 16-bits which is 2 16 or 65536 combinations of values that it can represent
again like the byte the range of values can be all positives or split into positive and negatives unsigned int 0 - 65535 signed int -32768 - 32767 again int does not necessarily have to be 16-bits. floating point types such as float and double are also represented by a bits in memory but their data representation differs from integer data types such as byte and int in that they will store a value in memory as binary fractions and exponents

948563
put	get
if you re not comfortable with doing that then you can put it as a standalone function passing the date as a parameter
if you needed it in utc time just replace all the get functions with getutc eg getutcfullyear getutcmonth getutchours.

949336
hash	salt
sha1 would serve your purposes just fine but there is a theoretical exploit for it relating to being able to create a tampered document that hash to the same value nothing you need to worry about
and in case you re not doing it make sure you salt your passwords before hashing them to protect against the more common hacker attacks identifying similar passwords rainbow tables etc

949918
put	get
what you can do is use an local variable to store the fetch_status and put that local variable in the loop
so you get something like this it s worth noting that this behaviour does not apply to nested cursors

950815
super	implements
not super convenient but rather quick
the quickest way for me is usually to type a using block using snippets for an instance of the type in which case you will get an error notification if the type does not implements idisposable

951152
strlen	strncpy
i think you think you want strlen
but that isn t the right way to use strncpy functions

951152
strcpy	strncpy
if the call-site for strcpy or strcpy_mine doesn t know the size of the output buffer you need to search backwards in the code for the location that allocates the buffer and pass the size all the way down to the strcpy site
basically you can t write a drop in replacement for strcpy that takes the same arguments and hope to avoid the problems that produced strncpy in the first place and better replacements beyond that

951156
strcpy	strncpy
one challenge however is that some of your existing code that calls strcpy may not know the size of the buffer either
you could use the same parameter list as strncpy for your strcpy_mine but write it so that it always null terminates the result

951368
postgresql	mysql
postgresql s most useful features which mysql lacks in my opinion are generate_series and set returning functions in general ability to use correlated values in limit and offset clauses custom aggregates distinct on clause more advanced join methods merge join and hash join you can do wonders with them
postgresql code also often looks more elegant note that looks doesn t mean performs since you can use nice casting syntax nice record types and these kinds of stuff

951991
rsa	aes
you can compromise a cipher rsa aes..etc but this does not necessarily translate into ssl itself being broken in my view the most practical crypto attacks on ssl are side-channel attacks against specific ciphers
aes in particular is known to be vulnerable against timing attacks

952708
serializable	deserialization
your result is and that is not directly serializable
you ll have to wrap it a minimal approach and then the deserialization goes like but note that you will not be comparing the xml in any way not practical

953850
fgets	fread
if the file is unicode you cannot read it with fgets you need to use fgetws or fread
unicode characters may have zero bytes bytes with a value of zero which will confuse fgets

953927
margin	height
also you ll have to make sure that the body and html elements don t have any margin or padding
you said you specified the height to 800px and wanted the div not to stretch when the width was greater than that.

953927
width	margin
you said you specified the height to 800px and wanted the div not to stretch when the width was greater than that.
to center horizontally you can use the margin auto

lisp	scheme
scheme macros hygienic macros are completely different from traditional lisp macros
some implementations of scheme offer lisp macros in addition to scheme macros but this is not required by the scheme standard

954330
lisp	scheme
some implementations of scheme offer lisp macros in addition to scheme macros but this is not required by the scheme standard
i would recommend you look for instructional materials specific to scheme macros if you would like to learn about that style of macro

954414
post	get
if you re not getting that warning you might be using get instead of post which is not a good idea for actions which change or insert data
check your form has this attribute if you want to avoid it altogether just redirect the browser after the post back

dom4j	xom
this is part of my quest to find a good dom4j replacement where xom was suggested as one option. first read the xml fragment into a nu.xom.document then get the document and the node under which the fragment is added
again for testing purposes i ll create the document from a string now adding the child node is simple and similar as with dom4j except that xom doesn t let you add the original root element which already belongs to newnodedocument givennode.appendchild newnodedocument.getrootelement .copy

955881
dom4j	xom
again for testing purposes i ll create the document from a string now adding the child node is simple and similar as with dom4j except that xom doesn t let you add the original root element which already belongs to newnodedocument givennode.appendchild newnodedocument.getrootelement .copy
outputting the document yields the correct result xml and is remarkably easy with xom just print the string returned by originaldoc.toxml if you wanted to format the xml nicely with indentations and linefeeds use a serializer

955881
dom4j	xom
thanks to peter štibraný for pointing this out. so admittedly this isn t very different from the dom4j solution
however xom may be a little nicer to work with because the api is better documented and because of its design philosophy that there s one canonical way for doing each thing

956489
uiview	uiwindow	uiview	subviews
if you set he background colour of the uiscrollview to be celarcolor the background image will show through - so you have a view heirarchy like uiwindow uiview ----- your background here uiscrollview scrolling subviews ----- high score table here if you draw your highscore table in the scrolling subviews using coregraphics the answer in the question you linked to will also work
it s not quite clear to me what you re asking but if you want the scrollview contents to scroll over a static image you simply need to add a uiview or more likely a uiimageview to your superview and then add your uiscrollview to that

957251
profiler	aqtime
the allocation profiler works fairly well - it s not quite as sophisticated as boundschecker from what i remember of boundschecker but what it does it does well - and it handles quite a few other things too
i ve been fairly happy with aqtime and the pricing is tough to beat and very transparent - 599 user

957930
treeviewitem	treenode
there isn t a treenode any more in wpf instead a treeview has treeviewitem listview has listviewitem etc
so the treeviewitem is what you should be using in these case

958363
daemons	systemd
a daemons or daemons is a process that is started by the systemd when it starts up it runs till shutdown no user asked for it explicitly
so by definition it is not part of a user interaction but belongs to the systemd

958375
next	except
example june 5 2009 next month would be july 5 2009 august 31 2009 next month would be september 30 2009 or simply strtotime +1 month
since months are so varied in size wouldn t the best way to set the next month be something like this day next month except if this day doesn t exist next month

958889
folder	directory
dropbox one quirk here for users of instant rails is that the space in the my dropbox folder name is a show stopper. spideroak syncplicity windows live sync
portable development environment not that you d want to run from a usb flash drive but you can bundle eclipse and the jdk all in one directory as described here to have a nicely self-contained development environment how-to run eclipse or aptana from usb drive you can toss in a few more tools too if needed how-to free portable web development on a usb drive stackoverflow development tools for a usb drive serverfault tools that fit on a usb drive see portableapps for additional tools including one that will put a menu in your system tray giving you quick access to all your portable tools

a simple get will suffice

959012
children	parent
your person must not have more than three children query bumps into this issue
to achieve what you re looking for you could assert that the person types a class of parent who have three children or less

959308
free	malloc
so instead of calling free new_display you will need to loop through the array entries and do free new_display i this way you are freeing only what you have allocated
the declaration of char new_display 1024 means that you are declaring an array of 1024 elements each element is a pointer to char. the array itself is statically allocated here an array of 1024 element will be reserved on the stack. in your example you are populating the entries of this array by allocating memory using malloc and setting each element of the array this is the memory that you should free and not the statically allocated array itself

959347
nunit	mstest
adding testdriven.net or resharper to your toolset allows you to run nunit easily within vs - but they aren t free if that s a problem you can try nunitit
mstest isn t of course portable and it s tied to visual studio

959368
nunit	mstest
nunit really is supported everywhere
our 200+ developer shop just moved away from mstest to nunit and so far we ve not encountered issues with lack of tool support in fact rather the opposite it seems that the support infrastructure around nunit is very extensive

959491
postgresql	mysql
as far as i know there is not direct support of such feature in sqlite or postgresql so i use just for them but remember this is not real autoincrement and may create not unique keys if you remove something from the table
mysql supports this create table history id integer not null version integer auto_increment not null content text not null primary key id version

959561
subclass	superclass
nstabview isn t the most customizable class in cocoa but it is possible to subclass it and do your own drawing
you won t use much functionality from the superclass besides maintaining a collection of tab view items and you ll end up implementing a number of nsview and nsresponder methods to get the drawing and event handling working correctly

959738
geany	scite	geany	notepad++
if not i ve found geany to be a nice light easy-to-use editor with good python support though i use emacs myself because i know it
other people like scite notepad++ or any of a slew of others

inherited	properties
ismouseover is defined in the uielement class from which usercontrol indirectly inherited
i realized that usercontrol doesn t have a ismouseover properties but it does.

multiplying	add
either value if you multiplying it by 3 will not be 1
of course you could add special rules

960774
sum	coalesce
i m pretty sure the linker will coalesce equivalent strings so the total will be less than the sum of the parts for these sections but i guess typically not by much
i would also expect your relocation and symbols sections to be less than the sum of the parts

960895
int	double
the mp3player is not an iplay object it is an iplay int
your oggplayer is an iplay double not an iplay int

960895

your oggplayer is an iplay double not an iplay int
you can t cast an iplay int to an iplay object or an iplay double to an iplay int like that

961244
int	chars
chars whose int representations are in the range from zero through 31 are not allowed
any other chars that the target file system does not allow

961271
trie	dawg
somewhat of a tangent but if you are super worried about the number of nodes in your trie you may look at joining your word suffixes too
i d take a look at the dawg directed acyclic word graph idea the downside of these is that they aren t very dynamic and creating them can be difficult

961417
hide	show
of course this suppose you use a tool allowing to choose which operations attributs relations must be visible but this drawing setting is classical may be you tool also have drawing setting to hide some part of the operation to reduce the width for instance to show or not the parameters or their direction their type etc bouml has all this drawing options and as it was said has png and svg exports best regards and happy modeling bruno
an other way is to not show all members but only the main ones this reduce the size of the classes then the size of the diagram

961939
for-loop	loops
for example if you want to perform all your calculations up front so that you can release a resource then a list comprehension or for-loop is probably best
if you use psyco you ll get a significant speed increase for list expressions and for loops but not for generators

962164
vsto	add-in
as far as i know you cannot directly create udfs in vsto
see paul stubbs article how to create excel udfs in vsto managed code where he uses a vba add-in to expose vba udfs which in turn call his managed udfs written in vsto

962164
vsto	add-in
see paul stubbs article how to create excel udfs in vsto managed code where he uses a vba add-in to expose vba udfs which in turn call his managed udfs written in vsto
you can use managed code to create udfs however when not using vsto

962749
solaris	bsd
i_recvfd is part of the streams extensions which are normally only present in system v based unixy operating systems aix and solaris for example
others like linux and bsd do not support it and probably never will as posix now has an alternative using sendmsg and recvmsg

962823
client-side	server-side
create a client-side implementation of the stock class there are a couple of things to keep in mind about gwt server-side classes can import client-side classes but not vice-versa usually
the client-side can t import any google app engine libraries com.google.appengine.api.users.user due to both items above the client can never implement the stock class that we created in com.google.gwt.sample.stockwatcher.server

quicksort	mergesort	mergesort	heapsort
it s easy to see that mergesort does as it s symmetric but reasoning about something like bubblesort or more importantly quicksort or heapsort is not

free	strncpy
many people do not realize that it is free to return a string that is not null terminated
an additional gotcha in c is the strncpy function

here s a checklist of things that must be true before foreign keys can work innodb storage engine must be enabled
both tables must use the innodb storage engine myisam doesn t support referential integrity constraints

963326
uptime	reboot
caveats it doesn t work with all oss and you ve got to track servers over time to get accurate uptime data
netcraft does this see here for a vague description the uptime as presented in these reports is the time since last reboot of the front end computer or computers that are hosting a site

perforce	svn
it s been some years since i last time used perforce but i remember it certainly didn t like anyone else messing with its workspaces
svn doesn t like it either

964160
subclass	inherited
that is in such situations it is ok to let class b be a subclass of class a
in situations where this relationship is not clear then you should consider composition instead of inherited

jgit	egit
the egit project is implementing eclipse tooling on top of the jgit java implementation of git much stable now
original answer july 2009 we are using jgit with eclipse but are finding the plugin not quite stable enough

964555
mp3	wav
it s free runs on the mac and will convert your waves files to mp3 or a host of other formats
i wouldn t use wav

964696
int	chars
actually a tiny int has actually the downside of values not intrisecally auto-descriptive i didn t say it s the perfect solution
be exteremely careful in using chars type for enum and avoid it at all if you want your app db go internationally

965030
button	checkbox
it behaves a little dodgy and inconsistent across browsers it causes problems in all versions of ie use the click event instead don t worry about accessibility because the click event will also be fired if you activate select a radio button with the keyboard and as the others here pointed out resetting the green is easy as well so simply change your code to edit as requested in comment also change the previous td or even better turning all td elements of the parent row green
you shouldn t use the change event on radio buttons and checkbox

965351
uiview	subviews
i m not sure what you mean by in the background but if you simply want the uiwebview to not be visible this property is available on all uiview objects straght from the class reference a hidden view disappears from its window and does not receive input events
it remains in its superview s list of subviews however and participates in autoresizing as usual

966142
octal	hex
without the x the values are in octal which isn t nearly as popular or understandable nowadays. alternatively should work notice that the null termination has to be included when initializing like this
probably the easiest in c is to use the hex escape notation x01 x02 x03 x04

966198
super	extends
the takeaway from this example is super class initialization cannot depend on the child class being completely initialized
if ftw did not extends wtf then it would be ok to assume that any initialization specified at the field definition will be done before the constructor is called

966662
free	malloc
memory allocated by malloc is free when the process ends
however memory allocated using shmget is not free when the process ends

966689
coff	omf
for example the microsoft visual c c++ linker is designed for coff format object files and libraries but will try to convert omf object files into coff files if necessary
this works in some cases but unfortunately microsoft link does not support all omf record types so in many situations the linker may still fail when given omf format object files

966954
fseek	fread
from the documentation for fopen if you open a file in update mode with a permission value that includes + you must call fseek or frewind between read and write operations
for example you cannot call fread followed by fwrite or fwrite followed by fread unless you call fseek or frewind between them

966954
fseek	fread
for example you cannot call fread followed by fwrite or fwrite followed by fread unless you call fseek or frewind between them
in short you need to call fseek before you call fwrite

967713
prepare	execute
however it doesn t accommodate for the need of prepare statements
when repeat executions of a statement with different parameter sets is not directly sequential executemany will perform just as well as execute

968733
multicastdelegate	delegation
however only the system and compilers can derive explicitly from the delegation class or from the multicastdelegate class
it is also not permissible to derive a new type from a delegation type

968853
inherited	properties
because when you define them private they can not be inherited
so in your dal class you should define those properties as private only if you do not want them to be inherited

968881
openssl	botan
i am not terribly fond of openssl s api but it works
i have never used botan but it seems pretty nice

969325
cvs	svn
during the conversion the cvs repository should be frozen and after which everybody should use the svn repository
the tool isn t suited for gradually moving parts of the cvs to the svn

969325
cvs	svn
the tool isn t suited for gradually moving parts of the cvs to the svn
it doesn t create a persistent record of which cvs version relates to which svn revision number

969325
cvs	svn
it doesn t create a persistent record of which cvs version relates to which svn revision number
thus if you would convert only parts of the cvs at the time you will lose branching information

969881
many-to-many	one-to-many
your problem is that your schema has the semantics of a many-to-many relationship between ad and milbase and as such the really desired way you would be wanting to do this in linq would be ad.milbases which would then hold a collection of milbases
the problem is not made any better by the fact that linq to sql does not support many-to-many relationships directly and in reality assuming that your lookup table only defines a one-to-one or one-to-many relationship you d have to do something like ad.adbases.single .milbase of course assuming there will always be one - if that s not the case then you ve got some more complicated things ahead of you

969881
many-to-many	one-to-many
the problem is not made any better by the fact that linq to sql does not support many-to-many relationships directly and in reality assuming that your lookup table only defines a one-to-one or one-to-many relationship you d have to do something like ad.adbases.single .milbase of course assuming there will always be one - if that s not the case then you ve got some more complicated things ahead of you
many-to-many etc

971225
folder	directory
that said the command will list the changes associated with the specified revision so you could process the output of this command to help copy the desired files to somewhere after checking out a working folder for the full directory
i think that a subversion check out can only check out a specific folder and not individual files

971239
width	margin
if you are using ie7+ with a valid doctype or a non-ie browser this isn t part of the problem 2 - you need to specify a width for the footer if you want the footer object to be centered
otherwise it defaults to the full width of the page and the auto margin for the left and right get set to 0

971581
inline	inlining
this function is not thread-safe regardless whether the compiler inline it or not
inlining and thread safety are orthogonal unrelated concepts

972674
int	chars
concerning your comment as for a database structure you may try this kind of structure mysql sql create table users userid int not null auto_increment username chars 50 not null userlogin chars 20 not null primary key userid
create table groups groupid int not null auto_increment groupname chars 20 not null primary key groupid

972674
int	chars
create table groups groupid int not null auto_increment groupname chars 20 not null primary key groupid
create table documents docid int not null auto_increment groupid int not null docname chars 50 not null docdatecreated datetime not null primary key docid index groupid constraint fk_documents_1 foreign key groupid references groups groupid

972674
int	boolean	int	chars
create table documents docid int not null auto_increment groupid int not null docname chars 50 not null docdatecreated datetime not null primary key docid index groupid constraint fk_documents_1 foreign key groupid references groups groupid
create table revisions revid int not null auto_increment docid int revuserfilename chars 30 not null revserverfilepath chars 255 not null revdateupload datetime not null revaccepted boolean not null primary key revid index docid constraint fk_revisions_1 foreign key docid references documents docid

972674
int	boolean	int	chars
create table revisions revid int not null auto_increment docid int revuserfilename chars 30 not null revserverfilepath chars 255 not null revdateupload datetime not null revaccepted boolean not null primary key revid index docid constraint fk_revisions_1 foreign key docid references documents docid
create table m2m_userrev userid int not null revid int not null index userid constraint fk_m2m_userrev_1 foreign key userid references users userid index revid constraint fk_m2m_userrev_2 foreign key revid references revisions revid

973328
implements	modifiers
you could create an interface that customer implements and pass an instance of this interface to the client
this interface would not expose the contenttype modifiers to the client

973530
post	get
get your model objects to post notifications when parts of them change but if your model is properly kvc compliant and made with the appropriate kvo callbacks manual notifications won t be necessary
maybe rather than observing potentially many key value paths why not have each object in the array post a notification when something has changed then only one object needs to observe one notification instead of one object observing many key value paths

974012
cvs	svn
exactly subversion is designed to support concurrent access via multiple protocols something which causes major problems with cvs
not only can you use http and svn but also file if you happen to be working locally on the machine for example with a continuous integration tool or other post-commit hook svn+ssh etc

974012
daemons	launchd
on the other hand if you re not already using apache or don t want to make it handle svn traffic the svnserve daemons is lightweight and quite performant
on my macs i set up svnserve using launchd to start up only when a request comes in so it doesn t use any resources when there is no repository activity

974350
ant	maven
i haven t used ant for other purposes than java projects
definitely you re not using maven here some thoughts maven is a java build tool and dependency management software with a well-defined lifecycle which goes like this validate compile test package integration-test verify install deploy

974350
maven	pom.xml
definitely you re not using maven here some thoughts maven is a java build tool and dependency management software with a well-defined lifecycle which goes like this validate compile test package integration-test verify install deploy
what you are using is the scm plugin which can stick to any of the phases defined here and perform some actions but unless you make complicated changes in the pom.xml i haven t heard of anyone doing this the lifecycle will continue being executed

975155
actionscript	mxml
you can also specify more calls in mxml like you can even pass the event parameter to your method whatever you write in the value of the mxml event not sure it s the right term to use will become the body of the generated handler for the actionscript event
the reason is that in mxml what you write isn t actually the handler is what gets executed in the handler

975194
vb6	vba
this knowledgebase article explains how to do it from vba it s exactly the same in vb6
the references command is on the project menu in vb6 not the tools menu i think that s the only difference

975480
stdout	fflush
printf writes to stdout which is buffered
sometimes that buffer doesn t get fflush before your program crashes so you never see the output

975480
stderr	fflush
since stderr is not buffered
add a call to fflush stdout

976307
jboss	glassfish
a couple general containers for dummies guidelines though use either tomcat or jboss move on and focus on writing a good application
i see a strong up-vote for glassfish but i d caution that it might not have the critical mass you d be comfortable with

976475
multiplying	addition
if the integer i1 is part of the sum add it with its corresponding zero immediately to the left and if i1 is not part of the sum multiplying it
between each zero and the term to the right insert an addition sign

977839
ironruby	ironpython
ironruby ironpython are dynamically typed interpreted languages
i believe ironpython does additionally support compilation but i m not 100 sure and less about ruby

977953
directx	gdi
i m quite sure you can use that method via managed directx from c#
edit after some more research and googling i come to the conclusion that drawing via gdi doesn t happen in realtime and even if you re drawing in the exact right moment it might actually happen too late and you will have tearing

978770
ant	maven
there is nothing like it msbuild is not like maven msbuild is like ant
of course if ivy can make ant more maven-like someone could create something like ivy but for msbuild and make it more maven-like

980259
pascal	delphi
turbo pascal was one of the if not the main compilers of the dos era and delphi is still the second most sold ide in the world after visual studio so i think the dead language and teaching language bits are a bit exaggerated
note that older 1.0.x versions of the free pascal compiler sources were effectively turbo pascal compatible as in could be debugged with tp which demonstrates basic pascal capabilities

980929
udp	tcp
udp is great if you plan to have your client for the game account for missing information by using approximation most fps games do this as well as just about any game that requires very quick reflexes where tcp ip is simpler will greatly reduce errors in transmission and be more prone to lag
the main difference between the two is that udp is fire and forget meaning that it doesn t bother to check to see if the message actually arrived at its destination

981130
post	get
that doesn t mean that every reference is compressed - read the linked article for more information and there are plenty of blog post about it too. in response to another comment note that the reference itself is typically just a way of addressing the object itself
whether it s a direct memory pointer or not its goal is to get to the data for the object

982356
metaclass	superclass
method dispatch to class methods is as so the dispatch system follows the class object s isa pointer to the metaclass object the metaclass object s method table is searched for the class method
if not found the search continues to the metaclass object s superclass where the search continues

984386
udp	tcp
for most large scale mmo s for isntance udp and reliablity udp are the means of communication and reliability
all rudp does is add a smaller portion of tcp ip to validate and order certain messages but not all

984575
try-catch	exception-handling
we could also use three sequential try-catch blocks returning false in the exception-handling conditions if there are overlapping exception-handling cases that need to be handled separately this isn t quite as nice as you have to kill the server in more than one place but now we can handle specific exception-handling types different ways in different places without maintaining any extra state
in general you want to use as few try blocks as possible distinguishing failure conditions by the kinds of exception-handling they throw

984618
jar	war
if the jsps are part of a war that is part of an ear that is being deployed as a jar then i m not clear why your jsps are not being recompiled
if not couldn t you touch the jsps as part of building the war ear before deploying

984736
submit	submission
just because you use mercurial to track personal changes doesn t mean you cant submit earlier to clearcase for review
the problem isn t mercurial or clearcase it s submission 4780 lines of code for someone to review

984912
put	get
if you put two people in a room and ask them to write a business proposal they can resolve conflict fairly easily and make everything flow pretty easily
if you toss ten people on that same project you re going to have ten very different ideas and instead of getting something done ten times as fast...you re going to get something that doesn t mesh and takes an order of magnitude longer to produce

985209
for-loop	loops
here s an example of how to do a for-loop style function in scheme taken from this page guile and scheme links here s another link to a page that describes the ideas you need to understand to translate loops from imperative languages to scheme scheme looping constructs scheme is a really interesting language to learn you should also read the structure and interpretation of computer programs which is the textbook formerly used for teaching scheme at mit
your example in java doesn t directly map onto the scheme language by just learning a few new keywords as there aren t explicit constructs for implementing a for loops in scheme unless you write a construct yourself

985493
daemons	launchd
you can write your daemons in php since there are client in many languages you can also check this question
so you have three pieces here your web server without root privilege an application a daemons that is monitoring the application your problem is not launchd the daemons it is writing it and communicating with it from the web server without needing root privilege

985493
daemons	launchd
so you have three pieces here your web server without root privilege an application a daemons that is monitoring the application your problem is not launchd the daemons it is writing it and communicating with it from the web server without needing root privilege
a daemons can be as simple as a non interactive application launchd in the background i am not a php developper but searching for message queue and php i discovered beanstalkd looking at the example on the first page it seems you can use it to do the following the apache php sends some message to beanstalkd your daemons reads the message from beanstalkd

986314
rss	feed
if you are set on the client being the sync participant then take a look at jakarta commons which i think has the code you re need to turn you client into a simple web-server that ll be needed for it to act as a web-service or rss feed
first off i m not familiar with sync but a quick read of the overview suggests that your client will need to provide either a web service or rss feed in order for the sync runtime to obtain the data to be sync d from the java process

987096
fseek	fread
fseek on data in a variable doesn t make sense
fseek just positions the file handle to the specified offset so the next fread call starts reading from that offset

987648
matlab	simulink
matlab guis and the simulink editor rely on incompatible technology
you will not be able to embed the simulink editor into a matlab gui

987832
short	base
your current question is too general ask concrete questions on the mailing lists since many smart and knowledgeable people that are active there probably don t read stackoverflow mono-project.com mailing_lists a summary from my short experience asp.net 2.0 is fully implemented and i could get asp.net mvc to work windows forms is supported but will never be high quality because it s not a priority
save yourself the pain and just create a gtk# interface for your linux port the base libraries are implemented and linq db is almost there but you won t have any luck with windows specific apis like wpf and wcf although silverlight is implemented in moonlight mono is having success in recent games that need a powerful scripting environment

987922
rdf	owl
owl in general is about entailments given a set of rdf not about validation especially with regards to structure
there is no way in owl 1.1 to know if a node is anonymous or not

988871
versioning	upgrade
you test them on pre-production environment test deployment on exact copy of production environment database and potentially other systems what types of objects should be versioning controlled
everything and do not forget static data lookup lists etc so you do not need to copy any data between environments keep only current versioning of the database scripts versioning controlled of course and store alter scripts 1 big script or directory of scripts named liked 001_alterxxx.sql so that running them in natural sort order will upgrade from versioning a to b which types of objects shouldn t be versioning controlled

989767
jax-ws	saaj
actually cxf does not use javax.xml.soap saaj underneath unless its required to do so jax-ws handlers are present provider type things etc....
in general using saaj will be slower than cxf since it doesn t allow streaming which cxf would normally do

989882
folder	directory
unlike vss tfs source control repository does not support linking to an item from multiple places in the source folder structure nor does it allow an item to be pinned allow different references to the same file from different directory to point to different versions in a way that cannot be further edited
tfvc supports branching at entire source code level as well as individual files and directory levels as well with each branch being maintained individually

990029
width	height
similar to roberts html css that doesn t allow for a fluid layout #container width must be known then you do the math
to allow for a fluid layout you need to hop into the world of absolute positioning watch out for the height of #container

990121
try-catch	exception-handling
you can have a try a try-catch a try-catch-finally or a try-finally
then if the exception-handling is not handled re-thrown by a catch block or not caught at all control is returned to the caller

990826
realloc	calloc
it is also true for pod types declared at global scope with one exception it is not true for local variables or for data allocated with malloc or realloc
it is true for calloc since calloc explicitly zeros out the memory it allocates

990830
innodb	myisam
innodb is slower for read only databases because it has features acid compliant row level locking that myisam leaves out
however if you are doing a mixture of reads and writes depending on the mixture then innodb can offer serious performance improvements because it doesn t have to lock the entire table to do a write

991635
execl	fork
execl doesn t launch a process -- it overlays the existing process with another executable
fork does launch a process -- and returns the child process s id aka pid to the parent process returns 0 to the child process that s how the child knows it s the child so it can clean things up and exec

992232
boost	stl
boost enjoys a near stl status due to the number of people on the c++ standards committee who are also boost developers
poco and ace do not enjoy that benefit and from my anecdotal experience boost is more widespread

992335
boost	stl
again you should probably only consider poco if it provides some functionality you need and that is not in boost
as rdbound said boost has a near stl status

992589
quicksort	radix-sort
inline quicksort string sorting you can also use compression and encode each letter of your dna into 2 bits before storing into the sort array
radix-sort is not cache conscious and is not the fastest sort algorithm for large sets. you can look at ti7qsort

992917
filtering	grouping
here is the original note originally written by tchao when uac is enabled in windows vista--which is the default setup a thread in an administrator account will have a pair of split tokens a filtering token and an elevated token. the filtering token will have the local administrators grouping sid in its grouping but that sid is not enabled until the thread gets the elevated token after user s approval via the uac dialog or programmatically
the above sample code shows that both a filtering administrator token and an elevated administrator token as having the local administrators grouping sid enabled but that is not the case with the filtering administrator token which has its token_elevation_type as tokenelevationtypelimited

992917
filtering	grouping
the above sample code shows that both a filtering administrator token and an elevated administrator token as having the local administrators grouping sid enabled but that is not the case with the filtering administrator token which has its token_elevation_type as tokenelevationtypelimited
of the local administrators grouping

993069
queue	fifo
conceptually if we have the following elements in the queue and when we remove 1 we decide to add 42 the queue will be as the following as the queue is a fifo fifo data structure this ordering is typical
as noted in the documentation for the queue interface this is not a necessity of a queue

993319
vb6	vba
it doesn t have access to vb.net features so it s more like a modified version of vb6 with add-ons to be able to work on the document like worksheet in vba for excel
it s vba

994065
children	parent
any detached children must be waited on separately. here main waits on parent but since parent s children were indeed created as detached that does not make main implicitly wait on the children as well so main and therefore the whole process can and often will terminate before some child task has had a chance to run
per msdn you need more waiting or other synchronization and i quote when you wait on a task you implicitly wait on all children of that task unless those children were created by using the detachedfromparent option

994301
integer	unsigned
a few reasons might be the type size_t can be defined as the largest unsigned integer on that platform
for example it might be defined as a 32 bit integer or a 64 bit integer or something else altogether that s capable of storing unsigned values of a great length to make it clear when reading a program that the value is a size and not just a regular int if you re writing an app that s just for you and or throwaway you re probably fine to use a basic int

994792
cpu	affinity
for an example implementation see linux 2.6.29 arch x86 kernel smpboot.c function do_boot_cpu which brings a cpu online in several ways using apic
affinity is not determined by the cpu state and can therefore not be modified by assembly alone

994792
affinity	processors
with setting the affinity as a user you configure this scheduler
and if you wouldn t have a os which the question seems to imply i think then you re writing the scheduler yourself and you will have own control of the configuration and you will probably start with a global runqueue and for each processors core watch this runqueue and retrieve processes to run from it

996656
getter	setter
as corletk points out there is wisdom in thinking long and hard about the highest level of abstraction and not just programming thoughtlessly with getter setter that just let you do an end-run around encapsulation
however i have a great deal of trouble with anyone who tells you that you should never use setter or should never access primitive types

997066
implements	extends
there are many quality apis for common rdbms and it is usually a good idea to use those unless you have specific requirements that those apis do not implements
a good rule of thumb is to not reinvent the wheel but rather extends it when necessary

997145
hash	md5
in short unless you have reason not to use a decent hash algorithm avoid simple crcs
only use crc if computation resources are very tight some embed environments or you need to store transport many output values and space bandwidth is tight as crcs are usually 32-bit where an md5 output is 128-bit sha1 160 bit and other sha variants up to 512 bit

997309
hash	md5
it is useful to check the integrity of a downloaded package such as ubuntu because generating the md5 hash will be identical if the package is exactly the same as the authenticated source
if there are errors in the download from network interference etc. or if you downloaded a malicious package that was made to look like ubuntu but contained other code whatever then the md5 would not match and you would know something was different and you should download again from a different source

997384
cpu	processors
so when you try to read from a particular location in memory your cpu doesn t just read that one location into a register and call it good
instead it reads that location and a bunch of nearby locations into a processors cache that lives on the cpu and can be accessed much more quickly than main memory

997725
rss	feed
one screen could be an aggregated rss feed of development topics pulled from sites such as stack overflow or even coding horror
not sure what your goal for these screens is but i could see it useful to me if you had a feed with topics specific to your development team headlined

998016
16-bit	64bit
cardinal and longword didn t exist in delphi s and turbo pascal s 16-bit days
the common wisdom for years had been that integer and cardinal would become 64bit types on a 64bit compiler but that is apparently not the case

998269
subclass	inherited
edit the code in the second question is missing the int in both cases but adding it makes it ok works fine and with different values for a maxhp and cat maxhp -- in this case the subclass is not inheriting the static from the base class since so to speak it s hiding it with its own homonymous one
3 in all cases since the static int total inherited by somederivedclass is exactly the one in someclass not a distinct variable

998902
post	get	put	get
of the http methods like post get put delete etc
not just get like php would have you believe. maybe you could be revolutionary and use some of your own lingo and maybe even some utility functions i know wild and crazy good luck and have fun

999093
implements	extends
when extends the class you may create a static method of the same name but you are not in fact implements a static abstract method
same goes for extends any class with static methods

999255
postgresql	mysql
also look at the native postgresql types point lseg box path polygon and circle if you want to understand more about how postgis works and why its 2d feature implementers have a shorter row to hoe in general
mysql does not implement a lot of spatial queries -- i don t know for sure about contains but there are ways of approximating it and other functions

999347
maven	m2e
i had a couple of issues getting maven to work with myeclipse
first even when i enabled all m2e features checkbox i still couldn t check out a project as a maven project from subversion

999347
maven	m2e
first even when i enabled all m2e features checkbox i still couldn t check out a project as a maven project from subversion
that option that you get from m2e just wasn t available

999366
parentviewcontroller	navigationcontroller
parentviewcontroller is not always a navigationcontroller
here s a case where it s not the parentviewcontroller is the most immediate view controller above the current view controller in the hierarchy

999497
jruby	mri
so the only real performance difference is the fact that your mri yarv ruby applications won t be able to utilize all of your processor cores but your jruby applications will happily do so
however if that isn t an issue mri s threads are theoretically i haven t tested this a little faster because they are green threads which use fewer system resources

999840
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
windows installer only recognizes major.minor.build for installation packages files however can use major.minor.build.revision just not the installer itself so from the point of view of windows installer 1.0.0925.1 and 1.0.0925.2 are both actually 1.0.0925 if they ve got the same product code then you ll get the standard another versioning of this product is already installed dialog
basically if you want to support upgrade change the major.minor.build versioning number

1001017
onclick	onchange
clicking in the autocomplete box does not however fire the onclick event
2 the onchange event fires as soon as focus is lost if the content has changed

1001127
websphere	ibm
in practice you will need websphere integration developer wid to do that - it would be a lot of work to create the mediations manually it s not documented and it s not supported by ibm either
your local ibm client team should be able to advise you but these products are typically purchased together

1001323
entity-relationship	diagram
while not primarily a database tool it can reverse-engineer a database into an entity-relationship model then you can create one or more diagram from that model
it has a nice add related elements command that allows you to create a new diagram to focus on one entity

1001609
extjs	mootools
thats what i use jquery for not so complicated user-interface stuff. when i have to build rich browser-side applications i d always switch to the big solutions extjs yui qooxdoo that offer a variety of ready to use widgets
the thing that made my experience with mootools a rather unpleasant one was the documentation and the stability of the api i simply wasn t able to find a documentation that related to the mootools-version in use

1001751
background-repeat	background-position
since you re just using that png for rounded corners why not try the following create 4 divs one for each of the corners in your stylesheet give them absolute positioning your png as a background image with background-repeat set to no-repeat and an explicit height and width that s the exact size of your rounded corner
on a per-corner basis use background-position to slide that png background into place

1003003
implements	extends
interfaces are not inherited rather they specify what you have to implements to properly fulfill the interface definition
inheritance implies a possible change in behavior - parent class defines something child class extends that

1003028
inherited	properties
interfaces are not inherited they are implemented
the difference is that interfaces only provide a public set of methods and properties that define a contract between the calling code and the implementing class

1003262
maven	pom.xml
i encourage you to put the repository definition in the pom.xml this way any developer just grab a copy of the code and run maven to get it compiled without having to change things in his settings file
i find the setting.xml file useful just for hacking maven s behaviour in special situations for example when one repository is not accessible due to a firewall and you need to use a mirror

1003443
dependencyobject	observablecollection
it checks types to see if they implements or extends specific interfaces base classes inpc incc dependencyobject etc and so doesn t care if the interface is implements explicitly
observablecollection implements inotifypropertychanged explicitly which means you have to cast the instance to the interface before you can access the interface s methods properties and events

1003562
margin	font-size
if that still gives you trouble remove the margin and try a position relative on the child with a top 10px
finally try adding a overflow hidden to your parent element to force it to not budge when the font-size gets larger

1003732
versioning	upgrade
and the 500 price tag is for a new copy of office not the upgrade versioning
sounds like it s time to upgrade

1003774
fullscreen	minimized
we solved it by not using a fullscreen directx device at all - instead we used a full-screen window with the top-most flag to make it hide the task bar
if you alt-tab out of that you can remove the flag and minimized the window

1004041
mouse	keyboard
they generally support using the mouse exclusively but it s not optimized for this
itunes is on the other extreme -- it relies on the mouse almost exclusively as do most drag-drop dominated uis and using the keyboard only is next to impossible

1004730
g++	gcc
it isn t suitable because it relies on a very heavy environment consisting of ptrace chroot and an outbound firewall however i found there a few g++ safety switches which i thought i d share here gcc 4.1.2 flags -o -fmessage-length 0 -fno-merge-constants -fstrict-aliasing -fstack-protector-all g++ 4.1.2 flags -o -std c++98 -pedantic-errors -wfatal-errors -werror -wall -wextra -wno-missing-field-initializers -wwrite-strings -wno-deprecated -wno-unused -wno-non-virtual-dtor -wno-variadic-macros -fmessage-length 0 -ftemplate-depth-128 -fno-merge-constants -fno-nonansi-builtins -fno-gnu-keywords -fno-elide-constructors -fstrict-aliasing -fstack-protector-all -winvalid-pch the options are explained in the gcc manual what really caught my eye was the stack-protector flag
i believe it is a merge of this ibm research project stack-smashing protector with the official gcc

coalesce	isnull
all the cool people use coalesce instead of isnull
coalesce is portable and you can have as many parameters as you want not just two

1005238
django	turbogears
having picked raw psycopg2 or sqlalchemy as the technology for my data-access layer that would rule out django which in my experience only works well with its own orm -- but that s not suitable for a project of such db complexity imnsho
i d go with werkzeug personally as the framework most suitable for highly complex projects requiring ridiculous amounts of flexibility and power -- though pylons and turbogears 2 on top of it may be acceptable as a fall-back if the team just doesn t have the web app experience and skill it takes to make truly beautiful music with a flexible framework such as werkzeug

1005620
post	get
i couldn t comment otherwise i would have added to vinko vrsalovic s post the id generated by a sequence can be obtained via insert into table values sequence.nextval otherval select sequence.currval ran in the same transaction as to get a consistent view. updating de sequence after getting a nextval from it is an autonomous transaction
otherwise another session would get the same value from the sequence

1005911
inherited	subclassing
and you probably shouldn t add it if the method makes sense in your class regardless of any implemented interfaces or inherited abstract methods
i tend to prefer the use of override in this case so that the method gets flagged in the subclassing if the superclass changes either removing the method altogether or changing its signature etc.

1006227
int	chars
this is because a string at least in c c++ is not quite the same sort of thing as an int
if we re talking c-style strings then an array of them like what is actually happening under the hood is that test is an array of pointers each of which point to the actual data where the chars are

1006425
for-loop	arrays
if you re looping through an arrays it shouldn t matter - the enhanced for-loop uses arrays accesses anyway
for example consider this code when decompiled with javap -c test we get for the main method now change it to use an explicit arrays access this decompiles to there s a bit more setup code in the enhanced for-loop but they re basically doing the same thing

1006868
arduino	avr-gcc
this is done automatically by the arduino ide when it launches avr-gcc other issues some of the supplied include files are not c++ safe they need to be wrapped with
the arduino software uses avr-gcc to compile sketches

1006868
arduino	avr-gcc
the arduino software uses avr-gcc to compile sketches
supported virtual functions constructors and destructors including global ones not supported c++ standard functions classes and template classes but see this port of uclibc++ for arduino operators new and delete attempting to use them will cause the linker to complain about undefined external references

1007483
inherited	properties
it defines the internal data storage of an object it defines the messages an object can understand and if there is inherited which is not mandatory for oo programming
classes also defines from which other class or classes if multiple inherited is allowed this class inherits and which properties if selective inherited exists

1007835
post	get
post your code for the databound element and the web.config to be safe and we can take a look at it
edit i think the problem is that you are trying to get the connection string from the appsettings area and programmatically that is not where it exists

1008027
put	get
you shouldn t put extra code in your settranslate since it won t get called
from msdn here implications for custom dependency properties because the current wpf implementation of the xaml processor behavior for property setting bypasses the wrappers entirely you should not put any additional logic into the set definitions of the wrapper for your custom dependency property

1008027
put	get
if you put such logic in the set definition then the logic will not be executed when the property is set in xaml rather than in code
similarly other aspects of the xaml processor that obtain property values from xaml processing also use getvalue rather than using the wrapper. therefore you should also avoid any additional implementation in the get definition beyond the getvalue call

1008628
client-side	server-side
you must create client-side code then have the server side print an invocation of said code
as for server-side redirection applying to the whole window again such can not occur without the same approach

1008666
equals	gethashcode
first off - do not implement equals only in terms of gethashcode - hashcodes will sometimes collide even when objects are not equals
the contract for gethashcode includes the following different hashcodes means that objects are definitely not equals same hashcodes means objects might be equals but possibly might not andrew hare suggested i incorporate his answer i would recommend that you read this solution by our very own jon skeet by the way for a better way to calculate a hashcode

1008704
post	get
http post is not encrypted it can be intercepted by a network sniffer by a proxy or leaked in the logs of the server with a customised logging level
yes post is better than get because post data is not usualy logged by a proxy or server but it is not secure

1008704
post	get
yes post is better than get because post data is not usualy logged by a proxy or server but it is not secure
to secure a password or other confidential data you must use ssl or encrypt the data before you post

1008807
ssl	https
if it is very important drop the ajax and pick up a ssl certificate and use the https layer
you could make your own ssl certificate for free it wouldn t be trusted by general users but you can trust it

1009015
opera	google-chrome
opera 10 does not support the audio element though it does support an older version of it in the form of an audio object
google-chrome 3 will likely support the audio element

1010388
int	chars
in this case chars could be either a signed or unsigned int type -- its signedness is implementation-defined
fortunately though an int can represent all possible values of a chars whether or not chars is signed assuming you re on a system where chars s are 8 bits and int s are at least 16 bits

1010388
int	chars
fortunately though an int can represent all possible values of a chars whether or not chars is signed assuming you re on a system where chars s are 8 bits and int s are at least 16 bits
if chars is signed then the second paragraph above applies so both operands are converted to int the type with higher rank

1010388
int	chars
the unsigned chars would be converted to 152 as an int which is greater than 7
do not ever rely on chars s being signed or unsigned

1010593
ant	maven
troubleshooting the build maven is less reliable than ant especially the non-core plugins
also maven builds are not repeatable

1010631
pascal	delphi
generally the turbo pascal versions were imo.
though some of the additions to the delphi language were not

1010977
minix	linux
though if your looking for good kernel source to read i wouldn t go with linux it s a beast of a hack about like saying the gcc sources are fun instead you may wish to try minix or one of the bsds darwin is basically a branch of netbsd iirc or even one of the many free dos clones if everything else is a little too scary
it s been recommended by quite a few people that v0.0.1 of linux is the easiest to understand

1011238
bazaar	git
if by code management you are referring to file and directories and renaming go with bazaar
if by code management you are looking at content management git is designed to manage just that the staging area for instance allows you to record what current content you want to commit even though you have already begun to make some large modification you end up not wanting to commit in the current branch to be sure re-read linus s original vision for git back in april 2005

1011950
bazaar	git
i have used bazaar extensively for personal projects for a couple of years since the 0.8 days but i have switched to git last year and never looked back at least for source code management
i am too lazy to rewrite my own impression but to sum it up bazaar works more consistently across platforms bazaar is more discoverable if you are given the tool wo any documentation any semi-competent user will be able to use bazaar that s not so true with git bazaar is easier to extend in an api way git is easier to extend in a unix way pipes git is immensely more powerful imho

1011950
bazaar	git

in particular i am convinced that their approach for rename handling and content tracking is the right one for many cases the bazaar revno system is not good imho

pop-up	dialog
i m not so sure about how you should pop-up help about them however
in that dialog press f1 then search that page for more information on regular expressions

1013600
hash	salt
hash passwords cannot be retrieved in general this depends on the hashing function secure hash cannot be retrieved
if they have the same hash on two sites they could have the same password this depends on the hash salt used by the sites what method etc

1013962
maven	pom.xml	ant	pom.xml	ant	maven
you don t need to have maven or a pom.xml file just ant and this build file using a command line like the following will do what you want the inspiration for this came from this excellent blog post
i m not sure if there is a maven plugin to handle this but it is fairly simple to use the maven ant tasks for this purpose

1014089
submit	submission
the user would submit their form and then have to wait to see if the business logic on the server-side would actually allow that entry or not
it also helped out during development when i could take my server down and still have the form submission fail decently

1014498
for-loop	loops
also note that if i was 0 when it got tested in the condition then it will be 1 in loops body for the while example so if i is an index for an arrays or something and not just keeping track of loops iterations you d be better to stick with just a for-loop which increments i after each iteration
safe here meaning less likely to enter an infinite loops

1016625
free	malloc
rational quantify is an example of a commercial one but there are many free profilers out there too
one fairly low-tech way i could ensure of not crossing a maximum threshold of memory in your application would be to define your own special malloc function which keeps count of how much memory has been allocated and returns a null pointer if the threshold has been exceeded

1016725
onchange	onsubmit
1 a very simple way to handle this is to start with the onchange event the major drawback here is that the textarea will not update until the focus has left the textarea
2 you should be able to adapt the above example to a form validation function that fires on the form s onsubmit event

1017170
debian	centos	ubuntu	centos
if you re using debian or ubuntu something like apt-get install texlive ..will get it installed
redhat or centos need yum install tetex note this needs root permissions so either use su to switch user to root or prefix the commands with sudo if you aren t already logged in as the root user

1017208
versioning	upgrade
once the first versioning of the database has been put into production you will need not only build scripts mainly for developers but also upgrade scripts based on the same principles there must be a way to retrieve the versioning from the database i use a stored procedure but a table would do as well
before releasing a new versioning i create an upgrade.sql file that can call other ones that allows upgrading versioning n-1 to versioning n n being the versioning being released

1017261
komodo	notepad++
padre is getting better but it s currently not quite up there with komodo or epic
that said it is comparable with ultraedit or notepad++ at this point less than a year after the first line of code was written

1017378
put	get
from my experience and talks with friends when a company wants to get this kind of certificate several objectives are followed at marketing level it might be good to be able to put this label some customers might want this kind of certificate in order to contract you you really want to improve your q a a lot of companies are only focusing on the two first points and basically the q a team write procedures that the teams will need to learn a few days before the authority audit .
once they have the certificate they just forgot about them - if you are not interested in the first two points the other way to go is to get the spirit of these certifications and try to introduce it little by little in the company

1017825
public	protected
thus whilst the public internal identifiers are used here for consistency really the state in il is simply public or nonpublic as the reflection.emit flags show
yes you just cannot make them top level classes they must be inner classes this is fine it means that the only classes allowed to see foo are sub classes of outer note that you cannot declare any outer class as private protected or protected internal in c# since the access modifier for outer level classes defines their visibility in relation to other assemblies

1018164
free	malloc
this approach doesn t work if you want to limit your process to 10 while other processes are running but if you want to ensure that you have 50 cpu free then it works fine
for memory limitations you are either stuck implementing your own layer on top of malloc or taking advantage of your os in some way

1018865
alloca	malloc
one of the oss projects i work on uses it extensively and as long as you re not abusing it alloca ing huge values it s fine
once you go past the few hundred bytes mark it s time to use malloc and friends instead

1018867
alloca	malloc
by using alloca you dramatically increase your chances of getting a stack overflow error if you re lucky or an inexplicable crash if you re not
processes only have a limited amount of stack space available - far less than the amount of memory available to malloc

1019063
put	get
plus you need to go through all your code and where ever you used a refernce to the filed being null or not being null you need to rewrite to exclude or include based on the possible bad values someone will put in becasue the data is not allowed to be null
i do a lot of data imports from client data and every time we get a file where some field that should allow nulls does not we get garbage data that needs to be cleaned up before we import to our system

1019357
post	get
and finally a good long article that goes into great detail i d post more but so says i am too noob - how to design for browser sizes - baekdal.com
i get questions a lot from designers about not only width but what height to use to keep everything above the fold

1019357
width	height
i get questions a lot from designers about not only width but what height to use to keep everything above the fold
here is one answer i gave recently - for width i m not a designer but i ve read that 960px width is the way to go these days because it lends itself to being divided into columns that look nice and fits nicely within most displays

1019433
vim	emacs
gnu emacs microemacs xemacs jed or a vi clone such as elvis ftp www vile vim for vi lovers in general windows or elsewhere vi nvi available from cpan in src misc is yet another vi clone unfortunately not available for windows but in unix platforms you might be interested in trying it out firstly because strictly speaking it is not a vi clone it is the real vi or the new incarnation of it and secondly because you can embed perl inside it to use perl as the scripting language
nvi is not alone in this though at least also vim and vile offer an embedded perl

1019601
hdd	floppy
frankly if a program had an icon for saving that was something like a memory stick or hdd most users wouldn t be able to pick it out as the save icon
i think in general the floppy disc icon has become the accepted save icon even if it doesn t have much bearing any more with flash memory and dvd s being pretty ubiquitous

1019649
accessor	properties
properties are a runtime supported method of exposing a pair of get set methods that have metadata support which means they are discoverable using reflection without guessing what methods are supposed to form the accessor based on method name and signature
the other advantage of properties is that they act like fields syntactically and not like methods which has the advantage of creating more clean code

1019649
inline	inlining
most of the time properties are inline by the jit engine because they are very simple which means most of the time properties act like fields more than they act like functions so they are closer to how fields behave than functions
in the case of properties it doesn t mater if there is ambiguity between a function call and field access because for the greatest part you don t pay the function call cost property getters and setters because of their simplicity are high candidates for inlining which means that cost wise the are closer to fields than function calls

1019915
inherited	subclassing
you can use the type object to dynamically construct a class given a name tuple of base classes and dict of methods class attributes eg mysub is now a subclassing of drvcrystalfontz and some_other_class inherited their methods and adds a new one some_extra_method
i m not sure i m clear on your desired use here but it is possible to subclassing dynamically

1020038
vim	emacs
after a while you start to compartmentalize the two mentally and you probably won t have much difficulty though i still occasionally wq emacs and c- vim it doesn t happen often enough to be a problem
read the emacs documentation thoroughly

1020038
vim	emacs
you aren t going to forget vim and replace it in your brain with emacs
if you know vim and you learn emacs then you will know both

1021276
mp3	ogg
xiph the people behind ogg vorbis have published a comparison between the leading codecs rm mp3 wma aac and ogg - you can listen and compare each of the codecs
if your data is already in mp3 a lossy format it would not be advisible to convert it particularly to another lossy format

1021570
post	put
and the method in your post doesn t work because.
if for some reason you really need to fiddle with the builtin flatpage class and edit it dynamically you can hook to the class_prepared signal edit here s how you d do it with a class_prepared put this in say signals.py in the same directory as your settings.py and add signals to the top this is important to make sure the signal handler gets installed in time of the installed_apps list

1021749
floating-point	fractions
seconds may be a floating-point value
on operating systems that do not support waiting for fractions of a second floating-point values are rounded down to the nearest integer. if optional arg nodisp is t don t redisplay just wait for input. redisplay does not happen if input is available before it starts

1022505
inherited	properties
incidentally the in operator on an instance of this blackmagic class is faster as it happens than with any of the previously proposed solutions -- or at least so i m measuring with my usual trusty -mtimeit going directly to the built-in method instead of following normal lookup routes involving inherited and descriptors shaves a bit of the overhead
a metaclass to automate the self.__class__ -per-instance idea would not be hard to write it could do the dirty work in the generated class s __new__ method and maybe also set all magic names to actually assign on the class if assigned on the instance either via __setattr__ or many many properties

1022646
persistent	transient
i shouldn t need to double the number of model classes just to have transient versions of my objects not when i want them to behave exactly the same sans persistent
yes the other option is to have an in-memory persistent store which houses all of the entities you want to be transient

1022683
for-loop	loops
in javascript the body of a for-loop doesn t introduce a new scope so any functions declared in loops body all reference the same outer variables
in lua each iteration of the for-loop creates new local variables for each loops variable

1023509
hash	salt
then compare the result with the stored hash
you re not actually using a salt

1023705
submit	submission
if something failed like in case javascript being disabled make your fallback script output page with a hidden data field so it should not be modified anymore and visible submit button posting data to a proper location
you may try changing the action attribute of your form using javascript just before form submission

1025127
for-loop	loops
in all browsers. so if it s not that important for order in which elements of your loops get processed you should be using while i-- form also if you have to use for-loop going forward remember always to cache .length property to join large strings use arrays it s faster it s much faster than inside an loops
the fastest loops in javascript are while i-- ones

1025627
inherited	base-class
let s say t base-class is of type stream and u is of type memorystream inherited class you cannot assign a stream to a variable of type memorystream
your code boils down to the line where you try to assign a baseclass to an inherited class which is impossible

1025819
getter	setter
a property is actually some syntactic sugar and is implemented by 2 methods a getter method and a setter method
so i think that you should be able to determine if a property is abstract by checking if the getter and or setter are abstract like this and afaik a field cannot be abstract

1026213
int	chars
function atoi converts string to int not only one chars
function at gives pointer to chars in the string

1026214
try-catch	exception-handling
the alternative is to put the try-catch around your own code
most of the calls to your wndproc end up in defaultwindowproc which doesn t throw c++ exception-handling

1028119
actionscript	mxml
for what it s worth as far as i know file size is not increased by using mxml as the mxml is converted to actionscript before the swf is created
so the best answer to your question may be to just go ahead and use mxml

1028276
spaces	delimiter
i can t trim the string because it only removes white spaces and technically this isn t white spaces
it sounds like you have non-tab whitespace characters in your string as well as being tab delimiter

1028434
dom4j	xom
the only shortcoming i ve found is that it doesn t directly support streaming xml unlike dom4j where i m coming from but with a simple workaround it can stream just fine
you might want to check this question about the best xml library and its top xom answer

1030112
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
it isn t magic it is a uinavigationcontroller that instantiates a uiviewcontroller internally a uitableview that is populated with your address book contacts and sets the uiviewcontroller as its root view
you can indeed create your own similar uinavigationcontroller subclass

1030559
width	height
i believe the reasoning is something like this let s say you have a method that accepts a rectangle and adjusts its width it should be perfectly reasonable given what a rectangle is to assume that this test would pass .
because changing a rectangle s width does not affect its height

1030707
hex	binary	octal	binary
here is a short-list of binary representation topics for study numbering systems binary hex octal decimal ... binary data organization bits nibbles bytes words ... binary arithmetic other binary operations and or xor not shl shr rol ror ... type representation boolean int float struct ... bit fields and packed data finally...here is a nice set of bit twiddling hacks you might find useful
if you are developing lower-level code it is critical that you understand the binary representation of various types

children	parent
parent vm knows children intimately but child does not know parent
child vm publishes event on event hub that parent listens to mediator pattern

1031386
comparator	comparable
enum doesn t implement but it does implement comparator
so an enum can be the t in a where clause like where t comparator but this gives an error and then i suppose you d like someclass to be comparable

1032307
maven	pom.xml
after some more research i finally came to the conclusion that this is not possible for two reasons in the current maven version 2.1.0 maven profiles are not inherited so you can t define a profile in a parent pom.xml and activate that in a child pom.xml
i haven t found a possibility to activate a profile from a pom.xml itself

1032426
filtering	grouping
you should be able to create a query with this filtering here and when you run that against your ldap server if you get a result your user yourusername is indeed a member of the grouping cn yourgroup ou users dc yourdomain dc com try and see if this works
if you use c# vb.net and system.directoryservices this snippet should do the trick word of caution this will only test for immediate grouping memberships and it will not test for membership in what is called the primary grouping usually cn users in your domain

1032488
automake	autotools
edit 2013-08-26 note that an automake project using a subdirectory named using obj is not portable to bsd make
the gnu build system does not use obj directories so the autotools are not designed to support that

1033669
int	chars
chars whose int representations are in the range from zero through 31 are not allowed
any other chars that the target file system does not allow

1033785
super	implements
the platform is super young though and it ll be worth it to implements in the long run
i wouldn t recommend replacing a traditional user pass system completely right now but it s great for linking accounts and posting wall posts to user feeds which is pretty easy to implements

1034421
put	get
i don t know if this will help but what i always do is in the parent s pom put the dependencies in a dependencymanagement block
then in the child pom list the dependencies again but without the version and exclusions but to be honest for my first and only assembly i couldn t get it to work in a child module and put it in the parent s pom

1034998
hash	md5
i m not sure about this but i always thought hash can t be decrypted only compared to another hash
md5 generates a hash

1035069
move	drag
the jquery ui sortable should allow you to move items up and down within a column it s a little confusing because the jquery site also has a sortable page with a demo that currently doesn t appear to work
you might also need the jquery ui droppable the droppable will allow you to drag and drop from one column to the other

1035179
scons	autotools
scons is better but cross compiling is not its strong point
it is not a build system like cmake or autotools either it is only a build tool

1035308
ssl	https
in addition the use of ssl is necessary to ensure that communication across existing proxies is not broken
one of the big issues with using https is that its considered secure and so most web browsers don t do any caching or at least do very limited caching

1035522
int	chars
double parens are used for int math
indyk1ng the # is not treated as a comment since the escapes the next chars

1035522
int	boolean
later in the script the use of single brackets for int addition is not recommended
the single brackets are evaluating an expression to a boolean

1035701
inherited	properties
largely however interfaces allow a contract to be specified for an object that doesn t require an inherited model
lets say i have class foo that has functions x and y and properties z and i build my code around it

1035833
rtos	qnx
if you aren t locked into your version of wince you might want to look into tenasys who claims to offer an rtos running side-by-side with windows on standard hardware
i ve also heard good things about qnx but i haven t used their products either

1035838
multiplying	add
if the first part contains a we multiplying that number by a random interger 1 to number after d inclusive
if the first part doesn t contain a we take first number random rolls just like previous line and add them up this is the map reduce in the middle

1036192
mouseover	mouseenter
mouseover event handling is great for a state change but less so for some kind of interaction like an alert
what is likely happening is the mouseover is being fired multiple times note mouseover is not the same as mouseenter -- note not well supported see for more details on mouse events

1036343
inherited	properties
if you are passing a type of personas to your partial view as it s model then it needs to inherited not the same type as the parent view
the partial view cannot just know that your parent view model type has a properties of type personas and somehow map the object you pass into it to that properties

1036866
int	boolean
perl doesn t have a native boolean type but you can use comparison of int or strings in order to get the same behavior
alan s example is a nice way of doing that using comparison of int

1037510
firefox	safari
indeed firebug in firefox shows the computed style for this element as having 0px for marginleft and marginright but this is non-zero in safari
as expected changing from margin-left to marginleft makes no difference nor does accessing the attribute directly like .container_16 not first 0 .style.marginleft because firefox is computing it wrong in the first place

1037588
post	get
i was originally going to post this as a comment but decided to expound a bit more
strictly speaking get doesn t take an argument

1037909
daemons	systemd
it also should be emphaised that on unix systemd daemons mode of mod_wsgi must be used and you must implement the code monitor described in the documentation
the whole process reloading option will not work for embedded mode of mod_wsgi on unix systemd

1037976
solaris	irix
in solaris 2.0 and 2.2 the load average did not include the running jobs but this bug was fixed in solaris 2.3
consider that there are two basic modes to display load irix mode and solaris mode

1038145
factors	mean	multiplying	add
generate standard normal independent deviates and then transform by multiplying by the cholesky factors of the covariance matrix
add in the mean at the end if the mean was not zero

1038413
hash	md5
1 the primary purpose of a hash is to map a very very large space to a smaller but still very large space md5 which will take anything and convert it into a space of size 2 128 -- big but not nearly as big as aleph-0. in addition to other features good hash fill the destination space homogeneously
bad hash fill the space in a clumpy fashion coming up with the same hash for many common inputs

1038413
hash	md5
in truth md5 isn t perfect which is one of the things that makes it vulnerable. but it will still be true that a huge number of inputs will map to any given hash because the input space is infinite and dividing infinity by 2 128 still gives you infinity
2 yes hashes always cause data loss except in the case where your output space is the same as or larger than your input space -- and in that case you probably didn t need to hash

1039257
capitalize	capitalization
the final function in the text area looks like this maybe add some code to capitalize some words like really and here
regex replacement cannot execute function like capitalization on matches

salt	md5
you didn t salt the password
also md5 is considered not strong enough for hashing passwords

1039459
multiplying	add
multiplying the result by 9 and divide it by 8 and get the integer result floor not round
then add 1

1039478
short	base
depending on the specifics of the database and nodes you can also throw in other rules for cutting short your path searches if you happen to know that departure and destination are 1000 miles apart and your path traced so far has you flying 3000 miles and you re still not there screw it move on to the next path search
at the base you re going to view your city network as a tree with departing city as root and each departing flight being a pointer to a child

nexus	artifactory
that said i have never used nexus and cannot really help you with a proper feature comparison
here are some things off the top of my head that i really like about artifactory keep in mind nexus may have these features too nice web 2.0 interface

lisp	smalltalk
it can be done in smalltalk and in lisp
there are possibly other systems in which this is possible but i m not aware of them. - alan kay creator of smalltalk

opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
as far as i know opera 9 and webkit safari google-chrome do it on pcs and rumour has it that ff3.5 will also be able
actually since apple added svg support to iphone s safari just half a year ago i m not sure if it works but it s worth a try

1040719
integer	fractions
you can then multiply it to get the fractions part represented as an integer at whatever precision you d like
mapping the fractions portion to an integer has some challenges - many floating point numbers cannot be represented as a base-10 integer and thus may require more digits to represent than an integer can support

1040886
factors	mean
best probably depends on a lot of factors
if by best you mean most performant here are some points to consider xml is not the best way at all binary serialization is far more efficient

1041524
prng	random
in fact performing any additional actions from a number returned by a prng doesn t really increase its randomness and in fact the number can become less random
so my best advice is don t mess around with values returned from a prng

1041539
apache	nginx
thus using keep alive on the apache side is pointless when using nginx in front of it
because though nginx doesn t implement keep alive it should drop the connections promptly as it will have no intention of reusing them so you shouldn t suffer if you do forget to turn of keep alive in apache when using nginx as front end

1041677
cdr	cons
a list is a series of cons cells where each car holds some value and each cdr points to the respective next cell the last cdr pointing to nil
when you write cons a-list x this creates a new cons cell with a reference to a-list in the car and x in the cdr which is most likely not what you want

1041819
post	get
there s a post here that will get you started
update apparently that post is a bit dated and does not include some details specific to access 2007

1042059
subclass	inherited
the reason is that a base class s constructors will not know how to initialize the subclass s members so having them invoked would put the subclass object in a bad state
as you suspect constructors are not inherited

1042059
inherited	subclassing
as you suspect constructors are not inherited
subclassing need to implement their own constructors

1042462
try-catch	exception-handling
there s not a problem with using try-catch in this case but you could at least catch more specifically comexception
you are using exception-handling handling the right way to fail gracefully from a specific situation that you know how to recover from

1042947
post	get
the following msdn post has a sample of this and more info can be found on this blog regarding secure mex endpoints
if so try 2 seperate bindings - one for the mex endpoint and one for the wshttp so for the service - something like and for the mex endpoint no security service endpoints will be something like with this setup it s not applying the security for mex so you shouldn t get that message when trying to update service reference

1043812
int	double
when casting double to int the decimal places are truncated and not rounded
you don t need to cast double are casted automatically to int if needed. you should add 0.5 to the dprogress value when setting position in order for it to be properly rounded

1044548
lisp	scheme
if you d show me an example of using eval in common lisp i could try to come up with other methods of doing the same thing
i m not a scheme programmer

1044678
recursive-descent	lalr
with such tools it really doesn t matter if the algorithm is directly-encoded recursive-descent or table-driven ll k
as a matter of interest it is also worth looking into recursive-ascent which is a parsing algorithm directly encoded after the fashion of recursive-descent but capable of handling any lalr grammar

1045734
hash	md5
these are the properties of hash functions in general
a word of caution though md5 shouldn t be used anymore because of vulnerabilities that have been found in it

1045893
daemons	systemd
your code essentially hands off the sending of the message to a queue daemons that runs on the server and sends whatever mails are in the queue in a separate process thereby not holding up your asp script from finishing its execution
persits produces the well-known aspemail com component that comes with a mail queuing systemd that will do what you need

1046066
hash	salt
the actual hash in your case is after the 2nd the reason for this is so you can have many types of hash with different salt and feeds that string into a function that knows how to match it with some other value
if the hash does not use a salt then there is no sign for that

1046541
organization	naming
for example using temp as the name of local variables is not allowed variables must be named so that the purpose of the variable is obvious always use a consistent style to name variables camel case the key would be to publish these rules and enforce them for the entire organization
i am not sure about the specific problem variable names are not descriptive or are they using variable names aren t in english variable naming style is inconsistent etc

1046748
for-loop	loops
foreach is a useful construct and not replaceble by a for-loop in all circumstances
for example if you have a datareader and loops through all records using a foreach it automatically calls the dispose method and closes the reader which can then close the connection automatically

1047106
hash	md5
anyone who doesn t believe me is free to give me anything that hash to 2aaddf751bff2121cc51dc709e866f19
what md5 doesn t have is collision resistance which is something else entirely. now if the only reason you can t work backwards in a cryptographic hash function was because the hash function discards data to create the hash then it would not guarantee preimage resistance you can still work backwards and just insert random data wherever the hash function discards data and while you wouldn t come up with the original message you d still come up with a message that hash to the desired hash value

1047849
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
from your code it looks like you are not closing the connections and sqldatareader
see if you can place your connections and sqldatareader in a using statement using con as new sqlconnection connectionstring .... end using the dbsqlhelperfactory opens a connection but can t close it since the connection is needed after its return

1047890
hash	md5
you may be confused because the answer to the question you cite is confusing. one of the requirements for a cryptographic hash function is that it should be preimage resistant
that is if you know md5 x but not the message x then it is difficult to find any x either equal x or different from x such that md5 x md5 x

1048024
daemons	systemd
not surprisingly there s a perl daemons library available
if your hosting provider offers perl script support then you probably have permission to use systemd or backticks command

1048389
webclient	httpwebrequest
the point of webclient is to provide a very simple api to use in very simple situations
webclient doesn t have this kind of functionality - even the slightly-lower-level httpwebrequest doesn t as far as i m aware

1050001
post	get
i ve seen a couple of post about setting a div s width height to 1in and then querying the offsetwidth offsetheight but that doesn t work any better than screendpi
interestingly i get 96 from this method regardless of resolution even though i get 72 from screendpi

1050260
icomparable	compareto
this gives you what you need to know you haven t declared your class to implement the icomparable interface
it is not enough to just implement the compareto method since the sorting algorithms will look for the icomparable interface before attempting to call compareto through that interface

1050635
put	get
so when i load up the data i put a version of it in the correct place in each array or not in the array depending on the filter
i have a call to get the array that uses the state of the segmented control to decide which array to return

1051080
x86	64bit
if it relies on 32 bit stuff most of the time you can still run it as a 32 bit application by setting the target platform to x86
if it doesn t rely on a 32 bit external library com component it ll work perfectly as a 64bit process and will leverage its benefits large address space x64 instruction set ...

1051767
vcproj	csproj
i spent several hours investigating the msbuild task solution above and it s pretty good for managed code but i can t see any way to use it for c++ bar converting the vcproj to csproj eek
msbuild task will not work as this is a vcproj file c++ so vcbuild is used

1052035
ivar	subclassing
usually i do not bother using the getter for accessing the ivar from within the implementation but there are times when it is necessary
in particular if you expect the getter might do some caclulation or checking or if you want to allow for subclassing to override the behaviour

1052601
runtimeexception	filenotfoundexception
however as i don t see the environment around your case wrapping an exception in these ways might confuse the clients of that method - they might not be prepared to deal with a runtimeexception
for example the method throws an ioexception and your clients catches it as filenotfoundexception to display an error dialog

1052927
geocoding	geocode
this was not a trivial system to use but it got its parsing and geocoding data from the postal authorities of countries around the world so could stay up to date
the theory was that any address which would permit a letter to be delivered could be parsed and geocode

1053135
int	double
the problem is in the c code you have the long long filled out right but then you convert the int value directly into floating point rather than reinterpreting the bytes as a double
if you throw some pointers addressing at it it works notice also that the format specifier for double and for float is f not lf

1053422
mvp	presenter
i think apple uses the term mvc almost universally because many of the views in cocoa appkit use data bindings to draw data directly from the model and this breaks with the mvp pattern
in the diagram below from this article the mvp model shows all the data moving through the presenter - and this generally isn t the case for well-built cocoa apps

1053610
initializer	class-method
the difference between class-method and instance methods are class-method operate on class variables they can not access instance variables do not require an object to be initializer to be applied sometimes can be a code smell some people who are new to oop use as a crutch to do structured programming in an oo enviroment instance methods operate on instances variables and class variables must have an initializer object to operate on
the answer to your question is not specific to objective-c however in different languages class-method may be called static methods

1054453
versioning	upgrade
if this is the case you will need to perform an upgrade on the settings file properties.settings.default.upgrade you can also set a setting of needsupgrading to true by default and set it to false after performing an upgrade so that end users who are not changing versioning numbers every time the app is started will not be upgrading all the time
if you have your assembly info set to automatically generate any versioning numbers 1.0

1054464
bash	zsh
maybe the problem with job control had to do with some bug in zsh that doesn t even exist in bash and maybe it is no longer relevant in zsh either
so try just an with bash and if job control is interfering try to disable it set +m and hopefully this would work

1054610
vim	textmate
it s completely replaced vim for me and while it s not a full ide it s got alot of neat integrations in bundles specially targeted towards perl development
you didn t specify which platform you re on but on the macintosh textmate is a very popular choice for perl development

1054708
opera	firefox
of course this can t be used to retrieve cross-domain-content for that you either have to proxy the calls through a script of yours or think about integration something like flxhr cross-domain ajax with flash call.html jquery.js is jquery 1.3.2 uncompressed test.html a valid xhtml-document xmldoc.js output.js ready.js in opera the whole thing works without the createxmldocument and the beforesend function
the extra trickery is needed for firefox 3.0.11 and ie6 can t test ie7 ie8 other browsers as they have a problem when the content-type returned by the server doesn t indicate that it s xml

1055219
firefox	safari
i believe it works the same way in firefox and other browsers but you may need to get the reference to your swf element differently than ie
ie will use an object tag generally with an id and firefox safari etc will use the embed tag and since you aren t supposed to be the same id on two elements people generally use the name attribute instead of an id attribute on the embed tag

1055913
free	malloc
if something was allocated with new free it with delete malloc is free by free and new by delete
and variables that are declared without any of these are automatically handled and should not be manually free

1056575
getter	setter
i m not sure where you got your 2 arguments constant construct but the constant function is a getter that only takes one argument the constant name you want to retrieve
define on the other hand defines the value of a constant setter

1056957
folder	directory
the debug folder and the release folder are the actual output from your project s build
if you haven t included file.txt in the project and marked it as copy to output directory then it doesn t count as part of the build output and your app shouldn t try to load it

1057108
public	protected
type example this will disable strong name verification for all assemblies signed with your public key. you can list current settings for strong name verification with sn -vl installing the private key for team build since the private key key.pfx is password protected team build cannot access it
thanks to nagaraju palla s blog using password protected signing keys in team build we have a solution

1057308
kerberos	ntlm
existing components that are designed to use kerberos for authentication are not affected by this change
this is expected behaviour microsoft windows server 2003 service pack 1 sp1 modifies ntlm network authentication behavior

1057346
cvs	rcs
here is the cvs documentation for keyword substitution note that id is one of many such strings that can be used
that is probably an expanded version of id which i think has its origins with the rcs version control system and has been inherited or implemented in many others not least cvs and svn

1057630
post	get
you aren t sending any post parameters
yours are get parameters

1057915
hide	show
the overflow hidden is intended to but might not hide what would otherwise cause the to expand
i d recommend using the title property of the span to show the text that s present or clipped in the visual cell so that the text s still available and if you don t want need people to see it then why have it in the first place i guess...

1059225
sudo	passwd
this means that you need to modify your sudoers file on each remote machine and add entries like this assuming your username deploy the first two lines allow the deploy user to run sudo without having a tty or re-typing the passwd -- which means it can be run straight over ssh without any further input
here is an example python command to take advantage of sudo on a remote anyway this is not a straight answer to your question but rather an illustration of how easy you can use python and a couple of other techniques to create a systems management tool that is 100 tailored to your specific needs

1059716
cpython	pypy
pypy written in python has a very flexible back-end and can use lots of different strategies id v gives on cpython only the numeric value of the pointer just as a handy way to uniquely identify the object
a list can be heterogeneous some items may be integers others objects of different types so it s just not a sensible option to store some items as pointers to pyobject and others differently each object also needs a type indication and in cpython a reference count at least -- array.array is homogeneous and limited so it can and does indeed store a copy of the items values rather than references this is often cheaper but not for collections where the same item appears a lot such as a sparse array where the vast majority of items are 0

cpython	pypy

a python implementation would be fully allowed by the language specs to try subtler tricks for optimization as long as it preserves semantics untouched but as far as i know none currently does for this specific issue you could try hacking a pypy backend but don t be surprised if the overhead of checking for int vs non-int overwhelms the hoped-for gains

1059862
next	except
here is a good guide to css 3 features not included smashing magazine take your design to the next level with css3
although the not pseudo-class is useful in certain situations it is not supported except by the most recent browsers because it is part of the css 3 specification

1060611
peer	p2p
it is a little confusing because the gksession reference talks only about being a way to connect peer over bluetooth while the gkpeerpickercontroller states can be configured to select between bluetooth and internet connections. however there s a clear note there that they re not really going to help you with internet based connections
the iphone emulator does not run these bluetooth p2p connections

1061250
inherited	subclassing
a very popular alternative to inherited as in subclassing is object composition and delegation
so instead of you do composition is more flexible than subclassing you can have more than one delegate as opposed to only one superclass at least in java it cleanly separates interface from implementation whereas with a superclass you get both its methods and their implementation and even methods that are not in the interface you can swap out delegates by configuration at runtime whereas the superclass instance is compiled in

1061298
hash	salt
to prevent against malicious activities on some of my internal ajax stuff i add two get variables one is the date usually in epoch then i take that date add a salt and sha1 it and also post that if the date when rehashed does not match the hash then i drop the request otherwise fulfill it
of course i do the encryption before the page is rendered and pass the hash date to the js

1061522
uninstall	upgrade
i generally find that minor upgrade are only useful in a few cases 1 uninstall bug there is a bug in the uninstall sequence of the installed msi
since a minor upgrade does not uninstall the product but merely reinstalls it

1061522
uninstall	upgrade
since a minor upgrade does not uninstall the product but merely reinstalls it
this allows you to fix whatever was wrong in the uninstall sequence before it is called

1062066
yacc	bison
i think the quote below sums up the theoretical side very well. from wikipedia perl in wikipedia perl has a turing-complete grammar because parsing can be affected by run-time code executed during the compile phase. 25 therefore perl cannot be parsed by a straight lex yacc lexer parser combination
instead the interpreter implements its own lexer which coordinates with a modified bison parser to resolve ambiguities in the language

1062293
children	parent
after reading up a lot one option would be to use something like select referenced_table_name parent table_name child from information_schema.key_column_usage where referenced_table_name is not null this gives all tables having children
filtering to only return children to the requested parent would of course be easy

1062852
superclass	subclassing
but that s still not as good as fixing the superclass
it may be a smell from the superclass not the subclassing

1062852
superclass	subclassing
it may be a smell from the superclass not the subclassing
is there functionality in the superclass that is publicly accessible only through the constructor

1064057
vpn	lan	wan	lan
i can t stress however that this only works if all the people are on the same little office lan and not some kind of remote connection or a wan vpn
so in the case of wan vpn use terminal services or consider moving the backend to sql server and continue to use the application front end as is

1064491
inherited	properties
the properties is inherited from tstringlist and if you look at the documentation for tstringlist.duplicates you will find note duplicates does nothing if the list is not sorted
you need to set the sorted properties to true in order to have the list ignore duplicates

1064546
sharepoint	spsite
sharepoint group has an option that can allow only the group owner to see the membership details or allow everyone to view the membership details
if every one is allowed you will not get the security restriction else you need to runwithelevatedprivileges and be sure to get a new instance of the spsite spweb to be used inside that

1065289
inherited	properties
a box of wine could also be a beverage holder and those are not both cylinders so you have to look at what else you might want to inherited from in your domain
i would agree that you should create a dimensions class that has the thickness length width properties along with the getvolume method

1065323
jsf	seam
jsf 1.1 1.2 raw doesn t provide an easy way to do this
seam spring both have ways around this and there are a couple of things you can do

1065378
ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	icollection	ienumerable	ienumerator
it follows that if are not required to do the job then it s sensible to use ienumerable or instead thereby eliminating the additional plumbing
the definition for is so is derived from ilist icollection and in addition to ienumerable and the ienumerable interface exposes the getenumerator method which returns an ienumerator a movenext method and a current property

1066486
junit	easymock	junit	testng
junit allows you to easily create methods that run as part of a test easymock allows you to create mock or fake objects to pass in that will respond in very specific ways which you can use to test a method that relies on a framework or running environment that isn t there during testing
junit testng and easymock for testing there are many others those are the ones we use

1066902
hash	md5
md5 is not a symmetric encryption algorithm it is a one-way hash
there is no way to decrypt passwords stored using the md5 algorithm

1067204
implements	extends
for # nokogiriwrapper 0x581f74 nokogiri_wrapper.rb 12 in method_missing nokogiri_wrapper.rb 29 this is one way to implements the delegator pattern in ruby another way is to use one of the delegator classes
nokogiri doesn t have any instance methods to inherit but normally you would use extends ri extends ---------------------------------------------------------- object#extend obj.extend module ... obj ------------------------------------------------------------------------ adds to obj the instance methods from each module given as a parameter. module mod def hello hello from mod. n end end class klass def hello hello from klass. n end end k klass.new k.hello # hello from klass. n k.extend mod # # klass 0x401b3bc8 k.hello # hello from mod. n what you want to do is use all the class methods of the nokogiri module as instance methods of your class

1067393
implements	extends
object.clone has an implementation this link explains the cloneable interface an object must implements the cloneable interface in order to call the clone method otherwise it throws a clonenotsupportedexception
by definition all classes in java extends the base object class and object class has a default clone method even though object itself does not implements cloneable

1067520
profiling	debugging
he says do less stuff. and always profiling the release build - profiling the debugging build is generally a wasted effort
profiling by stopping in the debugger is not a reliable way to get timings as you ve discovered

1067927
client-side	server-side
add some client-side validation to check for the textbox being empty and refuse to submit the form if it is
accompany this with a validation check server-side that confirms the passed-in value is non-null and also a valid date and then fails the save and returns an error message to the user when a valid date is not present

1068168
post	get
it s stripping the post body and sending content-length 0
not a lot we can do to work around however and down want to use get requests as this exposes usernames passwords etc on the url string

1069367
std	ostream
regarding the error ostream is part of std namespace and not part of the global namespace or the namespace the class you re refering is part of
some implementation returning the same ostream allows combinations like however it is still strange to use it this way

1069376
std	ostream
you also need to change this into std ostream because c++ standard library names are within the namespace std
do not write using namespace std

1069455
migrate	upgrade
in the more distant past with smaller projects that were more like desktop apps with a database as the datastore every time the app started i would check to see if the database existed and if not create it check that all the tables existed and if not create them check that all the columns existed and if not add them whenever i needed to change the schema i would just add more code to the end of the startup code to modify the schema as necessary taking care to migrate any existing data
the benefit of this was that you could just uninstall and reinstall a new version of the software and it would automatically upgrade the existing database to the latest version

1070135
int	boolean
i d think that an optimizing compiler should optimize away any difference because there is no logical difference assuming it s a language with a true boolean not just int type
testing for equality to true can lead to a bug at least in c in c if can be used on int types not just on boolean types and accept any non-zero value

1070816
post	put
it can even fail on old browsers or even some modern ones a googled forum post seemd to indicate that opera does not like javascript urls
a better practice would be the second way to put your javascript into the onclick attribute which is ignored if no scripting functionality is available

1072654
ienumerable	ilist
if you return an ienumerable then he will not know a priori that he can make an ilist out of it
but if you return an ilist he will know that he can iterate over it

1072778
ienumerable	ilist
basically list is ienumerable but you have count functionality add element remove element ienumerable is not efficient for counting elements if the collection is intended to be readonly or the modification of the collection is controlled by the parent then returning an ilist just for count is not a good idea
in linq there is a count extension method on which inside the clr will shortcut to .count if the underlying type is of ilist so performance difference is negligible

touchesmoved	touchescancelled	touchesmoved	touchesended
in touchesmoved withevent if the user s intent isn t known yet determine whether the touched has moved far enough away from the starting position
if it has determine whether the user intends to scroll or change the date and save that intent. if the user s intent is already known and it s to change the date send the date picker the touchedmoved withevent message otherwise send the uiscrollview the touchesmoved withevent message. you ll have to do some simliar work within touchesended withevent and touchescancelled withevent to make sure the other views get the appropriate messages

google-chrome	firefox
i sometimes have the same happen to me when i m inspecting http traffic with fiddler and my computer crashes although in that case its the other way around ie google-chrome etc give me the error message and firefox works splendidly
firefox doesn t use wininet which most windows applications use

1073591
goto	break
the one advantage that ab using do break while or while break for this purpose has over goto is that you are guaranteed not to be jumping above the construct -- goto can be used to jump to a label earlier within the same function
the disadvantage that do break while etc

there are a few public repositories like here and here hosting these artifacts. to use these repositories you could add the relevant repository declaration to your pom.xml or settings

1075181
many-to-many	one-to-many
for a many-to-many i would think it would call a delete on the join table but am not 100 sure
i have not done many-to-many but i would try and change the cascade from cascade.all to cascade.alldeleteorphan good link about cascades ayende on cascades for a one-to-many if you remove an object from the collection nhibernate will call a delete on the child

1075232
persistent	transient
so for a fresh item that isn t persistent it starts at false and stays false because nhibernate has never saved or loaded it
when nhibernate checks whether the child is transient the trigger responds that it is transient and a save happens which marks the child as persistent

1075599
inherited	properties
it s a way to implement properties inherited
you can use vba to set the the properties of all projects using a script shouldn t be more than a few lines for a simple solution

1076020
accessor	properties
while in this particular example it really doesn t make much of a difference the get set accessor offer the ability to do a bit more work when grabbing a properties
for example many of our properties get accessor perform some lookup within a more complex data structure or set default values if nothing has been defined

1076398
ienumerable	iqueryable
ienumerable is not indexable
neither is iqueryable

1076725
libpcap	dpkt
it was written by the author of pypcap a different libpcap wrapper but it shouldn t be too difficult to get it working with pcapy to see if it s faster for your purposes than scapy
you may want to look into dpkt yet another packet parsing building library

1076866
opera	safari	firefox	safari
please feel free to move it if needed or to tell me so as i can rectify my problem was the following did not work on safari 3 firefox and opera ie is not enable to draw svg
in fact this code produce the insertion in a of the following element and safari 4 is able to draw a svg file as an image but this is not the way to do for the other browser

1077333
move	drag
set child to draggable set parent to droppable set a flag which if true on drag stop removes the element unset this flag in the parents on drop function child dragged out of parent child not dropped into parent so when you move the child around in the parent nothing happens removeme flag is unset and it move back to original position
if you drag the child outside of the parent the removeme flag isn t unset and the drag stop method removes the child

1077337
firefox	safari
ps these were all tested on firefox using firebug
i cannot make any claims about the efficiency of safari s webkit konqueror s kjs ie s proprietary engine or google chrome s v8

1077513
metaclass	subclassing
type self .__name__ def getsize self return self.size of course this way you ll get the error only when an instance of a subclassing of a which doesn t override size actually tries to use self.size the metaclass approach has the advantage of giving the error earlier when an errant subclassing of a is created
if metaclass scare you and i sympathize with that attitude

1078324
maven	m2e
all modern ide s eclipse only with 3rd party plug-ins m2e or q for eclipse support importing maven projects directly so you do not have to adapt anything
additional maven has a dependency management which takes care of download dependencies adding them to the correct classpath depending on the scope compile test runtime

1078988
folder	directory
from my own experiments it seems that having a subfolder with any items in it within the res drawable folder will cause the resource compiler to fail -- preventing the r.java file from being generated correctly
no the resources mechanism doesn t support subfolders in the drawable directory so yes - you need to keep that hierarchy flat

1079264
mockito	jmock
jmock doesn t do anything special for final classes other than rely on the jdave library to unfinalize everything in the jvm so you could experiment with using jdave s unfinalizer and see if mockito will then mock it
mockito can t mock final classes

1079441
pop-up	dialog
to show your modal pop-up extender from javascript all you will need to do is add some script to your master-page user-control or page which displays the dom element which is the modal pop-up extender
alternatively you can use a javascript framework which has many other styles of modal dialog which are equally if not more useful than the ajax modal pop-up extender

1079798
mouseout	mouseenter
i am not particular sure what you expected but if you want the user to hover the table and then all available cell will light up then you can try with following and the mouseout event would be similar
when the this inside the mouseenter event is called it means the particular td which is mouse entered but not the whole set of td.available in your document

1080017
post	get
they expect a single string representing a json object to be parsed out rather than the individual variables in the post data
json it s not a problem in this specific case but it s a good idea to get in the habit of quoting any string keys or values in your json object

1080018
apache	nginx
if the model isn t very complex and or your traffic is fairly low you can probably get away with apache mongrel and sqlite on some nix
if you start seeing performance issues you can add some memcached into the mix upgrade relatively painlessly to mysql and use a different server passenger nginx

1080417
public	protected
the accessibility levels in c# are as follows public access is not restricted
protected access is limited to the containing class or types derived from the containing class

1081237
subclass	abstract-class
i would add a pure abstract clone method to class person which definitely looks like it should be an abstract-class existing mainly for the sake of being subclassed -- if you need a concrete none of the above kind of person it s best done via a separate concrete subclass otherkindofperson rather than as the base class itself and override it in every concrete subclass in student with a new that invokes the specific concrete subclass s copy ctor you also need to change the registry map to you could use some smarter pointer than a plain old but as the map and all of its entries probably needs to survive as long as the process does this is definitely not a big deal -- the main added value you might get from smarter pointers being smarter behavior upon destruction of the pointer
- now your factory function can simply end with the changes are needed to avoid the slicing effect of using the base class s copy ctor on a subclass that has extra attributes as well as preserve any virtual method s resolution

1081281
daemons	systemd
how to detect whether an os x application is already launchd for an introduction to the run-time context and particularly around mac os x daemons and agents and for those cases when you do need to have multiple copies of an executable running as a pool or such and akin to apache see
mapping process management among disparate operating systemd doesn t work

1081709
post	get
this is untested by me mark wubben s answer in this forum post was very enlightening for getancestor and onrelease
according to 626595 and 801642 the click event doesn t get propagated out

1082107
inline	inlining
explicit inline fixes that
of course the compiler may still inline the function if it thinks that will be efficient but it s not the same as an explicit inlining

1082107
inline	inlining
of course the compiler may still inline the function if it thinks that will be efficient but it s not the same as an explicit inlining
template functions are implicitly inlined in the sense that they don t require an inline to prevent multiple definition errors

1082217
innodb	myisam
where these conditions do not apply and besides websites they do not apply often in the database world the innodb table is likely to be the table type of choice
this article is aimed at users who are familiar with mysql but have only used the default myisam table type

1082273
packets	multicast
it doesn t guarantee packets delivery nor ordering
you can implement broadcast and multicast mechanisms very easily

1082394
udp	tcp
this is one major reason why mmo games connected to hundred of thousands of clients use udp
speed the fact that each message is routed individually means that you cannot hit a stream congestion like tcp can

1082394
udp	tcp
broadcast udp can broadcast to all listeners on a network segment
you shouldn t even consider udp if you re considering tcp too

1082394
udp	tcp
you shouldn t even consider udp if you re considering tcp too
if you re considering tcp means you are thinking in terms of a stream exactly once in order messages and using udp will put the burden of fragmentation retry and acknowledgment duplicate detection and ordering in your app

1083671
validationsummary	customvalidator
the customvalidator will now be responsible for this you have the option of displaying nothing at all less clear to the user or displaying an asterisk to indicate which validator is invalid. option 1 display none option 2 preferred display dynamic set the text in between the validator tags to no changes needed for your validationsummary control it should be neutral and not have a validationgroup attribute set which is the default add a customvalidator see code below add an eventhandler for the customvalidator s servervalidate event you can just double click it from the designer to have it generated implement the eventhandler logic see code below the idea is not to directly allow the page to handle those requiredfieldvalidators anymore and instead we ll let the customvalidator do it
textbox requiredfieldvalidator example you should have something that looks like this with relevant id names which corresponds to step 1 above option 1 option 2 customvalidator markup you can place this anywhere sensible such as next to the validationsummary control the error message here replaces the ones from the individual validators

1083964
typedef	struct
much of the c standard library uses typedef for this reason
you would use a typedef so you do not need to specify the struct keyword when declaring variables of that struct

1083964
typedef	struct
you would use a typedef so you do not need to specify the struct keyword when declaring variables of that struct
without typedef struct mystruct foo

1083980
typedef	struct
in c++ this is not so useful because c++ was designed to make definition of new types easier and more complete than c at least at the beginnings of c++ and the typedef is not even necessary to refer to a previously declared struct or class
the typedef version is a special case of typedef foo bar

1084204
typedef	struct
here are the differences between the two declarations definitions 1 you cannot use a typedef name to identify a constructor or a destructor 2 you cannot hide a typedef name like you can a name introduced via the class-head - or conversely if you already have a function or an object with a certain name you can still declare a class with that name using the class-head but not via the typedef approach
3 you cannot use a typedef name in an elaborated type specifier 4 you cannot use it to define nested struct as you can see there is a discernible difference between the two

1084554
postgresql	mysql
if you cannot change dbs to one that has spatial operators implemented correctly like postgresql s postgis extension you can solve this problem using a two-part approach
first let mysql give you an bounding box pre-filtering result based on the bounding box that is what it does by default using their intersects operator

1084856
inherited	properties
an object x that is created by x new person is linked to inherited from person.prototype but as far as the ecma standard is concerned you cannot change x.prototype in order to change that link inherited afterwards that s the magic power only the new keyword possesses
mozilla seems to offer a way to change the object link after an object has been created through the non-standard properties __proto__

1085114
atomic	interlocked
this is where you may need to make the field volatile to get the behaviour you expect if you are dealing with a 64-bit value on 32-bit hardware you may need to use the interlocked.read operation to guarantee the whole 64-bit value is read in a single atomic operation otherwise it may be performed as 2 separate 32-bit reads which can be from either side of a memory update re-ordering of your reads writes may cause you to not get the value you expected
in which case some memory barrier may be needed either explicit or through the use of the interlocked class operations short summary

1085340
chown	chmod	chown	passwd
full chown chmod in a web app is equivalent to just pasting your root passwd on the page
if the chown needs to happen for some reason but not to root we hope then the functionality should be wrapped

1085902
filesystems	ntfs
for example you d be much better off building something that supports fat32 rather than ntfs because the former is a much much simpler filesystems
as long as you have low-level block access and some sensible way for dealing with concurrency problems best handled by working on the filesystems when it is not in use you can do this in c# perl or any language you like

1086282
ubuntu	linux
worth noting that gnome-terminal doesn t respond to it just produces a plain foo and neither xterm nor gnome-terminal nor tty1 respond to 6 blink rapid at least on my system ubuntu 9.04
from looking at wikipedia the string produces a blinking foo in xterm or in the linux console as in ctrl-alt-f1

1086649
int	chars
this should do the job for enum types with any underlying types convert.toint64 is used because a 64-bit int is the widest integral type possible to which all enum values can be cast even ulong
note that chars is not a valid underlying type

1087421
super	abstract
you need to provide expectations for each method that is called with the expectation on any concrete methods calling the super method - not sure how you d do that with mockito but i believe it s possible with easymock
all this is doing is creating a concrete instance of youclass and saving you the effort of providing empty implementations of each abstract method

1087501
subclass	abstract-class
when you use a mocking framework to mock a class most frameworks dynamically create a subclass and replace the method implementation with code for detecting when a method is called and returning a fake value
when testing an abstract-class you want to execute the non-abstract methods of the subject under test sut so a mocking framework isn t what you want

1087860
put	get
edit to answer your question you can download a trial version of dreamweaver put in your web-site as a project and use the link checker to check and correct the links
as said in the comments i would definitely correct the problem and not try to get around it by using a ignore-case solution

1087950
folder	directory
if your wanting to use the compressed folder option you will need to modify the directory flags on the directory handle
this will only impact new files added to that directory and will not automatically compress existing files

1088439
vim	emacs
vim s my poison
i m sure emacs offers similar gains the biggest gain not needing to touch the mouse

1088743
coalesce	isnull
the coalesce is ansi standard and isnull is not
but more important is the fact that coalesce is more flexible. isnull will only work with two parameters

1088743
coalesce	isnull
but more important is the fact that coalesce is more flexible. isnull will only work with two parameters
if the first parameter is null then the value of the second parameter is returned else the value of the first is returned. coalesce will take 2 to n i don t know the limit of n parameters and return the value of the first parameter that is not null

1088854
filtering	grouping
as a result the receive verb does not offer any filtering
the where clauses of receive are restricted to conversations and conversation grouping and this is as a means to help application leverage the conversation grouping locking concept not to filtering our certain messages

1088904
post	put
if however you are adding the blog post to the category by either putting or posting to the category then you can return a 404 not found
i assume you are responding to a put or post request on your blog post resource

1088933
hmac	md5
if they send you a long string or file and a hmac you can compute the hmac yourself compare your hmac and theirs and if they match the data was not corrupted in transit nor was the data tampered with
md5 is not encryption - it s a hash

1088933
hash	md5
md5 is an unkeyed hash function - there is not key in use at all
so let s say the server sends you a giant string or a file and a hash of it

1089204
integer	unsigned
according to the 1999 iso c standard c99 size_t is an unsigned integer type of at least 16 bit see sections 7.17 and 7.18.3
the standard also recommends that size_t shouldn t have an integer conversion rank greater than long if possible ie casting size_t to unsigned long is unproblematic if the recommendation is followed

1089804
daemons	launchd
you probably shouldn t be launchd the second daemons directly from your daemons
you should probably make it another daemons

1089804
daemons	launchd
however as i said you shouldn t be launchd your second daemons using open or launchd services
if you can post more detail about exactly what it is your daemons do we might be able to give you advice as to the best way to do it

1090158
awt	swing
there are better 3rd party native looking skins than swing s implementations btw lots of people preferred using awt s filedialog over swing s filechooser because it gave the platform file dialog most people were used to rather than the weird custom swing one
as far as when awt may be more useful than swing - you may be targeting an older jvm or platform that doesn t support swing

1091127
processors	hyperthreading
on a processors with hyperthreading technology or on a multi-processor system the increment decrement operations are not guaranteed to be executed atomicaly
increment decrement operations on 32-bit or less integer variables on a single 32-bit processors with no hyperthreading technology are atomic

1091205
cpu	processors
also some cpu commands are not so problematic
when you have a simple fetch of one piece of data that the processors can fetch in one piece -- the fetch itself is of course atomic because there is nothing to be divided at all

1091513
opera	firefox	opera	safari
the java code getlocaleinfo.java an example of html page using the above applet getlocaleinfo.html tested on firefox 3.0 ie 6 safari 3.1 and opera 9.50 on windows xp pro sp3. it works without problem with the first two on safari i have a strange error after init call but it still works
i can t get it work with opera the applet loads correctly as i can see the trace of init call in the java console i have no errors when javascript calls the java functions except if i add and call a method getting a jsobject parameter curiously but the java functions are not called i added trace of the calls

1092009
innodb	myisam
if your table is innodb and id is a primary key then you can omit id from the indexes above
if your table is myisam or id is not a primary key you need to create a composite ondex on topic_id id

1092089
inherited	subclassing
you could however create an abstract base class and inherited from it to provide the default implementation but make that concrete class sealed
now any classes which inherited from foobase have to implement dostuff but you have a default implementation fooimpl from which subclassing may not inherited

1092119
shadowing	named
shadowing is not really a java only term
in any instance where a variable declared in a scope has the same named as one in a bigger scope that variable is shadowed

1094878
maven	m2e
running the test in eclipse with the junit test runner does not invoke maven even if you are using m2e
i suggest you either create a maven launch configuration for the test goal

1095283
put	get
the tricky thing with the naive just do it in the application solution is that many time you have multiple applications interacting with the db which can put you in a bind if you have no application messaging bus or something like memcached cause it can be expensive to have one cache per application
obviously for your problem the ideal solution is to be able to do the paging in a cheaper manner and not need to churn through all the data just to get page n

1095287
class-method	eigenclass
this shows that there really is no difference between a singleton method on a class method and a singleton method on any other kind of object therefore it doesn t make sense to talk about class-method in ruby
you can also see how these two notations relate to the notion of singleton methods and eigenclasses def foo.baz # ... end says add the singleton method baz to the object foo and open up the eigenclass of object foo and then add instance method bar to the eigenclass

1095375
feedback	review
similarly such standards have to be living documents adapted in the face of feedback
code review also work well since not all such good style rules can be automatically determined

1096984
inherited	subclassing
iskindofclass will return yes if the receiver somewhere inherited from the class passed as argument
ismemberofclass will return yes only if the receiver is an instance of the class passed as argument only not including subclassing

1097291
factors	mean
also take in account that people have different estimation factors not sure this word makes complete sense in english .
by that i mean that you dba might always estimate 1.5 times as long as it takes him and your css monkey maybe just half as long .

1097915
int	chars
also ffffffd2 is 8 hex digits which means it s a 32bit signed int
if you declare fileinrampointer as unsigned chars or unsigned __int8 the sign bit doesn t propagate during promotion

1098191
bit-shift	xor
useful as the bit-shift method suggested
you can store two values in one field using xor as you might have noticed you need one of the original values to retrieve the other so this technique is not as .

1098397
unsigned	short
53328 cannot be nicely stored in short use int instead as it allows you to store unsigned value up to 10 9 so don t downcast the expression to short as it will net you the signed value
the other answers are ok but i would like to put an emphasis on the type the short type can represent values between -32768 to 32767

1098616
dictionary	map
- the dictionary you pass to the translate method has unicode ordinals not strings as keys which is why we need that rebuilding step from the original char-to-char spec_dict
values in the dictionary you pass to translate as opposed to keys which must be ordinals can be unicode ordinals arbitrary unicode strings or none to remove the corresponding character as part of the translation so it s easy to specify ignore a certain character for sorting purposes map ä to ae for sorting purposes and the like

1099249
integer	unsigned
first you have to know the type in your .dat file and the byte order big little endian . then assemble the individual bytes into an appropriate java type. if the .dat files specifies a 32 bit signed integer an int in java would be suitable. if it was an unsigned 32 bit integer you probably would need to use a long in java to capture all the possible values since java does not have unsigned types
read it as follows if the integer in the file is little endian and if it s big endian do i don t remember atm

1099468
free	malloc
if that memory isn t available _m_what is set to a predefined string. _m_dofree is a flag that stores whether free needs to be called on this memory
to make your own exception class you want to overload the following function if you look at the visual studio implementation exception uses malloc to allocate memory to store the character string

1099712
udp	tcp
udp is a connection-less protocol and used in applications like snmp simple network management protocol dns domain name system where data packets arriving out of order unreliability and not of concern and immediate send through of the data packet matters
since udp does not involve connection establishment there fore applications like dns where connection establishment delays needs to be avoided udp is preferred over tcp

1099807
udp	tcp
udp has lower overhead as stated already is good for streaming things like video and audio where it is better to just lose a packet then try to resend and catch up
there are no guarantees on tcp delivery you are simply supposed to be told if the socket disconnected or basically if the data is not going to arrive

1099807
udp	tcp
tcp has its own re-try and ordering mechanism that is hidden from your application you can re-invent that with udp to tailor it to your needs
udp is far easier to write code for on both ends basically because you do not have to make and maintain the point to point connections

1099870
tunnel	packets
see techrepublic article understanding tcp over tcp effects of tcp tunnel on end-to-end throughput and latency
in some cases which others have highlighted guaranteed arrival of packets isn t important and hence using udp is fine

1099870
udp	tcp
in some cases which others have highlighted guaranteed arrival of packets isn t important and hence using udp is fine
there are other cases where udp is preferable to tcp

1099906
udp	tcp
udp is often harder in that you must write your program in such a way that it is not dependent on the accuracy of the packets
udp when speed is necessary and the accuracy if the packets is not and tcp when you need accuracy

1100412
union	distinct
i m sorry that i m not able to understand exactly what your issue is but i wonder if your issue stems from the fact that the union operator will eliminate duplicate rows kind of like a select distinct over the combined query
if you don t want this behavior use union all instead

1100433
post	get
according to the http rfc get should not have any side-effects while post may have side-effects
the most basic example of this is that get is not appropriate for anything like a purchase-transaction or posting an article to a blog while post is appropriate for actions-that-have-consequences

1100433
post	get
the most basic example of this is that get is not appropriate for anything like a purchase-transaction or posting an article to a blog while post is appropriate for actions-that-have-consequences
by the rfc you can hold a user responsible for actions done by post such as a purchase but not for get actions

1100433
post	get
by the rfc you can hold a user responsible for actions done by post such as a purchase but not for get actions
bots always use get for this reason

1100433
post	get	put	get
this allows user agents to represent other methods such as post put and delete in a special way so that the user is made aware of the fact that a possibly unsafe action is being requested
naturally it is not possible to ensure that the server does not generate side-effects as a result of performing a get request

1100454
post	get
on the other hand post is not safe not idempotent and every agent knows not to cache the results of a post request or retry a post request automatically
so for example a credit card transaction would never ever be a get request you don t want accounts being debited multiple times because of network errors etc

1101080
folder	directory
asp.net requires write permission to the temporary asp.net files folder it shouldn t be a security risk providing you only grant permission to that folder and not any higher as it sits within the c windows folder
this msdn article about securing asp.net applications recommends granting full control to the temporary compilation directory to the asp.net process identity

1101088
goto	break
in other words while-break can be translated into functional languages like lisp with tail-recursion goto cannot
break understands the semantics of the block scope while goto is oblivious to it

1101352
elf	dwarf
the concept of elf debug info doesn t really exist the elf specification leaves the content of the .debug section deliberately unspecified
common debug formats are stab and dwarf

1101646
folder	directory
seems like you ve probably got some path issues and the files are possibly being written to the asp.net temporary files folder which may change from instance to instance
the asp.net development server does not clear the directory each time it starts

1101655
gprof	shark
unfortunately gprof does not work on mac os x
you ll probably want to use shark instead

1101716
cvs	svn
for all the reasons linked in the comment and elsewhere svn tends to be a much better enviroment than cvs or vss unless you have some weird requirements - so if you can successfully import your history and save the company money i wouldn t see why the bosses wouldn t go for it
there are tools to convert cvs history to svn and other tools to migrate vss history - so you can use them in your case of moving to a better system

1102146
spaces	delimiter
as an argument to the delimiter command so not having the spaces there may be confusing it
try delimiter

1102306
hex	binary
you can use encoding.getbytes to get the encoded version of a string once you ve chosen an appropriate encoding - but the fact that there is that choice to make is the reason that there aren t many apis which go straight from string to base64 hex or which perform encryption hashing directly on strings
any such apis which do exist will almost certainly be doing the encode to a byte array perform appropriate binary operation decode opaque binary data to hex base64

1102520
folder	directory
concerning source files my project directory structure is flat no source code is in sub folder this is the default when you manage code with xcode only
my doxyfile contains this setting this way .svn directory are not parsed by doxygen

1102917
try-catch	exception-handling
this means that must be explicitly catched in a try-catch block
runtime exception-handling need not be caught java.lang.runtimeexception

1102969
inherited	properties
well you write binding user.username but it doesn t create binding because as zachary said datagrid column doesn t inherited from frameworkelement and hasn t setbinding method. so expression binding user.username simply creates binding object and assign it to binding properties of column this properties is type of binding . then datagrid column while generates cells content generateelement - protected method uses this binding object to set binding on generated elements on text properties of generated textblock which are frameworkelements
chris mancini you do not create binding to binding properties of data grid column

1103603
inherited	properties
sql is not particularly good in handling multiple inherited
a classical approach to this problem is create a table called wall_container and keep properties common to both users and events in it reference both users and events to wall_container reference wall_posts to wall_container however this is not very efficient and it s not guaranteed that this wall_container doesn t containt records that are not either a user or an event

1104373
robocopy	xcopy
an alternate solution that copies one file at a time and does not require robocopy the outer for statement generates any possible path combination of subdirectory in source_dir and name in filenames_to_copy
for each existing file xcopy is invoked

1104441
superclass	subclassing
ib will recognise outlets in the superclass as for whether subclassing the controller is a good or bad idea i m not sure
apple suggests subclassing nsarraycontroller in order to change sorting filtering behaviour

1104473
for-loop	loops
edit for comments it might not be global as you say but it s outside the scope of the for-loop
so the variable is the same reference each time round loops

1104479
superclass	subclassing
my initial approach was to extend the matrix type with a scala class and then overload the arithmetic operators and call the java native methods but the matrix class doesn t provide a default constructor without arguments the scala class needs one primary constructor i thought one good primary constructor could be the one accepting an array array double first thing that sucks that syntax is much more verbose and hard to read than double as far as i know by reading the manuals the parameters of the primary constructor are also implicitly fields of the class so i would end with one array array double in the scala subclassing and another double in the java superclass which is pretty redundant
i think i could have used an empty primary constructor that initialized the superclass with some default values for example a 0 or just make an adapter class that used the jama.matrix as a delegate but if a language is supposed to be elegant and seamless integrated with another that kind of things shouldn t happen

this is not always required but i ran into 2 separate cases where i needed to make this change basing a new site in a directory outside of the default xampp http root basically any path that will be accessible via http must have explicit permissions set adding mod_rewrite rules for a site set up as a virtual host under the default http path i was getting the error .htaccess rewriteengine not allowed here
reading the comments in httpd.conf about the allowoverride option makes the cause of the error obvious but i had overlooked that before

1105525
range	max
32 bit on sql server. he just looked at the range of float and did not think about the fact never mind that for larger numbers the ones place is not held in the number due to limited precision
so his code to take max pk + 1.0 would at some point return a number equal to max pk

1105566
firefox	safari
if you can make something look right in three of the above browsers you ll probably be fine when any of those browsers upgrades in the future ie9 firefox 4 etc.
doesn t look right in chrome safari firefox either so this really isn t an ie8 problem

1105762
opera	google-chrome
the specs say it does not work for netscape mozilla safari opera and internet explorer for the macintosh. .
google-chrome

1106609
disk	ram
network latency nearly everything that affects application speed said for disk is equivalent for network i o
ram if your ram is not big enough to store your complete application image you need to store it on an external disk

1106609
disk	ram
ram if your ram is not big enough to store your complete application image you need to store it on an external disk
therefore the disk i o slowdown bites you again

1107666
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
the reason for this behavior is that the only unchecked-exception in the java language is runtimeexception and it s subclasses
all other exceptions and errors including yours since it only subclasses exception and not runtimeexception are checked exceptions

1107717
put	get
a better idea would be to put a breakpoint at the end and debug it but that again has problems
it s frowned upon because it s a platform-specific hack that has nothing to do with actually learning programming but instead to get around a feature of the ide os - the console window launched from visual studio closes when the program has finished execution and so the new user doesn t get to see the output of his new program

1107718
cpu	processors
a blocking operation most importantly differs by leaving the cpu and associated resource path out and installing a wait of some form on the resource from which the desired event is expected
in a multitasking or multithreaded processors environment the usual case for a long time now where there are other operations possible while the desired event has not arrived burning cpu and resource access paths leads to an awful waste of processing power and time

1107718
cpu	processors	cpu	hyperthreading	processors	hyperthreading
in a multitasking or multithreaded processors environment the usual case for a long time now where there are other operations possible while the desired event has not arrived burning cpu and resource access paths leads to an awful waste of processing power and time
when we have a hyperthreading system like i think you are referring to in your question it is important to note that the granularity at which cpu threads are sliced is very high

1108167
x86	64bit
in the build settings for you project set the platform target to x86 instead of any cpu
this will solve problems where your project has hidden dependendencies on 32 bit subsystems that are not available in 64bit

1108403
observer-pattern	mvp	observer-pattern	presenter
to adopt the mvc pattern you want to implement the following the view hooks up to the model and listens for changes. the controller hooks up to the view and handles specific events button presses etc the model processes requests made by the controller and notifies the view. i agree with jimmy you would want to integrate something like observer-pattern to this type of system so its possible for the model to inform the view when it changes so the view can then update itself accordingly
the difference with mvp is it introduces a presenter class which monitors the model on behalf of the view in other words the view doesn t know about the model it only knows about its presenter

1108902
put	get
for tracking the work i define a set of milestones for roughly the next three releases and put things i want to do into those milestones and then hammer away
it s important not to get stuck in a rut though this project is partly for me so every now and then i ll add a new feature or re-write a big chunk on a whim

1109023
mouse	keyboard
that s what qrubberband uses to let it s parent handle the mouse events
as for keyboard events a qwidget doesn t get any keyboard events unless it has set itself a focuspolicy

1109292
hash	salt	hash	md5
md5 is a hash algorithm which is a one-way function
you cannot reverse the hash on your oscommerce system to remove the salt and rehash

1109329
hash	md5
do not save plain md5 hash in your database
plain md5 hash can be reverse engineered quickly and easily using rainbow tables

1109329
hash	salt	salt	md5
anyways i want to reiterate that plain md5 hash are easy to crack for most passwords since people like short and easy to remember passwords. use a salt and or a more complex algorithm
i d recommend both and use a salt that is longer than two characters and not limited to numbers

1109587
distance	polygons
the resulting polygons lies at the required distance from the old polygons far enough from the vertices
near a vertex the set of points at distance d from the old polygons is as you say not a polygons so the requirement as stated cannot be fulfilled

1109651
jar	manifest.mf
there is not a way with the jar command
the closest you can get is to use -tf to show the presence or absence of a meta-inf manifest.mf file or -xf to extract it

1109725
cpu	processors
i wouldn t be surprised if various drivers and codecs are shipped in multiple versions and the correct one selected once the cpu has been interrogated
actually intel make or have made various kinds of processors including arm intel s arm processors were called xscale but i think they ve sold that business

1110101
getter	setter
by extension this also means that if the getter is defined in a different .dll .so the call can not be inlined
in any case i don t think trivial get setter are necessarily good oop practice or that there are all the other reasons for using them

1110150
nsstring	nsdata
i think the garbage comes from the logging here you are saying that you want an nsstring from this c-string array of bytes terminated by zero
the problem is that the bytes method of nsdata does not return data terminated by a zero because it s an ordinary array not a c-string

1110632
postgresql	mysql
if you want to scale more save time have less weird bugs to hunt have more simple application code spend more time optimizing your business not fighting with your database then the open source solution of choice is postgresql
some say mysql is simple and fast

1111599
wav	riff
if the file starts with riff then it s little endian. if it starts with ffir or rifx then it s probably not. generally supporting the wav means supporting riff files although adding rifx support should not prove difficult
the aes31 specification for bwf broadcast wave format references this specification for riff from this riff has a counterpart rifx that is used to define riff file formats that use the motorola integer byte-ordering format rather than the intel format

1112181
folder	directory
here s a screenshot of beyond compare comparing folder
whilst i don t agree with your stance on not creating repositories until after 2 months of development a tool you might find useful for merging entire directory is beyond compare

1112649
width	height
if you specify an explicit pixel width but no height flex wraps the text to fit the width and calculates the height to fit the required number of lines
if you specify a percentage-based width and no height flex does not wrap the text and the height equals the number of lines as determined by the number of return characters

1112649
width	height
if you specify a percentage-based width and no height flex does not wrap the text and the height equals the number of lines as determined by the number of return characters
if you specify only a height and no width the height value does not affect the width calculation and flex sizes the control to fit the width of the maximum line

1112649
width	height
if you specify only a height and no width the height value does not affect the width calculation and flex sizes the control to fit the width of the maximum line
as a general rule if you have long text you should specify a pixel-based width property

1112711
bazaar	trac
subversion is not a distributed approach -- go for mercurial bazaar or git instead
yes trac does do bug tracking among other things -- check it out

1113356
comparator	icomparer
and actually it could probably be improved to include the seed that you have... anyway the project is called essence and it uses the system.linq.expression libraries to generate based on attributes standard representations of equals gethashcode comparator tostring as well as being able to create iequalitycomparer and icomparer classes based on an argument list
i also have some further ideas but would like to get some community feedback before continuing too much further. what this means is that it s almost as fast as being handwritten - the main one where it isn t is the comparator

1113814
ant	cruisecontrol
however there are some links you can start with note that for running most open source continuous integration servers you need a java environment what continuous integration tool is best for a c++ project - some alternatives for continuous integration software continuous integration for c++ - some ideas for hudson configuration using cruisecontrol with c++ - some ideas and configurations for cruisecontrol compiling c c++ code with ant - if you do use the makefile project in cdt and do not want to use make as a build tool i personally prefer hudson because of its simply install no need for application server just start with java -jar hudson.war and easy to use and quite clever gui
hudson can checkout your code from svn or cvs and can run a shell script or ant file as a build script

1114794
windows	wow64
.net clr 3.0.30618 mozilla 4.0 -- netscape 4.0 compatible - compatible with whatever we just claimed to be but not actually msie 7.0 - internet explorer 7.0 windows nt 6.0 - windows vista wow64 - 32-bit ie on a 64-bit windows trident 4.0 - i m really internet explorer 8 trying to be internet explorer 7 -- this might be the source of your problems gtb6 - google toolbar 6 is installed slcc1 - secure licensing commerce client is available for windows anytime upgrade detection .net clr 2.0.50727 - .net framework 2 is installed media center pc 5.0 - windows media center 5 the versioning in windows vista is installed .net clr 3.0.30618 - .net framework 3 is installed
my user agent on ie8 on windows vista sp2 64-bit mozilla 4.0 compatible

1115321
int	chars
some of them have different data types for example oauth_timestamp is an int representing seconds since 1970 encoded in decimal ascii digits
an oauth token is conceptually an arbitrary-sized sequence of bytes not chars

1115476
opera	google-chrome
example with this you will achieve text-shadow with proper font-weight in these browsers firefox 3.5+ opera 9.5+ safari 1.1+ since 2003
google-chrome 2.0+ konqueror 3.4+ and if you want drop shadow in ie you can use filter expressions with dropshadow but i personally do not recommend using proprietary css extensions

1115476
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome 2.0+ konqueror 3.4+ and if you want drop shadow in ie you can use filter expressions with dropshadow but i personally do not recommend using proprietary css extensions
your only real loss then would be having an improper font-weight for older non-ie browsers like firefox 3.0 and lower and opera 9.2x and lower

1115484
typedef	struct
note that i removed the unnecessary typedef and inline s
it is difficult to say which one is right since unnamed struct s are not allowed by the standard although they are a common extension and as such the program is ill-formed

1115487
getter	setter
don t do it unless you have to use a different serializer such as datacontractserializer which also supports private getter setter or fields but doesn t support full xml control - for example see here use a separate dto
use your class with private setter in the app and a separate simpler class public get set for serialization perhaps with an implicit conversion operator between them make the get set public and don t worry about it i think i d go for the dto option

1115889
implements	extends
an interface on the other hand only allows you to declare that you want properties and or methods with a given name to exist in all classes that implements it - but doesn t specify how you should implements it
also a class can implements many interfaces but can only extends one abstract class

1116053
feedback	review
if you re heavily re-writing someone else s code you re effectively taking the time to review it anyway you just aren t providing the feedback which is the worthwhile part of code review
so sneak the review in under the radar - write a function or three then ask a colleague to look at it and give you instant feedback on whether it makes sense to them

1116253
keydown	keyup
keydown is handled at a lower level so it will capture all nonprinting keys like delete and enter
you shouldn t use the keypress event but the keyup or keydown event because the keypress event is intended for real printable characters

1116594
margin	height
make sure you set your margin and padding to 0
this is because slideup works by reducing the height to 0 but it doesn t change the margin

1116594
margin	height
this is because slideup works by reducing the height to 0 but it doesn t change the margin
so when the element has finished sliding up it still has a 15px margin

1117582
put	get
you add yourself into the group with change the group to www-data just in case you haven t sudo chgrp -r www-data var www get new files to inherit the permissions 750 sudo chmod -r 2750 www-data var www some people prefer to put it in home username www which would be easier
it doesn t matter i personally placed it in var www and put it under the www-data group and placed my username into the www-data group

1118402
post	get
maybe just keep it simple and limit the post per page provide paging functionality
this is familiar ui functionality to users they shouldn t get lost

1118678
folder	directory
check whether folder already exist at the destination in which case move files in that folder over and continue traversing the source directory structure otherwise move the folder wholesale
at the end of the script the source folder is removed altogether to eliminate these folder which have had their files moved over to an already existent folder at the destination meaning these folder have been emptied but not deleted at the source

1118678
folder	directory
additionally we check whether a folder is both empty and already exists at the destination in which case we do nothing and leave the source folder to be deleted to the last line of the script
not doing this results in the filename directory name or volume label syntax is incorrect. errors

1118936
persistent	transient
in that context persistent makes no sense and so it fails
the javadoc for hibernate session.persist i know you re not using the hibernate api but the semantics are the same and the hibernate docs are better says make a transient instance persistent

1118936
persistent	transient	instances	transient
the javadoc for hibernate session.persist i know you re not using the hibernate api but the semantics are the same and the hibernate docs are better says make a transient instances persistent
if your object already has an id it s not transient

1119051
post	get
i m not very familiar with how lucene.net supports threading but based on your description you may want to create a work queue that other threads post work to - and use a single thread to pick up the work from the queue and use an indexwriter to add it to the index
this way no single thread is ever starved from the opportunity to get its changes added to the index

1119334
free	malloc
the more interesting part is how free works and in this direction malloc too can be understood better
in many malloc free implementations free does normally not return the memory to the operating system or at least only in rare cases

1119334
free	malloc
the free block list is just a circular list of memory chunks which have some administrative data in the beginning
this is also the reason why managing very small memory elements with the standard malloc free is not efficient

1119371
free	malloc
malloc keeps some data structure let s say a list of all the free chunks of space in the heap
when you call malloc it looks through the list for a chunk that s big enough for you returns a pointer to it and records the fact that it s not free any more as well as how big it is. when you call free with the same pointer free looks up how big that chunk is and adds it back into the list of free chunks

1119371
free	malloc
when you call malloc it looks through the list for a chunk that s big enough for you returns a pointer to it and records the fact that it s not free any more as well as how big it is. when you call free with the same pointer free looks up how big that chunk is and adds it back into the list of free chunks
if you call malloc and it can t find any large enough chunk in the heap it uses the brk syscall to grow the heap increase address y and cause all the addresses between the old y and the new y to be valid memory

1120436
hash	salt
the weakness of hash passwords is the attacker s knowledge of your hash function
if they know your hash function but not your salt the salt has protected your passwords

1120436
hash	salt
if they know your hash function but not your salt the salt has protected your passwords
if they know both the hash function and your salt your data is at risk

1121225
folder	directory
if you want the .dll in that folder either create a reference to the .dll from your test project or use the deploymentitem attribute to make sure the item is copied to the test directory
the bin debug folder is not where the unit tests run

1121260
wxruby	shoes
at least for now you ll have better luck trying qtruby or wxruby or jruby
shoes doesn t support anything of the sort at present and there s a good chance it never will

1121403
scons	autotools
cmake scons bjam are nice but when it comes to serious work.
it is quite clear that autotools are superior not because cmake can t do the same thing but because it is just much harder to do so with it

1123887
ws-addressing	soap
the first and only one that comes into my mind is wso2 wsf php which features soap mtom ws-addressing ws-security ws-securitypolicy ws-secure conversation and ws-reliablemessaging at the cost of having to install a native php extension
the native php soapclient class does not support multipart messages and is strongly limited in all ws- matters and i also i think that neither the php written libraries nusoap nor zend_soap can deal with this sort of soap messages

1124122
put	get
the way forward is to create a review forum with the most vocal opponents and put them in a room with you and management
get them to defend their reasons for not wanting the new system

1124155
inherited	properties
i do not want to use typeof typename due to inherited issues
static properties aren t inherited in the normal sense

1125307
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	freebsd
and if you wish to move ahead and are suffering from the dogma of a simplified to more complex or geeky linux distro then read this question it made me stick to ubuntu
well freebsd contrary to everyone s expectation does not perform extra-ordinary well efficient or fast from ubuntu

1125307
freebsd	linux	ubuntu	linux
well freebsd contrary to everyone s expectation does not perform extra-ordinary well efficient or fast from ubuntu
various benchmarking are now available for linux and those benchmarks show clearly that there is very little difference between the two in terms of over-all performance

1125307
ubuntu	linux
it is important when you have to try any application or a new product or a new release it is far easier to install n try on ubuntu than on other linux variants
ofcourse this is not what you are looking for in the answer but i am giving my suggestion that ubuntu provide more peace of mind ease on work

1125337
qtp	loadrunner
if you mean simultaneous user testing with qtp as a proxy for load testing no it is not a good tool for that
you will want a real load testing tool rational performance tester opensta jmeter loadrunner et al

1125353
google-chrome	firefox
while google-chrome will execute javascript marked as javascript1.7 it does not support js1.7 features like the let scoped variable operator
this code will run on firefox 3.5 but not on google-chrome using v8 if you change language to javascript1.7 and omit the type it won t run with js 1.7 features in firefox 3.5

1125483
cpu	processors
because when you call usleep the cpu is put to work to something else for 1 second
so the current thread does not use any processors resources and that s a very clever thing to do

1125680
folder	directory
instead these folder references are added on the fly when you start the visual studio command prompt allowing you to run the tools
for example if you open a regular command prompt you cannot run xsd.exe without changing to the directory c program files microsoft visual studio 8 sdk v2.0 bin

1125799
explode	fgetcsv
if it is not a csv explode should be the best choice
if that string comes from a csv file i would use fgetcsv or str_getcsv if you have php v5.3

1125876
folder	directory
try setting a different chmod permission for your folder 777 . also try adding a to the end of your url
this checks if the requested url is an existing file or directory and only if that is not the case wordpress jumps in and tries to interpret the url via index.php

1126248
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
a for-loop gets compiled to code approximately equivalent to this where as a foreach loops gets compiled to code approximately equivalent to this so as you can see it would all depend upon how the enumerator is implemented versus how the lists indexer is implemented
as it turns out the enumerator for types based on arrays are normally written something like this so as you can see in this instance it won t make very much difference however the enumerator for a linked list would probably look something like this in .net you will find that the linkedlist t class does not even have an indexer so you wouldn t be able to do your for-loop on a linked list

1126426
udp	tcp
as far as i know it isn t possible to use udp with the major browser plugins flash silverlight etc
tcp is the lowest you get

1127044
nstimer	nsrunloop
an nsrunloop object also processes nstimer events
also in general your application does not need to either create or explicitly manage nsrunloop objects

1128033
gridview	objectdatasource
i couldn t use the emptydatatemplate property because i was creating my gridview dynamically with custom fields which provide filters in the headers
i couldn t use the example almny posted because i m using objectdatasource s instead of dataset or datatable

1128864
folder	directory
i know you d prefer to not use objective-c but here is an example of how to do it with objective-c use it like this nslog library folder pathforuserdirectory nslibrarydirectory
which will print the full posix path of the current user s library directory

1129041
folder	directory
that means that all files and paths are relative to your home folder home username for a user and root for the root user
finally you do not need to use the sudo command for writing code in your own home directory and thus you can just stick with gedit filename.java

1129486
range	max
then a helper given an index in the above range figure out where it is
doing the swap is pretty simple now this doesn t implement a max depth but it s a start

1130250
tabcontrol	tabitem
this smells like some tabcontrol funny behaviour since replacing tabcontrol with listbox works fine. as to the specific cause of the problem it isn t apparent to me
edit i ve checked your code and it seems that at runtime the contentpresenter of the tabitem does not inherit the datacontext from the tabcontrol as soon the item to display is of type visual or derived from it

1130714
int	chars	int	double
chars -128 to 127 - any ascii chars includes alphanumerics special chars int -32768 to +32767 - only numbers int float 3.4 e-38 to 3.4 e+38 double 1.7 e-308 to 1.7 e+308 void notapplicable in case if any of the above are not sufficient for representing any type for your problem c has provided us with compound types like struct where you can defined your own types
for eg fractions. to represent fraction we need two int one for the numerator second for the denominator

1131172
bytearrayoutputstream	inputstream
what you need to do is read from the stream write the results into a bytearrayoutputstream then convert the bytearrayoutputstream into an actual byte array by calling tobytearray
calling tostring on an inputstream doesn t do what you think it does

1133359
bindingsource	dataview
in order to be able to temporarily suspend data binding you ll have to put a bindingsource between your datagridview and your dataview
by setting the raiselistchangedevents property of the bindingsource to false changes in the underlying source are not notified to the datagridview

1133427
goto	break
if you need to break out more levels than that you will either have to add some kind of if or use the dreaded not recommended goto
you can use a break

1133611
cvs	svn
subversion for cvs users may also be worth reading
i m not sure if i understand the question correctly but you can tag a specific revision in svn svn cp -r url trunk url tags my_tag see the chapter on svn copy in version control with subversion for more information

1133735
cvs	svn
if you checkout a tag version from a cvs repository it cannot be modified or to say it better it can be modified on your local copy but you cannot commit back the changes
in some way cvs automatically protect its tags from accidental changes the copy in svn is just well a copy of the trunk in another path

1134474
std	ostream
the std streams are not designed to be subclassed as they have no virtual methods so i don t think you ll get too far with that
you can try aggregating a std ostream to do the work though

1135228
put	get
it comes down to cushycms s decision to edit files directly and not put the user-provided content in a database like wordpress dotnetduke drupal etc
so the real answer is you can t get there from here and should look into migrating to a database backed cms

1135307
folder	directory
the images must be stored in a folder outside of the public accessible directory
public_html js jquery.js index.php getimage.php private_images myimage.jpg note that private_images directory is not accessible when you now to create the getter script

1136877
inherited	properties
because the button s command properties is a dependencyproperty itself inherited from buttonbase and supports databinding already
if it isn t then a dependency properties on it will not work which is fine because you shouldn t have dependency properties on your view model in the first place

1137216
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
after a touchesbegan event is fired the uikit looks for a positional movement of the finger touch which translates into touchedmoved events as the x y of the finger is changed until the finger is lifted and the touchesended event is fired
if the finger is held down in one place it will not fire the touchesmoved event until there is movement

1137260
commandbinding	routedevent
as you have noticed the routedcommand class is an implementation of the icommand interface its main distinction if that its function is similar to that of a routedevent the execute and canexecute methods on a routedcommand do not contain the application logic for the command as is the case with a typical icommand but rather these methods raise events that traverse the element tree looking for an object with a commandbinding
the event handlers attached to the commandbinding contain the command logic

1137627
inline	inlining	inline-functions	inlining
inline-functions are not always guaranteed to be inline - some compilers only do this in release builds or when they are specifically configured to do so
also in some cases inlining may not be possible

1137849
qtableview	qtablewidget	qtableview	qabstractitemview
to get the selection you must call selecteditems which is again a method of qabstractitemview and not qtableview which is why you missed it in the docs
the method is public at the level of qabstractitemview but qtablewidget has a built-in model which you can t change

1138476
width	height
strangely this hack only worked by resetting the width not the height
i came across a similar problem with row height not resizing correctly

1138780
public	protected
while it would be possible to create a public clone method that would clone any object at all this would not be as good as a method written specifically for the class that needs it
clone is protected because it is something that ought to be overridden so that it is specific to the current class

1138823
public	protected
the method is protected because you shouldn t call it on object you can and should override it as public
from sun in class object the clone method is declared protected

1139034
cldc	midp
the apis section of the document you linked to lists only the basic midp cldc nokia ui apis jsr 30 connected limited device configuration cldc 1.0 jsr 37 midp 1.0 nokia ui api
basically your best if not only option is java me midp

1139366
inherited	properties
concerning oo i find i rarely use inherited in pure f# projects and favor composition and interfaces instead
this is mainly due to using the primary contructor that allows you to use it s parameters as private properties in your methods not sure if i worded that correctly

1139394
apache	nginx
serving static content from apache has overhead so it ll be a better idea if you server it using some lightweight webserver such as lighttpd or nginx and connect to apache using reverse proxy to serve the django based content
here s a tutorial on using nginx since you are using mod_wsgi you can run each site as different user as well so that two of them may not access each other s data

1140056
equals	gethashcode
the most important property a hash code implementation must have is this if two objects compare as equals then they must have identical hash codes
if you have a class where instances of the class compare by reference equality then you do not need to override gethashcode

1140061
int	chars
so you couldn t put a letter in a field that was an int type etc
it also limited the number of chars that could be entered based on the column size found in the database

1140062
background-image	background-position
once you have defined your background-image you ll need to define unique background-positions for each different button you d like to use
for backwards compatibility i would advise using class mixtures since as of now ie still doesn t support css3 attribute selectors like so if you give the .submit class the background-image property you can set the background-position property independently for each individual button and avoid having to repeat yourself several times

1140658
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome just doesn t ask for them at all
all right this was actually google-chrome caching more aggressively than firefox and ie

1142243
put	get
not too terribly different than taking an image from flicker they put a clear gif image over the image that you want to view so that when you right click and save you get the shield image however can be defeated by the lowly print screen button
if you want casual users from getting your file use a flash control and buffer a minute or two of your videos and make that flash authenticate with the server to get those files

public	protected
it seems that the listviewitemcollection class does not have a public default constructor
this means that you will have to explicitly create a constructor in your class which calls one of the accessible protected or public constructors in the listviewitemcollection class

1143527
glut	sdl	glut	glfw	glfw	sdl
you do not have to use glut though there s nothing wrong with it - i kind of like glfw
you could also try the tao framework a set of mono .net bindings to glut opengl sdl glfw and much more

1143973
sudo	passwd
maybe you don t need to sudo gem list passwd local gems # ...loads of gems listed ... sqlite3-ruby 1.2.4 # .
loads of gems listed ... if it s not there sudo gem install sqlite3-ruby will sort you out in no time

1144262
versioning	upgrade
that was added in versioning 1.5
you can upgrade your client to 1.6 but if the server is 1.3 then this is not enabled

1144289
g++	gcc
in general you should be using g++ to compile c++ programs
either use g++ readclientfile.cpp or gcc readclientfile.cpp -lstdc++ i m guessing gcc isn t linking vs

1144757
floating-point	integer
further although money looks like floating-point numbers it isn t
money changes hands in integer quantities of whatever your base unit is

1144979
postgresql	mysql
if you are going to attack this with concurrent requests i d go with postgresql
otoh if the data is going to be loaded once then scanned by a single thread maybe mysql in its acid not required mode would be the best match

1146395
public	protected
i m sure somebody will pipe up and dogmatically assert that you should only unit test public methods
if it needs unit testing it shouldn t be a protected or private method but i m not really interested in debating that

1146434
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
other places on the web suggest that you not use uinavigationcontroller if you need precise control over your views size and locations
they suggest that instead you create your own navigationcontroller class based on uinavigationbar

1146768
for-loop	loops
in a for-loop there is only one iteration variable for all of the loops
not one for each iteration of loops

1147232
int	chars
the case you most want to avoid is stride 0 of course which must be special-cased but to avoid also special-casing bucket_count stride equal to a small int you can just make the bucket_count prime and not care what the stride is provided it isn t 0.
usually a simple hash function works by taking the component parts of the input chars in the case of a string and multiplying them by the powers of some constant and adding them together in some int type

1147232
int	chars	multiplying	modulo
usually a simple hash function works by taking the component parts of the input chars in the case of a string and multiplying them by the powers of some constant and adding them together in some int type
so for example a typical although not especially good hash of a string might be then if a bunch of strings all having the same first chars are fed in then the results will all be the same modulo k at least until the int type overflows

1147232
int	chars
so for example a typical although not especially good hash of a string might be then if a bunch of strings all having the same first chars are fed in then the results will all be the same modulo k at least until the int type overflows
as an example java s string hashcode is eerily similar to this - it does the chars reverse order with k 31

1147858
versioning	upgrade
if you do it manually you can do it to a versioning that does not have a database splitter
but if you do use the splitter then--yes--you will have to upgrade to a versioning that has a splitter before doing it

1147901
wordpress	oscommerce
i would not recommend wordpress for an e-commerce site as it designed primarily to be a blog and therefore would not be particularly easy to adapt
you may want to look at oscommerce or another open source e-commerce cms

1148106
speex	ogg
speex is not a real transport format -- it has no framing built into the protocol so it is typically wrapped in an ogg stream whose api is unfortunately more complicated than the speex api itself but i digress... so audio x-speex really means speex in ogg
i haven t seen anywhere that flash supports ogg -- so those files you get from speexenc aren t going to work reportedly flash encodes decodes speex in flv format according to this page

1148207
fireworks	paint.net
the best image editor to achieve these effects is probably adobe fireworks which definitely doesn t come under the freeware category at around 700 and probably around 700 as well although i haven t checked
the best freeware editor in my opinion would be paint.net

1148804
haskell	ocaml
object-oriented not to be found in haskell or sml
ocaml has a bog-standard oo system grafted onto the core language not well integrated with other languages

1149762
cpython	ironpython
so my suggestion is use cpython for gui use a framework like wxpython pyqt and you would be happy
use cpython with ironpython you are bound to .net platform which do not have much cross platform support mono is there on linux but still for a cross platform app i wouldn t recommend .net

1150981
ncover	nant
about nant integration ncover has its own nant task
if some other tool doesn t include nant integration you could either write the nant task yourself it s quite easy really or just script it with embedded boo

1151373
folder	directory
if there is not a tmp folder in your current set up create one that is not browseable by users and tell the php.ini file the location as directed above
wikimedia s advice is check to make sure php s directory for storing session data is writable

1151525
folder	dir
googling around i found out that there is no hard reason not to dump them all into a single directory as long as you don t ask the underlying os to do a folder listing
in other words calling for a ls dir would hang the machine but just retrieving single image files by their filename from the database would imply no performance penalty

1151844
qobject	qmetaobject
on a sidenote the additional argument from cjhuitt s answer isn t necessary anymore it was in qt 4.1 since connect defaults to qt autoconnection which now qt 4.2 does the right thing and switches between queued and direct connection mode based on qthread currentthread and the thread affinity of the receiver qobject at emit time instead of sender and receiver affinity at connect time
stribika got it almost right qmetaobject invokemethod textedit append qt queuedconnection q_arg qstring mystring

1152288
bids	ssis
bids has been replaced by sql server data tools a free plugin for visual studio including the free visual studio community edition
it sounds like you have installed sql server 2005 express edition which does not include ssis or the business intelligence development studio

1152432
maven	pom.xml
for more details on using maven check out the maven the definitive guide by sonatype it is online and free
if maven has access to the central repository it will download most plugins some are not hosted on central to access those you need to define an additional repository in your pom.xml or settings . if the dependencies are configured in your pom.xml maven will automatically attempt to download them when you run a relevant goal

1153158
nsstring	nsobject
also the specifier is not limited to nsstring objects but is for any objective-c objects
the base nsobject class provides a generic description of the object consisting of its class and its address but many objects will supply information specific to their type such as the collection classes nsarray nsdictionary which will supply nicely formated dump of their contents

1153743
disk	ram
key points the data storage that we call process memory is in my opinion best visualized as a massive file on disk
ram can be seen as merely a performance optimization total amount of virtual memory your program consumes is really not hugely relevant to its performance running out of ram seldom results in an out of memory error

1154111
actionscript	haxe
but as your active tags indicate you never really dealt with actionscript or flash so i am not sure if it is not simpler to use the adequate cocoa frameworks to get your stuff done .
there is an advantag in using haxe and flash api i think it is a lot easier than related cocoa frameworks a friend of mine who is a mac developer started with the iphone so i have a superficial insight but it was a little shocking how little he had up and running after 2 days of work .

1154650
memcpy	memset
memcpy copies memory that s a read and a write and you don t need the read
memset which only writes only writes bytes so that isn t going to work either unless colorval is also a byte

1154832
domxpath	domdocument
the domxpath beeing constructed with the domdocument as parameter maybe it ll work.
i have not tried but the second parameter of domdocument __construct seems to be related to the encoding

1155092
post	get
i will post my results as a comment here
update to get a pure-static python executable you must also configure as follows once you build with these flags enabled you will likely get lots of warnings about renaming because library isn t present

1155448
inherited	subclassing
if a child class does not declare its own meta class it will inherited the parent s meta
if the child wants to extend the parent s meta class it can subclassing it

1155538
inherited	properties
properties are inherited fields are not
protected fields are visible to descendant classes but not inherited by them

1156108
post	get
there is also an other thing to take into account if you are modifying data you should use post
not get which is used to.

1156487
equals	gethashcode
an object hash code may be useful for determining when two objects are not equals but to determine whether they are equals you will have to call equals
an implementation that always returns 0 for gethashcode is legal but may not be very efficient when objects of that type are inserted int various types of containers

1156524
equals	gethashcode
you shouldn t implement equals in term of gethashcode ever
it s perfectly valid for gethashcode to have collisions but equals must not return false positives

1158121
folder	directory
vs 2003 requires a web application to be a configured virtual folder in iis
it does not need to be copied to inetpub wwwroot folder but it does need to be a virtual directory

1158121
folder	directory
it does not need to be copied to inetpub wwwroot folder but it does need to be a virtual directory
so you do not need to copy the files to the iis folder

1158483
merb	ruby-on-rails
matz himself prefers merb over ruby-on-rails 2 because ruby-on-rails create a dsl on top of ruby which is really against the ruby philosophy
and i reckon because ruby-on-rails itself is opiniated which in turn if you don t have the same opinion as the creator it might not fit your needs

1159253
inherited	properties
inherited doesn t provide a mechanism of method grouping. the core concept of classic inherited and polymorphism is conveniently captured in the liskov substitution principle
stolen from that wiki page if s is a subtype of t then objects of type t in a program may be replaced with objects of type s without altering any of the desirable properties of that program

1159613
lisp	scheme
using sicp with common lisp is possible and fun you can use common lisp for learning with sicp without much problems
the scheme subset that is used in the book is not very sophisticated

1159613
lisp	scheme
generally make sure the code is compiled since common lisp interpreters will usually not support tco
sometimes it might also helpful to write one or two macros and provide some scheme function names to make code look a bit more like scheme

1160031
int	chars
in the western world we tend to use a fairly uniform format - a few differences but they re mostly street number - numeric house or building name - varchar - in the uk some houses buildings are identified by name not by number street number suffix varchar although in most cases chars 1 would suffice a b etc street name varchar street type varchar or int if you have a streettypes table so far i ve found 262 unique types in the english speaking world there are likely more and don t forget other languages strasse rue etc
street direction varchar 2 n e s w ne se nw sw address type varchar or int if you have an addresstypes table po box apartment building floor office suite etc.

1160417
inherited	subclassing
although if you have a lot of columns that are only used by one subclassing sti probably isn t the best inherited model to use
as far as rails is concerned every column can be set in every subclassing

1160545
superclass	subclassing
superclass subclassing
synthesize will generate getter and setter methods for your property. dynamic just tells the compiler that the getter and setter methods are implements not by the class itself but somewhere else like the superclass or will be provided at runtime

1160545
superclass	subclassing
synthesize will generate getter and setter methods for your property. dynamic just tells the compiler that the getter and setter methods are implemented not by the class itself but somewhere else like the superclass or will be provided at runtime
uses for dynamic are with subclassing of nsmanagedobject coredata or when you want to create an outlet for a property defined by a superclass that was not defined as an outlet

1160756
getter	setter
as others have said in general you use synthesize to have the compiler generate the getter and or settings for you and dynamic if you are going to write them yourself
there is another subtlety not yet mentioned synthesize will let you provide an implementation yourself of either a getter or a setter

1160756
getter	setter
there is another subtlety not yet mentioned synthesize will let you provide an implementation yourself of either a getter or a setter
this is useful if you only want to implement the getter for some extra logic but let the compiler generate the setter which for objects is usually a bit more complex to write yourself

1161356
equals	tostring
make sure it displays all the fields that your equals and hashcode methods are based on if you override those as well
for display to end users i wouldn t use tostring though

1161401
folder	directory
put all shared assemblies into a lib directory under your main trunk folder and reference them into your web site from lib
in this case tfs will not check-in the assemblies into the bin folder of your web site but it will only add a text file which has the same name as your assembly and with the .refresh extension for example myassembly.dll.refresh which contains a single line pointing to the location of the real assembly

1162113
hash	salt
people have been computing and publishing rainbow tables which make it possible to shortcut a lot of the computation required to reverse a particular hash
jeff had a blog post on rainbow tables too . salt helps protect against rainbow tables because you would need a table set for each possible value of the salt but the size of the salt used in the classic implementation of crypt is only 12 bits so that isn t as huge a block as might be hoped

1162344
sorting	filtering
if you have some reason to expect continuity or bounded change the vector is of consecutive sensor readings then sorting will destroy the time information or whatever the vector index represents
filtering by detecting large spikes isn t a bad idea but you would want to compare the spike to a larger neighborhood 2nd difference effectively has you looking within a window of +-2

1162572
pop-up	dialog
not exactly sure about your situation but we had a problem with a pop-up window that also displayed a print dialog box when loaded
our main problem was that we forgot to create a new ie instance and attach it to the pop-up

1162749
submit	submission
as far as i know you cannot submit an upload with ajax like that
you can fake it by creating a form inside an and then submission it but i don t think you can use pure ajax to do it

1162834
accessor	ivar	accessor	properties
using the public accessor to set the properties to nil in dealloc either self setfoo nil or self.foo nil may have unwanted side effects
a assign properties does not have to have its ivar set to nil in -dealloc

1162850
stdout	fflush
but if you don t care for details here s the short answer use pty.spawn in the following manner with your own command of course and here s the long answer with way too many details the real issue seems to be that if a process doesn t explicitly fflush its stdout then anything written to stdout is buffered rather than actually sent until the process is done so as to minimize io this is apparently an implementation detail of many c libraries made so that throughput is maximized through less frequent io
if you can easily modify the process so that it fflush stdout regularly then that would be your solution

1163208
postgresql	mysql
postgresql vs
mysql and not on the framework - except that some data mapping library may make inefficient use of sql

1163299
catalyst	anyevent
it s still pretty light-weight has a reasonable amount of plugins a decent website and isn t as slow or heavy as catalyst
cgi application dispatch thus cgi application too cgi fast dbix class template toolkit dbd pg coro anyevent gtk2 config general pdl devel nytprof moose wish it was faster to start up i develop web apps and desktop apps with these

1163446
gridview	objectdatasource	gridview	sqldatasource
examples datasourceid asp objectdatasource id ods1 runat server selectmethod test typename testbl asp gridview id gv1 runat server datasourceid ods1 in this case databinding occurs automatically datasource asp gridview id gv2 runat server and in code behind you would have something like this please note that i have used instead of angular brackets
the two properties are mutually exclusive when you use one of them you are not allowed to use the other one the datasourceid property is to be used with a datasource control objectdatasource xmldatasource sqldatasource etc the datasource property is to be used with custom objects custom data binding

1163561
postgresql	mysql
another issue i ve seen is that early postgresql on windows will by default make sure that it s writes are going through the write cache - even if it s battery backed
afaik mysql does not do this and it will greatly affect write performance

1164068
short	base
not sure how it packs bool char and short members
if 99 of the 100 base types of the object mentioned have no new instance fields declared then their per-object allocation overhead is zero

1165466
for-loop	loops
is the same as actually the for-loop is a little better because the i will be out of scope after loops while the i will stick around in the while loops case. a for-loop is just a syntactically prettier way of looping
no changing the type of loops wouldn t matter

1165553
ant	maven
maven configuration is very verbose though maven 3 promises to address this and if you want to do anything that is not the maven way you have to write a plugin or use the hacky ant integration
note i happen to like writing maven plugins but appreciate that many will object to the effort involved

1165693
for-loop	loops
you are not obliged not to modify for-loop variables but it is a common and good practice
the difference between for and while is semantic in a while loops you will loops as long as the condition is true which can vary a lot because you might in your loops modify variables using in evluating the while condition

1165693
for-loop	loops
usually in a for-loop you loops n time
this n can be variable but doesn t move until the end of your n loops as usually developpers doesn t modify variables evaluated in loops condition

1166235
equals	gethashcode
it is really important to make sure you keep the override of .gethashcode in step with equals
basically you must make sure they consider the same fields so as not to violate the first of the three rules of gethashcode from msdn object.gethashcode if two objects compare as equal the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value

1166235
equals	gethashcode
basically you must make sure they consider the same fields so as not to violate the first of the three rules of gethashcode from msdn object.gethashcode if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values

1166235
equals	gethashcode
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values
in other words you must make sure that every time .equals considers two instances equals they will also have the same .gethashcode

1166315
translation	localization
if you need the ability to translation your software into other languages then i would place as many strings that are displayed to an end user as you can in resource files
if you do not need localization or if the strings in question are never displayed to an end user i would use constants

1166388
qlabel	pyqt
tabbing from link to link in qlabel
i m answering in c++ here since that s what i m most familiar with and your problem isn t specific to pyqt

1166537
free	malloc
the infrastructure to create to avoid this problem is called code review though in this case a quick grep malloc or grep free on the codebase will probably suffice
the easy way to not get them mixed up is never to use malloc then you will never be tempted to call free

1166712
versioning	upgrade
i really like the idea of red-gate s sql packager which will diff your two database versioning and then create a sql script a c# project or a stand-alone executable to upgrade from versioning 1 to versioning 2
not 100 how you d be able to upgrade from 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 all to 2.0 - check out their website and see if they offer something for that scenario

1167607
gtk	jhbuild
download and install the beta version of the gtk osx framework at before installing the meta-gtk-osx-python you need to build and install some other packages that jhbuild doesn t install automatically so what i did was i installed libpng by doing the command .local bin jhbuild build libpng you also need to install libtiff so do the command .local bin jhbuild build libtiff and also gtk-doc is needed so .local bin jhbuild build gtk-doc and finally you can now install meta-gtk-osx-python by doing a .local bin jhbuild build meta-gtk-osx-python let me know if it works
i don t use macports but it seems that jhbuild works for me

1167964
multiplying	multiplication
note that multiplying a matrix in place is going to get the wrong answer since you re going to be overwriting values before using them
that s not any matrix multiplication definition i ve ever seen

1168935
cpython	ironpython
note that with this code you can actually use extensions written for cpython from your ironpython code so that s not a discriminating condition any more
ironpython is .net-native -- so it will be preferable if you want to fully integrate your python code with .net all the way

1169169
lisp	scheme
i m not saying that it s not possible -- it is of course possible to implement the whole book in common lisp for example see bendersky s pages just as you can do so in c or perl or whatever
it s just going to harder with languages that are further apart from scheme

1169169
lisp	scheme
however common lisp s nil is still different it is also a symbol
so in scheme you have a clear separation something is either a list or one of the primitive types of values -- but in common lisp nil is not only false and the empty list it is also a symbol

1169169
lisp	scheme
so in scheme you have a clear separation something is either a list or one of the primitive types of values -- but in common lisp nil is not only false and the empty list it is also a symbol
in addition to this you get a host of slightly different behavior -- for example in common lisp the head and the tail the car and cdr of the empty list is itself the empty list while in scheme you ll get a runtime error if you try that

1169169
lisp	scheme
this is all the essence of rainer s first non solution and the reason he labeled it as bad . his third option -- rewriting functional loops expressed as recursive functions as common lisp loops dotimes dolist and the infamous loop can work for a few simple cases but at a very high cost the fact that scheme is a language that does proper tco is not only fundamental to the language -- it is also one of the major themes in the book so by doing so you will have lost that point completely
in addition there are some cases that you just cannot translate scheme code into a common lisp loop construct -- for example as you work your way through the book you ll get to implement a meta-circular-interpreter which is an implementation of a mini-scheme language

1169169
lisp	scheme
note that i m talking about the simple interpreters -- later in the book you implement this evaluator as something close to a register machine where you kind of explicitly make it do tco. the bottom line to all of this is that this evaluator -- when implemented in common lisp -- will result in a language that is itself not doing tco
people who are familiar with all of this should not be surprised after all the circularity of the evaluator means that you re implementing a language with semantics that are very close to the host language -- so in this case you inherit the common lisp semantics rather than the scheme tco semantics

1169169
lisp	scheme
again this is something that might not bother you but it will damage the overall learning experience. all in all very few languages get close to scheme in being able to implement the semantics of the language inside the language as a non-trivial eg not using eval evaluator that easily. in fact if you do go with a common lisp then in my opinion rainer s second suggestion -- use a common lisp implementation that supports tco -- is the best way to go
however in common lisp this is fundamentally a compiler optimization so you will likely need to a know about the knobs in the implementation that you need to turn to make tco happen b you will need to make sure that the common lisp implementation is actually doing proper tco and not just optimization of self calls which is the much simpler case that is not nearly as important c you would hope that the common lisp implementation that does tco can do so without damaging debugging options again since this is considered an optimization in common lisp then turning this knob on might also be taken by the compiler as saying i don t care much for debuggability

1169518
int	chars
the only cross-platform way to do it is to read it byte by byte that is chars by chars and build an int out of them
you d want to use long because int is not guaranteed to be wide enough to hold a 32-bit value

1169791
put	get
so put simple_html_dom.php somewhere in your application directory and then do require simple_html_dom.php
installing the file in the os doesn t really get you anywhere since it needs to be accessible on your server

1170103
paradox	bde
two good options change the net dir in the bde admin to a path the user has access to bde admin configuration drivers native paradox change net dir apply adjust the access rights on the required files on c to allow the user access and one bad option run the program as administrator
on vista normal users do not have write-access to c so you get the permission denied error message when trying to use paradox since it needs to write to some files

1170326
next	except
rerunning succeeded on the next execution of the build script. also using like you sm d du not using n additionally using t
i ve just now just once experienced the same condition immediately after a successful invocation with the same parameters except on a different msi file

1171087
dictionary	map
finally i d add a method to extract the details into a dictionary or probably an ilookup if you re using framework v3.5 something like
you can t - from ayende s blog discussing map i would like to point out that i have still not covered all the options for map there are even more options although idictionary k ilist v is not something that is possible to map for the problematic sql statements that would be required to do so

1171285
hash	md5
also look at the nist cryptographic hash project and their tentative timeline of development of new hash functions another recent discussion -- sha-3 second round candidates released july 2009
an alternative to md5 is would be the md6 hash algorithm but it is not ready yet

1172115
children	parent
since the topology of the tree does not change this would automagically take care of the children having a correct parent
the downside of course is that you no longer can directly find out the parent from a user record and would need to go via the nodes

1172805
maven	pom.xml
note you may need to invoke maven with the -n option in order to run this goal if your project is broken so badly that it cannot build because of the version mis-match
versions lock-snapshots searches the pom.xml for all -snapshot versions and replaces them with the current timestamp version of that -snapshot -20090327.172306-4 versions unlock-snapshots searches the pom.xml for all timestamp locked snapshot versions and replaces them with -snapshot

1172949
client-side	server-side
as has been pointed out user management and role-based security in a win forms app is not something that will actually work client-side
in a web analogy imagine trying to implement all of your security using only javascript and cookies keeping no information on the server-side

1174203
disk	ram
on the iphone you do not normally load the entire audio into ram because of the size constraints and the speed of the disk
using the audioqueue api you write a callback function that populates a buffer from the disk usually using audiofile methods

1174239
inherited	properties
about basic dependency properties a very rough statement would be that they basically inherited their values from parent elements in the wpf logical visual tree
a dependency properties attached or not inherits its value downwards if its metadata is set with the frameworkpropertymetadataoptions

1176134
subclass	superclass
just because they both subclass exception eventually doesn t mean they re related to each other
you can only throw a checked exception if that exception class or a superclass is explicitly listed in the throws clause

1176517
prepare	execute
that s simply not the way you use prepare statements
it is perfectly okay to insert one row per query because you can execute one prepare statement multiple times with different parameters

1177376
hash	md5
from that page however for merkle-damgård hash functions the concatenated function is only as strong as the best component not stronger
joux noted that 2-collisions lead to n-collisions if it is feasible to find two messages with the same md5 hash it is effectively no more difficult to find as many messages as the attacker desires with identical md5 hashes

1177377
range	minimum
to do this it discards pixel colors at each end of the red green and blue histograms which are used by only 0.05 of the pixels in the image and stretches the remaining range as much as possible
the result is that pixel colors which occur very infrequently at the outer edges of the histograms perhaps bits of dust etc. do not negatively influence the minimum and maximum values used for stretching the histograms in comparison with stretch contrast

1178579
put	get
it s not uncommon to put the source code to 3rd party libraries in your own revision control or just put the headers and binary libraries in - whatever works best for your situation
1 is fine for users downloading the source for your project assuming that the list of dependencies does not get out of control and they remain easy to acquire

1178595
sorting	grouping	filtering	grouping
only the first part of a possible solution -- maybe it ll help you get to the full solution what about a view node with something like that i use drupal in french so it might not always be the right words sorry fields taxonomy term node title as link to node filtering whatever you want sorting whatever you want on the left of the screen base parameters or something like this style html list or table the little wheel icon on the right of style when you click on it you have to possibility to choose in a select list a grouping field
select taxonomy term it should list the nodes grouping by taxonomy terms

memcached	apc
to answer your first point the power of memcached is that it allows to create a cluster of cache servers it is not meant to be used on a single server event it you can use it that way the theory is you have many servers and each one has some free ram you have no use for to use this ram you install memcached on these servers and configure it to use the amount of ram that wasn t used and if one machine is down it automatically stops using it and put load balance the data on the others the drawback of memcached for some people is that it s network based even when you use it on only one machine
which means a bit slower that local-only apc works on only one machine it is great used as a caching mecanism to store data you only need on one server or if you only have one server

1179908
fseek	fread
in particular make sure fseek is returning 0 - if it s not this may be the entire problem
provided that fseek is succeeding fread should tell you the total number of bytes read

1179908
fread	strlen
provided that fseek is succeeding fread should tell you the total number of bytes read
also strlen is not necessarily a valid thing to use since it s going to assume that this is a null terminated string

1179924
bindparam	bindvalue
to bind those parameters you ve got to use bindparam and not bindvalue
here are some i can think about with bindparam you can only pass variables

1179924
bindparam	bindvalue
here are some i can think about with bindparam you can only pass variables
not values with bindvalue you can pass both values obviously and variables bindparam works only with variables because it allows parameters to be given as input output by reference and a value is not a valid reference in php it is useful with drivers that quoting the manual support the invocation of stored procedures that return data as output parameters and some also as input output parameters that both send in data and are updated to receive it

1180895
post	put
if not post how far you get and i ll have a another look during the week
sounds like fun if you could put them all in a single directory opening each file is reasonably easy have a search on that first

1181030
put	get
if it exists index.php outputs the profile if it doesn t have the script redirect to users 404.php but if the user does exist all your visitor will see is that they put in www.example.org users foo and they got to foo s user page
no get variables for a hacker to exploit and a pretty easy to put on another blog or business card url

1181524
addslashes	multibyte
with regards to this vulnerability when character set-unaware escaping is used for example addslashes in php it is possible to bypass the escaping in some multibyte character sets for example sjis big5 and gbk
as a result a function such as addslashes is not able to prevent sql-injection attacks

1182972
uiview	calayer
if however you are only interested in performing basic animation and it can be done through uiview the api is usually simpler so it will make sense to use uiview to save yourself time there
you use calayer when you are not getting any benefits from using uiview and when it s not possible to do the thing you want to do with uiview

1182972
uiview	calayer
you use calayer when you are not getting any benefits from using uiview and when it s not possible to do the thing you want to do with uiview
following this line of thought if your need is not making use of any ui controls and or you want to create your own custom animation 2d or 2.5d animation it makes sense to drop down to the coreanimation level and create your own calayer to do your thing there

1183073
uiview	calayer
while an uiview has a memory footprint of at least 4 width height pixels this statement is absolutely not true
the memory overhead of a uiview compared to a calayer is just the size of the instance variables of the uiview class plus a few instances of additional classes that will get allocated

1183622
postgresql	mysql
i ve long loved postgresql but with the current 8.4 release it really seems to have reached a peak
don t ignore postgresql -- every bit as open as mysql not in the middle of a muddle caused in mysql s case by acquisition by sun then by oracle core developers leaving forks into drizzle mariadb ourdelta ... and just about as functionally rich and sql standards compliant as ms sql server if not more i miss recursive ctes a lot when i have to use mysql -- both sql server and postgresql have them though just as the sql standards require

1183747
starttls	smtps
the following command does work openssl s_client -starttls smtps -connect smtp.gmail.com 587 so i think what is happening is that you do not have starttls support enabled
i am not sure how to do it in ruby buy what i did find out is that the action_mailer_tls plugin allows this by patching net smtps

1184180
hash	md5
irreversible use a hash sha-1 of the given string
modern hash algorithms not md5 can be considered collision-free

1184207
postgresql	mysql
you might want to subscribe to rsses of one of 2 postgresql planets don t ask why there are 2 of them planet.postgresql.org and planetpostgresql.org also subscribing to postgresql related lists can help - you can find list of them in here
important things if you can as since you re starting and own a server - you can use the latest released version 8.4 at the moment make sure autovacuum is turned on in postgresql.conf if you have problems - usually the fastest way to get help is to join #postgresql on freenode.net irc network and ask there there are some things mysql has and postgresql doesn t replace for example - usually if something is not in postgresql there are good reasons for it and or a workarounds

1184406
direct3d	directdraw
aoe 2 is a directdraw application not direct3d
there is no way to compare opengl and directdraw

1184528
postgresql	mysql
the time to make the switch is highly dependent on you application environment however if you need clustering and replication to work properly 100 of the time then postgresql will not let you down as mysql has for me in the past
as to skaffman s point you may want to have a look at postgresql if mysql isn t scaling for you

1184528
postgresql	mysql
as to skaffman s point you may want to have a look at postgresql if mysql isn t scaling for you
it is a more mature and robust than mysql and is opensource

1186408
entity-relationship	diagram
entity-relationship diagram i know this is not uml but a good database design upfront is important and an entity-relationship diagram would help you to organise and plan how different tables relate with each other
it s good to have a set of uml diagram to keep track of what is happening but to remember in the end that documentation decays - your code is your design

1186550
put	get
unless you put it in an tag you can not get the visited active etc colors without javascript
you can however get the pointing hand cursor and the ability for it to go somewhere when you click on it

1186828
draggable	droppable
all that s needed is to hook into the start event of the draggable and conditionally change the accept options of the droppable you want them to work with
running a quick test myself it does not appear that jquery ui inserts any more css classes into the draggable-helper if it is over a droppable so you cannot use pure css to change the colour of the helper when it is over a droppable

1186875
jar	war
basically extract out the common functionality make it a library as a jar file and either include that jar file in both war files or add it to a common part of the classpath
war files are meant to be whole web applications not libraries

1187573
setinterval	settimeout
for your first problem don t use setinterval ndash
use settimeout in the callback for your request don t forget to call your function once after it has been defined to start it off after that settimeout will be called every time after a request has finished. note that in some cases you might not reach readystate 4

1187628
for-loop	loops
if not you need to change the for-loop to a for
in loops

1188158
inline	inlining
yes the clr will inline that in normal cases
there are some situations in which inlining doesn t take place however - including anything derived from marshalbyrefobject because it could be a runtime proxy

1188832
installation	upgrade
specific reasons not to upgrade software installation and regression testing costs money
hence the need for a compelling reason to upgrade

1189834
factors	mean
maybe we can point you at the right algorithm if we know what you are trying to do why must numbers over 10 000 use the 1 000 factors
what do you mean that the sqrt function doesn t work as you expect

1190371
public	protected
even then though you would bind a properties on the mxml file either in an mx script or in code-behind via inherited and then have your textfield bind to the properties then your field would be declared now displaynamelabel.text will automatically change everytime you change your public displayname properties
i m not sure but it s possible that control instances are generated as protected

1190687
int	chars
using a chars literal in an enum is essentially the same as assigning a chars to an int it s totally legal and can be quite useful in many situations
that is not a single-quoted string it s a chars literal

1190815
ati	nvidia
apparently ati has beta drivers and libraries but they are not publicly available yet
i believe nvidia has released a beta windows opencl sdk but i have no idea what the requirements to use that are

1191122
hash	salt
why not add a random salt to the password and hash that combination
the advantage of a random salt is that the user is free to change it s username

1191124
hash	salt
many systems will store the plain text salt in the database in the column right next to the hash password
the salt helps to ensure that if two people user a and user b happen to share the same password it isn t obvious

1191128
width	height
if you don t set the width or the height they will naturally form
the height is determined by the length of the content and the width if not specified will fill the width of the container it is in

1191128
width	height
the height is determined by the length of the content and the width if not specified will fill the width of the container it is in
if the width of the container is the whole page then it will take up the whole page.

1191322
hash	salt
at least that s the idea anyway. it s more complicated than that of course since hash value output is fixed length whereas the possible input while in practical terms isn t infinite is definitely more than the possible number of output
now where salt comes in is because simple hashing of the password alone isn t secure either

1191598
single-quotes	double-quotes
can they be escaped by with backslashes or by enclosing them in single-quotes
if there s an odd number of them the match must have occurred inside a pair of double-quotes so it s not valid the lookahead fails

1192000
superclass	subclassing
vtables are another issue and are per-class and not per-instance anyway -- an instance of the subclassing embeds if you will one of the superclass
say all instance variables are 32-bit ints for simplicity if the superclass has 3 and the subclassing adds 2 more then each instance of the subclassing will allocate 5 x 4 20 bytes -- 8 for its own instance variables plus 12 for the instance variables of the superclass

1192094
post	get
when i post the form php was not finding any post parameters. it was random some time it was working and some time not
even i tried with get it worked some time and some time not

1192226
melt	reshape
you can also use melt from the reshape library i think it s easier to use than reshape itself - that ll save you the extra step of having to add the time column back in.
for this particular task however i would consider using the zoo library which would not require you to reshape the data frame r developers contributors gabor and hadley in this case have blessed us with many great choices

1192514
put	get
you wouldn t be able to put a price in the value because multiple things might be the same price
then when the form is submitted on the next page you d get these ids and query the database with these ids for the total price

1192713
maven	m2e
to solve this you must tell eclipse to compile to a different place than maven
m2e doesn t support this

1193279
versioning	upgrade
the only issue i m aware of about jrails is that current versioning isn t compatible with ruby 1.9
right now there s no real alternative. however you can install jrails then upgrade the jquery installation simply replacing the javascript files except jrails.js in the javascripts folder

1194199
dynamic-languages	typechecking
if you don t do testing in a dynamic-languages you can get hit by run-time errors that the compiler would catch in a statically typed language - but it turns out this is not as much of a win for statically typed languages as you might think because you should be doing testing in both types of languages anyway
you need to test in statically typed languages to catch the other logical errors that the typechecking won t catch - and in many cases those types of tests passing would rule out the type related errors anyway - so you don t need enough extra testing in dynamic languages to offset the type declaration coding you don t have to do

1195096
folder	directory
for example if you want to remove a file from a folder you need access to the folder and the file because the file is stored inside the folder
if however you want to remove a file from a directory you need access only to the directory because a directory itself is just a regular file that lists the locations of but does not contain other files

1195267
superclass	subclassing
for the purposes of this question all of the interesting methods in defaultannotationhandlermapping and its superclass are protected and so not visible to external code
however it would be trivial to write a custom subclassing of defaultannotationhandlermapping which overrides these methods and makes them public

1196642
for-loop	loops
the java design of the enhanced for-loop was to not expose the iterator to code but the only way to safely remove an item is to access the iterator
so in this case you have to do it old school if in the real code the enhanced for-loop is really worth it then you could add the items to a temporary collection and call removeall on the list after loops

1197324
perl	tcl
it is written in tcl which is a language somewhat simpler than perl but broadly in the same family and not difficult to learn
i think perhaps the tool you want is not perl but expect

1197491
put	get
you should also put as many constraints on your data as you think is reasonable
all of these goals tend to make queries a teeny bit longer as you have to join different tables to get the desired information but with the right names for tables and columns this shouldn t be a burden from the point of view of readability

1197642
spaces	delimiter
try this instead the problem is that actually only matches spaces if any that are alone on a line --not the newlines themselves
this leaves the delimiter empty when there s nothing on the line which doesn t make sense

1197764
folder	directory
i guess the windows installer team decided not to simplify things and only support ini files in the windows folder by not allowing a dynamic path
the windows installer documentation states that the .ini file must be present in the default microsoft windows directory

1197875
int	boolean
in c# this would refer to bool boolean int int32 float single long int64
int bool etc are not actual parts of the language but rather just shortcuts or aliases for the actual type

1198167
disk	ram
if you can parallelize disk access by using multiple disk faster disk a ram disk ... you may benefit way more
also be sure to have io not block the application read from disk and process while waiting for io

1198206
disk	ram
postgresql will for example switch to a sorting operation more suitable for on-disk sort than in-memory sort if it knows the sort will happen on disk - which it won t know if it happens in swap
also postgresql can switch to a completely different plan for example using a different join method if it figures out the data does not fit in ram

1198427
post	put
that also has the link to the code so you can download and play with settings in the project if the post is not enough
first you obviously have to put your code into a framework

1198919
ssl	https
on a side note https is not using ssl exclusivley anymore tls the successor to ssl see rfc2818 is more modern rule of thumb users should have the choice if they want http or https in noncritical environments but forced to use https on the critical parts of your site login cart payment ... to prevent malicious attacks
some webservers are configured to mirror the whole site so you can get every page over http or https depending on what you prefer or how the webbrowser sends them around

1198963
folder	directory
but if you are in a library and do not have access to the application or environment objects you should consider making a basefolder parameter or property to let the main application take control over folder
it is always dangerous to rely on the current directory concept so you will need a starting point

1199094
inherited	properties
the problem i am coming into is that the particular object is inherited from a base class and those base class properties values are not updated
the below code copies over top level properties values

1199340
rdf	owl
if it s not you ve either got to convert it from its current form into rdf on the fly or permanently
to do it on the fly you could use a technology like d2r which maps relational databases to rdf there s some other semantic web c# stuff about like rowlex which is more owl based or there s my own dotnetrdf library but that s only just about to be a first alpha release so i wouldn t recommend it for any production systems yet

1200052
firefox	safari
the usage of native control and font rendering mechanisms is where you ll see the most differences in firefox
in safari while not officially acknowledged there does seem to be some deliberate changes in the port

1200516
nstreecontroller	nsarraycontroller
bind the nstreecontroller s managedobjectcontext directly to the managedobjectcontext property of the appdelegate and remove the whole nsarraycontroller
nstreecontroller can add remove items from the managedobjectcontext but not from the nsarraycontroller s arrangedobjects as it is read-only

1201033
put	get
this same developer though could put the same code into the application version and be as likely to be caught or not causght as if they maliciously change a proc
personally i think the proc might be easier to catch because it might get reveiwed separately from the code by the dbas which might mean the manager or configuration management person and the dbas had a chance to look at it vice just the manager or configuration management person

1201337
memcpy	memmove
with memcpy the destination cannot overlap the source at all
with memmove it can

1201337
memcpy	memmove
this means that memmove might be very slightly slower than memcpy as it cannot make the same assumptions
for example memcpy might always copy addresses from low to high

1201711
hash	salt
just add a salt to the existing hash and hash it again
of course this will require any future logins to go through the same process meaning two hash functions will need to be called but lots of legitimate patterns do this anyway so it doesn t smell as bad as you might think

1201762
geocoding	geocode
google s geocoding api would seem to do want you want but unfortunately this use also appears to violate the api s terms of service
specifically the stipulation that you may not 10.12 use or display the content without a corresponding google map unless you are explicitly permitted to do so in the maps apis documentation the street view api documentation or through written permission from google for example you must not use geocode obtained through the service except in conjunction with a google map but the street view api documentation explicitly permits you to display street view imagery without a corresponding google map

1201925
int	chars
stroustrup lists incompatibilities with c90 c95 in appendix b.2 of the c++ programming language special edition which is 3rd edition with some added material a is an int in c a chars in c++
the sizeof an enum is int in c not necessarily in c++

1201925
int	chars
it won t allow an int to be assigned to an enum and objects cannot be assigned to other pointer types without a cast
in c it s possible to provide an overlarge initializer where c will discard the trailing null chars

1202238
nstimer	nsrunloop
so if you have a child or background process running in a different thread the nstimer will fire against that thread s nsrunloop instead of the application s main nsrunloop
you could ensure that timers are always created against the main runloop by sending it the addtimer formode message with your newly instantiated but not started nstimer

1202238
nstimer	nsrunloop
you could ensure that timers are always created against the main runloop by sending it the addtimer formode message with your newly instantiated but not started nstimer
accessing the main application s run loop is done with nsrunloop mainrunloop so regardless of which thread you re in doing nsrunloop mainrunloop addtimer nstimer timerwithtimeinterval 20.0 target self selector selector timerfired userinfo nil repeats no formode nsdefaultrunloopmode will always schedule the timer against the main runloop

1202486
profiling	debugging
then use the profiling to introspect the state of the threads
the use of java 1.4 is a minor issue here since 1.4 s debugging interface is not great but some profilers still support it

1202603
x86	64bit
also note that x86 dlls cannot be loaded on 64bit process
if x64 version of the dlls cannot be obtained the alternative is to run x86 dlls on a 32-bit wow64 process and do interprocess communication ipc back with the 64bit process

1203047
multiplying	multiplication	multiplying	division
the pic16f does not have a hardware multiplying or divide unit so unless you are multiplying or dividing by a power of 2 it is taxing to the processor
here is a routine that does a bcd on a 32 bit number and doesn t require division or multiplication

1203234
decimal	ieee
when you convert that back to decimal it only looks like it gained precision
it s not adding precision it s just rounding it to the nearest ieee floating point representation

1203332
agile	sprint
while waterfall gives managers the illusion of control agile seems to do the same for development teams
i ve seen teams where bringing up any issue that aren t in the current sprint iteraton is frowned upon with the expectation that it ll be handled in time

1203520
distance	polygons
you could pick the one with the shortest normal distance to the center of the bounding box for example
i am not saying that this is the fastest but it will give you a point inside the polygons

1204121
disk	ram
loosely speaking ram is 1000 or more times faster than disk and cpu is faster still
there are probably not a lot of logical optimizations that will help except avoiding movements of the disk heads seek whenever possible

1204725
boost	allocator
take a look on boost pool_alloc for a good sample of fast allocator
allocator arrays with variable length on the stack is a good idea because it fast and doesn t fragment the memory

1204984
inline	inlining
and some functions such as recursive ones simply cannot be inline
the major reason for not inlining a function is that it would greatly increase the overall size of the code preventing iot from being held in the processor s cache

1205194
client-side	server-side
session is an asp.net server object that is not accessible from the client through javascript directly session may be stored as a cookie on the client but then even then it is not designed to be accessed from the client-side directly
you could handle what you want to do in a number of ways - store a value in a hidden input when a link is clicked and then read that value server-side and store in session

1205284
class-method	delegation
i ve recently started using the following conventions for objective-c methods are in order of decreasing audience size with the exception of initializer init dealloc awakefromnib and convenience methods ie class-method that return an auto-released instance of the class
initialze init dealloc awakefromnib convenience methods properties ibactions general public methods delegation methods eg nsresponder nstableview etc binding and notification call back methods private methods i m still not 100 sure how to order ivar s in the header file

1205542
int	boolean
false instead of true. br bad reasons could include obfuscation making the code harder to read personal preferences badly considered global search-and-replace and shenanigans converting boolean values to integers. br br it s possible that some confusion has been caused by the true and false definitions in win32 which are not of bool type but int and which may trigger warnings when used in boolean statements
mainly anything non-zero is true but if you want to make sure that true is always one when using integers instead of boolean you sometimes see shenanigans like this

1205693
cout	cin
i guess you are having problem with not including std namespace . you can add using namespace std in it but using namespace std in header file is not good idea instead you can do using std cout
using std cin

1205953
versioning	upgrade
when it comes to upgrading old project to a new versioning then you need to consider your gains and losses
if its worthed upgrade it if not stick with the old versioning

1206249
put	get
in most situations git fetch should do what you want which is get anything new from the remote repository and put it in your local copy without merging to your local branches
git fetch --tags does exactly that except that it doesn t get anything except new tags

1206503
mstest	typemock
it might work if mstest runs will not run the tests in parallel in the same class. unfortunately it seems that mstest does not have a command line argument for overriding this behavior
disclaimer i work at typemock first note that we throw this exception because there s really no point in faking all instances of a type more than once and we want to let the user know that he probably made a mistake

1206767
versioning	upgrade
this gets more complicated of course if your application modified files within the directory containing the html script files as you need to be careful not to blitz needed changes made via the app when you apply the new versioning
for databases i keep the build scripts needed to create a new database and upgrade scripts needed to morph an existing database from one versioning to another in source control

1206808
folder	directory
open the package project for the library and configure the unit output directory to be the version-specific folder you ve chosen
the bpl files generated from the packages will not need to be put into separate directory because they will simply take the names of their corresponding dpk files and those files should already have version-specific names

1206992
mef	prism
mef looks like it s heading for the .net framework so i d say this was a really good way to expose a plugin surface area that requires a very small and relatively unchanging dependency just on mef.
not all of the other stuff that comes along with prism for your plugin authors

1208285
post	put
either do the json decoding from the full post content not the dictionary
or put the json data into a mime-multipart wrapper

1208773
single-quotes	double-quotes
i m not quite sure what the rationale for using single-quotes by default is
double-quotes would make a more sensible default i would have thought

1208819
puts	gets
if the object has a finalizer then it puts a reference to the object on the finalizer thread - note that just because an object is disposable doesn t necessarily mean the object itself has a finalizer but something somewhere within the object or subobjects will almost certainly have one
this means the object - or subobject - survives the gc run so gets promoted to generation 1

1209190
128bit	64bit
this is in contrast to the c# decimal data type which is more like a 128bit floating point number
mssql float does not have exactly the same precision as the 64bit double type in .net slight difference in mantissa iirc but it s a close enough match for most uses

1209736
mouse	keyboard
in my case i dislike isenabled false not because of the disabled style but because toggling isenabled makes it hard to get keyboard focus back. i m using the overlay solution above for blocking mouse action
and for the other half of the solution - -disabling keyboard input -- i m handing this in the main window window +----------------+ private void window_previewkeydown object sender | | keyeventargs e | transparent | if this.mydialog.visibility visibility.visible | | e.handled true

1210590
emacs	gedit
it might be be a good idea to learn emacs by using for plain text files notes todo lists so there is not the distraction of learning language specifics
if they are beginning to learn programming it is better to start with a simplae text editor like gedit or geany

1210696
post	get	put	get
have that form s template contain among the other fields put theid in the context with which you render that template and it will be in the request that the def post of the action receiving the form finally gets
something that has side effects such as altering the store by creating a new object for example should not be an http get -- get should essentially only do read operations

1210937
intersect	contains
intersect indicates that the bounding volumes partially overlap
if boundingsphere1 is smaller than boundingsphere2 then i suppose boundingsphere1.contains boundingsphere2 would return a containmenttype.intersects result instead of a containmenttype.contains result since it doesn t completely contains the other

1211073
getter	setter
a7 when you don t want to run the setter getter methods for whatever reason
i use it ocassionally when the setter doesn t allow nil values and i need to release the variable a8 dealloc is called automatically when release is called the correct amount of times

1211401
coalesce	isnull
it s not ansi sql though with a more flexible command existing there coalesce
it s just like isnull but takes any number of parameters

1212917
actionscript	mxml
that s why you ll see that all of the examples use actionscript instead of mxml
yes that means that you can t use flexbuilder to code the renderer and yes some of these examples could be done in mxml but it is easy in mxml to do things that generate extra code that you may not need

1213285
disk	ram
this is why heap access can be very expensive because if the page is not in memory a page fault happens and os has to load a page from the disk and that can be by magnitude slower
stack frame of the thread being executed is in processor cache which is much faster as ram

1213479
firefox	safari
finally avoid floats and columns when styling for printers it can make ie and firefox act wacky
safari 1.3 and later don t know about 4 do not support page-break-inside try it or see here

1213515
post	get
there is one primary difference get must be idempotent while post does not have to be
what this means is that gets cause no side effects i.e i can send a get to a web application as many times as i want to think hitting ctrl+r or f5 many times and the requests will be safe i cannot do that with post a post may change data on the server

post	get
what this means is that gets cause no side effects i.e i can send a get to a web application as many times as i want to think hitting ctrl+r or f5 many times and the requests will be safe i cannot do that with post a post may change data on the server
for example if i order an item on the web the item should be added with a post because state is changed on the server the number of items i ve added has increased by 1

1213515
post	get
if i did this with a post and hit refresh in the browser the browser warns me if i do it with a get the browser will simply send the request
on the server get vs post is pure convention it s up to me as a developer to ensure that i code the post on the server to not repeat the call

1214036
unsigned	short
note that wchar_t is defined as unsigned short - so it s just missing the define there - not an actual bug of conversion as said above
i don t have a vc 6 to test it but under vc9 it s something like this #ifndef _wchar_t_defined typedef unsigned short wchar_t

1214224
innodb	myisam
innodb tables do support transactions so i ll recreate the tables and then see whether the transactions work then
apparently mysql doesn t support transactions with myisam tables which is the default type of tables

1214267
jsf	seam
if for some reason you cannot use seam maybe you can borrow some ideas from how seam handles authorization and authentication in jsf
i use jsf seam and have used seam s built-in authentication and authorization and find it extremely easy to use

1214388
vsto	add-in
however office interop in f# is the same as c# - you can use the native com apis or the newer managed visual studio tools for office vsto libraries
unfortunately f# doesn t have the ui-designers for creating vsto add-in like c# so the simplest way to do office interop is to use the com apis

1215092
typedef	typename
typedef are always types
the question isn t really about typedef but typename

1215092
typedef	typename
in your typedef example you still have the typename in the typedef declaration but once the typedef is declared that is not a dependent name
it s just a type so the typename isn t necessary when referring to the typedef

1215141
range	max
the valid range is xxx 0-600 seconds
default 30 c msg an optional shutdown message max 127 chars f force running applications to close. this will not prompt for file-save in any open applications. so will result in a loss of all unsaved data

1215164
pascal	delphi
martin waldenburg wrote a pascal version of lex yacc named paslex which has been kicking around for way over a decade now and has been converted to delphi although it might not work with the latest versions without some minor work
if i remember correctly it uses the same .l grammar input files as lex so any documentation you find for lex yacc can also be applied to paslex with the exception that you get pascal code as the output

1215747
cpu	processors
make menuconfig and look at processors type and features - timer frequency this way your cpu will get interrupted every 10ms
furthermore consider that the default cpu time slice on linux is 100ms so with a nice level of -20 you will not get descheduled if your are running for a few milliseconds

1217016
testdriven.net	xunit.net
i m not sure how testdriven.net supports xunit.net but with nunit you can run a single test a class its tests or all test with a click of the mouse or keyboard shortcut
testdriven.net is a vs2005 2008 plugin which also allows super fast testing especially when using tdd

1217049
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc

the first parameter to realloc must be a pointer that was previously returned by malloc calloc or realloc and not subsequently free d

1217117
listview	gridview
also depending on your needs there is a new lightweight listview component in 3.0
it does not support all of the gridview s features but if you primarily need a display-only grid it might be a great alternative

1217233
post	get
make it inexpensive but not free of course and easy for legitimate advertisers to post responsible marketing material for your users to see

1218948
int	double
the rules for type coercion are detailed in the jsp 2.1 spec for example if coercing an int to a string box the int into an int and apply the rule for coercing an int to a string
or if coercing a string to a double apply the rule for coercing a string to a double then unbox the resulting double making sure the resulting double isn t actually null

1219364
csla	.net
first csla is not an orm
because rockford lhotka has stated it himself many times in interviews on the .net rocks and hanselminutes podcasts

1219494
explode	implode
- then on the php script that receives the data from the form when it s been submitted you d use explode to extract the data as an array from the string which will get you and now you can use thoses ids.
first you probably want to use implode and not explode to construct your variable

1219872
post	put
here s great post with javascript microtemplating by john resig - note that this is not the only way of achieving this only johns version of it
i ve seen it used for microtemplating where you can put a template in a script tag and then reference it through the id

1220337
int	chars
wilson is slightly off though you really should cast it to a chars instead of an int as with an int you will see 4 bytes not a single byte as you would with a chars
additionally unless you can read 8bit ascii chars and map them to something meaningful in your head you would probably want to convert it to some other form such as base2 base8 or base16

1221047
inherited	properties
a visual c++ interface can be defined as follows - can inherited from zero or more base interfaces. - cannot inherited from a base class. - can only contain public pure virtual methods. - cannot contain constructors destructors or operators. - cannot contain static methods. - cannot contain data members
properties are allowed. this feature is microsoft specific

1221524
implements	extends
any class extends the abstract class will have to implements only its abstract methods and members and will have some default implementation of the other methods of the abstract class which you may override or not
--edit - forgot to mention earwicker reminded me finally you can implements as many interfaces as you want but only extends one class being it abstract or not

1221913
g++	gcc
always build c++ code with g++
when you compile with gcc the c++ libraries are not linked in by default

1221933
hash	salt	hash	md5
someone has posted this for example so when the user log in not the most secure hash
_session checksum md5 _session username . salt

1221933
salt	md5
lets go through what is wrong with this salt - not wrong but pointless
no one is cracking your damn md5 who cares if it is salted comparing the md5 of a session variable with the md5 of the same variable stored in the session - you re comparing session to session

1222199
wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe
wsdl.exe is part of the asmx web service technology that microsoft now considers to be legacy code which will not have bugs fixed
actually you should do this with svcutil.exe not with wsdl.exe

1222298
put	get
put this at the top of the other files where you want to access the class using click10.app_code
or access the class from other files like this click10.app_code.glob not sure if that s your issue or not but if you were new to c# then this is an easy one to get tripped up on

1222655
system.data.oracleclient	odp.net
may be there is a bug feature in microsoft s library system.data.oracleclient that this adapter do not automatically support converting we8iso8859p1 to unicode
here is a link to odp.net i hope that there will be a support for this encoding in odp but to say true i never checked this it is only a suggestion 2 workaround in dataset you should create a binary field mapped to the original table field and a string field not mapped to the database

1223031
lxml	beautifulsoup
it s much much faster than beautifulsoup and it even handles broken html better than beautifulsoup their claim to fame - lxml just isn t as vocal about it
it has a compatibility api for beautifulsoup too if you don t want to learn the lxml api

being able to do more than what i would put in the model.

put	get
i would put each stream in a using block in order to explicity dispose of them all
from looking at the streamwriter.dispose method in reflector it looks like the underlying streams get closed but not disposed

1224125
hash	md5
languages and libraries which allow you to take the md5 hash of text data usually mean encode the string in a specified encoding then hash the result.
this page provides these examples of 128 byte values hashing to the same value d131dd02c5e6eec4693d9a0698aff95c 2fcab58712467eab4004583eb8fb7f89 55ad340609f4b30283e488832571415a 085125e8f7cdc99fd91dbdf280373c5b d8823e3156348f5bae6dacd436c919c6 dd53e2b487da03fd02396306d248cda0 e99f33420f577ee8ce54b67080a80d1e c69821bcb6a8839396f9652b6ff72a70 and d131dd02c5e6eec4693d9a0698aff95c 2fcab50712467eab4004583eb8fb7f89 55ad340609f4b30283e4888325f1415a 085125e8f7cdc99fd91dbd7280373c5b d8823e3156348f5bae6dacd436c919c6 dd53e23487da03fd02396306d248cda0 e99f33420f577ee8ce54b67080280d1e c69821bcb6a8839396f965ab6ff72a70 note that although your question asked for strings which collide md5 is defined over binary data so the normal text meaning of string doesn t really apply

1224507
setinterval	settimeout
everyone has a settimeout setinterval solution already
i think that it is important to note that you can pass functions to setinterval not just strings

1224707
range	minimum
strtotime s documentation also gives the valid range for dates note the valid range of a timestamp is typically from fri 13 dec 1901 20 45 54 utc to tue 19 jan 2038 03 14 07 utc
these are the dates that correspond to the minimum and maximum values for a 32-bit signed integer. additionally not all platforms support negative timestamps therefore your date range may be limited to no earlier than the unix epoch

1225397
move	drag
the current implementation doesn t use mouse move events and do not calculate the geometry
instead it relies on mouse over out events detected by targets after a drag was started

1225856
folder	directory
jason so your not supposed to put the whole gdata folder in war web-inf like i did... problem solved
it should be in the war web-inf lib directory for it to be included in the packaged war file

1226211
merb	ruby-on-rails
authlogic can be used in any ruby framework you want ruby-on-rails merb sinatra mack your own framework whatever
it s not tied down to ruby-on-rails

1226298
inherited	properties
unlike the world of winforms this does not require you to inherited a new control and override rendering logic
instead you set some properties on the control resorting to overriding the template itself if you can t get the look you want from other properties

1226423
serializable	deserialization
the great thing about this is if you add a member value that doesn t need to be searched or indexed only stored you don t need to put it in a database column so you make no changes to the database at all it will be stored in the serializable blob
the only thing to do is add a default value for this member in your deserialization code so the objects from this class which are already in the database and do not have this member will have a decent default value for it

1226806
put	get
as the javadoc points out and the names of the parameters indicate the method with offset and numbytes uses only part of the buffer to put its output in
you can use this method if you want to reuse an existing buffer that already has data in it that you do not want to clobber of course the numbytes starting from offset will get overwritten

1227406
sprint	branding
it also helps branding the methodology different from other iid methodologies as to the sprint length anything goes as long as the sprint is timeboxed it is finished on the planned date and not when it s ready
or alternatively in rare occasions the sprint is terminated prematurely to start a new sprint in case some essential boundary conditions are changed. it does help to have the sprints of similar durations

1228038
put	get
if you ve never used xaml and you ve got a sort timeline to get this thing done you best be prepared to put in some extra time or be okay with a less than stellar look and feel

1228373
post	get
update there appears to be an additional problem with the asp.net 2.0 xmldatasource not being able to handle default xml namespaces - that s this line here in your xml see this blog post here on the topic there s really two things you could do to fix this use an xslt transformation to strip out the default namespace so that the xmldatasource can handle the data load the data from the url in code and bind it to the gridview in your code-behind update 2 the method of stripping out the xml namespaces seems to work quite nicely - bill evjen proposes this method here
if you save his xslt file in the post to a file called stripnamespaces.xslt in the web site project you should get your data if you change the asp xmldatasource to be note the new transformfile setting - this must reference that xslt file

1228486
getter	setter
no it is not common to use getter setter style names in c#
properties should be used for almost all places you would use a getter setter in java

1228619
haskell	ocaml
haskell is a wonderful language it has #1 and #2 and although it doesn t have #3 it s type system is so flexible that you will probably not find the lack of meta to be limiting
i believe you can do metaprogramming in ocaml at compile time with a language extension

1228659
cpython	ironpython
so unless ironpython which is written in .net can correctly load c dlls written for cpython you might be out of luck
a ironpython does not support using pyds built for cpython since they leverage implementation details of cpython

1228733
pascal	delphi
first off this is c++ not pascal
the delphi version is self

1228761
oledb	openrowset
the use of openrowset has been suggested but this is not what the openrowset function was intended to be used for from books online includes all connection information that is required to access remote data from an oledb data source
this method is an alternative to accessing tables in a linked server and is a one-time ad hoc method of connecting and accessing remote data by using oledb

1229195

i don t have a doctrine-enabled project right here so can t test for you as a sidenote i don t have a postgresql server to test on

photoshop	fireworks
however photoshop can be quite daunting if you are just starting out
fireworks is specifically web orientated and has preset styles that you can use but it doesn t have the fan-base or tutorials available that photoshop does

1230829
metaclass	subclassing
property works because qobject has a metaclass that takes care of them
in the class that s really a legacy old-type class the one made the second time metaclass is classobj which isn t a subclassing of type and properties don t work right assigning x.x bypasses the property and after that getting x.x doesn t see the property any more either

1230829
metaclass	subclassing
in the class that s really a legacy old-type class the one made the second time metaclass is classobj which isn t a subclassing of type and properties don t work right assigning x.x bypasses the property and after that getting x.x doesn t see the property any more either
but in the first case the qt case there s a different metaclass and it is a subclassing of type so it s not really correct to say the class isn t new-style

1230853
children	parent
that is a process stores pointers to it s parent but parent appear to not store information about children
so you have to look at all the processes in the system which really isn t that hard and then manually connect the dots yourself by looking at the parent process field

1230890
tostring	string.format
bind items to dropdown ... i prefer this rather than overriding tostring as tostring is generic and used everywhere and can therefore be a pain in the arse whereas this is a local modification that doesn t affect anything else
jamie s suggestion is good but instead of overriding tostring i would just project your ilist order into ienumerable listitem before binding ie var items from o in datalist datalist being ilist returned from repository select new listitem o.name string.format 0 | 1 o.key.id o.key.customerid

1231244
udp	tcp
if you are working with tcp ip sockets you already have that scheme with udp sockets listening on a local port to which multiple sources can send data
you cannot have such a tcp socket however the select api is available on all standard implementations to let you open multiple tcp listening sockets one per source and then do a select on the whole lot

1231775
maven	pom.xml	inherited	properties
the standard set are inherited from the maven super pom.xml and can be overridden by redefining the relevant properties
for example to change the sources directory from src main java to src the test directory to test-src and the resources directory from src main resources to resources you would set the following in your pom.xml be aware that a few plugins might not use the standard properties to access the locations hardcoding target classes instead of using project.build.outputdirectory so you might have the odd problem

1232409
boost	allocator
and you should do the same -- either by using ready-made raii classes like vector shared_ptr or almost any other class in the standard library or in boost or by writing your own
as a general rule of thumb your code should not contain any new delete calls except in the constructor destructor for the class responsible for managing that allocator

1232617
vb.net	vb6
in vb.net you have to use andalso instead of and if you want it to skip evaluating the second expression
it s not true for vb6

1233454
int	chars
an int type means that its a number and in many languages defaults to zero
a string type by contrast is a set of chars that may resemble an int but doesn t have to

1233974
versioning	upgrade
be aware that ids 9.21 is long out of support - indeed both 9.30 and 9.40 the successor versioning of ids are also out of support
you are years overdue for an upgrade even though it appears that you cannot actually do the upgrade for political reasons

1234058
datamapper	activerecord
another approach could be to use an alternative orm like datamapper which does not have the same limitations
activerecord likes to have integer id columns and throws a fit if this is not the case

1234076
put	get
the mechanism to avoid this problem is to synchronize access to the data structures so you put an order and ensure a single thread completes its use of the data structure before some other thread access it
these synchronization mechanisms to be able to work have to make sure that they themselves cannot be scheduled out of the cpu while they are operating because if that happens then a thread might get to update the structure when it s not supposed to

1234119
switching	screens
starting a screens saver with the p command line switching creates the screens saver window as a child of the given window with the same size and position - it is meant only to provide a screens saver preview in the display properties dialog box
it will not position the screens saver window somewhere in the z-order beneath some other window

1234628
groovy	gsp
this particular file isn t that helpful but it references a class in the groovy project if you wanted to deeply understand how grails is using sitemesh this probably isn t necessary
the tag includes the layout in the gsp page

1235266
ant	maven
an additional path for those not so keen on maven unable to port or perfectly happy with ant ivy i ve found the that easiest way to accomplish the stated task is to turn the non-osgi library into an osgi library by letting the manifest export every package and add on some approriate symbolic names versions
i ve been able to do this very easily with bnd via ant tasks or even direct command line invocation

1235396
iequalitycomparer	iequatable
so if you implement iequatable correctly you do not have to pass a custom iequalitycomparer
it sounds like your person class should implement iequatable person

1235549
jar	.war
the protobuffers.jar file was not being included in my projects .war file even though i had added the jar to my project myeclipse was not including it
upon following the path to the jboss server and looking inside the .war i found out the jar was not there

you can try to get a post to cache by using .ajax and setting cache to true and type to post

1235663

1235667
migrate	staging
the built in conversion tool will not migrate transaction settings migrate activex scripts associated with steps analysis services task complex data transformation tasks custom tasks data driven query tasks data mining prediction query task dynamic properties tasks execute packages tasks parallel data pump tasks tasks that obtain their connection information from microsoft data link .udl files activex script code that accesses the dts object model through the parent property of the globalvariables collection there is a tool called dtsxchange available from pragmatic works which does most of these conversions but still it does not re-engineer the package
typically a dts package would use staging tables and most of the transformation data manipulation would happen using sql or stored procedures

1235869
put	get
this must be refresh fast on commit put a constraint on the materialized join view that the count of child records must equal n your database constant you can then do a series of insert update delete statements
when you commit the materialized view will refresh and if the condition is not met you will get a constraint violation error at that point

1235877
for-loop	loops
a bug hunter will probably be expecting you to do this with a for-loop so they ll have an easier time finding it if you use a for-loop
despite your desire not to use loops i think you should use a loops

1236367
for-loop	loops
i wouldn t ever guessed that the recursive function was faster than the for-loop -o have fun ctional xd
here you have it of course i know this is ugly and inefficient but it doesn t have loops -p you want it simpler and prettier

1236537
filtering	grouping
you need to determine what kinds of activity your application is going to want to show and try to filtering it accordingly so that you aren t making huge queries all the time but only using a tiny fraction of the returned results
pulling data out and grouping it php side is fine but if you can avoid selecting it in the first place you re better off

1236552
nsurlconnection	nsoperation
take a look at dave dribin s blog post on concurrency with nsoperation that shows how to encapsulate an nsurlconnection session if you are not talking about accessing a web service or site where nsurlconnection is appropriate you can instead use cocoa async socket if it s straight tcp ip or udp best regards
you can simply spin off an nsoperation and post a notification when the data has come back finished loading

1236559
floating-point	integer
1.25 because at least one of 5.0 and 4.0 is a floating-point number so the result will also be floating point
you re not actually doing floating point math there you re doing integer math which will floor the results of divisions

1236559
integer	fractions
you re not actually doing floating point math there you re doing integer math which will floor the results of divisions
in c++ 5 4 1 not 1.25 - because 5 and 4 are both integers so the result will be an integer and thus the fractions part of the result is thrown away

1236586
vim	emacs
typically if i want to switch between vim and my shell bash i just hit ctrl + z to pause the vim process play around in my shell then type fg when i want to go back to vim - keeping my editor and my shell nice and separate
i m not sure exactly what you re trying to achieve i ve never used emacs but you can run commands in vim by typing and if you want to type in several commands or play around in a shell for a while you can always use once the command or shell terminates you ll be given the option to press enter to return to your editor window vim is intentionally lightweight and lacking in the ability to do non-editorish type things just as running a full-blown shell inside a vim pane tab but as mentioned above there are third-party addons such as vim-shell that allow you to do that sort of thing

1236880
serializable	deserialization
by requiring you to mark the class with serializable you indicate that you have taken these considerations into account
automatic serialization deserialization might not suffice for the object

1237553
mvp	presenter
in the past years i have been using my own implementation of mvp with a very passive view that enslaves itself to whatever the presenter tells him to do
my solution consisted of the following an interface per widget defining the methods to control the visual appearance an implementing class that can be a composite or use an external widget library a central presenter for a screen that hosts n views that are made up of m widgets a central model per screen that holds the data associated with the current visual appearance generic listener classes like sourcesaddevents customerdto the editor does not like the real symbols for java generics here so i used thoe brackets because otherwise you will have lots of the same interfaces who just differ by the type the views get a reference to the presenter as their constructor parameter so they can initialize their events with the presenter

1238502
spweb	spsite
it seems that you cannot really have a spweb without having a spsite
so if you got the spweb without going through spsite to get it either by doing a new spsite or one being provided to you then you probably do not need to worry about disposing the spsite

1238779
spweb	spsite
so you can safely use it and i would avoid disposing of it lest spweb dependencies go all wonky on you
reflector tells us that this is the code that runs inside the spweb object when you call the site property it s not creating a new spsite object just returning the one it already had which would be up to the spweb.dispose to take care of if necessary

1238799
children	parent
so if the parent has a counter or other property then the children will see the value at the time of they were forked but not if the parent subsequently alters it
children get a copy of the parent s state at the time of the fork

1239202
spweb	spsite
you must have some handle to an spsite before an spweb can be created and that is the same spsite instance you will have when you call spweb.site
let s think through the implications of that - if you do not control the creation of the spsite but one of its child webs is handed to you from external code and you dispose the site when control is returned to the calling code you ve disposed a site they may not be done with

1239640
post	get
or post.minimum date_published .year..post.maximum date_published .year i like the second one a lot even though it doesn t account for the possibility that a year may have no post
i d use one of these a find_by_sql to get the distinct years using whatever year-revealing functionality is available in your database

1240094
instances	transient
the reason that initwithnibname is not seeming to be called is that interface builder actually creates a real instances of your view controller and then serializes that view
so when you create the view controller in ib add it to your project basically ib calls initwithnibname but unless you have overridden the default encodewithcoder any transient variables that you ve set up there will be gone when the view is loaded from the nib deserialized

1240227
dmz	was
the evil viruses of the internet are not able to exploit any software on a computer behind a router provided that the router admin didn t configure it in the funny way for example by enabling dmz
you still have some options talk to the router admin and make him forward a port for you take the router out and put your target computer where your router was or enable dmz this only makes sense if there was only one computer behind the router

1240259
hash	salt
i wouldn t hash a password on the client side which is what gwt is
if you hash your password you will undoubtedly want to salt it otherwise you will be susceptible to rainbow attacks

1240601
hash	md5
so just use the full length hash
and since md5 is broken and sha-1 is starting to show cracks you shouldn t use either in new applications

1240713
actionscript	mxml
it is hard to reverse engineer the original mxml from the decompiled actionscript that has been generated from that very mxml source
the generated actionscript is not really a pleasure to work with

1240869
hash	salt
and the fact that most passwords are short and people often use common values like password or secret means that in some cases you can make a reasonably good guess at someone s password by googling for the hash or using a rainbow table
that is one reason why you should always salt hashed passwords so that two identical values when hashed will not hash to the same value

1240882
hash	md5
you cannot un-hash an md5 hash
md5 is considered broken not because you can get back the original content from the hash but because with work you can craft two messages that hash to the same hash

openrowset	openquery
here is a list of some techniques plus the pros and cons linked servers provide access to a wider variety of data sources than sql server replication provides linked servers connect with data sources that replication does not support or which require ad hoc access linked servers perform better than opendatasource or openrowset opendatasource and openrowset functions convenient for retrieving data from data sources on an ad hoc basis
openrowset has bulk facilities as well that may may not require a format file which might be fiddley openquery doesn t support variables all are t-sql solutions

awt	swing
err to answer your question no you don t appear to be able to do that with awt swing has the advantage that it is truly write-once-run-anywhere and it can look exactly the same everywhere
there are look feels that try to make swing look native some are better than others mac isn t terrible windows is okay gtk isn t

post	get
i d recommend making an online portfolio if not to display past projects at least to post your resume and basically a cover letter
you can get a lot of free css templates if you re not comfortable with designing your own

1242458
versioning	upgrade
i have the same issue but i have an ipod touch versioning 2.2.1
it used to connect to xcode 3.1.2 then i upgrade to 3.1.3 and it doesn t work

1243476
children	parent
the uniqueness constraint and the check for the child_nr field take care that a parent has at most 5 children
the other check constraint and the foreign key constraint on the pair parent_id next_sibling_nr ensure that there are not less than 5 children

1244102
post	get
also a practical point to keep in mind when setting the requirements to a webserver receiving a post an empty field is the same as a non-existent field
that means that if updatemodel were designed such that it did not reset non-existent form fields such as date the same behavior would mean that if the user removes the text in your date field and posts it would not get updated with empty or null

1244316
public	protected
if the shared code can use just the public interface of the class so it doesn t access private member variables protected functions etc. you should consider whether other classes might want to use the same code
if no other class can make use of the function put the shared code into a global free function within an anonymous namespace in the .cpp file like this if the shared code cannot be implemented using just the public interface maybe the code uses private member variables or something make it a private member function of the class

1244346
int	chars
this time there is no conversion from uclist to unsigned int and so that is not a viable function
an unsigned chars can be promoted to size_t and so this time overload resolution succeeds and will use operator uclist const

1244413
printf	fgets
the results will be undefined and very probably not what you want. so the best solution would be not to to use write and printf on the same descriptor
the manpage for fgets tells me it is not advisable to mix calls to input functions from the stdio library with low-level calls to read 2 for the file descriptor associ ated with the input stream

1245368
lxml	beautifulsoup
ian bicking agrees and prefers lxml over beautifulsoup
there s no reason to use beautifulsoup anymore unless you re on google app engine or something where anything not purely python isn t allowed

1245446
prng	random
the reason you get different results despite the fact that you are clearing the pool and resetting it is that by default openssl s rand implementation will hash the pid into the output block precisely to ensure that even applications that use the same seed do not get the same prng output since 99.9 of the time that happening is a bad thing
in addition even if this was not the case it is unlikely that your reference application uses the same prng that openssl uses to turn the seed file into a series of random bytes

1245687
toolbar	tabs
for the api functions properties etc... of any system object including powerobject or windowobject open the object browser icon on the powerbar toolbar or under the tools menu item in later versions of pb go to the system tab not essential but for bonus points right click on the left pane and select show hierarchy from the menu select the object in question on the left pane double click the properties events or functions headers in the right pane to expand the list
and go through the list recursing through the control arrays note that userobjects tabs and tabpages have control arrays as well as windows

1246177
realloc	malloc
if you re passing a pointer to a function and you want the pointer value to be overwritten then you need to pass a pointer to that pointer if you want to resize a dynamically allocated buffer use realloc note that is the same as
you should not cast the result of malloc unless you re using an implementation of c that predates the 1989 ansi standard or you intend to compile this code as c++ in which case you should be using new instead of malloc

1246563
lisp	scheme
common lisp deftype doesn t have an exact scheme equivalent
you will have to translate type definitions by hand or write a deftype macro in terms of whatever scheme record library is available in your system

1248494
pop-up	dialog
if you want to have a form in a pop-up use an approach like following html code this code part should be inside the part of your html document
you cannot open a dialog in the same page unless you use javascript jquery or another framework to display this form

1248913
jsf	tapestry	jsf	wicket	struts	wicket
an example of it is not jsf because in some way jsf is pretty much quite the same with struts since the creator of struts and jsf is the same
a good example of component based framework tapestry and wicket

1249002
inline	inlining
if the property getter is inline should it have been the property s declaring type that was the creator
assuming that inlining of the method that needs to check its caller and permissions aren t a problem you can call the following method in a constructor so for your real question the answer is yes it is possible but not recommended

1249219
mockups	balsamiq
i d rather have a dirty mockups than none at all though
note the free version of balsamiq doesn t let you save images but you can achieve the same with the export import functionality

1249284
perl	tcl
if you re experienced at developing in perl tk the transition isn t too painful but i think it would be a difficult place to start
the worst part is that you need to refer to the tcl tk documentation in order to use it

1249521
postgresql	mysql
not sure if it still applies without changes to postgresql
in mysql it would look something like select title from questions order by was_sent_at_time desc limit 3

1249769
public	protected
the trick is to implement an interface but not having all interface members as public members in the class
the protected member foobase.bar is not an implementation method of the interface ibar

1249769
public	protected
defining a public method bar is implicit implementation
to have the compiler satisfied you might override or new the baseclass method as public not a good advise if method is protected in baseclass

1250008
lisp	scheme
while common lisp supports a functional programming style that is not its general focus scheme while not purely functional is much closer
common lisp supports a completely imperative style of programming very well

1250784
accessor	properties
i am not sure whether or not the gnustep implementation of objective-c will follow apple s lead in accessor mutator synthesis but if you are trying to make an app for mac windows and linux gnustep is probably not the best choice
it should be pretty easy to port the code from cocoa to gnustep and you might be able to even write a macro to convert your properties declarations but very few people use gnustep on linux and even fewer on windows

1250805
uiview	subviews
at this point the view property of the top level uiview will be nulled out it will be released and deallocated
because the uitextfield was set as a property that was retained the uitextfield is not deallocated as it would have been had its only retain been that of the subviews array of the top level view

1250827
int	chars
a signed chars above 127 would be treated as if it were a negative number if you did not cast it to unsigned chars since the argument is an int
the toupper function expects the argument to be repressentable as an unsigned chars or the value eof

1251051
int	chars
in java you are casting an int into a java string
you ll note i m not talking about an array of chars or a user defined string

1251535
installation	upgrade
first it sounds to me like someone on your team doesn t have all the updates applied to their visual studio installation
go around and get everyone upgrade to the latest service pack for your vs version

1251703
button	checkbox
keyboard stroke- alt + f4 close keyboard stroke- f5 refresh keyboard stroke- ctrl + f5 refresh keyboard stroke- shift + f5 refresh change of url or anything that cause postback other than your particular submit button
to explain that i have used two textboxes one asp.net submit button with id testbutton. other postback controls that i have taken are one other asp.net button one checkbox with autopostback property true one dropdownlist with autopostback property true. now i have used all these postback controls so that to show you that we also need to show promt to user about the data lose when user perform actions on these controls. on submit button we will not show the prompt as we have to submit the data with that control action.here is the sample code.i have set window.onbeforeunload method on controls change

1252077
jsf	wicket
it s not correct to say the seam is the next step of jsf. seam doesn t have to use jsf as the view layer
it can also use wicket or gwt

1252077
jsf	seam
it s biggest disadvantages are those related to jsf too much reliance on http post which s button link doesn t always solve lots of javascript excessive calls to getter setter nasty looking html
etc there are more than enough pages detailing the shortcomings of jsf elsewhere note that these aren t criticisms of seam - rather of jsf1.x and many are resolved in jsf2.0 i don t believe that seam is the next step for jsf but it and facelets are crucial if you re planning to use jsf1.x right now

1252126
jsf	seam
also icefaces is great with jsf and facelets it works perfectly well with or without an application framework like seam or spring
i like jsf and i evaluated seam not long ago

1252126
jsf	seam
i like jsf and i evaluated seam not long ago
jsf is a web ui framework whereas seam is a more general web application framework that integrates not just jsf but conversational contexts workflow jbpm and object persistance preferably ejb3

1252126
jsf	seam
jsf is a web ui framework whereas seam is a more general web application framework that integrates not just jsf but conversational contexts workflow jbpm and object persistance preferably ejb3
i was first attracted to seam by the advertised auto-generated scaffolding but i never did get it to work with my enterprise data model

1252514
width	height
i think the correct way to do this is to use the scrollable interface two lines of your code then have to change to and the components should always fill the entire width of the jscrollpane whatever the size of the frame
this change has a side effect that the components will now not fill the height of the jscrollpane

1252585
put	get
i wouldn t put an else after a conditional exit or return
but other people would do as you have and the argument can probably get tribal

1252641
webkit	gecko
if you re not absolutely committed to webkit i recall something about a project to allow you do something similar with the firefox engine
basically a minimalist window around the gecko renderer plus gears and desktop shortcut for your app

1252756
udp	tcp	icmp	tcp
if you are determined to use udp you will have to implement path mtu discovery in your protocol and prey that the routers firewalls don t block the fragmentation needed icmp packets
which they shouldn t otherwise tcp wouldn t work either

1253277
public	protected
you can think of these methods not as being public on the class but being tied directly to the interface
there is no reason to specify public private protected since it will always be public as interfaces cannot have non-public members

1253795
super	extends
super bit in the latter example is only useful if you plan on connecting a b with an a that isn t for exactly the same type of b
thinking in concrete terms suppose you had an and a circle which extends shape which extends b

1254100
strcpy	strncpy
the programmer must be sure they are fulfilled or he must explicitely test them with additional boilerplate code before calling strcpy already silently assuming the non-overlap and zero-terminated strings
strncpy does include some of these checks but it adds another postcondition the programmer must take care for after calling the function because the result may not be zero-terminated

1254110
versioning	upgrade
the important thing is to make sure the ie6 versioning still works and doesn t crash or render hideously
ie6 users will see that and think oh that website doesn t work i won t visit there again. this should spur people to ask their it department to upgrade

1254401
ubuntu	centos
i ve just been through this game on ubuntu and the trick was simply to install the right packages including dev packages etc
i m not familiar with centos but somebody will probably chime in with the right packages for that

1254490
post	get
check out phil haack s excellent blog post on how to model bind a list of elements
whether you ll be able to use this directly or not i m not sure but you could always get the ids in a separate parameter and then retrieve the groups by id to add to your user object

1254870
jsf	seam	jsf	wicket
if you re going to be using ejb and jsf already seam is killer
if you re going to be using jsf plus any of its related tools like icefaces or richfaces seam pojos can simplify your setup a lot as well as give you access to the life-cycle states that seam provides conversation etc. if you re using ejb with wicket or gwt seam might be able to save you some configuration as well though i ve not personally used it in this configuration

1254870
jsf	seam	wicket	seam
if you re going to be using jsf plus any of its related tools like icefaces or richfaces seam pojos can simplify your setup a lot as well as give you access to the life-cycle states that seam provides conversation etc. if you re using ejb with wicket or gwt seam might be able to save you some configuration as well though i ve not personally used it in this configuration
as has been said seam s disadvantages are inherent in any abstraction framework it s hiding the details from you

1254951
submit	submission
if a control on your page submit the page to the server code the page is unloaded and the javascript is executed
if you don t want the javascript to be executed when a control on your page is submission it to the server you have to implement something that checks to see whether or not your code should be executed

1255091
dictionary	map
you have to protect the map dictionary inside a lock so that only one thread at a time can access it
the dictionary is not thread safe so if you let one thread read from it while another thread is changing it you will have problems

1255091
dictionary	map
the dictionary is not thread safe so if you let one thread read from it while another thread is changing it you will have problems
remember that using lock on the map object doesn t protect the map object in itself it s only using the map reference as an identifier to keep more than one thread at a time to run the code inside the lock

1255876
inherited	properties
the solution i ended up using was to make a new class modulepage that inherited page
in the oninit it would check an abstract properties i added ixmodule to see if that that module was turned on or off if it was on the page will display and if it is not the user is redirected to another page

1255933
serializable	deserialization
however there is one gotcha only use .net serializable for the very highest level datastructure to get serializable deserialization started and then call the serializable deserialization functions directly for the fields in the highest level datastructure
otherwise there will not be any speed-up... for instance if a particular data structure say generic.list is not supported by the library then .net serializable will used instead and this is a no-no

1255944
stdout	fflush
when you print something which isn t n -terminated you have to fflush stdout if you want to print it immediatly printf type something
fflush stdout

1255954
hash	salt
hash the password the unique salt on the client via javascript before submission
send this hash to authenticate but not the password

1256522
put	get
everything that you put on the classpath for felixhost also all compile time dependencies in your case is essentially living outside of the osgi world so it s not advisable to use bundles like osgi.service.obr-1.0.2.jar in this way
as you pointed out if the osgi framework also loads the osgi.service.obr-1.0.2.jar bundle you will get into classcastexception because you have essentially two versions of the same classes interfaces

1256581
inherited	properties
by default other members methods fields properties and events inherited the cls-compliance of their type
now as far as the compiler is concerned cls rule 1 it must be able to apply the rules for cls-compliance to any information that will be exported outside the assembly and considers a type to be cls-compliant if all its publicly accessible parts those classes interfaces methods fields properties and events that are available to code executing in another assembly either have signatures composed only of cls-compliant types or are specifically marked as not cls-compliant

1257224
uilabel	uitextview
uitextview supports data-detectors in os3.0 whereas uilabel doesn t
if you enable the data-detectors on the uitextview and your text contains urls phone numbers etc

1257709
webclient	httpwebrequest
if that is the issue you ll probably need to refactor to use the httpwebrequest and httpwebresponse classes instead on webclient and configure a more reasonable timeout
webclient does not support user-specified timeouts and iirc has a default timeout of 100 000 msecs 100 seconds

1257887
put	get
or put differently pint is an int - dereferenced pint is an int
pint must then be a pointer to int otherwise we would not get an int when it is dereferenced

1257887
int	chars
pint must then be a pointer to int otherwise we would not get an int when it is dereferenced
this means it is not necessary to learn more complicated declarations by heart pchar is of type const chars

1258295
put	get
you can get all kinds of information about an exe windows file if you download it the easy way by running external utilities on it or up to a point the hard way via apis and your own code simulating those utilities -- a lot depends on what info was put into it when it was built
without downloading you can get only the info the server is giving you which in this case seems pretty scarce -- i can t believe that server s configured to not tell you latest modified date c

1258558
strcpy	strncpy
otherwise it could happen that the source string is not correctly 0 terminated in which case the strcpy function could write more characters to destination corrupting anything which is in the memory after the destination buffer
this is the buffer-overrun problem used in many exploits also for posix api functions like read which does not put the terminating 0 in the buffer but returns the number of bytes read you will either manually put the 0 or copy it using strncpy

1259988
xval	fluentvalidation
ideally this could be integrated with xval
fluentvalidation also has an mvc component however it doesn t do the client side of things

1260219
stdout	fflush
most likely stdout is line buffered
your program does not call fflush or send a newline so the buffer does not get written out

1260327
maven	pom.xml
assuming your project is in version control and you ve got a ci tool when you check in your ci tool can build to pom.xml project and deploy the snapshot to the maven repos
if your projects point to the snapshot version of the parent pom.xml they ll check the repository to validate that they have the latest version...if not they download the latest version

1260726
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome
doesn t work in opera 10b but i would expect it to work in the stable version 9.6
this works for me in firefox 3.5 ie8 7c google-chrome 2

1260938
chown	chmod	chgrp	chmod
for example mine are stored here .. application models lucene articles index if you are on a linux unix machine you are going to have to chmod the folder or chown chgrp so that the web server has write access
if you have access to the server you could simply run chmod -r 770 path to your data users_index if you are not the admin of the server however you should probably ask the server admin to make sure this is the proper permissions to be applied to this folder every admin has his her own quirks about how they want folder permissions setup

1262109
put	get
well newer versions of .net put layers on top of older layers so all the older knowledge you get is definitely practicable however not all of it is practical

ssl	https
this post is the best resource i have found so far that explains why this setting would be enabled and the pros and cons of enabling it the do not save encrypted pages to disk comes into play when dealing with ssl https connections
just like a web server can send done information about how to cache a file one can basically set internet explorer up to not save files to the cache during an ssl https connection regardless if the web server advises you can

1262272
rpm	yum
i think it would be best if your python dependencies were available as rpms also and declared as dependencies in the rpm
if they aren t available elsewhere create them yourself and put them in your yum repository

folder	directory
check the documentation on the resource_autoloader its purpose is to load resources that reside in the models directory or elsewhere - i.e outside the library folder
resource autoloaders are intended to manage namespaced library code that follow zend framework coding standard guidelines but which do not have a 1 1 mapping between the class name and the directory structure

buildroot	uclibc
i ve had good luck using buildroot to build toolchains and libraries for cross-compiling linux
buildroot uses the lightweight uclibc c library rather than glibc so it might not work for your purposes

so it should take about 5 days and to not put too much pressure on yourself and keep some margin of error you say 6 days or 6 days and a half to your boss

1263324
free	malloc
if you have a good reason not to use a global concurrency or recursion you can use malloc free
the important thing is to either increase your stack not a good idea if you re using threads or get the data on the heap malloc free or the static data segment global

1263443
disk	ram
unless you accept direct keyboard input each time the server reboots it pretty much has to exist on disk somewhere
in general you have to assume the evildoer doesn t have access to the root level operating system or hardware as when that s the case they ll eventually manage to get the key even if it s only in ram

1263571
many-to-many	one-to-many
in theory this is still many-to-many but in practice you do it so that you can have multiple one-to-manys
i agree that the join table for a one-to-many in this situation doesn t seem to add much benefit and as chaos says you actually end up implementing many-to-many support

1263571
many-to-many	one-to-many
i agree that the join table for a one-to-many in this situation doesn t seem to add much benefit and as chaos says you actually end up implementing many-to-many support
one other possible reason for implementing a join table on a one-to-many is that it completely separates questions answers from a dependence on users

1263645
for-loop	arrays
if varscount is 0 the for-loop won t execute anyway
it means one of your arrays isn t actually an arrays

1264967
xna	spritebatch
personally i wouldn t use either of these for a 2d game when you already have xna
xna already has some classes for doing 2d graphics the main one being the spritebatch

1264967
xna	spritebatch
xna already has some classes for doing 2d graphics the main one being the spritebatch
if you do use xna not only can you make a game that runs on windows but also one for xbox zune and silverlight as well zune and silverlight require that you don t use the 3d part of xna though but that shouldn t worry you

1266126
folder	directory
so if you encounter similar problems make sure you re not using subfolders or solution folder
it turns out that the problem was down to using solution folder and not having all the projects on the same directory level

1266253
children	parent
the key part that explains this from the section you quoted is however this only configures plugins that are actually referenced within the plugins element in the children so if you do this in the child pom the configuration from the parent will be applied update to answer the actual question the content from the pluginmanagement section is always merged with any plugin declaration
to avoid the parent doing this you can define the pluginmanagement section within a profile and activate that profile on child projects but not the parent

1266430
agile	sprint
the company i work for and most other agile companies i know work in web development where these issues aren t a concern
your sys-admin deploys right to the webserver at the end of each sprint theoretically

1266779
error-handling	exception-handling
like this calculating total file size is simply adding them up with no error-handling required
exception-handling are as a general rule slow so whenever the issue is not critical it s better to use return flags for efficiency reasons

1267023
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc
as a further note if you wanted to truncate the block there s a legal way to do this realloc works both to enlarge and shrink memory blocks but may or may not move the memory to do so
you cannot pass a pointer you did not obtain from malloc or calloc or realloc ... to free

1267023
realloc	malloc	free	malloc
you cannot pass a pointer you did not obtain from malloc or calloc or realloc ... to free
that includes offsets into blocks you did obtain from malloc

1267040
free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
otherwise if the argument does not match a pointer earlier returned by the calloc malloc or realloc function or if the space has been deallocated by a call to free or realloc the behaviour is undefined
in my experience a double free or the free of the pointer that was not returned via malloc will result in a memory corruption and or crash depending on your malloc implementation

1267268
accessor	properties
alternatively if you don t want to use the accessor then retain or copy the value retrieved
if you choose to create a properties you should use in your init message and not setting the value without the self prefix will not call the copy or retain message and will create a memory problem not necessarily a leak

1267580
folder	directory
here is the section on version control if the project is checked out of a version control system the build or nbbuild dist or nbdist and the nbproject private folder should not be checked into that version control system
if the project is under the cvs subversion or mercurial version control systems the appropriate ignore files are created or updated for these directory when the project is imported

1267928
put	get
you could potentially check the title of all open applications since many applications put document names in their window titles but this is not a requirement and many applications do not do that

strdup	malloc
the problem appears to be implement a strdup function without using standard library facilities or subscripting
i m going to make an exception for malloc as there s no reasonable way to do the above without it and i think that using it isn t detrimental to what s being taught

1268148
for-loop	arrays
you can t modify the variable of a foreach loops so you have to use a for-loop
won t work because of the way the point struct is retrieved from the arrays and then not re-assigned automatically

1268276
folder	directory
for each of my mini-projects i keep all of my low-level functions in a folder called functions and source them into a separate namespace that i explicitly create

subclass	abstract-class	subclass	superclass
2009-08-12 15 27 02.080 flipswitch 1756 20b so you need do define initwithcapacity in your subclass i would recommend to not extend nsmutablearray there is no need just make a class that has a mutable array in it
you problem is that you are not implementing abstract methods of nsmutablearray superclass that need to be implemented it says - nsmutablearray initwithcapacity method only defined for abstract-class

1268799
codeigniter	kohana
even though they aren t as good as codeigniter s they still contain a lot of useful information

1269049
integer	unsigned
41 this implies that unsigned arithmetic does not overflow because a result that cannot be represented by the resulting unsigned integer type is reduced modulo the number that is one greater than the largest value that can be represented by the resulting unsigned integer type
for iso c 99 it is 6.2.5 9 a computation involving unsigned operands can never overflow because a result that cannot be represented by the resulting unsigned integer type is reduced modulo the number that is one greater than the largest value that can be represented by the resulting type

1269139
explode	substr
so you then have to explode that string using n as a separator and take the first element of the returned array
making sure php substr finishes on a word not a character

1269619
pop-up	dialog
you mentioned pop-up modal dialog and i d argue that non-modal ones are just as bad
any dialog box remove focus from the program they could end up behind the program and make it hard to find it they might not even appear on the same virtual screen

stateless	stateful
silverlight apps are interactive stateful applications not stateless web pages containing information and page requests
web pages can also act as applications through ajax and the like but still are stateless pages

1270248
int	chars
a and would return an int representing the chars s ascii value which was usually not the behavior people were looking for but in practical use chars would normally be represented by a one-character string
in ruby 1.9 chars are never mysteriously turned into integers

all build artifacts are uploaded to this folder from the slaves so you re not missing anything important
backup the master s root directory this includes the war file all build history

1270505
post	put
post on resource+operation actually executes the operation
perhaps this is not quite so elegant as using additional http verbs put and delete but these urls should work well with vanilla html forms

1270917
submit	submission
the last action was the loading of the success page not the form submission which means if users do an f5 it will just reload that page and not submit the form again
don t you get annoyed by the re-send data requests if ever you press back after a form submission you can get around this by doing a redirect from the page that processes your form submission to the success page

1270960
filesystems	fat
with that session handler the age of the session data is calculated on the file s last modification date and not the last access date note if you are using the default file-based session handler your filesystems must keep track of access times atime
windows fat does not so you will have to come up with another way to handle garbage collecting your session if you are stuck with a fat filesystems or any other filesystems where atime tracking is not available

1271208
ready	each
bind the ajaxcomplete event once in doc ready and do not add it every time
you keep adding the same event to the ajaxcomplete stack each time in the itemload event. not that easy to tell as you have not given the full script

1271456
inline	inlining
to summarize there are few scenarios where you should attempt to take manual control of inlining by placing or omitting inline statements
some common aspects compiler option debug builds usually don t inline and most compilers have options to override the inline declaration to try to inline all or none suitable calling convention varargs functions usually aren t inlined suitable for inlining depends on size of the function call frequency of the function gains through inlining and optimization settings speed vs

1271456
inline	inlining
the great opportunity for inlining is removing code paths that the compiler knows won t be taken - as an extreme example a good compiler would inline foo false but not foo true
with link time code generation foo could reside in a .cpp without a inline declararion and foo false would still be inlined so again inline has only marginal effects here

folder	directory
several upsides are the folder persist through the uninstall reinstall that s sometimes necessary when dealing with a corrupted clickonce cache less frequent than a few years ago but still an occasional issue
the folder follow a user that is using roaming profiles our experience has been that in a roaming profile situation the clickonce directory are not configured to roam

1273141
folder	directory
the folder follow a user that is using roaming profiles our experience has been that in a roaming profile situation the clickonce directory are not configured to roam
the folder are easier to find if having to do over-the-phone or email it support due to problems in those data files

1273609
mouseover	mouseout	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave
it is actually less expensive to use mouseenter mouseleave because they do not fire for the menu when children mouseover mouseout fire
set a timeout on the mouseout to fadeout and store the return value to data in the object

1274451
button	checkbox
in the case of jcheckbox however the button press is not important the change in state is
that state change is signaled to the itemlistener -- which is also defined on abstractbutton even though state changes are meaningless to other button types the javadoc even says checkbox

1274519
put	get
toolbars are funny about what you put inside
they get funny when all the elements aren t direct children of the toolbar

1274525
textarea	textbox
use the jquery way or pass the clientid of your textbox to your method so you can get the reference to the textarea via the asp.net generated element id
fyi this won t work document.getelementsbytagname returns an array of elements so if anything this would look something like this anyways this isn t the best way to get a reference to a textarea

1274639
firefox	safari
moonlight currently is made up of a few components mono runtime cross platform works on many platforms including powerpc and osx graphics engine cross platform video engine cross platform browser gate currently only supports firefox windowing system integration currently only supports x11 there have been discussions about writing more browser gateways for new browsers but so far it has not been a priority
if moonlight were to be ported to the mac a gate to safari would be necessary

1275341
post	get
see phil haack s blog post on running asp.net mvc on iis 6
if not you need to add a wildcard handler so that all urls get mapped to your application

1275553
public	protected
so you need to perform some steps to be able to protect to some degree obfuscate the code often very non-trivial task as you cannot obfuscate public interfaces exposed to reference them
if the software is a development component it can be protected using built-in .net licensing by using .licx files in visual studio

1276345
struts	stripes
if you decide that struts suits you well you could also have a look at stripes a struts-like framework that s based on the same concepts but is less verbose when it comes to configuration with more sensible defaults less xml and support for annotations
large knowledge base. i agree that this perhaps isn t as valid as it used to be but struts has been used in a lot of projects over the years

1277220
post	put	post	get
that s not the cause of the missing data provider or datapackage error message in order to find that out you should post a reproducible case
the easiest way to get that reproducible case going would be to put two tclientdatasets on your server clientdataset1 and clientdataset2 load the data into that clientdataset1 at design time using a provider and such save that data from clientdataset1 to a .cds file load the .cds file into clientdataset2 at design time send over clientdataset2 to your client if it still reproduces then post that .pas .dfm somewhere. if it does not reproduce then start cutting out portions until it reproduces

1277696
post	get
if that doesn t explain it please post the code you re using to test for nullity
if you use you will not get a nullpointerexception

1278000
stdout	stderr
you have to worry about deadlocks if you re communicating with your subprocess if you re writing to stdin as well as reading from stdout
because these pipes may be cached doing this kind of two-way communication is very much a no-no however if you ve not set up stdin or stderr when constructing data_stream you should be fine

1278070
abc	subclassing	abc	isinstance
editing to add the benefit of checking against the mapping abc instead of against dict is that the same test will work for dict-like classes regardless of whether or not they subclassing dict so it s more flexible just in case
check out the new in 3.x abstract base classes abc s in the collections module i would consider checking with isinstance against mapping like in the following then if you make your own dict-like class make collections.mapping one of its bases

1278789
folder	directory
if you need the parent read only and the child not read only then you ll need to use a filewatcher to look for new directory and change the read only attributes on it when it sees a new folder
the folders created in the dialog box inherit the parent folder permissions

1279211
.htaccess	httpd.conf
something to keep in mind the way that apache handles .htaccess rules is cascading meaning that it will check every .htaccess along the path of the file you are trying to access so if you have some rule forbidding users from viewing any non-index files at any point it will affect all deeper directories
having said that if you know the issue isn t with the httpd.conf file check to see if the root of the publishing path has a .htaccess

1279402
webclient	httpwebrequest
use the webclient instead which exposes a webresponse.headers property
the httpwebrequest does not permit access to the response headers collection

1280095
maven	m2e
here s the easiest way i ve found to do what you are describing check out the entire svn repo somewhere including all of the source i use tortoisesvn for this go to file...import..maven..existing maven projects browse to the directory i just checked out and click finish if there are multiple nested modules the m2e plugin will create a new project for each one in addition to one master project that contains all of the projects but isn t a java project
i think the import projects feature is only in the latest stable development build of the m2e plugin

1280349
daemon	cron	jobs	cron
i would recommend creating a work queue in a flat file or database that a constantly-running php daemon can poll for jobs
it doesn t suffer from cron delay but keeps cpu memory usage to a usable level

1280872
junit	jmockit	testng	jmockit
this happens because it keeps track of the current test being executed by the test runner which can be a junit 3.8 a junit 4.5+ or a testng 5.8+ runner. so when not running in the context of a testing framework junit or testng it lacks the necessary test tracking information
jmockit expectations could be changed though

1281094
perl	tcl
tcl might be easier to embed than perl but i do have to agree matthew scharley s reasoning
also tcl isn t exactly known for it s performance but maybe that s changed in recent years

1281258
actionscript	mxml
mxml is simply declarative actionscript so there is no difference between creating your instance in actionscript or using the mxml notation
your function could be changed to or if your actionscript does not have a reference to the display list than you cannot add the custom component to the display list

1281258
actionscript	mxml
your function could be changed to or if your actionscript does not have a reference to the display list than you cannot add the custom component to the display list
adding an mxml based custom component is no different than adding any other displayobject to the display list is the same as both the sprite and the startsplashpage are extensions of displayobject at their core

1281372
ant	pom.xml	ant	maven
update i m not saying you should change your build process - if ant works for you stick with it
it s worth following the maven conventions in your pom.xml regardless of your build method

1281372
maven	pom.xml	ant	pom.xml
for groupid com.foo.bar artifactid my-project version 1.0.0 the path to the files will be com foo bar my-project my-project-1.0.0.jar com foo bar my-project my-project-1.0.0.pom option 3 if you want to use ant to deploy to a maven repository you can use an ant http library note i ve not tried this myself
you would compose two http put tasks one for the jar and one for the pom.xml

1281399
nfa	dfa
however the regex implementations in most of today s popular programming languages including .net are what friedl calls traditional nfa engines
one of the most important differences between them and dfa engines is that alternation is not greedy

1281516
put	get
if you re interested in what i ve got so far i can try to clean it up a little bit and put it up on the project this weekend
it s really been spiking so far so i have a shameful lack of tests note that the sandbox doesn t allow robots to run other than on appengine at the moment - if you know any java at all you might want to follow the java robot tutorial to get an idea of the kind of thing you ll be able to do

1281651
tostring	string.format
i took hhafez code and added a memory test i run this separately for each approach the + operator string.format and stringbuilder calling tostring so the memory used will not be affected by other approaches. i added more concatenations making the string as blah + i + blah + i + blah + i + blah
the result are as follow average of 5 runs each approach time ms memory allocated long + operator 747 320 504 string.format 16484 373 312 stringbuilder 769 57 344 we can see that string + and stringbuilder are practically identical time-wise but stringbuilder is much more efficient in memory use. this is very important when we have many log calls or any other statements involving strings in a time interval short enough so the garbage collector won t get to clean the many string instances resulting of the + operator

1281829
bazaar	svn
now i m using bazaar
but the idea is exactly the same except with bazaar i have local history and all that i have an ssh access to the production server like you do i work on linux exclusivly so what i do might not be as easy with windows now how i work everything that has te be on the production server source-code images ... is commited to svn bazarr whatever i work locally with apache php mysql i use a dump of the production db that i import locally once in a while i am the only one working on that project

1281829
bazaar	svn
and forced me to remember the revision number of the time i last pushed to production well it was automatically stored in a file by the script so not that hard what i do now when switching to bazaar i didn t want to rewrite that script which didn t work very well anyway i have dropped the script totally as i have ssh access to the production server i use rsync to synchronise from my development machine to the production server when what i have locally is considered stable production-ready
a couple of notes about that way of doing things i don t have a staging server my local setup is close enough to the production s one not having a staging server is ok for a simple project with one or two developpers if i had a staging server i d probably go with do an svn update on it when you want to stage when it is ok launch the rsync command from the staging server which will ba at the latest stable revision so ok to be pushed to production with a bigger project with more developpers i would probably not go with that kind of setup

1282287
x86	64bit
i think the best answer would be a comparison in x86 bit x64 assembler when your x32 bit program registers a variable for example an integer 5 the code is equivalent to this push 5 to understand things better push x is a shortcut to those registeres are 32 bit 4 bytes long which is the size of a pointer in any 32 bit programming language
in 64bit code however the size is twice bigger and so are registers.our register esp exists in x64 executables but its not widely used as it is in x32 executables

1282831
unix	bsd
from the rationale section of a unix manpage for xargs
interestingly this section doesn t appear in the os x bsd version of xargs nor in the gnu version. the classic application of the xargs utility is in conjunction with the find utility to reduce the number of processes launched by a simplistic use of the find -exec combination

1283166
pypdf	reportlab
as distributed pypdf does just about nothing with colors but with some hacking that could be remedied
reportlab s powerful python library is entirely focused on generating new pdfs not on interpreting or modifying existing ones

1283166
reportlab	pdfminer
reportlab s powerful python library is entirely focused on generating new pdfs not on interpreting or modifying existing ones
at the other extreme pure python library pdfminer entirely focusing on parsing pdf files

1283637
puts	gets
it s actually if you ve got a window handle then you want the getwindowthreadprocessid function this returns the thread id and puts the process id in the out-param
getprocessid gets the process id when given a process handle not a window handle

1283845
rss	feed
here s my perspective after having followed both paths system.servicemodel.sydication is about 9 times faster than argotic does not have rdf support doesn t have support for atom versions 1 doesn t have support for rss versions 1 fails with xmlexception on about 30 of the feed i give in from the wild this is the deal-breaker for me argotic hasn t been updated since jul 2 2008 is slow see above has very good support for all types of feed all version of atom rss rdf as far as i can tell is slightly harder to use than system.servicemodel.sydication
you need to determine what kind of feed you have before letting argotic parse it and then you need custom logic to deal with each of 3 different classes depending on the type of feed

1283853
rss	feed
i already posted this for another question but it may be helpful for you too system.servicemodel.sydication is about 9 times faster than argotic does not have rdf support doesn t have support for atom versions 1 doesn t have support for rss versions 1 fails with xmlexception on about 30 of the feed i give in from the wild this is the deal-breaker for me argotic hasn t been updated since jul 2 2008 is slow see above has very good support for all types of feed all version of atom rss rdf as far as i can tell is slightly harder to use than system.servicemodel.sydication
you need to determine what kind of feed you have before letting argotic parse it and then you need custom logic to deal with each of 3 different classes depending on the type of feed

1285015
put	get
if you use an object as a key in a hashmap or if you put it in a hashset and then change the state of the object so that hashcode would return a different value then you re confusing the hashmap or hashset and you ll get strange things
for example when you iterate the map or set the object is there but when you try to get it it s as if it is not there

1285440
win64	windows
as far as i know there is no native mono port to win64 but the win32 one works fine under wow even on x64 systems
the fact that there exists an x64 code generator that works under linux doesn t mean that the same code generator would work under windows

1285486
post	get
in this method the client will do the post request and wait for a response
however your post handling action method will not return a concrete answer but will return a redirectresult to the get handling action method thus the client will request that and wait for its response in turn the get handling action method will contruct the view and return it

1285729
win64	windows
the mono project does not provide binaries installers for win64 because it is not officially supported
as the other answers indicate the win32 version works perfectly fine under 64bit versions of windows

1286591
unix	solaris
this is quite hard job for unix oses you can use pthread condition and mutex with setpshared argument
note it is supported well under linux 2.6 solaris but it does not supported freebsd and cygwin don t know about mac os x for unixes you may also use named semaphores but i don t know the support level of them for windows there are some events.

1286718
factors	mean
depending on several factors it may or may not work - and for a couple reasons
i take it you mean full-on reversible compatibility

1287201
memset	malloc
for instance you can use memset for that
free doesn t guarantee that the memory will be cleared because c doesn t guarantee that malloc will return initialized memory

1287679
profiling	debugging
the best way to narrow this down is with a tool such as ants profiling which will show memory leaks and performance issues
you could also turn on asp.net tracing and set debugging true in web.config and get some idea on slow executing code although with all those timeouts this might not be so helpful

1288731
hash-collision	key
note the difference between a key collision and a hash-collision
the hashtable will not allow more than one entry with the same key as in your example you put two entries with the key two the second one 3 replaced the first one 2 and you were left with only the second one in the hashtable

1289907
disassembly	machine-code
if you compile with debug symbols you can use objdump to produce a more readable disassembly
objdump -drwc -mintel is nice -r shows symbol names on relocations so you d see puts in the call instruction below -r shows dynamic-linking relocations symbol names useful on shared libraries -c demangles c++ symbol names -w is wide mode it doesn t line-wrap the machine-code bytes -mintel use gas binutils masm-like .intel_syntax noprefix syntax instead of at t -s interleave source lines with disassembly

1290070
nunit	mstest
that is not to say that you can t plug any other testing frameworks into cc nunit just happens to be an easy one to use
as for available features mstest has some really nice add-ons when you run it with the fantastically priced visual studio team system with tfs in the back-end

1293193
superclass	subclassing
subclassing that have constructor parameter lists that differ significantly from their superclass is another example of a class doing too much
if a subclassing truly is-a superclass then it shouldn t require significantly more data to do its job

1293324
listview	gridview
i don t think there is any point in using a listview if as you say you cannot use gridview or any other view
i would exchange listview for itemscontrol or listbox if you need a selectable item or any of the other things that listbox offers

1293769
hash	md5
a md5 hash is 128 bits wide and doesn t guarantee uniquess only a low probablity of collision
the md5 hash is no smaller than the uuid so it doesn t help with storage

1293769
hash	md5
the md5 hash is no smaller than the uuid so it doesn t help with storage
if you know the hash is from a uuid it is much easier to attack because the domain of valid uuids is actually fairly predictable if you know anything about the machine geneerating them

1293860
salt	md5
the advantage of md5 -ing the output along with an application-specific salt string or random number is a way harder to guess string unlike plain uniqid this produces very different outputs every microsecond
furthermore it does not reveil your prefix salt string nor that you are using uniqid under the hood

1293867
int	double
int to double is okay
a double has enough precision to accurately represent all int values. in some cases that would have been useful - in some cases not

1293893
pascal	delphi
but delphi was pascal and he knew nothing about pascal and couldn t be bothered to learn more about it so he chose to develop in powerbuilder for new projects
and i decided to move to a company with a smarter boss who did believe in delphi

1294354
pygtk	pycairo	pygtk	pygobject
keep in mind you will probably need all of the following installed on your windows machine pycairo pygobject pygtk unofficial x64 versions of the above 3 items are available here -- however i cannot vouch for nor recommend them
and of course the gtk+ runtime or i suspect in your case that the pygtk libraries are not finding your gtk+ runtime directory where the dlls are

1294599
migrate	upgrade
if you do not want to rewrite the entire application your best bet is to migrate to owlnext
first step will be to still use borland c++ 5.0x but upgrade the project to use owlnext instead of the old owl libraries

1294824
config	ini
the point of this is that the responsibility of config is delegated
each unit doesn t care if the config is stored in a table ini file xml file or even gasp the registry

1294826
queue	fifo
a fifo queue would just be a stack with enqueue being push and dequeue being pop
that doesn t make any sense as an exercise so i d definitely assume a fifo queue was intended

1294912
versioning	upgrade
this provides a level of safety - you know you won t break a client s project because somebody else changed something underneath you but it s very easy to upgrade at any time to the new versioning
versioning in svn is trivial - so i wouldn t let this be an issue

1294964
src	attr
looking at jquery 1.3.2 source it would appear that attr attempts to set the attribute as a property of the element if it exists as a property on the element colspan exists as a property and defaults to 1 on htmlelements in ie and firefox the document is not xml and the attribute is none of href src or style using colspan as opposed to colspan works with attr because the former is a property defined on the element whereas the latter is not
the fall-through for attr is to attempt to use setattribute on the element in question setting the value to a string but this causes problems in ie bug #1070 in jquery convert the value to a string all browsers do this but ie see #1070 elem.setattribute name + value

1295256
post	get
you could either have your page 2 link issue a form post using javascript not recommended or simply pass in the form data into that link so they show up in the query string
that s because your link is issuing a get request and the form data is not being submitted to page 2

1295261
post	put
keep in mind i m not totally sure what you re after but if you post a bit more info i might be able to clarify
i might be misunderstanding your question but you don t need to use binding to put an instance of one type of control into an instance of another type of control

1295440
versioning	upgrade
can be called to upgrade your settings from the previous versioning
possible duplicate settings.settings file keeps getting reset my answer from that question applies here i believe settings.settings files are saved based on the current versioning number basically as a feature where settings are not saved between differing versions of the same program on a machine

1296201
serializable	deserialization
full cycle serializable deserialization could work reliably only if you are holding both activities in your own hand
if one company implements serializable sends the rdf over to another company that implements the deserialization you cannot expect too much

1296684
opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested all combinations of pre-allocating not pre-allocating counting up down and for while loops in ie 6 7 8 firefox 3.5 google-chrome and opera
the functions below was consistently the fastest or extremely close in firefox google-chrome and ie8 and not much slower than the fastest in opera and ie 6

1297161
gif	png
for some reason when people are running internet explorer via citrix it changes the mime type for gif and jpg files
jpg image x-citrix-pjpeg gif image x-citrix-gif based on my testing png files are not affected

1297249
pull	push
hg convert the extension can incrementally bring in new revisions from a subversion repository into the mercurial one a little like pull
however it does not support taking mercurial revisions and sending them back to subversion no push

1297249
pull	push
up until recently this only let you clone and pull a subversion repository but as of hgsvn 0.1.7 it supports push
i do not know how well it does push

1297357
cpython	ironpython
you can simply copy the standard library from a cpython install if you prefer although you re better off getting just the modules that the ironpython developers have ensured with with ironpython - this is most of them
modules that are implemented using the cpython c api extension modules will not be available

1297891
tunnel	packets
if the shops were in different countries then you would have a better chance of getting it right country that is supposing of course i was not tunnel my traffic elsewhere
you could always hack their router and install some sort of packets tagging in it.

1298060
libc	ldd
alternatively link foo.so like this gcc -shared -o foo.so foo.o bar.o -ldep1 -ldep2 -wl --no-undefined this should fail to link if foo.o or bar.o uses something not provided by libdep1 or libdep2 or libc
ldd -r foo.so should print the set of symbols which foo.so needs but which aren t provided by its direct dependencies

1298617
swt	swing
we also had this question in company and decided to go with swing because for normal desktop application you just cannot sense the speed difference which is supposedly on swt side and this speed you are buying with ruining wora principle you have to bring with your application needed .dlls or .so files to natively support your application running in desired os-es
for long time swing part of java with printing was weak point of java

1299593
config	ini
readability is one of the main reasons i ve used ini filies for php script config in the past
people who are not coders have run into an ini file at least once before and can understand what it is much easier than even a simple php file

1300385
entity-relationship	entities
you cannot tell what is it only from the relational structure you need to see the entity-relationship model
for table persons id name surname 1 john smith id name and surname are entities in the real world and may or may not represent entities in the underlying entity-relationship model

1300385
entity-relationship	entities
for table persons id name surname 1 john smith id name and surname are entities in the real world and may or may not represent entities in the underlying entity-relationship model
the fact of a record exists in the table means that these entities are in the following relation person 1 has name john and has surname smith

1301010
implements	extends
i don t think there s anything out there that would do all 5 but the other requirements shouldn t be very difficult to implements
perhaps you could get the source to one of these existing plugins and extends it

1301370
switching	screens
while it s not an ide it is some kind of window manager on the terminal -- you can have multiple windows and switching between them which makes especially tasks like this much easier
you should give the screens utility a look

1301375
division	multiplication
in 64 bits it s okay obviously after the multiplication has overflowed the division isn t going to undo that overflow
because the multiplication overflows 32 bit integers

1301938
csla	.net
csla does not follow the ddd paradigm
the above book .net domain-driven design with c# by tim mccarthy wrox press is really good one

1302763
directx	gdi
directx is not something you would use to draw simple shapes rather render complicated 3d stuff also using dx api under c# is a bit trickier although not that hard
read about gdi gdi+ system.drawing namespace for example here

1303024
post	http-get
it sounds like you re using a form that post but you want to stay in test mode
that is you re not using http-get so it s not realistic to pass qs variables around

1303078
uitouch	uibutton
i m unsure of that. as i stated above i have used this approach not this exact implementation but this pattern quite successfully when i needed to have a button on the interface but also capture the uitouch object itself
instinct would say subclass uibutton but uibutton is actually a class cluster ie the actual type of object transparently changes depending on what kind of button you want to make which makes it supremely difficult to subclass

1303933
submit	submission
any truthy value on the other hand will automatically submit a form
you should really perform any submission related logic in form s submit event handler not in click of one of form s elements

1303933
submit	submission
you should really perform any submission related logic in form s submit event handler not in click of one of form s elements
this should ensure that keyboard-based submission goes through your handler

1304410
int	chars
alternatively you can use static int and return its address every time - there will be no leaks but function becomes non-reentrant which is risky but acceptable if you bear it in mind
much better would be to return pointer to chars function finds or null if it is not present

1304488
qtextedit	qtextdocument
however you can achieve this using a qtextedit qtextdocument
try something like this i m writing this from memory so it may not compile or be 100 correct the important thing is to use a qtextdocument which allows you to change the html stylesheet

1304840
realloc	malloc	free	malloc	calloc	malloc
this is a limitation of the malloc calloc realloc free api -- and implementations may rely on these limitations for example keeping bookkeeping information about the allocation immediately before the start address which would make moving the start address difficult. now malloc isn t the only allocator out there -- your platform or libraries might provide other ones or you could write your own which gets memory from the system via malloc mmap virtualalloc or some other mechanism and then hands it out to your program in whatever fashion you desire
for c++ if you allocate memory with std malloc the information above applies

can handle up to 1500 feeds w performance still ok managing subscriptions still functioning
maybe not for programming purposes but chrome w google reader makes for the most powerful rss reader

1306062
jboss	weblogic
i don t know if the jboss support contract comes with a sales force but would be surprised if it did and that the playing field has leveled in that respect
in my experience other than the pretty console you get with weblogic which isn t worth forking out the license fees for there s not much between the 2

1306815
int	boolean
in button1.click handler rowcounter will act as an index to the answers dim rowcounter as int 0 for each gridrow as gridviewrow in gridview1.rows grid_rowdatabound handles the binding of single row grid_rowdatabound gridrow rowcounter rowcounter+ 1 next finally private sub grid_rowdatabound gridrow as gridviewrow rowcounter as int make the dropdown invisible ctype gridrow.findcontrol dropdownlist1 dropdownlist .visible false because we ll be acting on two properties of the label i shove it in a variable first for ease of access dim label as label ctype gridrow.findcontrol label1 label set the label to visible label.visible true set the text label.text iif answers rowcounter correct incorrect end sub someone probably has a cleaner solution than this but i do know this works at least as far as i understand the issue you are facing. good luck
here is how i handled it created a page level private variable to hold our list of correct incorrect values private answers as new list of boolean creates a strongly typed list of t f values in page.load if ispostback then iterate through each row for each gridrow as gridviewrow in gridview1.rows get the selected value for this answer dim answer as string ctype gridrow.findcontrol dropdownlist1 dropdownlist .selectedvalue add this answer to the list answers.add iscorrectanswer answer next end if the iscorrectanswer function determines whether or not the answer given for this question is correct and returns a boolean value

1306837
pure-virtual	base-class
instead a derived class that implements the pure-virtual method s must be used
a pure-virtual isn t defined in the base-class at all so a derived class must define it or that derived class is also abstract and can not be instantiated

1307603
integer	unsigned
the binary representation of -4 in a 32-bit word is as follows hex notation 0xfffffffc when interpreted as an unsigned integer this bit pattern represents the number 2 32-4 or 18446744073709551612
i m not sure i would call this phenomenon overflow but it is a common mistake to assign a small negative integer to a variable of unsigned type and wind up with a really big positive integer

1307603
integer	unsigned
i m not sure i would call this phenomenon overflow but it is a common mistake to assign a small negative integer to a variable of unsigned type and wind up with a really big positive integer
this trick is actually exploited for bounds checking if you have a signed integer i and want to know if it is in the range 0 i n you can test which gives you the answer using one comparison instead of two

1308051
int	chars
the type int string chars myclass yourclass etc of value doesn t support the operation
that is normal for most non-intrinsic number types int long decimal etc

1309174
datamapper	activerecord
the pattern that hibernate adheres most closely is the datamapper pattern
hibernate does not follow activerecord pattern

1309555
google-chrome	firefox
it doesn t work in google-chrome neither windows nor mac however
as for firefox 3.5 and ie 8.0 no deal

1309557
bazaar	git
i find them much less hassle for smaller projects and if you re using it on more than one machine the whole thing is backed up on both in case of hd issues. any of git mercurial and bazaar are fine choices in general
git on windows still doesn t have a native client although there are ones that work decently through emulators so i d not go with that

1311366
children	parent
a much better idea would be to create a lookup a lookup is a bit like a - so basically you work out which children belong to which parent then add them all in
i think the call to contains is necessary in case you have any root elements with no children - i would expect the indexer to throw an exception if the specified key doesn t exist

1311530
accessor	superclass
for example if you are writing an instance method on a class and you want to call a method on that same instance to do something or retrieve some data you would use self this is also often used for accessor methods on an instance setter and getter especially with setter methods if they implement extra functionality rather than just setting the value of an instance variable so that you do not have to repeat that code over and over when you want to set the value of that variable for example one of the most common uses of self is during initialization of a class
sample code might look like this invokes the superclass s via super initializer which is how chained initialization occurs up the class hierarchy

1311780
post	get
there appears to be a common mis-conception that post is more secure than get simply because it seems more obvious how to get a browser to manipulate the post variable
however it is a very very small stretch to do the same thing with post variables so security should not depend on posting rather than getting

1311780
post	get
however it is a very very small stretch to do the same thing with post variables so security should not depend on posting rather than getting
there s nothing wrong with using post except that you don t seem to be able to get it to work easily

1311946
spaces	delimiter
failing that it finds spaces
in perl if you use grouping in the regex when calling split the function returns not only the elements but also the captured groups in this case our delimiter

1312013
maven	m2e
still it s not wise to change the output folders for maven and its plugins
if you use m2e then the config in the eclipse project is overwritten by the plugin

1312822
for-loop	arrays
i did a very quick test after doing this declaring at the beginning of the script using and not in the for-loop you are using to access arrays elements and not adding a line to display used memory before the unsets i am getting this using php 5.3.1 today s snapshot 328616 332176 331728 the three outputs are first one the beginning of the script the one which says show current memory usage before second one the one i added before the calls to unset
just after the end of the for-loop third one the one you put at the end of your script

1313454
post	get
on a side note ideally you would not use get for deleting entries but rather post but that s another story
it all depends on how your application is built what happens at stack overflow is that the delete link click is caught by javascript and an ajax request is being made to delete the post

1313504
int	chars
2 the bit mentioned in you question is the one that is used in single byte int for their singed-ness
when a int on a system is larger than one byte the signed flat is not affected when you convert chars to int other wise it is

1313508
post	get	put	get
this allows user agents to represent other methods such as post put and delete in a special way so that the user is made aware of the fact that a possibly unsafe action is being requested
naturally it is not possible to ensure that the server does not generate side-effects as a result of performing a get request

1313842
int	boolean
ps don t try this on other brands of database that uphold the sql standard behavior a boolean expression yields a boolean not a 0 or 1 int
you re using mysql so you can take advantage of its feature that a boolean expression evaluates to 0 for false and 1 for true

1314757
postgresql	mysql
as the person that implemented both i can tell you that the reason is that by passing the string through as-is to postgresql and odbc the pdo driver code for those databases does not need to be updated as the underlying library adds new features
since mysql does not have its own connection string parsing code we invented a mechanism for passing data in to the underlying mysql function calls which have a very specific api with fixed parameters

1315150
post	get
in this case you are making a post request with the jquery.post function so you should use instead
it looks to me like the problem is in the php code and not the jquery - the problem you are having is likely related to the fact that you are getting the parameter question_id using the _get method which only retrieves parameters from a get request

1315361
udp	tcp
it s more a udp datagram connection
in these cases the data isn t a stream which gets packeted by tcp but rather a giant chunk of data

1315618
hash	salt
if no i would suggest to store the passwords hash sha-2 or something like that with a salt
it s not common practice to store passwords encrypted instead of hash

1315636
base	fractions
as for base ten i cannot tell how to handle denominators containing but not being a power of two - for example 12
i can give a hint - repeating decimals in base ten are all fractions with the denominator having at least one prime factors other than two and five

1315830
hash	md5
hash you also lament that you ll be using image sha s md5 s etc to deduplicate images
this is a fallacious notion of its own hash of files are only able to tell if the files are different not if they re the same

1316484
width	margin
consequently you should be able to reveal the image by providing enough space as you see fit by setting an appropriate right margin of at least 16 in your case according to this assumptions i ve indeed been able to reproduce the issue presumably it is easily overlooked because width and or margin of a textbox are often provided explicitly and visible either way due to the default textbox border while this is less common for a radiobutton and its border is invisible by default
given that the style seems to get applied correctly in the first place this is likely just an effect of your particular window composition width margin and placement of the related controls depending on your layout the image might end up behind the radio button canvas and thus invisible if their is not enough space left within the window to display the image alongside your control if the radiobutton fills the entire width of a stackpanel row

1316593
put	get
if not this time he s gonna take off all his clothes and put them on your damned table
relax just invite him for a drink go out and get stoned then explain him the whole situation

1316950
prepare	execute
this is done as an potential optimization - if you know in advance that you will need to execute the statement many times in a row preparing it upfront can save some work on the database server since it does not have to re- prepare the statement for each call
pg_query_params as well as its simpler version pg_query just execute the statement query directly forcing the database server to re prepare the statement each time the function gets called

1317131
google-chrome	firefox
so the fact that it s firefox that is launched and not google-chrome is normal
if you want to launch google-chrome you will have to use something else than

1317286
post	get
the only real difference is that you are using post to search whereas i am using get
according to this page ie7 does not support post requests so it may be that other browsers also do not support post

1317520
perforce	svn
i m not familiar with perforce but i got info from p4 opened
it looks like svn status performs the same function

1317597
post	get
as i said these are only conventions and there is not much technical difference between them but a very important difference is that browsers will warn the user if they try to repeat a post -- clicking refresh will pop-up a dialog box warning the user that this may cause an operation to be repeated and confirming that they really want to resubmit
the browser does not show this confirmation when refreshing a get request

1318687
min	max
you shouldn t be able to specify a select column if it is not a group by column an aggregate-functions min max count sum ... in your case i would use this select
i don t know why mysql allows you to do that but normally in sql the following query is not valid select cmt_id thread_id cmt_text min cmt_id from comments group by thread_id

1318726
rss	feed
specifically you will need an nsurlconnection object to get the rss feed either synchronously or async
it can do both if memory serves if not there s another class that does. you will also need to implement the nsxmlparserdelegate category on a handler object and run an nsxmlparser on your rss feed

1318765
perforce	svn
perforce won t affect any part of that - as long as you can make it ignore the .svn dirs
i don t see why not if you can make perforce ignore the .svn directories then a svn wc is just an ordinary directory of files

1318765
perforce	svn
i don t see why not if you can make perforce ignore the .svn directories then a svn wc is just an ordinary directory of files
you can make your changes to those files and commit them as normal using svn - svn simply uses the .svn dirs to detect whether anything has changed and to generate the diffs to send to the repository

1319454
for-loop	arrays
your for-loop check to get the size of the arrays will not work
if you use malloc free or new delete then you ll have to specify the size of the arrays you want beforehand

1319665
postgresql	mysql
in postgresql this is a fairly common approach to your dilemma
while i ve not tried it in mysql sepecifically it may be worth considering

1320317
git-rebase	amend
then when git asks you to amend each commit do edit or just close the editor that opens and then do git-rebase --continue to continue the git-rebase
you could skip opening the editor altogether here by appending --no-edit so that the command will be single commit as some of the commenters have noted if you just want to change the most recent commit the git-rebase command is not necessary

1321506
filesystems	ntfs
the windows filesystems fat32 and ntfs only recognizes the pe file name so two assemblies with the same pe file name but different culture version or public key token cannot exist in the same windows folder
to solve this issue .net introduces something called the gac global assembly cache which is treated as a single folder by the .net clr but is actually implemented using nested ntfs or fat32 folders

1322339
sharepoint	spsite
in fact i would be surprised to find that your code actually works as you intend existing sharepoint objects specifically parentweb have their permissions set when they are created and should also not be passed into an elevated context
a better approach for elevating permissions within sharepoint is to use spsite impersonation

1323046
hash	md5
assuming uniform spread in the range of md5 and sha-1 hash for random strings which isn t the case and assuming we re only talking about two strings and not talking about a pool of strings so we avoid birthday-paradox-type complexities an md5 hash is 128 bits wide and sha-1 s is 160
with the above assumptions two strings a and b have a probability of colliding p if both hash collide

1323126
put	get
if your oracle database runs on an operating system that matlab will also run on and matlab can expose a c dll-style api for its api s if not i m sure you could put a thin .net layer on top of matlab to create a c dll then you can call matlab functions as external procedures from oracle
ideally you d benchmark both and see what sort of performance you could get out of both options

1323270
jar	war
make the war project have a dependency on the jar project and the jar project have a dependency on aspectjrt
the jar dependencies you want to exclude can be specified as scope provided so they will not be included in the build or excluded by configuring the jar dependency to exclude those transitive dependencies see the transitive dependency exclusion section of the dependency mechanism documentation for details

1323270
jar	war
the jar dependencies you want to exclude can be specified as scope provided so they will not be included in the build or excluded by configuring the jar dependency to exclude those transitive dependencies see the transitive dependency exclusion section of the dependency mechanism documentation for details
when the war is built any compile-scoped dependencies and their transitive dependencies will be bundled into the war s web-inf lib directory aspectjrt will be included as well

1323586
uilabel	uifont
start with a reasonable font size 12 and set the font property of the uilabel with a uifont that matches that size call - void sizetofit for the uilabel
check the frame for the uilabel if the frame will fit within the bounds you need it to you re done if the frame is still to big drop the size of the font and repeat the loop for the latter option you ll want to make sure you re not squeezing the text into oblivion so you ll want to put a minimum size cap on the font size

1324414
inherited	properties
if you absolutely need to be able to set the parent after modifying the font you could derive your own control class from tdatetimepicker and implement a response to the cmfontchanged message that suppresses the inherited behaviour unless the control is parented note that the adjustheight procedure is reproduced from a private method of tdatetimepicker
if you are only changing the font.style you may not need to reproduce this code and can remove it and the call to it but if you alter other properties of the font then this should ensure that the control is correctly sized

1324588
cpu	affinity
you will not be able to do anything smarter than sql already does in regard to partition the data access per cpu it simply has access to information you don t buffer pool fill state page lifetime expectancy cpu numa affinity etc
if your processing is scalar oriented and cpu intensive and even some set oriented processing place the processing in an udf clr function and again let the query execution paralelize your function execution

1324688
hash	md5
calculating an md5 hash and using it as a key for something that s already unique is redundant
on the other hand if name is not unique then the md5 hash won t be unique either and so it s pointless that way too

1324688
hash	md5
on the other hand if name is not unique then the md5 hash won t be unique either and so it s pointless that way too
generally you use an md5 hash when you don t want to store the actual value of the column

1324688
hash	md5
generally you use an md5 hash when you don t want to store the actual value of the column
for instance if you re storing passwords you generally only store the md5 hash of the password not the password itself so that you can t see people s passwords just by looking at the table contents

1324950
post	get
i suppose a lot of people don t see it because the first request to a site generally isn t a post or they chalk it up to flukes
there is a potential workaround using curl. the curl work around would do a simple get request to each of your mongrels on the server to prime them so to speak

1324990
post	get
there are the autogenerated api docs at h ttp www.merbivore.com documentation current doc rdoc stack index.html but those are also horrendously incomplete most methods have grossly incomplete or nonexistent documentation that doesn t for example list what options are available in an options hash. there are tons of blog post on various merb features but the vast majority are horrendously out of date and no longer applicable to current merb
if you do go with merb resign yourself to spending hours reading the minimally commented test suite and source code yourself to figure out how to get things done

1325083
put	get
it s just mostly a matter of how it s put together at the core architectural level
it s not that straight sql is the devil - sometimes it s pretty much required to write raw sql to get a query to perform the way you want it to

1325184
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
the dtd including description for clientaccesspolicy.xml is at this page on msdn this basic example should get your started
silverlight looks for clientaccesspolicy.xml which is specific to silverlight if thats not found it will fall back on crossdomain.xml which can also be used by flash for instance

1325184
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
silverlight looks for clientaccesspolicy.xml which is specific to silverlight if thats not found it will fall back on crossdomain.xml which can also be used by flash for instance
you only need one of those sockets only work with clientaccesspolicy.xml but webclient and http work with both

1325245
post	put
it only knows get and post not delete and put
for deletion and updating operations it overloads the post method

1325311
hash	salt
then make a hash md5 or sha1 from that string
the salt can simply be userid or it could be something else as long as it isn t known to the user

1325585
ant	myeclipse
afaikt there is no ootb feature that can generate an ant script or equivalent headless-build script from myeclipse - i m not sure i understand why this is a problem
it s possible to write a simple ant build.xml in an hour or two that would do the job for most java ee apps packaged as war files

1325719
ssl	https
something like that gets you a connect for the ssl connection and then a get for the http portion
connect isn t a http verb it s the start of a https request the ssl connect portion

1326107
hash	md5
i wouldn t rely on just an md5 hash for your queries
it s possible if unlikely that a hash collision would occur and it would select a completely different query result

1327040
.war	manifest.mf
what i suggest you do is add a meta-inf directory with a manifest.mf file in .war file
please note that according to servlet spec it must be a .war file and not .war directory for the meta-inf manifest.mf to be read by container

1327212
pdfsharp	migradoc
sounds like you re using migradoc not pdfsharp
migradoc works similar to word you define the contents migradoc cares for the pagebreaks

1327701
sequence	permutation
works not only on strings but on any sequence type
there is an algorithm called next_permutation which given a range will return true on each subsequent call until all permutation have been encountered

1327733
listview	gridview
also be sure to look into the new listview and datapager controls
if not then perhaps the gridview is not the appropriate control to build from

1327960
folder	directory
from the netbeans knowledge base article on importing eclipse projects version control considerations if the project is checked out of a version control system the build or nbbuild dist or nbdist and the nbproject private folder should not be checked into that version control system
if the project is under the cvs subversion or mercurial version control systems the appropriate ignore files are created or updated for these directory when the project is imported

1329046
puts	fflush
think of hibernate as a big cache that can use a db as a store where it puts things that don t fit into the cache anymore
hibernate will not fflush everything to the db as you change it it will wait

1329401
inherited	properties
make a wrapper stream class that inherited stream and contains two additional streams and override its write method to write to both streams
i don t think you need to override anything else except the can_whaterver_ properties but i m not sure

1330214
getter	setter
each option on the slider has a setter as well as a getter so you can set the value with that as in the example above
from the documentation update for dual sliders you ll need to use you ll need to use math.min max to make sure that one value doesn t pass the other as the setter doesn t seem to prevent this

1330982
opera	google-chrome
it s very easy in firefox and opera as far as i see
google-chrome and ie not so much

1331295
post	put	post	get
i m not sure exactly and i ll update this post once i get chance to try it out on a clean machine i m still mid-project so it s not a very good time to be faffing about
the way i fixed it was to get the dlls from c program files episerver cms version bin and put them in the bin folder for the application

1331518
firefox	safari
i was able to fix this in firefox by doing this i m still getting an issue in safari where the browser refreshes to a blank page with just the content of the document.write and ie6 ie7 doesn t do anything at all
firefox works though

1331564
inherited	properties
first linkedlistnode is sealed so it can not be inherited
secondly linkedlistnode does contain properties previous and next that refer to the previous and next nodes in the linkedlist that a given instance of linkedlistnode came from

1331645
elf	dwarf
a more capable format to contain more information elf for maximum information include dwarf debug information elf is fairly widely supported and not too complex
dwarf allows you to record very expressive debug information for debugging of complex language constructs

1334396
peer	p2p
fms is not peer to peer to this date therefore you ll always pay for the bandwidth as long as you re not going p2p
flash player 10 has these capabilities built in but adobe is yet to provide fms that is p2p capable beside the hosted beta called stratus where adobe makes even more confusion making it unclear whether you can release a commercial application or not under the hosted stratus server rendering all these features useless these are the advantages of proprietary obscure protocols close minded companies

1334919
chunked	transfer-encoding
if the transfer encoding is chunked then the content-length field will not be set possible causes is that zendserver does not do chunked encoding whereas apache does see the following links for details
check for transfer-encoding header

1335107
spaces	delimiter
you should set for spaces not to be considered delimiter more info here
since you work in a version that does not support the above as was clarified after the answer was submitted you have two options find a character you know will not be used in the original text underscore convert all spaces to that character before splitting and convert back after splitting

1335239
free	malloc
you only need to call free on values which are explicitly created via malloc
in this case no you do not need to call free

1335247
free	malloc
note that you only free what you malloc
yes it is freed. not free ed though. since str is an automatic variable it will only last as long as its scope which is until the end of the function block

1335774
postgresql	mysql
in tables with traditional data types integer varchar date numeric etc etc. differences could be for one or the other as appropriate but in stored procedures firebird is much more powerful than postgresql much more simple and elegant
two or three years any linux distribution not including firebird only mysql and postgresl. not for nothing today but tradicionesles distributions ubunutu opensuse fedora centos etc etc and firebird include in their repositories

1335916
inherited	subclassing
on the other hand to counter the argument against interfaces because you can simply use inherited inherited has its draw backs one of them is that - at least in c# and java - you can only use inherited once single inherited
but the second - and maybe more important - is that inherited requires you to understand the workings of not only the parent class but all of the ancestor classes which makes extension harder but also more brittle because a change in the parent class implementation could easily break the subclassing

1336041
postgresql	mysql
i ve been working with postgresql firebird oracle mysql mssql more than 6 years ago and my preferred are firebird and postgresql
i don t like mysql because commercial license is not cheap and mysql lacks of some functions. i you ask me about what is my preferred one between fb and pg..

1336506
post	get
you then need to fill in the post body with the form elements as mentioned above and in the links you provided
not knowing anything about this site you re trying to log into i d venture a guess that if you don t get good session variables and cookies and include them for each of your logical requests your login attempts may fail

1336509
stdout	fflush
if that doesn t fix it you can protect the stdout resource with a named mutex or a critical section
basically wrap all printf + fflush calls with a wait followed by a signal on the named mutex

1336710
wtl	atl
another option would be wtl which comes recommended by some former colleagues of mine
why not use either atl or mfc as they re both supplied with vs2005 anyway.

1337331
children	parent
for each child tab page you need to merge create a tab in the main form page control corresponding to the child tab iterate over the controls in the child tab and change the parent property to the tab page you just created you do not need to deal with controls that are children of other controls
if you have a groupbox in your child tab then changing it s parent will bring both it and all controls within it to the new parent

1337718
translation	localization
i know you re not asking for translation methods but i think the joomfish way of selecting content based in a chosen language would be what you wanted but not based in languages just domains
the only component i know it would be able to suppress articles based in pre defined parameters in its case the language is the joomfish s table localization plugin but you need to be a joomfish silver member paying 60 to joomfish s developers

1337971
vbo	normals
for opengl es on the iphone apple recommends that you place all of the vertices that you can draw at one time in a vertex buffer object vbo and that you interleave the vertex normals color and texture information within that buffer in that order
note that the vbo itself doesn t give you a significant performance boost over a standard array on the original iphones but the 3gs has hardware vbo support

1338042
nullreferenceexception	argumentnullexception
well for one you are likely to get the dreaded nullreferenceexception since you are not checking if emailaddress is null at any level
that particular check should be done in the constructor itself and if emailaddress is null throw an argumentnullexception

1338046
put	get
constructors should be used to create objects that are immediately valid not to create just a container for things to be put in
yes if your general approach is ensure that you can only get an instance of a valid object then i love it

1338116
udp	mtu
for ethernet assuming the 5000 byte payload is not encapsulated in an ip + tcp udp frame you will have 18 bytes of overhead for every packet sent
that means each transmission with an mtu of 1500 will be able to hold 1482 bytes

1338533
websphere	ibm
using firefox provided the key that i needed to determine the source of this issue - the error 404 srve0190e message which told me that the problem was a websphere configuration
the problem is explained in better detail at the following link ibm websphere webcontainer throws a filenotfoundexception when a request is received for a static file which does not exist on the file system

1338533
websphere	ibm
the problem is explained in better detail at the following link ibm websphere webcontainer throws a filenotfoundexception when a request is received for a static file which does not exist on the file system
and the solution is explained at this link in this case setting the com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.invokefilterscompatibility value true websphere setting up custom properties for completeness sake i ll put how to correct this problem here -in the administrative console click servers and under servers click application servers -click on the server to which the custom property is to be applied -under configuration and container settings click web container settings and under web container settings click web container -under configuration and additional properties click custom properties -in the custom properties page click new -in the settings page enter the name of the custom property to be added in the name field and the value to be set for the custom property in the value field

1338707
ivar	subclassing
the uitableview in this case does some work looks to see if its -delegate property is non-nil which is just a random ivar that happens to be called delegate if so it sees the delegate implements the delegate method calls it if it does then does some more work
uitableview does not expose a default section header view it s a private subclassing called uisectionheadercell i believe so apple isn t making any promises about how it s implemented

1338741
antivirus	mcafee
disclosure i used to work on another now-obsolete antivirus package back in the 90 s
based on previous installations at various jobs empirically rated from slowest very annoying to quickest almost no impact symantec awful mcafee avg eset computer associates excellent i wouldn t bother with the speed tests etc

nstimer	nsrunloop
nstimer schedules its time events on the current nsrunloop --your thread doesn t start one
if all you are trying to do is run something after a certain amount of time use if you are trying to actually do work in the background will work as expected but you shouldn t run timer events in the background without an nsrunloop

1339467
disk	ram
the same way you would run it from disk
your program doesn t know whether it s already loaded in ram or on disk

1339882
pull	push
http protocol doesn t provides way to push client only pull allowed
your task looks as push notification to client

1340066
valgrind	gprof
caveat i am not familiar with kcachegrind i see now that kcachegrind is using valgrind framework so i would imagine you would be able to run it from your development machine
gprof would be the obvious choice if you are using gcc and i suppose valgrind should work too

1340685
jhat	hprof
jhat -baseline indeed won t work with dumps produced by jmap
i m not certain but i believe this is because hprof attaches to the jvm right from the start and keeps its own track of objects allowing it to produce consistent ids across multiple dumps

1340809
document.write	settimeout
for one your missing the quote in the like everyone has said and you should not be using the document.write to create new elements on the page as greg said use createelement and appendelement like
you could also use jquery and the html helper also in your settimeout method you should use it like

1341371
background-repeat	margin
background-repeat no-repeat
secondly the background does not go into margin-area of a box so if you want to have the background only be on the actual contents of a box you can use margin instead of padding

1341801
super	implements	super	self
apple documentation implements initializers cocoa-dev self super init debate basically it stems from the idea that a superclass may have over-ridden the designated initializer to return a different object than the one returned from +alloc
if you didn t assign the return value of super s initializer into self then you could potentially be dealing with a partially initialized object because the object that super initialized isn t the same object that you re initializing

1342417
inherited	properties
that could mean external code might attempt to attach to aborttransaction on your control but that will not be seen by the inherited control code
you are trying to hide a properties that doesn t exist

1342536
inherited	subclassing
however any class which consumes this role must implement all of the required methods either directly or through inherited from a parent
you cannot delay the method requirement check so that they can be implemented by future subclassing

1343110
inline	inlining
methods that contain exception-handling blocks are not inline though methods that throw exceptions are still candidates for inlining
if any of the method s formal arguments are structs the method will not be inline

1343110
inline	inlining
although your method is quite short and not very complex so it might match the heuristics is a struct so i d guess your method is not inline
as a rule of thumb if inlining this method improves performance the jit will inline this method

1343596
put	get	public	protected
the xml serializer can only serialize public properties and it will unless you put a xmlignore on them
the datacontractserializer is different it doesn t need a parameter-less default constructor it will only serialize what you explicitly mark with but that can be anything - a field a property and of any visibility private protected public it s a bit faster than xmlserializer but you don t get a lot of control over the shape of the xml - you only get a say in what s included see this blog post and this blog post for a few more tips and tricks

1344869
django	web.py
pylons is not that much simpler than django and it doesn t seem to have the same community
for lightweight apps i would recommend web.py

1344876
icmp	udp
instead you should just start receiving and the only way to tell that the remote socket may have dropped off is if you get a 0 byte packet or you get an icmp response from it
since you are using udp you cannot connect to the remote target

1345027
put	get
in response to the comment that you want to still load the rest of site-start i d try the following talk to whomever administers your system to get them to fix site-start the library name is stored in the variable site-run-file to not load that stuff but instead to put that kind of stuff in default which is loaded after the user s .emacs while waiting for #1 to resolve if it ever does invoke emacs like so emacs -q --no-site-file -l hack.el where hack.el contains something like
some changes to load-path to put your stuff in front of the load-path if site-run-file load site-run-file t t

1345200
nsurlcache	uiwebview
mad bad and dangerous to know the above email can be found at with no further replies further proof that nsurlcache can work is found in icab blog url filtering for uiwebview on the iphone aug 18 2009 anyone here probably should also look to apple s urlcache sample app as it may be relevant to their work except having just looked at it now it says this application does not use a nsurlcache disk or memory cache so our cache policy is to satisfy the request by loading the data from its source. and uses cachepolicy nsurlrequestreloadignoringlocalcachedata
so this is less relevant than i thought and why this person was calling nsurlcache a joke

1345988
post	get
it is not possible to redirect using post parameters which don t go in the url - this is a restriction of http not django
get parameters always go in the url that s what makes them get parameters

1346442
next	except
an intermediate milestone might include that feature before next year though
i am not sure it is currently available except for a custom xml script which would build a custom war to deploy

1346835
fileoutputstream	filewriter
in sun java 6 you can just use fileoutputstream
it will automatically create a new file if the file doesn t exist or overwrite an existing file if it exists note for writing text files what is what you seem to want to do use a writer for example filewriter instead of using an outputstream directly

1347215
jobs	cron
it could check some config file or database each time it runs for actual jobs that you queued
i would suggest that you do not add or delete cron jobs using php

1347215
jobs	cron
i would suggest that you do not add or delete cron jobs using php
you should write a fixed cron job instead that would be configured using php instead

1348099
accessor	properties
create accessor properties that return your now private data where necessary and mark them obsolete your goal is to make the object the master of its data and only return results not the internal data
with the bankaccount object we no longer return the actual account data but we have properties for currentbalance and methods such as averagebalance int days to see the account

1348521
multibyte	htmlspecialchars
this means always using the mb_ styled multibyte aware string functions
it also means when calling functions such as htmlspecialchars that you include the appropriate utf-8 charset parameter at the end to make sure that it doesn t encode them incorrectly

1348658
maven	pom.xml
however it s worth pointing out that the maven super pom.xml configures central to have snapshots disabled so maven shouldn t ever check for updates for snapshots on central unless you ve overridden that in your own pom.xml settings
you can configure maven to use a mirror for the central repository this will redirect all requests that would normally go to central to your internal repository

1348757
hash	md5	hash	hmac
hmacmd5 doesn t compute a hash it computes a message authentication code
hmacmd5 is a type of keyed hash algorithm that is constructed from the md5 hash function and used as a hash-based message authentication code hmac

1348958
int	double
the range of double is much wider than the range of int or long
typically you know that the value will actually be within the range of int or long so you cast it but the onus for that cast is on the developer not on math.floor itself

1349279
int	chars
for that you can use htmlspecialchars your echo would then probably look like this i considered id is an int auto-incremented or something like that so not much of a risk edit after seeing the comment on another answer with what you first used data2 is an associative array that looks like this which means the foreach will loop three times and val will be one value for each iteration ie val is not an array is a scalar value
when you do that you get null when doing you get ie you only get the first chars when using array-access on a string with a key that is a string

1349505
inherited	properties
dependencyproperties can only be created on dependencyobjects and since application which your app class inherited from doesn t implement it you can t create a dependencyproperty directly on the app class
i assume you want this properties to support binding

1350017
extjs	mootools
however extjs uses a more traditional ui so if you want more fine control over ui or want something flashy or very unconventional then extjs is not the right choice
mootools and jquery are better for original design but require much more effort in getting the styling right

1350540
innodb	myisam
if innodb doesn t exist mysql will automatically substitute myisam unless you change the default sql_mode to avoid this substitution
innodb has been around since mysql 4.0 and compiled in to most releases except for some special ones - like what is given to oem vendors

1350641
realloc	malloc
if you allocate the initial buffer using malloc you can use realloc to resize the buffer
you shouldn t use realloc to resize a new -ed buffer

1351741
serializable	deserialization
for example if a i serializable an object over the wire perhaps i send it from a client to a server via rmi and then do it again in separate rmi calls then the 2 deserialized objects on the server will not be
however in a single serialization a single client-server message which is a graph containing the same object multiple times then upon deserialization identity is preserved

1351929
division	modulo
modulo is the remainder not division
the sign is often used for the modulo in lieu of the word mod

1352521
xrange	enumerate
if you measure properly you ll see there s essentially no difference enumerate is microscopically faster than xrange in this example but well within noise btw i always recommend using timeit at the shell prompt like this not within code or at the interpreter prompt as you re doing just because the output is so nicely formatted and usable with units of measure of time and everything
in your code you have an extra assignment in the enumerate case you assign the list item to v in the for header clause then again assign v to elem

1352540
postgresql	mysql
if this is sql server oracle or postgresql yes you can use a check constraint
if it s mysql check constraint s are recognized but not enforced

1352559
filesystems	fat
and even then you may be out of luck if enough revisions have been made or it s not a trivial filesystems like fat
to the best of my knowledge most file recovery tools actually read the low-level filesystems format on the disk and try to piece together deleted files

1353076
integer	fractions
double- int here cast is taking the binary representation of 3.5 and putting it into integer representation
because integer doesn t have fractions it is dropped and also allowed

1353076
integer	fractions
because integer doesn t have fractions it is dropped and also allowed
casting a string to an integer in this way is not so simple and not allowed by the compiler

1353225
ironruby	ironpython
have not tried ironruby but i ll assume it can work in a roughly equivalent way and speed
ironpython ironruby ironpython in action will do a better job explaining this and exactly how best to use ironpython that can possibly be accommodated in a so answer

1353419
merb	ruby-on-rails
my feeling is that conventions helps you in merb but you won t get too much penalty for not following them in merb
however my experience with ruby-on-rails is that if you decide not to follow ruby-on-rails convention while developing ruby-on-rails app it will come back to bite you in one way or another

1354468
post	get
as fredrik s post shows even in languages that support overloading of which as3 is not one you often can t do both at the same time
the interface forces you to have a function with the exact signature clone isolvablegame and you cannot overload it with an additional clone mygame if you are looking for type-safety you can t get it at compile time but you will be able to get it at run time if you check the return type at the caller

1354790
jdom	xerces
by the way jdom is not an xml parser - it will use the parser provided to it by jaxp in order to provide you with an easier abstraction to work with
the sun java runtime comes with the xerces and xalan implementations that provide the ability to parse xml via the dom and sax intefaces and also perform xsl transformations and execute xpath queries

1355105
firefox	safari
parts of html 5 are supported by safari firefox and opera but they are not necessarily incorporating the same parts
it seems that firefox is the most ahead from my experience but it will be years before the majority of browsers users use will support it

1355214
profiling	instrumentation
that s obviously a more complication solution and i m not sure it ll work without compile-time support so hopefully the profiling tool is feasible for your situation
or is it sufficient to instrumentation the application running in a test environment

1355304
margin	height
document.body.scrollheight may not match the height of the document in a few cases if the body of the document in the iframe has a margin as body does by default
set margin and padding on body to 0

1355470
serializable	deserialization
well if you cannot change the way the instance is handled change the way it serializable
implement system.runtime.serialization.iserializable and just set the initial state in the deserialization constructor required when implementing the interface

1357115
inherited	subclassing
all methods are virtual in java and you cannot specify which in the inherited hierarchy you want to execute
the only exception is that subclassing can call their parent s methods even if they themselves override it

1358144
profiling	instrumentation
the best approach is to unsign the assembly for the profiling run
the reason you can not instrumentation a signed assembly is that the instrumentation process changes the contents of the assembly

1358945
mvp	presenter
in both mvp and mvc the view is supposed to be as dumb as possible and really should not be responsible for processing anything...commands actions input etc
should all be the responsibility of the controller or presenter

1359039
button	checkbox
if you re checking to see if a checkbox radio button is checked use second your code has a major logic bug
only one radio button can be checked at any given time but your code goes through and checks every radio button that isn t already checked

1359213
int	chars
evidently class string does not have a constructor that takes an int as an argument but it s assignment operator is ok with it
and the reason you get a smiley face is that it is the chars with the ascii value of 1

1359270
innodb	myisam
however innodb tends to be slower as myisam
that said with innodb you wouldn t need to re-order the table but you would lose the blazing speed of myisam

1359848
public	protected
public mustinherit class baseclass protected mustoverride sub methoda protected mustoverride sub methodb ...stuff protected mustinherit class pdfoperations protected mustoverride sub method1 protected mustoverride sub method2 etc. end class protected mustoverride readonly properties pdf end class simply making the nested class abstract isn t enough to require that the inherited class actually implement them as you don t actually reference that class anywhere
.net nested classes are similar to nested static classes in java in that they have no reference to a specific instance of the containing class they re simply grouped for lack of a better term by the outer class and have access to the private protected and internal members of the containing class

1360264
hash	salt
there are some online databases that let you reverse the hash of common words conbinations of words
however django adds salt to the password before it computes the hash so you cannot reverse django passwords

1360264
hash	salt
however django adds salt to the password before it computes the hash so you cannot reverse django passwords
that s why a hash is used

1360658
serializable	deserialization
you would just serializable the elements in the hashset but not the keys
deserialization restoring an object from a serial representation and ensuring the invariants of the object

1362499
profiling	debugging
don t profiling or otherwise judge performance in the debugging configuration
the debugging configuration isn t intended to be fast and you may make performance conclusions which are wrong like the idea that partial views user controls are slow

1362894
hide	show
if this is your partial xml file now then you can hide the control by changing it to this isn t much use as it is hardcoded
to get closer to what you are looking for change the xml to and then in the same way you have done the mybuttononaction callback you create the mybuttongetvisible callback which happens to have this signature c# bool mybuttongetvisible iribboncontrol control with this method you can then return true or false depending on whether you want to show hide the button

1363071
inline	inlining
but there are some counter example to it in java defining getter setter instead of defining public member variables does not result in performance degradation as the jit inline the getter setter
sometimes calling a function repetedly may be better than performing inlining as the code executed may then fit in the cache

1363119
nsmutablestring	nsdata	nsmutablestring	nsstring	nsstring	nsdata
since nsmutablestring is a subclass of nsstring you may have been given a mutable string at assignment so other code may modify the string s value without your knowledge unless you are using key-value observing to observe those changes
for this reason it is usually appropriate to use copy semantics for properties that you intend to hold an immutable value nsstring nsdata nsarray nsset are the common--though not exaustive--suspects

1363524
vb.net	vb6
it also makes other changes and additions to the language but contrasting vb.net with vb is not possible because they are the same thing
what you can do is contrast with vb.net with vba or vb6 or vbscript or some other variant of visual basic

1363582
gridview	repeater
see scott mitchell s why i don t use datasets in my asp.net applications for some details about datareader performance - as long as you aren t optimizing prematurely it s quite good advice. instead of using a gridview i d use a repeater which has less overhead and lets you write more compact html for a smaller payload to the client bind the master idatareader to that repeater
i m not sure whether you meant the gridview control or just a conceptual grid - the basic architecture would be the same for a gridview then add a handler to the repeater.itemdatabound that checks if the child data reader s current record matches

1363831
nunit	mstest
they use nunit for that project i believe
even microsoft s open source code prism composite wpf doesn t use mstest

1363832
nunit	mstest
integrating nunit with vs08 doesn t seem to the biggest problem on the other hand getting vs with built in testing framework might be a bit harder at least for some people
personally i m using vs ts so no test units in mstest wouldn t turn anything off for me

1363915
hash	salt
then an attacker cannot use a rainbow table because every password is essentially hash slightly differently
he would have to create a separate rainbow table for every single distinct salt practically for each account which would be prohibitively computationally expensive

1363949
folder	directory
to do this create a folder in the same directory as your script called whatever you like populate it with at least one image so that the following if doesn t unset the entire array and see if that works
if it does then you re stuck with finding the relative path to your folder

1364161
ssl	https
the server will need to support ssl for that if you re using apache make sure you have mod_ssl
make sure to use https not http if you want a secure connection

1364182
post	get
you re not going to be able to redirect the client with a post payload
either of the two options above would help you get the job done

1364203
next	except
almost all had the concept of a particular storage location typically a register which indicated the next instruction to execute
alteration of this value from the basic add one to the last value providing the primary means for the computer to be general purpose in this way the instruction pointer or ip as this special location came to be known represents something similar to the location of the head in the turing machine except it repesents the instructions not the data

1364292
put	get
tear down the code and put up much better stuff
in this case there isn t a good little way to do the change or there are lots of little changes that want to get bundled up into a mini-project where digesting all the code is needed and this isn t a quick minor change

1364705
for-loop	arrays
that s not quite how the for-loop works
an easier more accurate and more reliable way to tackle this is to use the traditional for syntax like so the for syntax you were using will work but it s still iterating over indices not values and even then it s not limited to just the integer indices in the arrays it could also include other properties defined on the arrays prototype or even on the particular arrays object

1364883
put	get
considering that key has to be included in the tags of your html pages to load the js files data from google s servers there is nothing you can do you must put it in your html files every one can take a look at those
still it doesn t really matter if anyone tries to use this key on another domain than yours they will get a javascript alert -- which is not nice for ther users

1364891
inherited	properties
basically the core protocol buffers wire spec doesn t handle inherited so protobuf-net achieves it by modelling inherited as encapsulation
you assign tags on properties fields with and sub-types via compare to

1365122
implements	extends
i m not sure whether this is especially pythonic but you could use operator overloading this is of course far more expensive to implements than your example and i would be wary of too much meta-programming but it was a fun exercise
you can extends or use this as you see fit

1365736
inherited	subclassing
it isn t that much of a hassle and you have direct control over the inherited logistics. of course this is not getting around the problem of not having multiple inherited but just modeling your world slightly different in such a way that you don t need multiple inheritance. protocols address the absence of multiple inherited mi to some extent technically protocols are equivalent to mi for purely abstract classes see the answer on protocols below
delegation is extending a class functionality in a way anticipated by the designer of that class without the need for subclassing

1366419
uitabbarcontroller	uiwindow
uitabbarcontroller expects to have its view added as a subviews of uiwindow not as a subviews of some other uiview
the frame property defines the offset of the view within its superview so the uitabbarcontroller implementation offsets its view s frame by 20 pixels by default to leave room for the status bar

1367360
postgresql	mysql
but i m using postgresql
i d love to use spatial data types for another project but i m going to have to do a hack or change databases to deal with mysql s insistance that they be not null

1367563
ienumerable	ilist
if ienumerable has everything you need then you could be even more generic and use that instead
if you use the second form you ll be able to call methods on mylist that are part of the list class but not part of the ilist interface without a cast

1369193
jms	jta
similar to servlet-api and jms the individual implementers provide their own copies of the api and providing the sun jar can muck them up
i believe that you should not be specifying the jta jar as a runtime requirement but rather as a provided requirement

1370014
nhibernate	automapper
personally i d call yagni on this one if you really anticipate needing support for multiple databases linq to sql might not be the best solution to start with in any case simply to keep your infrastructure consistent across the application tools like nhibernate would have far better support for such situations
moving on to adding a custom account class mapping code can be taken care of by tools like automapper though this might mean you give up things like lazy loading which may or may not be a big deal to you

1370305
inherited	subclassing
what you might be able to do is inherited from the classes
if the attributes in question are not inheritable you can add your own to your subclassing to override them

1370561
ubuntu	linux
the reason why it can happen is that ubuntu system you re compiling at is newer and forward compatibility is not preserved in linux libraries
you may install on your ubuntu box the compiler that fits the version of the library on your server

1370663
spaces	linefeed
the error that you get header may not contain... is only triggered if the string you pass as an argument to header contains a linefeed character that is not followed by either a spaces or a tab which would continue the header on the next line
now setcookie will actually urlencode its value setrawcookie will not so a linefeed will not cause an error there

1370742
debian	linux	ubuntu	linux
debian and ubuntu use .deb redhat and fedora use .rpm etc
there are tools for making application bundles for linux but they re not used often

1371286
post	get
in the create with post attribute employee since the viewdata positions is not set you are getting this error
this value should form part of your post request and on rebinding after post should fetch it from store or get it from session cache if you need to rebind this

1371286
post	get
this value should form part of your post request and on rebinding after post should fetch it from store or get it from session cache if you need to rebind this
remember viewdata is only available for the current request so for post request viewdata positions is not yet created and hence this exception

1371692
implements	extends
i am working with java the hole day and my colleagues and i are using interface idialog abstract abstractdialog class defaultdialog warningdialog abstract classes implements most common interface methods or most used util methods
you do not have to extends from the abstract class

1373404
for-loop	arrays
don t forget to compare a properly optimized for-loop if you really care about performance
some variant of duff s device if the arrays is sufficiently long and prefix --i not suffix i-- although most compilers will probably correct that automatically.

1373852
postgresql	mysql
i have used both and even migrated projects from mysql to postgresql and in my experience postgresql was the better choice
for my applications it was at least on par speed wise with mysql and offered needed features not found in mysql

1374180
cpu	processors
computers seem to be able to do lots of things simultaneously because the cpu can process these instructions very quickly - millions billions instructions per second
of course multi-core processors complicate things but let s not go there.

1374768
calloc	malloc
it s probably because the return value of calloc was null
the amount of physical ram in your box does not directly correlate to how much memory you can allocate with calloc malloc realloc

1374893
next	except
assuming for example that you want possibly-overlapping matches starting at distinct spots in the string which then would give two matches for the example in the previous paragraph note that you do have to compile the pattern into a re object in this case function re.search does not accept a start argument starting position for the search the way method search does so you d have to be slicing thestring as you go -- definitely more effort than just having the next search start at the next possible distinct starting point which is what i m doing in this function
the existing solutions based on findall are fine for non-overlapping matches and no doubt optimal except maybe for huge number of matches although alternatives such as sum 1 for m in re.finditer thepattern thestring to avoid ever materializing the list when all you care about is the count are also quite possible

1375061
distance	altitude
as usual with gps the difference in distance calculations that altitude would make is probably smaller than the error in most commercial gps devices anyway so in most applications altitude can be safely dispensed with altitude measurements themselves are pretty inaccurate with commercial gps devices although survey data on altitudes is quite accurate
if the distance formula you re using does not take the altitude of the two points as parameters in addition to the latitudes and longitudes of the two points then it does not factor in altitude to the distance calculation

1375061
distance	altitude
if the distance formula you re using does not take the altitude of the two points as parameters in addition to the latitudes and longitudes of the two points then it does not factor in altitude to the distance calculation
in any event altitude difference does not have a very significant effect on calculated distance

1376116
put	get
but seriously put some hosting up there and hit it hard
you will see that the response times are nice app deployment is easy but you do not get full control so you have to use medium-trust security and other stuff and you get 1 500 gb of monthly transfer and 150 gb of disk space

1376375
post	get
post requests are requests that you do not want to accidentally happen
get requests are requests you are ok with happening by a user pointing a browser to via a url

1376454
awt	swing
but if the component falls out side the bounds it is automatically substituted with a awt heavy weight component that has it s own native drawing surface outside the active window
it s not possible with the custom renderer since swing components are light weight

1376972
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
i try to use sortedlist as much as possible because it allows me to iterate over the keys and value collections
this is not possible with sorteddictionary as far as i know

1377377
post	get
if not then either add the variables to be sent via post in .send or change the method to get and put your variables in the url
use the following to get the object correctly in ie as well as ff and use the function edit on second thoughts you may be getting the object correctly although you have not mentioned your getxmlhttpobject function - which is why i am leaving my above answer around

1378366
dictionary	map
but on the same python object you provide a property which will be kind-of proxy for this mapped string field of type dictionary . code example not tested
if you need to map a 1-n relation and map it as dictionary rather then list then read dictionary based collections but if you mean a field then what you can do it to have a db field of type string which is mapped to your python object

1378670
or-operator	and-operator
there is already an accepted answer but i like to mention that the or-operator is also called default-operator because it doesn t return a boolean but instead the left or right hand argument
same goes for the and-operator which is also called guard-operator

1379598
implements	extends
if you want to do it cleanly you d need to implements your own scrollpaneui and set that as the jscrollpane s ui with setui
unfortunately you can t just extends basicscrollpaneui and disable its mouse wheel listener because the relevant member variables are private and there aren t any flags or guards on the scrollpaneui s installation of its mousewheellistener

1379734
post	put
also note that if you re using django 1.1 you can use the new annotate method to simply calculate the post count if you re not actually planning to generate links to individual post
resist the urge to put everything on one line - i think the code would be cleaner with something like this the defaultdict part is simple but you might want to initialize it with all of the days in a month if you re just planning to use a for loop in the template

1380432
eigen	lapack
probably not as performant as eigen
lapack - benefits very stable proven algorithms

1380960
int	double
of course you can also encapsulate all the fixed-point boilerplate code in your own struct which uses int long under the hood
do not use float or double

1381201
padding	overlapping
most languages not sure about c# give you some way to read and write raw bytes so do all of the serializable deserialization memberwise instead of a singular memory block and the packing padding problems go away
you might want to consider not overlapping struct s onto memory buffers

1381299
put	get
you need to put it into the properties collection but this does not expose a nice collection interface to do that with
after some trial and error the correct syntax is i don t think it is important exactly what the page size is still playing with that but setting it to something is enough to tell adsi to get all the results

1381699
put	get
more basically this is what the funny hashref syntax does using perldoc -f use as a reference say we have this basic module put it in foo.pm in your current directory when we call the code is executed
so this is what we get as output basically this syntax lets us do magic with the exporter but in truth you can make import do anything you like just be sure to document heavily so as to not cause confusion

1381826
temporary	tablespace
global temporary tables in oracle are not like temporary tables in sql server
they are not cached in memory they are written to the temporary tablespace

1382323
width	height
unrelated to the bug setting the width of an anchor to define the width of the popup that it triggers does not seem like good practice to me
setting the css of an anchor that has nothing to do with the presentation of the anchor seems kind of backwards just set it in the javascript to look for a.popup.large and set a certain width height for the popup

1382330
unsigned	short
the following is instead correct the above is not relevant anymore the question has changed. edit bcc32 error unit1.cpp 830 e2357 reference initialized with unsigned short needs lvalue of type char the compiler is telling you that somefunc2 is expecting a reference that is an alias for a char
but key in somefunc1 is instead a word which i understand to be a typedef for unsigned short

1382596
factors	mean
this is possible w o any wait if you actually split the execution stack up to the for-loop you execute on the calling thread after the for-loop you finish on the last queue thread whether this will work or not depends on many factors and i can t say w o knowing more about the caller context if is possible to suspend its execution on the calling thread and resume it on a queued thread
btw by exit thread i do not mean an abrupt thread abort but a gracious return and the entire calling stack is prepared to hand over execution context to the queue thread

1382615
int	double
if you use int you should write it as
using the tickcount approach has better performance for several reasons it s an integer not a multi-byte data structure it s directly available not requiring the various computations performance-wise you shouldn t use the double type

1382615
int	double
using the tickcount approach has better performance for several reasons it s an int not a multi-byte data structure it s directly available not requiring the various computations performance-wise you shouldn t use the double type
to measure a span of 100 seconds an int should be sufficient

1383365
temp	tmp
c temp log1.py a debug message an info message a warning message an error message a critical message as you d expect since on a terminal sys.stdout and sys.stderr are the same
now let s redirect stdout to a file tmp c temp log1.py tmp a debug message a warning message an error message a critical message so the info message has not been printed to the terminal - but the messages directed to sys.stderr have been printed

1383721
dictionary	map
when a few extra microseconds per translation are no big deal one might want to consider the bu approach simply for its convenience only needs a translation dictionary for hopefully few special characters that don t translate correctly with the underlying unicodedata idea
so here are three approaches more or less as given or suggested in other answers run as main this emits or wikipédia le projet d encyclopédie ae wikipedia le projet d encyclopedie ud wikipedia le projet dencyclopedie tr wikipedia le projet d encyclopedie showing clearly that the unicodedata-based approach while it does have the convenience of not needing a translation map xtd can t translate all characters properly in an automated fashion it works for accented letters but not for the reverse-apostrophe so it would also need some auxiliary step to deal explicitly with those no doubt before what s now its body

1383908
folder	dir
your task - the way it s written right now - would only work with files but not folder
elements contain patterns which are generally relative to base dir

1384450
int	double
one appears to be an int literal the other a floating point literal
it really doesn t matter to the compiler whether you initialize floats or double with int literals

1384595
folder	directory
is a unix shortcut that means the currently logged-in user s home folder which is typically something like
you should be able to find that folder by executing cd mkdir -p .vim syntax cd .vim syntax the mkdir command creates the directory if it doesn t already exist

1384783
client-side	server-side
it s generally not a great idea to store large chunks of data in client-side cookies both for security and compatibility reasons
instead i would recommend using something like cgi session which will give you automatic session cookies and you can store the data in a table or file on the server-side

1385242
cobertura	emma
edit as recomended by unknown cobertura can be used to record statement execution counts emma open source but doesn t seem to actually record statement counts clover commercial coverage tool certainly does cobertura newer open source tool than emma and does record statement counts
i m pretty sure some of the various code coverage tools such as emma and clover record the number of times each statement is executed because it s displayed in the reports

1385549
int	double
not 1.5 because it s all int
not until the next part is the integer promoted to a double

1385617
mouseover	mousemove
so you might want to try using jquery s live event with mouseover and mouseout
i have my doubts that this would sidestep the problem but it s worth a shot if that doesn t work maybe you could use the mousemove event this should work as soon as the user moves their mouse instead of the user having to move their mouse compeltely off the image

1385686
boost	allocator
boost just says not to store objects which may throw exceptions
so if you allocate memory you just have to be able to handle the case where allocator fails

1386193
mako	genshi
oh and while not losing out any in a direct feature comparison evoque is in some cases actually faster than mako and it also runs on python 3
genshi is conceived read biased optimized for generation of xml docs even if it does offer support for generating any kind of text document

1386255
for-loop	arrays
you would need direct access to the pixel data for the cgimage the code is here then use a for-loop reading the pixel data into the arrays boolean values the method pixelisopaque above obviously doesn t exist just replace with whatever the sample code gives you to extract the pixel value
you are storing whether a pixel exists basically check if the pixel is opacity 0 once you have this grid generate it at the beginning of your program once and store the resultant 2d arrays inside the game object then you need a collision detection method

1386444
put	get
i would guess that your edit note about a successful attempt is actually just that you had manually hit prntscrn previously and that your clipboard still had it in there when you ran you program which put nothing in the clipboard but then read your manually taken screenshot out again
your approach to get a snapshot of the screen won t work - you have to use some pinvoke stuff which isn t that hard to piece together if you re patient

1386940
free	malloc
you might be able to get the busy distribution hooking into malloc free but the free distribution which essentially is the fragmentation seems up in the air
so why not add busy free statistics histograms to your custom memory manager

1387133
inherited	subclassing
it has its own model of prototypes which can be quite confusing but doesn t actually deliver the proper potential of prototype inherited because it s still tied to constructor-functions which look like class constructors but aren t really
unfortunately this isn t truly creating a subclassing

1387170
ncover	xunit.net
what is meant by the faq topic is that ncover does not support covering silverlight code v1 or v2 or v3 when using the iis argument because then it runs on its own clr
however the code-behind and supporting classes of a silverlight v1 or v2 or v3 application are valid c# vb so you can write unit tests against that portion of the app and run those tests with nunit mstest gallio xunit.net etc and you will get coverage of that portion

1387189
division	addition	addition	multiplication
then it processes operators first exponentiation then multiplication and division together and finally addition and subtraction together
because well-formed input is expected as specified in the challenge it doesn t check for the addition operator explicitly since it s the last legal operator after all the others are processed

1387326
getattr	setattr
and b you re in a class that doesn t use really deep dark soot-black magic apparently django s models superclass is breaking something absolutely fundamental such as dir setattr and or getattr -- though even with that hypothesis i just can t reproduce the specific symptoms somewhat-reported by the op
for n in dir self if getattr self n is none setattr self n i m using the normal is none idiom assuming there s no hypersubtle motivation for that weird alternative you re using but that s a separate issue

1388394
vsto	add-in
vsto does not create com add-in
you will need to install your add-in on non-development machines

1388956
put	get
populate directly this object using put method from the hashtable class
you cannot get this information as a properties object is not necessarily linked to a file.

1389274
post	get
he post the form not knowing of its evil and wily intentions unsuspectinguser is now on victim.net and bam
the js injected by the ftp server is executed and unsuspectinguser s cookie for victim.net get s sent to evil.com profit

1389523
folder	directory
also remember you can have folder within the solution explorer that are not part of the file system
given how costly in time it is in some source code control systems to move files between directory i would consider starting of just using msdev folder until you are clear on the structure you want

1390061
division	subtract
the division in your example is probably a bad idea because it changes the scale of the output variable depending on which side is better
generally when comparing two quantities you either want interval data subtract one from the other or ratio data divide one by the other but not both

1390422
int	chars
it s actually a pointer to someclass not an int so you should at least cast the pointer to int the offset is another thing to watch out for because it s always in units of the type the pointer points to
in short when int is 4 bytes long adding 1 to a pointer will actually add 4 to it so it s better to cast any pointer to chars before doing calculations

1390511
children	parent
it turns out with the help of microsoft that sqlmetal generates different output than the ide s mslinqtosqlgenerator because the dbml file generated by a tool i created had some relationships defined where the parent could access the children but the children did not define the parent association
apparently you are required to define the association from the child to the parent the foreign key relationship

1390519
inherited	properties
indeed you can t because application doesn t inherited from dependencyobject
however it s not necessary only the target properties of a binding needs to be a dependency properties

1391801
bindparam	bindvalue
i m just learning pdo but i think you need to use bindvalue not bindparam bindparam takes a variable to reference and doesn t pull in a value at the time of calling bindparam
i found this in a comment on the php docs bindvalue param null pdo param_int

1391953
ant	maven
it wasn t too long ago that it took hours get the average oss java ant based project to compile having to set a ton of variables downloading dependent projects etc
you can do anything with maven you can do with ant but where ant doesn t encourage any standards maven strongly suggests you to follow it s structure or it ll be more work

1393210
put	get
is not a subtype of as you might expect for reasons mentioned in the other answers. however you can define your method like this which will allow you to get strings from the list but not to put anything in
you could pass a or theoretically a list of any subtype of string into the method. you can also define it as which will allow you to put strings in the list but only read objects from it

1394287
return-value-optimization	nrvo
standard allows but doesn t require implementation of nrvo as well as return-value-optimization but some compilers supports it
you could read more about return-value-optimization in item 20 of scott meyers book more effective c++

1394651
interpreted-language	compiled-language
to quote the interpreted-language wiki article theoretically any language may be compiled or interpreted so this designation is applied purely because of common implementation practice and not some underlying property of a language. there s a decent wiki article on just the typing
maybe it s because one of my main interpreted-language is perl and one of my compiled-language is objective-c but i never strongly felt that there was anything special about compilation vs interpretation that suggested dynamic over static typing

1395663
hash	salt
honestly there s no defensible reason not to have the salt be the same exact length as the hash password
if you re using sha-256 then you have a 256-bit hash

1395663
hash	salt
if you re using sha-256 then you have a 256-bit hash
there s no reason not to use a 256-bit salt

1395708
vb6	vba
...and scroll down to the end miscellaneous i18n resources on this site. much of that information is out of date for .net and other programming but it s still going to apply to vb6 access vba
here s an article that suggests a number of directions you might go in using unicode in visual basic 6 access s vba is an superset of vb6 then you ll probably want to muck around with these access vba functions strconv ascb chrb that doesn t resolve all of it but that should give you a starting point

1396178
integer	unsigned
do not have the proper signature of the calling function ie i left out an integer parameter the return types don t match etc
am not marshalling the types properly ie bool is marshalled as a bool while bool is marshalled as a unsigned single byte integer etc -- while this last one may not cause the exception it can cause decidedly funky behavior

1397266
pull	push
in version 1.6.4 git gained the ability to have a remote pull from one url and push to another using the remote.name.pushurl config setting
i can imagine weird behavior if the push-repository doesn t track the pull-repository but i suspect git will just try to fast-forward the push-repository from the current tracking matching branch es without regard for what it will pull when it asks the remote of the same name

1398089
maven	pom.xml
this feels really odd to me and if it s feature i think it is a really dangerous one. anyway it s not a maven bug and it s in the maven documentation here
regarding best practices on this issue i haven t heard of any but the safest way to proceed ought to be to entirely remove xstream from your pom.xml relying on the transitive dependency

1398659
cpu	processors	cpu	affinity
bin bash while true do ps sleep 2 done start this running . proctest | grep bash in another terminal start top - make sure it s sorting by cpu let it settle for several seconds then quit issue the command ps u start top -p with a list of the pids of the highest several processes say 8 of them from the list left on-screen by the exited top plus the ones for proctest and grep which were listed by ps - all separated by commas like so the order doesn t matter top -p 1234 1255 1211 1212 1270 1275 1261 1250 16521 16522 add the processors field - press f then j then space set the sort to pid - press shift + f then a then space optional press shift + h to turn on thread view optional press d and type .09 and press enter to set a short delay time now watch as processes move from processors to processors you should see proctest and grep bounce around sometimes on the same processors sometimes on different ones
give this a try to set the cpu processors affinity taskset -c 0 dostuff | taskset -c 1 filterstuff edit try this experiment create a file called proctest and chmod +x proctest with this as the contents #

1399006
innodb	myisam
usually this is avoided by not using noddy myisam and going to innodb instead which has row-level locking amongst other desirable database features
the problem of course is that you only get fulltext search with myisam

1399006
innodb	myisam
personally i now tend to store everything in the innodb table including the text and store a second copy of the text in the myisam table purely for fulltext searchbait purposes
this simplifies queries and code and brings the advantages of innodb s consistency to the text content and i also use it to process the searchbait to get stemming and other features mysql s fulltext doesn t normally support

1399071
copying	overwrite
consider using array of cars not array of pointers on cars and copying the whole item
problem is here you re taking pointer at object on stack so it is deleted overwrite every time so the pointers can be the same

1399211
implements	extends
class b extends a implements runnable is valid java syntax but doesn t really do anything
by extends a b is runnable

1399422
robocopy	xcopy
i couldn t work out how to use the built-in msbuild copy command because everything to do with msbuild is designed to maximally painful so i used robocopy instead
robocopy is the replacement of xcopy

1399957
cpu	hyperthreading
assuming that your threads would lock instead of busy-wait then having 100 cpu for several threads is a sign that locking isn t a problem
conversely something that looks like 50 total cpu utilitization on a dual-processor machine is a sign that only one thread is running and so maybe your locking is a problem that s preventing more than one concurrent thread when counting the number of cpus in your machine beware multi-core and hyperthreading

1400372
iasyncresult	idisposable
but the problem with this example is that the iasyncresult itself does not adhere to microsoft s own published guidelines for dealing with idisposable objects
that is if a class holds a reference to an idisposable type then the class itself should implement idisposable

1400676
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome does not allow you to use key-events at all
firefox is the most benign but still sketchy--like internet explorer

1400682
cos	inverse
cos -1 means the inverse function of cos
it does not mean cos raised to the power -1

1400682
cos	sin
it does not mean cos raised to the power -1
similar thing with sin more info asin and acos return the angle in radians you have to convert it to degrees

1401257
free	realloc
in contrast malloc and free together can only allocate a new one and you have to do your own copying
to be frank realloc doesn t get as much use these days because it doesn t work well with c++

1401747
centos	linux
centos 5 isn t listed in the operating systems and software provided by amazon but according to this thread centos 5 is very close to rhel centos 5 is 99.9 red hat enterprise linux 5
with exception to the yum update process used within centos the only difference between the two is the name

1402154
post	get
as ecyrb had suggested in a previous post the bindinglist does not sort
i did use the suggested site to get my list to sort

1403134
cpython	ironpython
2 the libraries in ironpython are very different than cpython
the python libraries are a fair bit behind - quite a few of the cpython-accessible libraries will not work currently under ironpython

1403134
cpython	ironpython
however ironpython has clean direct access to the entire .net framework which means that it has one of the most extensive libraries natively accessible to it so in many ways it s far ahead of cpython
some of the numpy scipy libraries do not work in ironpython but due to the .net implementation some of the functionality is not necessary since the perf

1403265
rsa	3des
is freeeware and with sorce code unfortunately does not implement rsa
hi bruce i use this library since delphi 5 delphi encryption compedium part i v.5.2 complete rewrite of the former dec 3 update to the dec 5.1 released back in 2006 many ciphers blowfish twofish 3des rijndael ... many hashs md2 4 5 sha1-512 ripemd128-320... checksum functions crc32 crc16... text conversion functions mime base 64 xx uu coding... secure random number functions with ciphers encryption in modes cts cbc cfb ofb ecb... full and easy object oriented highly optimized fast core supports ansi and unicode in d2009 and below by using widestrings .

1403346
cpython	ironpython
scipy is huge and sprawling and chock full of c-coded and fortran-coded extensions i have no first-hand experience but i suspect less than half will even run much less run flawlessly under any implementation except cpython
ironpython should make it easier via .net approaches but cpython is not that far via com implementation in win32all

1403346
cpython	ironpython
ironpython should make it easier via .net approaches but cpython is not that far via com implementation in win32all
last but not least by all means check out the book ironpython in action -- as i say every time i recommend it i m biased by having been a tech reviewer for it and by friendship with one author but i think it s objectively the best intro to python for .net developers and at the same time the best intro to .net for pythonistas

1403598
delphi	oxygene
given the comments the answer probably is there is not yet structural syntax highlighting for delphi prism - you might also want to contact the people at devexpress or hook the people at devexpress up with the people at remobjects
remobjects is the company that developed the whole delphi prism language and visual studio ide integration that product is called oxygene

1403808
put	get
to start with i would put some logging around your system.loadlibrary call to see if that executes properly
if it throws an exception or is not in a code path that is actually executed then you will always get the latter type of unsatisfiedlinkerror explained above

1404292
java.util.date	jsr310
unlike the java.util.date calendar apis it doesn t suffer from threading issues unlike java.text.simpledateformat etc
i ve seen numerous client issues relating to not realising that the standard date time formatting is not thread-safe it s the basis of the new java date time apis jsr310 scheduled for java 8

1405250
int	boolean
i d rather use the former approach each row in user is a dsitinct poster with an non-nullable unique email address and a surrogate key as foreign key in posts create table user id int primary key email text not null unique is_registered boolean default false
create table post id int primary key user_id int not null references user id content text

1405882
3des	aes
3des md5 sha-1 are already considered not enough
attacks against aes have been recently published

1406757
accessor	properties
the easiest way to get similar functionality is to create a dictionary object and either publicly expose it or create an accessor
where the vb code accesses this properties like class.sometext somekey your c# code will become unfortunately this still isn t quite the same since the collection accessor won t be able to see the index value

1407082
post	get
a 501 response means not implemented and is usually taken to mean that the server didn t understand the http method that you used get post etc
i don t recognise clienthttprequest but you have a line that says connection.setrequestmethod get

1407561
getter	setter
or decide that getid will return a default value if null and add a null check in the getter as you said
if class1 may have a null id but class2 may not you should have class1 s getters and setter use an integer type instead of an int primitive and you should create a dozer customconverter that returns a default value when the source field is null

1408212
filtering	grouping
so all we need to do is filtering out the other stuff
the other stuff is grouping of rows having a count that is not equal to the count of the desired subjects

1409348
hash	hmac
this for example allows you to use a secure hash function not md5 truncate the result as described and still get secure tokens
assuming that this is used for authentication i d use hmac

1409721
mstest	typemock
mstest isn t doing this
if you need to perform integration tests distinct from unit tests against the sharepoint api you could use typemock isolator for sharepoint

1410736
tabcontrol	tabitem
it will behave this way if you use the mvvm or presentationmodel pattern and load viewmodels as the items for your tabcontrol and use datatemplates for the views
if you just put tabitem into the tabcontrol with controls inside of them it will not behave this way however

1410737
postgresql	mysql
edit there is another option of embedding r inside postgresql using joe conway s pl r
just for completeness you have two more options rodbc which is very mature and feature-complete but doesn t correspond to the dbi framework as the postgresql mysql sqlite oracle .

1411112
stdout	fflush
if you re in control of the program that s doing the writing you can as another answer suggested fflush stdout continuously or more elegantly if feasible try to force stdout to be unbuffered by running python with the -u commandline flag what the man page adds is a mention of stdin and issues with binary mode s
if you can t or don t want to touch the program that s writing -u or the like on the program that s just reading is unlikely to help the buffering that matters most is the one happening on the writer s stdout not the one on the reader s stdin

1411688
folder	directory
any bin directory in nested folder are not treated as actual bin directory
so if you built this as a different project and just copied it into the original folder your structure would look like this parent parent bin parent yournewapp parent yournewapp bin i m thinking that the ellogph._default class is in a dll inside of parent yournewapp bin

1412500
equals	tostring
when designing a complex object for which i need to write an equals method and therefore a hashcode method i tend to write a string renderer and use the string class equals and hashcode methods
the renderer of course is not tostring it doesn t really have to be easy for humans to read and includes all and only the values i need to compare and by habit i put them in the order which controls the way i d want them to sort

1412628
invalidoperationexception	notsupportedexception
a type argument is a defining characteristic for the actual method you want to call not a real argument. invalidoperationexception should be thrown when the operation you re performing can be valid in some cases but for the particular situation it s unacceptable
notsupportedexception is thrown when an operation is inherently unsupported

1412669
invalidoperationexception	notsupportedexception
it doesn t fit here shameless self reference i think invalidoperationexception is the most appropriate exception you could throw here
i would avoid notsupportedexception

1412936
boost	stl
i work on the parallel pattern library so i m using critical_section from vs2010 beta boost mutex works great too and the raii pattern of using a lock_guard is almost necessary regardless of how you choose to do this
there isn t one that i know of the closest is in thread building blocks which has concurrent_unordered_map the stl containers allow concurrent read access from multiple threads as long as you don t aren t doing concurrent modification

1413011
post	get
the problem with the post approach is that you are not saving anything by your actions and so you are expressing your intentions better with a get request
just to describe a potential reason why this is occurring you are probably issuing get ajax requests but you are not differentiating the url in any way no extra data in the query string for example

1413663
processors	hyperthreading
with hyperthreading multiple os scheduled threads can be running on the same physical processors sharing the processors resources
spinwait indicates to the processors that you are not doing any useful work and that it should run code from a different logical cpu

1413738
children	parent
normally this wouldn t matter since the parent would usually become large enough to contain all of the children so they would show through the parent s background
but since you re using float on all children the actual size of #content is not actually the size of the child divs combined

1413738
children	parent
but since you re using float on all children the actual size of #content is not actually the size of the child divs combined
floating content can exist outside the bounds of its parent

1413884
richtextbox	textblock
if you need text highlighting formatting then maybe you want to use richtextbox
if you do not expect much more than ten-thousands of search results in your application a textblock control or readonly multiline textbox will suffice by far

1414531
migrate	upgrade
or migrate to any one of foss scms like subversion but the transition will probably be harder but may be cheaper
vss sucks migrate to a real scm microsoft will probably help you seamlessly upgrade to tfs which doesn t have this problem

1414967
post	get
first of all you shouldn t use links get requests to trigger actions that edit or delete data you should use post requests
you can still use a link to delete data by creating one via javascript and using their click-event to make an ajax post request

1415014
pascal	delphi
to squeeze that last 1 you might even have to maintain several versions optimized per processor and if newer processors and an improved pascal compiler comes along you re not going to benefit from it
this delphi code is faster than your fastest assembler code it s fast because the operations can be done with registers only instead of needing to store and fetch memory

1415502
post	get
for other readers who might wonder why someone wants to do this it s to prevent the user from submitting their post data more than once by using the reload function of their web browser which users with rotten communications problems often do to reload the thank you page that may not have loaded completely
hint when you redirect in this manner if you re not using cookies to ensure information gets to your thank you page then you ll need to add one or more parameters to your request in the same way a regular get form will

1415678
.htaccess	httpd.conf
assuming this goes in your local .htaccess
if that goes in your httpd.conf i believe it s a minor change to but i m not 100 sure about this because i rarely do it this way

1415780
int	chars
bit 32 is the lsb of int 1 ... then that s the same in little endian as bit 0 is the lsb of chars 0 .
bit 32 is the lsb of chars 4 ... in which case you can just cast a pointer to the int array to a pointer to chars array 3 supposing the native order of bytes in your bit set vector isn t exactly what the library needs then you have to either have to create your own that has the layout they want or transcribe a copy into their layout

1416064
hash	salt
the point is since salt is different for each user you cannot use a prebuilt dictionary of hash to map the hash passwords to clear text rainbow attack
salt is randomly generated for each user but it s saved somewhere in the database

1416090
mef	prism
we currently ship mef for .net 3.5 on codeplex
as far as prism with mef the challenge at this point is you need to write a bunch of code as prism does not yet have implementations of the services necessary to talk to mef one option is to use the mef unity integration layer we have in mef contrib mefcontrib.codeplex.com

mef	prism
as far as prism with mef the challenge at this point is you need to write a bunch of code as prism does not yet have implementations of the services necessary to talk to mef one option is to use the mef unity integration layer we have in mef contrib mefcontrib.codeplex.com
it enables unity and mef to talk back to one another thus you can using the existing prism source with mef through the unity bridge

1416097
hash	salt
since the salt is some private string only you possess knowing the hash of a salt password will not help an attacker who has a run of the mill rainbow table
a clever attacker can try to build a custom rainbow table just for your service by creating an account and changing his password to observe what the resulting hash is

1416133
folder	directory
you can change the folder where assembly is loaded from by using appdomainsetup.privatebinpath property
my guess is that it cannot find assembly because it s not in the same folder and not in the gac or other directory where the system is looking for

1416133
folder	directory
my guess is that it cannot find assembly because it s not in the same folder and not in the gac or other directory where the system is looking for
you need either move them in the same folder where an executing assembly

1416197
uiview	calayer
calayer will let it s delegate the uiview draw into a cgcontextref
it is one context per uiview so you can not use cgblendmode to blend several views since it will only function within one single uiview context

1416197
uiview	calayer
it is one context per uiview so you can not use cgblendmode to blend several views since it will only function within one single uiview context
blending of calayer should be done using the filter properties

1416610
postgresql	mysql
generically you can do it by using a case statement with a sum select voteable_id sum case when vote then 1 else -1 end as vote_score from votes group by voteable_id note that this is ansi sql so will work across sqlite mysql postgresql oracle sql server db2 etc. etc
to get your top n posts you would simply append to the above query order by vote_score desc limit 10 limit is used by postgresql and sqlite a bit differently in mysql and not in oracle or sql server as an fyi

1416636
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
you should convert it to number for example using the unary plus operator you could alternatively use also you are using a for..in loops to iterate over orders if orders is an arrays you should use a normal for-loop that is because the for...in statement is intended to be used for iterate over object properties for arrays it may be tempting to use it because seems to work but it s not recommended since it will iterate over the object properties and if you have extended the array.prototype those properties will be also iterated in addition to the numeric indexes
another reason to avoid it is because the order of iteration used by this statement is arbitrary and iterating over an arrays may not visit elements in numeric order and also it seems to be much more slower than a simple for-loop

1416700
hex	binary
you can open the file in a hex editor which is a text editor that is more sensitive to binary data
i am not very familiar with mac software but a free hex editor can be downloaded at

1416726
octal	binary
in hexadecimal octal as characters etcetera
edit to elaborate on binary data can mean absolutely anything a binary bit pattern that that is output by say a compiler cannot be distinguished from the identical binary bit pattern output by say some random user-defined application

1417331
unsigned	short
in the expression the unsigned long types aren t promoted because they have a higher rank than int unsigned int so the expression is evaluated using unsigned arithmetic with the underflow from the subtraction and the s2-1 subexpression evaluates to a very large number not negative 1
as litb indicated in a comment if the platform had int implemented as a 16-bit type which is permitted - ms-dos for example the promotion of unsigned short would be to unsigned int instead of int since an int wouldn t be able to represent all values of unsigned short unsigned short must be at least 16-bits

1417633
xfs	btrfs
xfs does not always do so which can result in much better performance for applications which use short-lived temporary files if you have enough ram
i suspect that the modern linux filesystems ext4 btrfs do this too

1417797
post	get
you could edit a user by using curl to manually type out all the parameters you wanted to change and make a post to users 1 but as a human it s a lot easier if you can just use a form
to look at your examples above then get users create might make sense and is pretty similar to get users new which is the default but post users create would roughly translate to make a new one of users create which doesn t quite make sense

1418244
put	get
in some cases those may be somewhat obvious from the start but in other cases they emerge incrementally as i m considering some major refactoring as follows typical scenario ... the early stages of the refactoring break some aspect of the fragile strong-expectations mocking that i have cheaply put in place initially i ponder whether to just tweak the expectations or go whole hog if i decide it s not a one-off the return in future refactorings and tests will justify the investment then i hand-code a good not quite mock and stash it away in the project s specific bag of tricks -- actually often reusable across projects
such classes packages as mockfilesystem mockbigtable mockdom mockhttpclient mockhttpserver etc etc go into a project-agnostic repository and get reused for testing all kinds of future projects and in fact may be shared with other teams across the company if several teams are using filesystem interfaces bigtable interfaces doms http client server interfaces etc etc that are uniform across the teams

1418741
post	put	post	get	put	get
yes get and delete map pretty cleanly but put can do create and update but complete replacement only and post is a wildcard verb
post is really to handle everything that does not fit into get put and delete

1418869
int	chars
c automatically truncates the 0xbaadf00d int into a 0x0d chars and sets each chars in memory as requested
the second argument to memset is a chars not a int or u32

1419254
accessor	properties
it s as simple as when using an object properties instead of variable it is interesting to know that the get accessor of the intermediate value is not called
only the set accessor is invoked for all properties accessed in the assignation sequence

1420511
toolchain	newlib
the gnu toolchain does not have any os dependencies but the gnu library does
most bare-metal cross builds of gcc use the newlib c library which provides a set of syscall stubs that you must map to your target yourself

1420969
maven	cobertura
according to mcobertura-65 the maven cobertura plugin still doesn t know how to aggregate reports of sub-modules into a consolidated one
some work has been done to implement a merge target on the maven cobertura plugin see mcobertura-33 but this code hasn t been included in the plugin yet

1421026
put	get
in alternative check if your compiler supports boundary checking. worst case scenario i would not put valid values in your array at negative numbers
i would put blatantly wrong values so that you get a clearly wrong value when this occurs

1421320
equals	icomparable
since you have defined equality in the methods of that interface you also need to override the equals method and equality operator to ensure the results from the two are consistent
in the above example i have implemented icomparable but not overridden equals

1421320
equals	compareto	icomparable	compareto
in the above example i have implemented icomparable but not overridden equals
if you call compareto with two separate instances of the class that have the same value it will say there are equal

1421320
equals	compareto
if you call compareto with two separate instances of the class that have the same value it will say there are equals
if you call equals with the same two instances it will say they are not equals as it will test to see if they are the same object the default implementation of equals

1421320
equals	gethashcode
if you call equals with the same two instances it will say they are not equals as it will test to see if they are the same object the default implementation of equals
two equals items should return the same hash code which are used for quickly finding items used as keys in hash tables so if you override equals then you should also override gethashcode as an example i just created the following class in my ide and ran resharper s helpful generate equality function saying that i wanted both a and b to affect equality

1421757
apache	nginx
if you ve got enough memory already then it shouldn t be an issue whether its passenger or apache just optimize and cache your app efficiently
i d second for passenger + nginx

1422341
interbase	firebird
i don t know if firebird actually supports milliseconds but i know for a fact that the interbase driver for delphi 2007 does not
this is because interbase does not return milliseconds in its c api

1422482
ant	maven
there are also maven tasks for ant though they are not as fully featured
maven is moving towards mercury particularly for maven3 so it makes sense to use the mercury tasks

1423016
put	get
to put it simply you enqueue and dequeue not just the items you care about payload but rather the items decorated into tuples that start with the keys you need heapq to consider
so for example it would be normal to enqueue a tuple like foo.x time.time foo if you want prioritization by the x attribute with ties broken by time of insertion in the queue -- of course when you de-queue you undecorate there by taking the th item of the tuple you get by de-queueing

1423145
put	get
put all the dlls into a directory and copy the include directory
you do not need to install postgresql using the msi build to get these dlls although that would work too

1423772
ckeditor	nicedit
ckeditor and tinymce are both fine editors
i d also add to the list nicedit - which is very easy to integrate but has a few drawbacks -- mostly that the editable area is in a div not an iframe so you can end up with some css leakage

1424871
strcpy	strncpy
also note that you ensured enough space for data in send buf so you can use strcpy safely
strncpy does not terminate the output string when the limit is reached - prone to errors

1424949
children	parent
however the treeview will not display a + - indicating a node has children until you actually add children to it
therefore as you populate a parent node you should check if the logical item data row has children and if it does add a dummy node

1425045
post	put	post	get
it s not in the flex stack so it s probably the underlying flash player runtime 2 all http get requests that have content type other than application x-www-form-urlencoded are turned into post requests 3 all http post requests that have no actual posted data are turned into get requests
see 1 and 2 4 all http put and http delete requests are turned into post requests

1426359
post	get
disabled html elements do not post back to the server
this is why you get a nullreferenceexception when you manage to disable your element

1427213
versioning	upgrade
databases tend to survive longer than most applications since administrators are smart enough to not fix things that aren t broken so they often don t upgrade their systems with every new versioning
still it s a real pain when you upgrade your database to a newer versioning yet the extensions aren t compatible with that one and thus won t work

1427213
versioning	upgrade
still it s a real pain when you upgrade your database to a newer versioning yet the extensions aren t compatible with that one and thus won t work
it makes the upgrade much more complex and demands more code to be rewritten

1427558
xlsx	.doc
vsto should work with xlsx files too you probably just need to use the office 2007 dll s
the xlsx extension is not because the file is hosted in sharepoint but because it is an office 2007 template all office 2007 extensions have an extra x behind their extension so .doc becomes .docx

1427865
jar	war
also note that if the 3rd-party jar is a properly-defined maven project it s dependencies will be defined in its pom.xml
those transitive dependencies are also bundled into the war unless you have them defined with a non-default scope in which case they might not be

1428298
awt	swing
edit if panela is an awt component you will be hard pressed to get panelb to overlap
from sun s article entitled mixing heavy and light components do not mix lightweight swing and heavyweight awt components within a container where the lightweight component is expected to overlap the heavyweight one

1429197
folder	directory
you could also have specific folder for different eclipse versioning so each developer wouldn t be forced to upgrade if something changed in the .settings or .project file between versioning
i ve played with the idea with subversion of having a myproject_eclipseproj folder that only contains the the eclipse project files and directory with an svn externals prop that pulls in all the myproject files directory

1429215
updatepanel	scriptmanager
this is one of the key reasons i decided not to use updatepanel the asynchronous post-back causes almost all of the page life-cycle events to happen and makes it very hard to actually see what s happening in complex situations like this - the only time i ve used an updatepanel in anger was on my personal site to wrap around a data grid to save the whole page reload when working with large sets of data
in the postback request the scriptmanager id operates as the parameter

1429273
innodb	myisam
innodb needs resources and it will not work well with defaults a lot
tuning myisam from defaults rarely gives more than 2-3 times gain while it can be as much as 10-50 times for innodb tables in particular for write intensive workloads

1430171
vim	emacs	macvim	emacs
vim doesn t have this included in it s default distribution and the project there for integrating gdb and vim was nearly impossible to get working with macvim
the biggest difference for me in choosing to use emacs over vim was the built in gdb support in emacs

1430188
vim	emacs
there is a huge difference on a day-to-day level - vim or any vi variant is inherently modal you go into command modes where you cannot edit and emacs along with most other editors are not
sure using menus and such you don t have to actually enter command mode in vim - at first

1430200
vim	emacs
on the downside vimscript is relatively similar to today s dynamic languages while elisp doesn t resemble pretty much anything more extendible excellent support for gnu tools the bunch of them personally i prefer vim - it is small does what it s supposed to do and when i wish a full blown ide i open vs
emacs s approach of being an editor which wants to be an ide or should i say an os but is not quite is imho outdated

1431288
folder	directory
pack uri scheme is only used for files inside resource directory where else if you just add a file or add a file as a link and set its type to content it will only copy the file in your bin folder but it will not be packed inside application resource directory
so for the file that exists in directory as individual file you can not use pack uri scheme you have to use file uri scheme that is normal path

1431863
font-lock	slime
triggering the major-mode is not what makes font-lock do its thing
i am not intimately familiar with the internals of slime or lisp-mode but just setting the variable should make it work

1432559
hash	salt
compare salt hash input with stored data to check a password
basic probably not 100 watertight but enough for general purposes hash the password use salt for added security using your favorite algorithm and store the hash and the salt

1432814
interpreted-language	compiled-language
also splitting into shared libraries here sounds like an interpreted-language mindset
in compiled-language you try not to postpone till runtime what you can do at compile-time

1433076
mouseevent	mouseenter
imagine you want to add an event listener to some ui component the above code compiles and run but if you move the mouse inside someuicomponent the do something code will note run because actually you are not overriding the base method mouseenter mouseevent ev
you just create a new parameter-less method mouseenter

1433315
vim	emacs
even though i use emacs all day every day and love it unless you intend to spend a lot of time in the program you choose i would pick vim
the text below is my opinion it should not be taken as fact or an insult with emacs you are expected to have it open 24 7 and live inside the program almost everything you do can be done from there

1433568
printf	getchar	printf	fgets	fgets	getchar
fgets read input until n or end of file followed by sscanf parse a string for input is safe from buffer overruns and will absorb any extra input and line terminating n flushing stdout after the printf isn t normally needed for terminal io but can be if you re piping it to a disk typically when you re logging a crashing program it will lose the most interesting bit just before the crash if you don t fflush
because fgets reads up to and including the end of the line there are no characters left in the buffer so you only need one getchar and slightly awkward input such as 1234 space enter doesn t cause the program to terminate without pausing

1434331
rubygems	bundler
if you look at the comments you will see the author say this the point i was not trying to make is that rubygems is bad or that people shouldn t use it
i use rubygems and think it s a critical piece of ruby s success i just don t have the line require rubygems anywhere in my library s source code because it s not necessary or convenient and makes it hard impossible for other environments like bundler rip gae debian hand rolled etc to use the library without rubygems which is often important

1434630
equals	icomparable
or just override equals and object.gethashcode on your class without implementing any interfaces
icomparable is not normally used to compare for equality it s used for ordering so ignores it

1435433
erlang	ocaml
i think ocaml is a great way to get started in fp and erlang is not very difficult once you have the basic fp concepts down
but the suggestion from aneccodeal is fantastic-- if you are interested in ocaml and have a friend who is already strong in it by all means develop a concurrency perhaps mpi library for it

1435831
erlang	lisp
clojure is concurrent so learning a little bit of erlang will help though you will need to keep in mind that erlang includes a lot about distributed programming while clojure is all about concurrent programming that is not necessarily distributed
clojure is a lisp so learning other lisp will help a lot in getting used to the parts of the lisp culture or general way of doing things

1436119
hash	salt
if a hacker gets a hold of your database if the password is hash it shouldn t matter if it s associated with a particular user if you re really paranoid about it you could always hash the user name too
it should be safe to store the hash password with the user you can also have random salt for each user too so the same salt isn t used for each password

1436515
profiling	instrumentation
i got it to work only with my development provisioning profiling which is not my distribution profiling
i also made sure i have the same provisioning profiling in project and target and turned on get-task-allow in entitlements.plist it sometimes still doesn t work and then i restart xcode unplug plugin my iphone clean the target and run instrumentation from xcode via start with performance tool this is by the way with xcode 3.1 sdk 3.0. hope this gets less painful with sdk 3.1 which i m downloading now

1437031
x86	64bit
i m using win7 64bit with td.net 2.22.246 and it works just fine. the only other visual studio runners exists are mstest run only as 32 bit process and testmatrix not free to check if it s a 64bit issue you can build the test project as x86 and run the tests with td.net
in that case td.net will run as 32 bit process - you can verify it using the task manager and looking at processinvocation.exe if the tests run than its 64bit issue

1437318
srp	principles
based on your examples there s definitely an isp and a srp and probably a law of demeter not solid but... violation going on at the very least
imnsho you re far better off reading articles on solid or buying agile principles patterns and practices in c# by robert c

1437653
hid	keyboard
see this link for details wm_devicechange there is a good discussion of wm_devicechange on this forum relating to its usage with hid devices mouse keyboard etc. for more detailed notification you can use the registerdevicenotification function registerdevicenotification
not sure about the monitor but the keyboard and mouse being disconnected should fire off a wm_devicechange message if they are usb devices

1441301
ascx	scriptmanager
i ran into this problem with a custom ascx server control
i tried many solutions involving adding script to the oninit events of the control which doesn t get executed until after it checks for the scriptmanager control adding logic inside of server tags on the control and adding things to about every other event

1441389
nfa	dfa
there s a dfa nfa library on scala as well though it is not particularly a good one
it supports conversion from arbitrary regular expressions ie the literals need not be characters into dfa nfa

1441495
raphael	excanvas
if raphael does what you need there is no particular reason not to use it
do note that there are also other libraries for this excanvas which emulates canvas for ie using vml as far as i know and also some others which do the same with silverlight and flash but i forgot their names

1441622
filtering	grouping
the gist of the problem is that the presence of distinct places a barrier that does not allow for the filtering predicate to move down the query tree to a place where is effective
update even if distinct is not a barrier on second look the second look there is a even more powerful barrier there the grouping by having clause

1442744
implements	extends
you don t have to implements the list from scratch you just inherit from it and override methods such as insertitem and removeitem to implements custom rules add calls insertitem under the hood
is not a partial class so you can t extends it using your own partial classes

1442901
udp	tcp
for heartbeats use udp not tcp
a heartbeat is by nature a connectionless contrivance so it goes that udp connectionless is more relevant here than tcp connection-oriented

1443014
nhibernate	massive
they both also support some amount of graphical modeling although llblgen pro is far superior in this regard activewriter for nhibernate feels like the linqtosql designer in visual studio but it s not really as feature rich
llblgen pro has much stronger code generation abilities but too much code generation can lead to compromised testability and maintainability one small tweak can cause massive amounts of code to need retesting

1443077
ubuntu	linux
since regular release testing covers ubuntu i would not worry about functionality of created libraries -- if there s .so it should work
the recommended way to use the boost c++ libraries on linux is via shared linking

1443181
superclass	subclassing
i can also see a problem in your logic regarding the fact that you want your superclass to be calling the constructor of its children which of course can be any type
i recommend you rewrite it like the following it is not a nice idea to expect the superclass to know the parameter to be used in the init of its subclassing since it is really hard to ensure that all the constructor will be the same maybe the animal dialog window takes diff parameters

1444060
inline	inlining
the compiler can inline whatever it wants in case inlining doesn t violate the code semantics and it can reach the function code
it can also inline selectively - do inline when it feels it s a good idea and not inline when it doesn t feel it s a good idea or when it would violate the code semantics

1444060
inline	inlining
it can also inline selectively - do inline when it feels it s a good idea and not inline when it doesn t feel it s a good idea or when it would violate the code semantics
some compilers can do inlining even if the function is in another translation unit - that s called link-time code generation

1445064
actionscript	mxml
compiling without flex builder you can also use flex builder flash builder without using the flex framework -- meaning you can program in the ide and use only actionscript classes that aren t part of the framework the classes you d use if you programmed in flash and not flex builder
you can choose to use or not use mxml

1445064
actionscript	mxml
you can even use mxml to auto-generate actionscript that s not part of the flex framework your own custom classes
using mxml for your own classes good luck

1445327
int	double
is not ambiguous the conversion from foo to int is used using your conversion function that converts to double that works because after applying the conversion function a standard conversion that converts the double to int truncation follows
in your case is int and has the value 6

1445454
int	double
therefore that doesn t work and we follow with if e2 is an rvalue or if the conversion above cannot be done skipping the part about if they both have class type otherwise if e1 or e2 has a nonclass type or if they both have class types but the underlying classes are not either the same or one a base class of the other e1 can be converted to match e1 if e1 can be implicitly converted to the type that expression e2 would have if e2 were converted to an rvalue or the type it has if e2 is an rvalue . therefore we see that 0 is an rvalue of type int
we can convert a foo since we can implicitly convert a foo to a double and thence to an int

1445694
many-to-one	one-to-many
many-to-one associations and one-to-many obviously do not suffer from this issue
owner entity can easily check its own fk and in case of one-to-many empty collection proxy is created initially and populated on demand so the association can be lazy

1446070
vim	textmate
not sure if you were referring to vim s own tabs there or pining for textmate s
it s unclear what vim version you re using but it s had tabs since at least 7.0 which seems to be installed everywhere i look lately and they re awesome

1446105
post	get
you should change these links to be post rather than gets then you won t have to worry about crawlers
there are other reasons to do this web caches may decide to cache the get and therefore not actually hit your server when the user clicks the link

1446361
jdom	xerces
you can use jdom which requires xerces saxparser
however appengine does not provide the xerces library

1446607
post	get
that get request is not a post and it ll be missing the payload
interestingly enough this is also in the same section if the 301 status code is received in response to a request other than get or head the user agent must not automatically redirect the request unless it can be confirmed by the user since this might change the conditions under which the request was issued

1446881
google-chrome	firefox
it works for ie and google-chrome
only firefox doesn t seem to be working for me

1447603
directsound	mixer
for example directsound has a method idirectsoundbuffer that allows you to set the volume for that sound buffer
per-application volume control whether it s exposed via the system mixer or not is a dramatically better experience for customers than an application controlling the master volume

1447993
multiplying	subtract
so you have to do or to preserve precision multiplying and dividing by whole numbers works normally
for instance to divide by 6 you can simply write and in the case of dividing by a power of 2 adding and subtract whole numbers though doesn t work naively

1448597
lisp	smalltalk
but smalltalk isn t a modern language in many ways it s a dialect of lisp so its heritage is 1950s even though it only arrived in the 1970s and the improvement is made to the implementation not the language
the same improvement exists in the sun java runtime the google javascript runtime and many common lisp runtimes

1448822
windows	wow64
your delphi programs will run on a 32 bit layer wow64 - windows on windows 64 of windows 64 bit which is close enough to the real 32 bit os that you do not need to care about it unless you work very closely with the lower system level
no idea about windows 7 64 bit version but i have been using delphi 4 5 2007 and 2009 for nearly a year now on windows xp 64 bit and given the effort microsoft spends on backwards compatibility i don t see why things should be very different on windows 7

1448969
post	get
edit seems like the linked blog post isn t that clear
you change only the name of the string passed to registerattached not the name of the static get set methods you have to initialize the collection in the getdisplayfilter method it seems that you only add tabitem elements to that collection

1449319
vim	emacs
vrapper doesn t give you full vim emulation but you can bounce around your code using vim shortcuts and you don t loose any of the goodness of eclipse
vim is without a shadow of a doubt the best editor in the world come get me emacs guys

1449504
hash	md5
to clarify confusion created by my naivety consistent with the comments made below md5 like most useful hash by their nature are not injective so their output is not guaranteed to be unique for all inputs
if hash collisions are an issue in this case they are using this technique will require checking after hashing whether an identical key has already been generated

1449765
maven	pom.xml
if you have a jar that doesn t already exist on a maven repository you can install it to your local repository using the install-plugin s install-file goal as rich s answer says
this generates a pom.xml using the values you provide and installs the pom.xml and the jar to the local repository

1449812
decimal	ieee
the latest revision of the ieee 754 2008 standard does indeed define hardware decimal floating point numbers using the representations shown in the software referenced in the question
the previous version of the standard ieee 754 1985 did not provide decimal floating point numbers

1450735
hash	salt
to respect the people s privacy it is recommended to always store passwords one-way encrypted with hash functions like sha-256 or md5
but you should not use them without any additional salt since dictionary attacks can simply be performed on those passwords

1450998
rational-numbers	fractions	int	double
the reason for the exception is that an int does not hold rational-numbers basically fractions
so trying to parse 0.3 to a int is nonsense. a double or a float datatype can hold rational-numbers

1451651
folder	directory
decompress the contents of the bundle you may do it in the same folder mingw is installed or do it in another folder it doesn t matter
launch a command prompt get to the bin directory where you extracted the bundle and run pkg-config --cflags --libs gtk+-win32-2.0 it will print a list of compilation flags and libraries to link your project to

1451668
post	get
from this post this exception occurred for one simple reason the permgenspace is where class properties such as methods fields annotations and also static variables etc
are stored in the java vm but this space has the particularity to not being cleaned by the garbage collector. so if your webapp uses or creates a lot of classes i m thinking dynamic generations of classes chances are you met this problem. here are some solutions that helped me get rid of this exception -xx +cmsclassunloadingenabled this setting enables garbage collection in the permgenspace -xx +cmspermgensweepingenabled allows the garbage collector to remove even classes from the memory raises the amount of memory allocated to the permgenspace may be this could help

1451684
inline	inlining
about inlining now some true code can be put inside the headers usually by prefixing it with the keyword inline
again this is not really true code the compiler and the linker will figure what to do with it but it can either move the function code into an object file and have all the other object files link with it there inline the code where the inlined function is used the two solution above at the same time but the inlined function could well disappear from the binary if it is not used

1451723
put	get
to answer your question if the application is a standard forms application deployed to the client s machine by an installer or xcopy deployment then the path to the executable is application.executablepath if the application is click-once deployed then i would not recommend using the above since the app s path is obscured shadow-copied and put in the sandbox
you can use applicationdeployment.isnetworkdeployed to test for click-once deployment then applicationdeployment.currentdeployment.activationuri to get the uri that the application was launched from

1451846
lisp	scheme
common lisp although does not have native continuations allows to create delimited continuations using cps transformers like cl-cont
so generators in common lisp can be written in pretty much the same way as scheme generators

1452054
ordinals	difference
basically an ordinals comparison just needs to walk the two strings character by character until it finds a difference
if it doesn t find any difference and the lengths are the same the result is 0

1452798
put	get
otherwise it ends up being put inside the gems directory where your ruby installation resides
ironruby will not see that gems directory by default and you would have to use the full path to get to it

1453063
vim	emacs
i can totally understand why someone not already familiar with emacs wouldn t want to use viper-mode but as someone coming from vim you really have the opportunity to get the best of both worlds
in general get used to the fact that viper-mode isn t perfect learn how to do the things you re missing from it the emacs way and make sure you explore the cool features that emacs has that aren t available in vim

1453486
int	boolean
this was necessary in c as it had no true boolean type it just relied on the interpretation of other values like int where 0 is false and non-zero is true or pointers where null is false
this meant you could then do something like however because c# does not allow arbitrary expressions to be interpreted as a boolean these will not work in c#

1453512
hex	binary
reflector comes up with some source which would compile to the same binary code - it doesn t know whether you used a hex literal or a decimal one etc
you can change the number format it uses under view options disassembler forcing it to hex or decimal or leaving it to decide

1454034
ssl	https
not sure about any java or spring specifics but in general 1 set up an ssl cert on your server
2 forward or link to an absolute url with https at the beginning when going to login page 3 forward to an absolute url with after successful authentication

1454119
spy++	sendmessage
as sendmessage does not seem to be working for you i don t know of another option apart from ui automation i am assuming you have check with spy++ installed with msdev that you message are being send to the correct button etc and that the button is a standard windows buttons
my first instant would say use sendmessage or postmessage but given the numbers of answers about sendmessage and the fact it is not working for you

1454162
next	except
a branch doesn t exist until there s at least one commit on it so the answer to your question is use hg branch branch-a to mark the next commit as being on branch-a.
hg branch x does nothing except tell mercurial the next commit i make should be on branch x. it doesn t actually create the branch

1454657
splist	spsite
if you read at least one field first you d probably see a slight delay there and no delay on the setter because under the hood setvalue calls ensurefieldcollection which - if the fields for the list item haven t already been populated - has to check back to the splist s fields collection
also this is not in your code snippet but make sure you are disposing of your spweb and spsite objects when you re done

1455170
punctuation	words
with x replace all punctuation and math symbols .
+ with a space dashes are not replaced add percent back slash underscore carat asterisk equal sign curly braces question and exclamation marks pipes dollar and cents signs pound sign tabs crlf replace all digits with a space replace all one letter words with a space pattern space single-character-wildcard space remove redundant spaces

1455845
hide	show
or something similar to hide it then it doesn t matter if you leave the event handler on the document - hiding it when it s already hidden will have no effect
if you want to be very tidy then add the event listeners when the div is show and remove them when it is hidden

1455991
perl	tcl
the tcl tk module uses the same bridge as tkx but supports a syntax that s mostly the same as perl tk
whether or not you need to compile anything depends on which version of perl you use

1456081
children	parent
if you simply want to delete parent along with children you do not need to load the children collection
you don t even need to get the parent using load is enough this of course assumes the appropriate mapping cascade in place

1456709
distance	polygons
although we do need pythagoras for calculating the distance between each vertex for the perimeter calculation and we do need to extrapolate because the number of animation steps on an edge is not necessarily a integer
pre 1 calculate the polygons s perimeter or estimate it if exact time of circling is not critical 2 divide the perimieter by the time desired for circling 3 move point around polygons at this speed. edit following ire and curses comment

1457243
printf	strncpy
you can avoid crashing from the problem you ve described by limiting the number of chars printed by printf
strncpy is safer against stack overflow attacks by the user of your program it doesn t protect you against errors you the programmer do such as printing a non-null-terminated string the way you ve described

1457326
ant	maven
the learning curve is not much worse than forrest s for basic use and since you don t have to learn ant if you use maven it s arguably even less for setting up a project from scratch
forrest as a whole is less complex though and if you don t need everything maven provides you might want to start with forrest and migrate to maven later if you need it. forrest is also better if you have an existing large-build system based on ant it lets you add in maven-style web site generation incrementally instead of rewriting all your build scripts to maven-ize the project

1457900
subtraction	addition
i couldn t take off the last term because then it wouldn t be in range and i couldn t remove the subtraction from the mod as that could result in a value over the top end of the interval
instead i had to subtract the lower value from the initial addition to compensate

1458669
prototypejs	mootools
the can take a css selector to return a set of elements just like the function in jquery prototypejs also has a very similar function that s a shortcut to getelementsbyselector
the second example is not jquery it s mootools

1459435
freemarker	velocity
freemarker is also a lot more flexible in my experience
velocity isn t really under active development any more

1459937
hash	salt	hash	md5	salt	md5
add a piece of code so that when someone logs in it does the normal process computes the md5 sum of the password and checks it against the stored hash and if that succeeds recompute a salt version of the hash from the clear-text password they entered and store it in the password file
the only wrinkle is that you ll need to add an indicator for whether each md5 is salt or not since you ll have a mix of both for a while

1459937
salt	md5
the only wrinkle is that you ll need to add an indicator for whether each md5 is salt or not since you ll have a mix of both for a while
or for a minor loss of security you can check each password salt and unsalted and if either one hits accept the login

1460682
free	malloc
free.c -- the source for the free command line utility sysinfo.c -- see the method meminfo for an example of how proc meminfo is read in
whilst reading proc is pretty straight forward being able to predict whether malloc is going to fail is not at all easy

1461800
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
assuming you know the type have an instance of it and that the method is actually public note that i m doing case-sensitive name matching here which wouldn t work with your sample
if you want to be case-insensitive it s slightly harder but still doable - personally i d advise you to make the xml match the method if at all possible

1464294
hash	salt
with different hash an attacker won t see that
another reason for using salt in password hash is to hide the fact that two users use the same password not unusual

1464720
folder	directory
that way the files get installed in your resources inside a folder instead of just as individual files all over the place
edit better yet do what i say about putting all the files you want in one folder add to your project but not as a group and then at first launch use and it will copy your whole directory from one place to another

1465055
innodb	myisam
it means what it says your installation of mysql is compiled or configured not to provide any support for the innodb database backend
the alternative and default database backend myisam is largely undesirable as it does not offer the data-integrity features that robust applications require

1465215
wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe
in short one is use wcf framework the other one is using asp.net webservice stuff wsdl.exe
it seems very strange that the service works fine with svcutil.exe and not with wsdl.exe

1465215
wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe
it seems very strange that the service works fine with svcutil.exe and not with wsdl.exe
the other way arround can happen with wsdl that are not compatible with datacontractserializer but i never had the cas where wsdl.exe didn t work.

1465228
move	drag
whatever it is matters because placement of elements in wpf is highly dependent on the parent container. it s easy to move something 20px to the right inside a canvas just add to canvas.left but it s much harder to do so in a grid you have to deal with column columnspan and margin
there s a code project article describing how to drag elements inside a canvas dragging elements in a canvas if you want to move just that circle and not other controls in an existing canvas grid

1465464
implements	extends
namevaluecollection does not directly implements the icollection interface. instead namevaluecollection extends nameobjectcollectionbase
this implements the icollection interface and the overloaded add system.string method is not implemented in the namevaluecollection class

1465992
x86	64bit
i changed the cpu type of the project to x86 and flash now works just fine
when i actually clicked on the get adobe flash player link it brings me to a page that says adobe flash player is not supported for playback in a 64bit browser. however you can run flash player in a 32-bit browser running on a 64bit operating system

1467269
prop	each
note since jquery 1.6 checkboxes should be set using prop not attr
this is easily done by flipping the current checked state of the checkbox upon each click

1468158
imperative	declarative
imperative programming sequentially executes statements that may manipulate an underlying state
some imperative programming in java note that if you do the above out of order it would result in a null pointer exception declarative programming doesn t have a state or order just declarations

1468158
imperative	declarative
some imperative programming in java note that if you do the above out of order it would result in a null pointer exception declarative programming doesn t have a state or order just declarations
here is a simple example - this xml snippet could be considered declarative it doesn t talk about how the customer object will get built just declares the parts

1468347
gif	png
i use this css hack for giving ie 7 a gif file and everything else a 24 bit png with transparency
yes ie 6 supports sprites but doesn t support 24 bit png transparency

1468419
lisp	scheme
this is not entirely language-agnostic in lisp you can actually return any number of values from a function including but not limited to none one two .
defun returns-two-values values 1 2 the same thing holds for scheme and dylan

1468695
put	get
if you get mad while figuring out quoting move all the logic of your command inside a shell-script so you only need to put mycommand.sh in your add_definitions for windows batch file based generators things are much tricker and i don t have a good solution
the problem is that the pre_build commands are not executed as part of the same batch file as the actual compiler invocation study the buildlog.htm for details so my initial idea did not work generating a custom.bat in a pre_build step and then do call custom.bat on it to get a variable set which can later be referenced in the compiler command line

1468748
disk	ram
if it s a writable segment it will be demand-paged off the disk into your address space where it will become a private mapping
if it s not writable you may just link up to an already loaded shared page but ultimately static variables are initialized in an image somewhere and paged into ram

1468855
entities	entitymanager
any entities you load from within this new instance will be loaded from database and thus contain latest changes
then there also may be a 2nd level cache which is not bound to a particular entitymanager

1468983
cxxtest	cppunit
i prefer cxxtest as i find it easier not to have to register my test cases explicitly as you have to do with cppunit
there s an eclipse plugin for cxxtest but i don t know if there s one for netbeans

1469172
maven	pom.xml
according to the exec maven plugin documentation about exec java executes the supplied java class in the current vm with the enclosing project s dependencies as classpath
here the aggregating pom.xml you are showing doesn t contain any dependency to the codadris.dbgui module which is actually good thing don t add it

1469183
superclass	subclassing
an object instantiated from a class may be treated as the type of any of its superclass but cannot be treated as the type of a subclassing
a subclassing can be treated as its superclass but never in the opposite direction

1469187
superclass	subclassing
a subclassing is an instance of the superclass but not the other way around so that s why the types are not compatible
imagine a very small superclass with just a single method or constant

1469796
ethernet	wireless
if this is in fact its own isolated network then you are right there really isn t a need for the ethernet connectivity at all
the overhead you will see on the wireless is huge your no overhead ideal data rate is 250kbit sec running zigbee on 802.15.4 2.4ghz point to point your real data throughout is usually around 20kbit sec

1469926
mousemove	mouseup
also for this functionality you do not need jquery simply use this pattern var mousemove function move div return false
var mouseup function document.onmousemove null

1469938
set	bag	union	distinct
the set operation performed is in this case set union while for removeemployeeobject and removeemployees it is set difference of course
because core data represents a to-many relationship using a nsset a collection of distinct elements not a nscountedset a set that can contain duplicate elements also known as a bag

1469938
set	bag
because core data represents a to-many relationship using a nsset a collection of distinct elements not a nscountedset a set that can contain duplicate elements also known as a bag
and because a set is an unordered collection therefore appending does not make sense as it does instead for an array or list

1470838
windows	wow64
windows itself will map specific registry locations into logical views using a registry redirector and registry reflection
you can read more about this process in the following msdn article 32-bit and 64-bit application data in the registry despite the win32 api being the best way to achieve this this is the possibility of hard-coding the location of the registry that you are seeking to retrieve although this is fraught with possible problems microsoft themselves do not support this method . you can read more about this in this stack overflow question how to open a wow64 registry key from a 64-bit .net application ultimately the win32 api seems about the best solution if not the most elegant at the moment

1471162
post	get
more technical details the function loadpage should be re-written using jquery post
this is a random shot not tested be warned i did not test it and i might get this function a little wrong

1471167
sorting	grouping
hash is faster is the resultset is not sorted hashing is faster than sorting
min and max are special cases since they don t require scanning the whole grouping only the first and the last value of the aggregated column within the grouping

1471396
public	protected
protect the server from being hacked in general by not opening or firewalling unnecessary services on the public internet and ensuring any admin services eg
ssh are suitably protected by strong account passwords or keys

1471660
hash	md5
for a good hash it would be computationally infeasible to find them beyond a pretty trivial maximum length but it means there s no guarantee that if you find a password which has the target hash it s definitely the original password
it s astronomically unlikely that you d see two ascii-only reasonable-length passwords that have the same md5 hash but it s not impossible

1471660
hash	md5
it s astronomically unlikely that you d see two ascii-only reasonable-length passwords that have the same md5 hash but it s not impossible
md5 is a bad hash to use for passwords it s fast which means if you have a target hash it s cheap to try lots of passwords and see whether you can find one which hashes to that target

1471660
hash	salt	hash	md5
md5 is a bad hash to use for passwords it s fast which means if you have a target hash it s cheap to try lots of passwords and see whether you can find one which hash to that target
salting doesn t help with that scenario but it helps to make it more expensive to try to find a password matching any one of multiple hash using different salt

1471663
hash	md5
you should add change password feature where the user gives another password calculates the hash and store it as a new password
md5 is a hashing algorithm you can not revert the hash value

1471668
hash	md5
technically it s possible but under very strict conditions rainbow tables brute forcing based on the very small possibility that a user s password is in that hash database
but that doesn t mean it s viable or secure you don t want to reverse an md5 hash

1471828
public	protected
if you want to allow conversion you should be using public inheritance
using protected or private inheritance you are declaring that the fact that the derived type inherits from the base class is a detail that should not be visible from the outside that s why you are getting that error

1471883
subclass	inherited
domainservices cannot return a type that is a subclass of another type returned from the same domainservice
...does not mean no inherited support. it does mean that in the current version of ria services you can t return both a parent and a child type to the client

1472383
profiling	debugging
the pb call blocks until the profiling browser is exited note just closing the window with the wm destroy button doesn t seem to cause it to return - only the exit menu item seems to so your server is hung until you dismiss the window but for debugging purposes that seems like it may be fine
after looking over the guppy website and not finding any information about how to launch the profiling browser there i started looking around the guppy source and eventually found guppy heapy prof.py at the end of which i saw a docstring containing this line then remembering that i had see some documentation giving the return type of guppy.hpy as use i checked to see if guppy.hpy .pb would do anything

1473402
hash	salt
but for usage as a one-way password hash the hash can be stored in a record with the parameters but in its own field
there is a specification for the parameters salt and iterations of pbkdf2 but it doesn t include the hash

1473930
webclient	httpwebrequest
the webclient is a very dumbed down wrapper for httpwebrequest
webclient is great if you just doing very simple consumption of services or posting a bit of xml but the tradeoff is that it s not as flexible as you might want it to be

1474127
post	get	submit	submission
as james skidmore suggested it is easy to do an onclick with javascript to submit it as a post
i would suggest unobtrusive js so if someone doesn t have js on then it will work as a link doing a get submission but if they have js then it would change the behavior to be post with no ugly url change

1474700
folder	directory
when i checked the .gitosis.conf file located in the home folder of the gitosis user i found that it was not updated
that s really weird -- on my gitosis installation the .gitosis.conf in the gitosis user s home directory is a symlink

1475127
inherited	properties
unfortunately by default infrastructure under class settingsbase from which your settings class is inherited - see auto-generated code in settings.designer.cs file doesn t throw exception on serialization error so you can t see the problem
remove font and color properties from your class and try again

1475430
pop-up	dialog
an fb user that is not logged in to facebook will get the pop-up
facebook removed the inline login dialog box for security reasons

1475673
perl	tcl
for perl there are two ways to call c++ subroutines perl xs external subroutine see also wiki - allows calling subroutines from other languages mainly but not exclusively c from perl by compiling c code into modules usable from perl
swig simplified wrapper and interface generator is a software development tool that connects programs written in c and c++ with a variety of high-level scripting languages including perl php python tcl and ruby though it seems swig s origins are bindings with python

1476101
hash	md5
you generally use a hash function when you want to be able to verify that a piece of data presented at two different times is the same for passwords or file consistency
md5 isn t considered very secure these days - there are other hashes sha-256 which are harder to attack

1476642
multiplying	multiplication
i really doubt that java has multiplying methods for point or vector classes because a canonical definition of a concept like multiplication is not possible for these objects
there are a few operations generally called products dot product cross product complex multiplication by identification of the complex and the euclidean plane but they all have properties that strongly differ from the properties of the usual real multiplication

1477008
pascal	delphi
while the delphi pascal syntax is more text oriented begin end or and so the underscores look a bit strange as you don t expect them there
to add to the answer of phoenix i associate leading underscores with c c++ not with delphi

1477118
many-to-many	one-to-many	many-to-many	many-to-one
for this lack of evolutivity the hibernate documentation recommends to avoid the many-to-many in general and use the two relationships from the beginning
from what i know it is not possible to map it this way you have to switch to one-to-many and a many-to-one relationships with your b in the middle

1477655
free	malloc
you can use malloc free for any type of data not only null terminated strings
yes it works free does not care where the null termination is

1477669
hash	salt	hash	md5	salt	md5
combining hash could have a similar effect but should not be used for that purpose without a salt because it s still possible for a precomputed table to exist for that combination
however the combination and repetition of hash has a value of its own by increasing the time it takes for an attacker to do a dictionary attack applying md5 ten thousand times still takes a fraction of a second and is feasible as part of the login process

1477721
terminate	timeout
you can use the terminate call on the process if you really need to though it s not recommended
you could use the multiprocessing library to run the code in a separate process and call .join on the process to wait for it to finish with the timeout parameter set to whatever you want

1478407
perl	tcl
perl for example having come to popularity somewhat later typically doesn t harp on the distinction
however you still often hear people refer to perl scripts rather than perl programs and likewise for tcl

1478775
multiplication	modulo
if not then it might not be worth slowing down all the multiplication operations with an extra lookup
and if you do use the lookup idea definitely do not use a modulo

1478808
int	chars
but to avoid sql injections you should protect the data use in the where clause too. if your id is a chars varchar in db it means using mysql_real_escape_string on too if your id is an int in database the quotes arround the value are not necessary quotes in sql are the string-delimiter
there is no need for any delimiter for integers you should make sure you are sending an int to the db

1478839
for-loop	loops
so i think you can reasonably efficiently do the only wasteful aspect here is that you have to generate an arrays of length n-1 for the for-loop which isn t ideal but it s probably not a giant issue
you could replace it by a while loops if you preferred

1479478
terminate	timeout
python simply does not have a way to terminate a running thread in a way that s both uncooperative and safe
you should just have the code check the timeout on its own

1479503
put	get
to use this on your form put all the controls you want to be grayed-out underneath onto a panel then have your button s click event do something like this to undo the effect you would just remove the floating panel from the form s controls collection then make visible again all the controls on the original panel and then refresh or invalidate the panel to get rid of the grayed-out stuff
the simple invalidate will work because the grayed-out effect does not persist - to get that you d have to make this all a bit more complicated

1479612
redmine	gitorious
depending on whether you want a feature-for-feature clone of github or just somewhere to view git repositories alongside an issue tracker wiki etc. i d recommend either using gitorious the github clone or redmine
many of the advantages of github easy forking user follows etc. aren t usually very applicable inside a corporate firewall so you may find a more traditional software workflow tool like redmine as or more useful for plain source code management while offering better functionality for project wikis issue tracking and access control

1480091
put	get
what i do for a similar situation is add a toxml method to my data classes the new lines aren t necessary but help when printing out the xml for diagnostic purposes so i always put them in
that apporach wouldn t do the whole job for you but would get you on the path

1480214
imperative	declarative
that does not mean the imperative approach is useless
there are times when it is not possible to apply handlers declarative

1480380
openssl	m2crypto
m2crypto is a python wrapper around openssl
the api is pretty much a straight translation of openssl s into python so the somewhat sketchy documentation shouldn t be too much of a problem

1480380
openssl	m2crypto
the api is pretty much a straight translation of openssl s into python so the somewhat sketchy documentation shouldn t be too much of a problem
if the public key encryption algorithm you need to use is supported by m2crypto then you could very well use it to do your public key cryptography

1481180
int	chars
encapsulating that code in a function shouldn t be that hard and might get you something like this and calling it with a shortened-url will get you int 123456
you can find examples of source-code to create short-urls containing letters both lower and upper case and number on those two articles for instance create short ids with php - like youtube or tinyurl building a url shortener here is the portion of code used in that second article quoting and you can pretty easily encapsulate this in a function -- only thing to consider is that is to be received as a parameter and calling it this way you get you can also add some other chars if needed -- depending on what you want to get in your urls edit after the comment reading through the second article from which i got the shortening code you ll find the code that does the un-shortening

1481392
ant	maven
there are also maven tasks for ant though they are not as fully featured
maven is moving towards mercury particularly for maven3 so it makes sense to use the mercury tasks

1481401
public	protected
in the most simplistic cases there is very little reason to have a public constructor rather than a public static method that returns a new object and the object only has private protected constructors
that being said there are cases where you either need to have public default constructors or it is very inconvenient not to have them

1481487
ssl	https
edit if you are using ssl tunneling proxy authentication is a bad idea
proxy using basic auth over https is not secure when the ssl is tunneled

1481929
windows	wow64
although its true that 32-bit will be around for a while in some form or another windows server 2008 r2 ships with a 64-bit sku only
i would not be surprised to see wow64 as an install option as early as windows 8 as more software migrates to 64-bit

1481929
windows	wow64
i would not be surprised to see wow64 as an install option as early as windows 8 as more software migrates to 64-bit
wow64 is a install memory and performance overhead

1482170
int	chars
this can fit without an overflow in an int 32 bit signed with a range from -2 31 to 2 31 - 1
some of scala s basic types are in order of the length of their representation in bits byte 8 chars 16 int 32 long 64 all are signed except for chars and all are convertible to a type below it as they would never over under-flow except for byte to chars which doesn t exist

1482170
int	chars
the only solution i see for your problem is using or something similar - richchar is implicitly converted to an int as implicit conversions cannot be chained
edit found out that there actually is no implicit conversion from richchar to chars

1482273
comparator	comparable
you ll be able to access the comparator method on things typed e
not everything is comparable

1482509
post	get
the client does not re-submit the post data on the second separate request
however neither post nor get alone are more or less restful - both are strings of data just in slightly different parts of the request

1482711
boost	allocator
also this doesn t help you with the non-crt memory allocator functions heapalloc globalalloc localalloc virtualalloc etc though boost almost certainly uses the crt functions
if the allocator number is consistent you could use _crtsetbreakalloc to set a breakpoint when that allocator occurs to see what code is allocator the memory

1482799
actionscript	mxml
mxml is not rendered directly it is first compiled into actionscript 3.0 and then into a typical swf.
so you cannot serve your users with mxml

1483160
post	get
if you decide on this route you can post here or on sites like silverlight.net disclamer i m not sure what the status of silverlight for linux
using silverlight would get around some issues such as installation

1483291
toolbar	tabs
the ribbon is an enhanced toolbar not a view changer
if your using the ms ribbon via officeui then there is a stipulation in the design guidelines that the view should never change the appearance of the ribbon apart from loading context tabs and that they ribbon should never wholesale change the view

1483384
maven-dependency-plugin	maven-antrun-plugin
configure the maven-dependency-plugin to unpack embed resources into target flex resources use the build-helper-maven-plugin to set target flex resources as a resource location note this may not actually work as the plugin expects embed resources to be in src main resources define the appropriate dependencies between modules
use the maven-antrun-plugin to copy the final artifacts to the existing bin directory if you attempt to use the same output directory by setting project.build.outputdirectory but then a clean of one module will clobber other builds

submit	submission
use #serialize to grab the form data append the button field to it and submit the result via jquery.post
this isn t the exact same thing as submission the form because it doesn t replace the page with the result

1483646
int	chars
although you may use any int constant expression of value 0 as a null pointer constant eg 0 or sizeof foo - sizeof foo + int 0.0 you should use null to make your intentions clear
according to the c99 spec null expands to a null pointer constant which is not required to be but typically is of type 0 is a chars constant

1483828
cpython	pypy
cpython has its own dedicated virtual machine
for completeness other implementations not yet recommended for production use include pypy a highly flexible implementation that supports many possible back-ends including but not limited to .net

1484819
public	protected
b if you do map onto properties getter and setter do not need to be public
they can be protected or even private

1485051
gridview	repeater	gridview	sqldatasource
here is the code from my example - nothing tricky here just bound a string array to a repeater and bound the gridview to a sqldatasource with the select and delete commands specified
all i can think is that your datasource doesn t have the delete command method specified but you d get a clear error about this or that you don t have the datakeynames specified in the gridview but you d get a clear error about that as well

1485568
hash	salt
by selecting a cryptographic strong hash function and a suitable salt value that is different for each password the computational effort required to guess the password is so high that the cost exceeds the possible gain the attacker can get from guessing the password
so to answer your question hiding the hash function does not improve the security

1486132
vb.net	vb6
first thing to note is that you definitely do not have to use vb.net with the interop forms toolkit you can just use your c# code directly
check out these two codeproject articles vb6 - c# interop form toolkit interop forms toolkit 2.0 tutorial in the second article there is a class called activexcontrolhelpers if you look in there you ll see how to wire-up your usercontrol to have the events flow seemisly across vb 6.0 to .net

1487712
maven	cobertura
that said while i ve seen strong arguments for running tests against both non-instrumented and instrumented code i prefer to only run the tests once against instrumented code - not just because of the maven hudson issues but because when you ve got tests that take 45 minutes it seems quite frankly silly to run them twice to generate the same result
it s a bit hackish but the approach i m using is to use a modified version of the maven cobertura plugin which is available from their repo

1487936
inherited	properties
since static s cannot be inherited this might be causing your issues
also i noticed the fields you are trying to get are not properties

1488561
int	chars
if you don t want this you can either write test manually by writing the ascii chars for each letter as bytes or you could use system.text.encoding.utf8.getbytes test and write the resulting array which will not contain a length int
as henk pointed out in this answer this is the length of the string as a 32-bit int

1488570
put	get
but it is also generally considered to be a good idea to design your classes such that it is simply not possible to get an invalid object initially or to put it into invalid state via normal means always ensure full initialization in constructors and try make methods exception-safe with respect to state validity and class invariants
so long as you stick to that rule your property getters should never get into a situation where they have to report invalid state and thus never throw

1488584
strtol	atoi
the atoi function has been deprecated by strtol and should not be used in new code
i would use the strtol equivalent just for that reason but i doubt you have to worry about atoi being removed

1488675
inline	inlining
methods that contain exception-handling blocks are not inline though methods that throw exceptions are still candidates for inlining
the methods would most likely all get inline

1488803
nullreferenceexception	argumentnullexception
you shouldn t throw nullreferenceexception
if it is an argument that is null throw argumentnullexception instead

1489299
inherited	subclassing
virtual inherited with qobject is not supported
the documentation for moc states that in cases of multiple inherited the class providing qobject should appear first if you are using multiple inherited moc assumes that the first inherited class is a subclassing of qobject

1489476
profiling	debugging
you need to debugging with a development profiling and use the ad-hoc profiling only for distributing non-debuggable copies
the ad-hoc profiling doesn t support debugging

1489505
int	chars
the int object with value 1 does not accept addition of a string value in the absence of explicit type coercion
so python names never ever have sigil chars that flag properties of the variable

1489874
folder	directory
the override alternate directory for each project and folder is maintained inside a local file - not on the server
the default working folder is kept on the server and any time you update it the changes are propigating to all other users

1489972
atexit	main
- because it terminates things quite brusquely finalizers not run including try finally blocks with blocks atexit functions etc
if all your threads except the main ones are daemons the best approach is generally thread.interrupt_main -- any thread can use it to raise a keyboardinterrupt in the main thread which can normally lead to reasonably clean exit from the main thread including finalizers in the main thread getting called etc

1490441
children	parent
after you ve parsed all your lines the only children of the root will be nodes that have appeared in the parent column and not the child column
anything that appeared in the child column and not the parent column will be a leaf node

1490547
superclass	subclassing
however because value is private the anonymous class can not access the instance variable of its superclass
as there is no variable called value visible to the anonymous subclassing of test5 the compiler looks for an alternative in the next scope

1490787
perl	tcl
it is very subjective so i wouldn t say that perl is the best choice but it is certainly a valid choice for string manipulation
other alternatives are tcl python awk etc

1492748
typedef	struct
so you have to declare the second struct as if you do not want to write struct all the time you can use a typedef declare key_state similar to device_extension
in c the name of the type is struct key_state

1493095
width	height
i m assuming you re referring to the wrapper width since you mentioned 980
the most ideal solution is to not think of pixels at all and instead rely on ems s and scaling be as fluid as possible so your design fits on small mobile devices and your elements height are not fixed but auto

1493119
folder	directory
the classes folder is not a good place to store your resources it is supposed to be a pure output folder
if you need non-classes on your classpath you simply need to put them somewhere on the source path eclipse will copy them to the classes directory

1494052
mp3	flv
ianal but i think it says that as long as you use the mp3 from inside the flv or swf then its free

1494124
factors	mean
on the other hand note that even if log n is not likely to exceed 50 a performance factors of 10 is really huge -- if you re compute-bound a factors like that can easily make or break your application
if that s not enough for you you ll frequently see factors of log n 2 or logn 3 in algorithms so even if you think you can ignore one factors of log n that doesn t mean you can ignore more of them

1494239
post	get
moreover in case of multpart form-data encoding which is required for file uploads but in this case get request is not an option anyway post will be more verbose
so are post

maven	pom.xml	maven	cargo
if you are strictly following automated smoke tests with selenium cargo testng and maven please note that the author is not really covering the multi-modules project setup i m not saying he s not doing it i m just saying he s not covering that part but only the functional testing project setup
he always launch maven from the functest directory never as a reactor from the parent pom.xml and the webapp deployed by cargo in the step 7 is treated like an external dependency

1497533
hash	md5
it doesn t really matter that this is python but you just need a hash function that maps to the length you want
for example maybe use md5 and then take just the first n characters

1498903
x86	64bit
you can do this by doing the following right click on the .exe application and choose properties go to the build tab change the platform target combo box to x86
edit and continue is not supported on 64bit applications at the clr level so there is no way for visual studio to implement it either

1499465
innodb	myisam
also a killer on innodb not about locking rather about sync disk io waits
3 fulltext myisam not usable for read-write tables because of locking

1499590
width	height
you simply need to resize the width and then calculate the new height assuming width to height ratio is same as original then if the height is not equal to the preferred height you need to draw a black rectangle cover background and then centre the image
you could also do a pillarbox but then you do the exact same as above except that width becomes height and height becomes width

1499791
yslow	pagespeed
additionally if you are looking to optimize a page yslow can provide other advice though it doesn t give you the specific data you re asking for
there is a plugin for firefox that supports this need pagespeed - this tool will let you record web activity live and then view each portion of requests

1499840
inherited	properties
but what i would do viewmodel classes almost always if not always inherited from dependencyobject
i would do this text properties a dependencyproperty which automatically notifies changes to whatever it s bound to

1500006
int	chars
had to google your problem to understand what it was here it is please be considerate of your readers x your code cannot actually work long int is not long enough and this is implementation dependent anyway you will have to read the int chars by chars and roll your own implementation of bigints which is the difficulty of the problem here i surmise
furthermore you will have to deal with overflow the result of int x int might not fit into an int

1500427
migrate	upgrade
since then we ve migrate to rails 2.1.2 2.2.2 2.3.2 2.3.3 and now 2.3.4
i did the migrations to 2.3.2 2.3.3 and 2.3.4...and for the 2.3.2 and 2.3.3 upgrade we had some failing tests that alerted us to problems we would not have discovered without having such a good test suite

1500586
int	double
a double is not an int and d and f are not interchangeable
.2f will round a double to 2 digits

1501641
mp3	wav
with audio files in a compressed format like mp3 transforming the compressed data back into time-domain samples would be so insanely difficult to do in javascript that i would found a religion around you if you managed to do it successfully
update after reading your question again i realized that it might actually be possible to do what you re discussing in javascript even if the files are in mp3 format and not wav

1501731
for-loop	arrays
if this is a dynamic arrays have your for-loop go from 0 to high data
if this needs to work with c because c doesn t have real arrays you need to do some extra work

1502428
xna	slimdx
so if you change to xna you support for directx 9 but not directx 10 or 11 soon
so if you really want to replace managed directx you should have a look at slimdx

1502646
fflush	gets
don t use fflush stdin since that is not guaranteed by the standard to work
instead you can just read characters in a loop until you ve skipped the newline there are also some other problems with your code among them that you really shouldn t use gets at all since it doesn t check that the line you read actually fits in the variable

1503434
post	get
niman you get several results he was a software engineer at safetran systems corporation in rancho cucamonga ca he was active with boinc doing seti home around 1999 he had a few active post in a couple math forums he had one post in a guestbook on a site for collecting soviet calculators you might need to google cache that one as it wouldn t load for me a search for donald niman shows he is currently in phoenix az according to facebook his google profile shows that he indeed lived in rancho cucamonga he has a single 51 year old friend on plurk - so he is probably in that age range as well consistent with writing a little commandment list in 1989 name placed on a microchip going to space this research does seem terribly stalker -ish but given these few details about the man he certainly matches the persona of someone who would write up some programming commandments
he does have a couple points of contact that you can get online - you might be able to get a hold of him and find out if he s the real author

1503807
agile	sprint
on the other hand the core of agile software manifesto is to deliver business value incrementally so ideally you re supposed to push to prod at the end of each sprint
if so then shouldn t uat be part of every single sprint

1504682
getter	setter
the setter method created is named setfido and the getter method is just named fido
when you specify readonly i believe that simply tells the compiler not to create the setter method but only the getter

1504959
int	chars
when calling a method overloaded as m int and m chars when you pass it a ushort odds are good that you want to treat the ushort as a number not as a chars
and a ushort is not a chars representation in the same way that a ushort is a numeric representation so it seems reasonable to make that conversion illegal as well

1505597
many-to-many	many-to-one
your schema has many-to-many association between server and metric via server_metric table which in itself then has additional attributes collection of values
hibernate does not support such many-to-many mappings so you ll have to decompose them into many-to-one mappings instead you can add appropriate onetomany declarations to server and metric if you want associations to be bi-directional

1505860
datalist	repeater
edit i was actually thinking of the datalist new name for the old listview as canavar mentions but the new listview is so flexible i d bet you can use it as well
the repeater does not have it the listview however does

1506079
toolchain	binutils	toolchain	newlib
first some basic stuff sudo apt-get install flex bison libgmp3-dev libmpfr-dev autoconf texinfo build-essential then i created a place to store the toolchain change cj.users to whatever is good for you
binutils apply patch to tc-arm.c according this info action view gcc newlib wget ftp sources.redhat.com pub newlib newlib-1.17.0.tar.gz wget tar -xvzf newlib-1.17.0.tar.gz cd newlib-1.17.0 then i would like to apply the patch with something like this but it did not work patch -p1 -i .. newlib-1.14.0-missing-makeinfo.patch so i opened it manually and edited line 6651 according to the patch

1506320
maven	pom.xml
but launching maven from a parent is not the only option and maven offers more possibilities to play with the reactor making a project and its dependencies or those that depend on it with maven 2.0.x you have to use the reactor plugin see reactor my new favourite maven plugin too with maven 2.1+ you can use native command line options see the new build mode options -amd -rf -am -pl check it out it might help you to achieve your goal
as pointed out the maven way to launch a goal lets say mvn install on a set of modules is to organize them as a multi-module project and to launch the goal on the parent pom.xml

1506458
datarow	datagridviewcolumn
if i set a datarow somefield to a value not in datasource i would receive the error you are receiving
i eventually created a descendant of datagridviewcolumn that support a combobox editor and allowed for values not in the datasource

1506482
int	double
here s example from the first link see calculating int powers squares cubes etc. in c++ code
c++ standard doesn t have int pow int int it has double pow double int float .

1506518
children	parent
you can have this effect by using jqueryui see jqueryui animate to class or see but unfortunately this is only if you want to apply this transition to the parent level but it wont effect the children styles to animate them as they are slowly becoming a new child grandchild of the new class
for instance if you want to animate the switching from list to grid this wont help you since it will only animate to parent styles to its own new styles not its children

1508042
mouse	keyboard
non-mouse users there are a huge number of conditions that can prevent one from being able to successfully mouse it took a few years for me and my brain which is somewhat unreliable when it comes to spatial relationships to pick up the skill
for these people keyboard access is really helpful i don t work in the web space so i m not sure if there are standard keys to use but these are communicated by screenreaders and tooltips so having any is better than none

1508170
gridview	onclientclick
you should add an onrowcommand event in the gridview and then implement an event handler
on your button instead of implementing onclientclick you should optionaly just provide the attributes commandname and commandargument i.e then in your onrowcommand event handler you can add your code the click of the button will always trigger the onitemcommand event even if you do not specify the commandname attribute however this allows you to have multiple buttons on a row so that each one will perform a different functionallity

1510240
overwrite	preserve
a dictionary is more than structure - it also contains behavior when you assign to a key that already exists you overwrite that key etc. and that behavior cannot travel across the wire
in other words dictionaries and many other .net types are not interoperable so wcf will not attempt to preserve them in a servicecontract

1510424
abstract-class	superclass
surprisingly many examples explanations given here do not provide good arguments for using an abstract-class
merely putting common fields methods in a superclass does not require it to be abstract

1510448
daemons	systemd
if the daemons function doesn t exist on the systemd you re using you need to use setsid and fork instead
on linux look at the daemons function int daemons int nochdir int noclose

1510699
equals	compareto
for example add method defined in core set interface specifies that you can t add an element to the set if there already is an element whose equals method would return true with this new element as argument
well sortedset doesn t use equals it uses compareto

1510699
equals	compareto
well sortedset doesn t use equals it uses compareto
so if your compareto returns false your element will be added even if equals were to return true thus breaking the set contract

1510807
maven	pom.xml
i m not sure but i think that the maven archiver which is mainly used by plugins to handle packaging can be configured to achieve this
about the element the maven archiver reference says whether the generated archive will contain these two maven files the pom.xml file located in the archive in a pom.properties file located in the archive in the default value is true

1510821
cpu	processors
i ll consider you did due diligence and validated that the cpu consumption belongs to the sqlservr.exe process so we re not chasing a red herring here
if not please make sure the cpu is consumed by sqlservr.exe by checking the process processors performance counters

1510821
cpu	processors
if not please make sure the cpu is consumed by sqlservr.exe by checking the process processors performance counters
you need to understand the sql server cpu scheduling model as described in thread and task architecture

1511383
next	except
as far as how the comments should be handled the c99 standard says this 6.4.9 2 except within a character constant a string literal or a comment the characters introduce a comment that includes all multibyte characters up to but not including the next new-line character
and the c++ standard says 2.7 the characters start a comment which terminates with the next newline character

1511864
equals	compareto
as chssply76 wrote in a comment you can use hashcode to decide the compareto call in the case where two collections have the same size but are not equals
this works fine except in the rare case where you have two collections with the same size are not equals but have the same hashcode

1512183
clang	llvm
you can also change the compiler from gcc 4.x to clang llvm
that displays more errors and clang warnings one example is that nslog a value is value will warn you you are not passing in enough parameters

1512587
equals	compareto	comparator	comparable
note that the ordering maintained by a sorted set whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if the sorted set is to correctly implement the set interface
see the comparable interface or comparator interface for a precise definition of consistent with equals. this is so because the set interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a sorted set performs all element comparisons using its compareto or compare method so two elements that are deemed equal by this method are from the standpoint of the sorted set equal

1512923
inherited	subclassing
in other words it only allows other classes to inherited from it but cannot be instantiated
the advantage is that it enforces certain hierarchies for all the subclassing

1513003
getter	setter
properties could be renamed or they could have a setter getter added or removed
adding a setter getter is not breaking but all other property changes are breaking

1513143
superclass	subclassing
this means that superclass get the benefit of subclassing behaviors but it also means that overriding methods can theoretically get invoked before the constructor in that class
because all java method invocations that are not explicitly super invocations are dispatched to the most derived class even in superclass constructors

1513398
django	turbogears
and although django is making many of the same mistakes zope2 did they are also fixing them much faster so i completely expect much of this discussion to be moot in five years because i expect every single python web framework to use wsgi+webob+repoze+deliverance+buildout as a base by then
but even then i d go for frameworks where i can use the zope component architecture and zodb but that includes not only the ones made by the zope community but also for example turbogears

1513444
nsinteger	double
#endif from the docs therefore you can write it as you are receiving an error because you are declaring bvalue as a pointer to an nsinteger yet trying to initialize it with a double value
an nsinteger is not an object type it is simply a typedef for an int or long dependent on whether your application is 32 or 64-bit #if __lp64__ || target_os_embedded || target_os_iphone || target_os_win32 || ns_build_32_like_64 typedef long nsinteger

1514136
post	get
none of the answers code samples in the answers on this page were sufficient to stop me getting a string was not recognized as a valid datetime error but it s the closest i have got to finding the correct answer on so posting this link here in case this helps someone else - the answer i needed was found on this blog post - basically use datetime.parseexact with a format string instead of datetime.parse
i came across this question as i was having a problem with the utc dates you get back through the twitter api created_at field on a status

1514244
disk	ram
i haven t come across anything like that yet and i think there is not really any other way than testing for your specific scenarios. there are way too many factors involved to give a consistent answer what nic s are you using are they doing tcp checksum offloading how performant is your switching fabric what disk are you using how much cache do they have how much data are you transferring a lot of small packets or a few large packets etc. etc
when your are talking ram access times you re talking about 10-100ns nowadays vs probably around 4-8ms for harddrives

1514244
udp	tcp
theoretically udp should be be 30-50 faster than tcp because it s missing the extra trip for the ack and has a smaller header overhead however in reality there are many cases where tcp would outperform udp just because of congestion control
also tcp with nagle turned on batches packets which again wouldn t be a fair comparison to udp which doesn t do that

1514246
integer	unsigned
unlike previous integer models air integers do not require precise traps and consequently do not break or inhibit most existing optimizations
cert has developed a new approach to detecting and reporting signed integer overflow unsigned integer wrapping and integer truncation using the as-if infinitely ranged air integer model

1514995
inherited	subclassing
old answer below not looking for inherited but leaving for someone else ok i think i ran into this today
i think what you might want to do is define 2 classes as subclassing of a base class entity

1515142
try-catch	exception-handling
while i don t have any numbers i don t believe that try-catch has any significant impact on performance not that i have seen
i think that if you don t run into many exception-handling the performance impact will be basically nothing

1516550
hash	salt
if your old system used unsalted hash and vbulletin uses salt ones then if you want users to keep their passwords you will have to modify vbulletin to use unsalted ones too
i m not familiar with the vbulletin code but if each user has their own salt value perhaps just setting this to an empty string will suffice

1516601
hash-collision	key
developers do not have to work around the issue of hash-collision in hashmap in order to achieve program correctness
there are a couple of key things to understand here collisions are an inherent feature of hashing and they have to be

1516639
int	chars
their storage is that of short int but their semantics are those of the chars in a string
the language designers decided in this case to follow the lead of earlier languages like c and treat chars like int when doing mathematics on them that does not involve strings

1516639
int	chars
the language designers decided in this case to follow the lead of earlier languages like c and treat chars like int when doing mathematics on them that does not involve strings
if you want to treat them like short strings there are any number of ways to convert chars to strings

1516675
content-disposition	content-type
your content-disposition should be not sure if that s the problem though
i would also recommend using readfile to output the file also it can t hurt to use an exhaustive content-type header and set the content-transfer-encoding header content-transfer-encoding binary

1517045
versioning	upgrade
imagine you have an application that needs versioning 1 of libfoo but another application requires versioning 2
if you install everything into usr lib python2.4 site-packages or whatever your platform s standard location is it s easy to end up in a situation where you unintentionally upgrade an application that shouldn t be upgrade

1517670
ocaml	rust
other languages offer some form of type inference the capability of the type system to deduce the type of a variable ocaml haskell scala kotlin the main advantage here is that all kinds of checking can be done by the compiler and therefore a lot of trivial bugs are caught at a very early stage
examples c c++ java rust go scala dynamically typed languages a language is dynamically typed if the type is associated with run-time values and not named variables fields etc

1517704
chunked	transfer-encoding
but that doesn t even cover the potential for a server to send back a response with the transfer-encoding chunked header set
a chunked response could quite possibly never end

1518126
django	turbogears
i m new to python i want to learn it not just for web-projects but as a substitute to php for scripting small helpers what i didn t like about django to me looks like a close platform
orm template system sessions etc they all are django s on the other hand turbogears 2 uses already known open platforms and just glued them just like appfuse does it for java with turbogears 2 i learn sqlalchemy that i can use later for small python scripts or from the python shell to solve common tasks

1519660
plone	buildout
but if it s private packages that should not even be listed on pypi or packages only useful as a part of a large system like plone it s another matter
then you want easy___install and buildout etc s to look for eggs on your server

1519799
toolchain	binutils
here is a ms toolchain sdk+ide set listed ms toolchain i m not shure does ms release stand alone toolchain for compiler+linker but this could be found on msdn certainly
more info about sdks msdn summarize you can have any binutils toolsets installed on your development machine. however you need to set up your project properly to build it succesfully. for ex

1519900
inherited	subclassing
i think that in both cases the implementation should not be repetitive but implemented only once and inherited for example as needed
subclassing and their methods would only be needed for non-standard jobs like custom queries with their custom parameters

post	get
when your editing form gets deactivated and the data on it isn t valid yet post the form a message

lisp	scheme
update only a piece of the store thanks for the detailed comment by laurence gonsalves . it is however one of the few or even the only well-known success case of lisp in the real world and for some reason yahoo rewrote it in c++

stores was before it was bought by yahoo largely though not exclusively written in lisp
seeing how scheme is a variant of lisp any kind of problems

1522270
persistent	transient
i am also pretty certain that the issues you are seeing are not related to the code you have included above because even in the first case there is nothing in the code you have that will commit the changes to persistent storage
absent a call to nsmanagedobjectcontext save all changes to your object graph will be transient

1523151
profiling	benchmarking
never profiling unless the code does not meet specifications expectations
if you need to profiling this code write it both ways and benchmarking it with your expected load

1523383
inherited	properties
your experience with tttableviewcontroller is also going to be a little different than you might expect because it does not inherited from uitableviewcontroller
unlike most iphone tutorials that have the table s view controller also implement the uitableviewdelegate and uitableviewdatasource protocols three20 implements them through separate classes you are expected to set the controller s datasource properties with a model instance and the controller creates its own delegate in the createdelegate method which you can override

1523809
xsl-fo	xslt
the xslt processor may need to be replaced explicitely as described here of course you can also just continue to use xsltproc for generating the xsl-fo and then feed fop the fo file
as was noted at this is not directly a fop problem but one with the default xslt processor that is active in your java installation

1524031
memcpy	memmove
if it is a single object why not use assignment operator i suppose the compiler-generated assignment operator could be implemented in terms of memcpy if that is so advantageous and the compiler knows better whether your class is a pod. if you want to copy an array of objects you can use std copy
depending on the implementation this may end up using memmove one more thing that you can mess up - the buffers may overlap

1524391
cassini	iis
i would not recommend using hacks to use cassini as your host server - it s just not 100 the same and you might run into serious deployment problems in the end - just not worth it really
if you want to deploy to iis later use iis in your development and save yourself some grief

1525698
hex	binary
i recommend you take a look at the file in a hex editor and if you cannot work out the issue post the file and the code here
edit1 regarding your c++ code do not use the operator to read from a binary stream

1526470
websphere	ibm
take a look at ibm help writing websphere mq base java applications ibm has an api for interacting with queues
here s their sample i m not sure if the ibm jars are located at the base maven repo

1526793
stateless	stateful
i m in the stateful client-stateless server camp due to scaleability but when facing the hurdles of explaining why this and that became harder to implement using a stateless server you get kind of resigned in the long run this is where stateful server shines
eventhough i prefer stateful client this is not easy to implement efficiently using asp.net viewstate and perhaps this is where stateful web gets practical. i think stateful client stateless server makes you more aware of the amount of data that is transported back and forth between tires

1526793
stateless	stateful
eventhough i prefer stateful client this is not easy to implement efficiently using asp.net viewstate and perhaps this is where stateful web gets practical. i think stateful client stateless server makes you more aware of the amount of data that is transported back and forth between tires
that is sometimes hidden until trouble occures using stateful server programming model

1526930
ubuntu	linux
note that all four of the dhcp clients listed here can be installed on ubuntu and can replace the default dhcp client dhclient
with the wide variety of dhcp clients on linux -- pump dhcpcd dhclient udhcpc and quite possibly others that i do not know of -- this isn t possible in a general sense

1527033
googletest	qtestlib
you could integrate qtest into your new googletest based setup
i haven t tried it but based on how qtestlib is architected it seems like it would not be too complicated

1527046
codeigniter	yii
however for objectivity i should mention i tried both zend and codeigniter before
in the earlier releases of yii benchmark tests were very impressive and because the leadership doesn t want to have this framework bloated not all feature requests get implemented

1527423
yacc	bison
this is not terribly useful behavior but was inherited from the original yacc program
you can only have a single character between the quotes in bison -- any multiple character token must be recognized by the lexer as such and returned as a single token as described by acidzombie when you put multiple characters in quotes in bison as you have done it essentially just ignores all except for the first which means and are really the same token the same as giving the error you see

1527427
sharepoint	spsite
to summarize rwep to impersonate the app pool outside of sharepoint spsite impersonation to impersonate the app pool inside of sharepoint
reasons to elevate fall into two categories your code needs to perform operations in sharepoint for which the current user does not have permissions

1527916
versioning	upgrade
my versioning is a hybrid of features from the versioning 2.0 and 2.5- it has all of the reading functionality with some 2.5 upgrade but no writing
oh- and unlike either versioning 2.0 or 2.5 my versioning doesn t require that the first sheet in the excel document be named sheet1

1528145
gif	png
gif does not support alpha transparency
png works in all modern browsers whereas alpha transparency is not supported in ie6 natively

1528859
cvs	svn
which doesn t support cvs
svn book chapter on externals the only thing you should point at cvs is a gun

1529204
filesystems	xfs
this is the traditional way to do things but many modern filesystems designs do not satisfy this assumption
the following are examples of file systems on which shred is not effective or is not guaranteed to be effective in all filesystems modes log-structured or journaled file systems such as those supplied with aix and solaris and jfs reiserfs xfs ext3 etc. file systems that write redundant data and carry on even if some writes fail such as raid-based file systems file systems that make snapshots such as network appliance s nfs server file systems that cache in temporary locations such as nfs version 3 clients compressed file systems that being said there might be some way within cocoa or core foundation to allow you to write to a specific head cylinder sector etc

1529562
put	get
that is just the right place to put it and instantiating the object in an httpmodule is also appropriate
the cast really shouldn t be much of a problem but if you want to get away from that i d highly recommend an extension method for httpcontext for this.

1529816
junit	testng
and if you decide otherwise it is not a big undertaking to convert from junit to testng or visa versa
in testng you can define suites via the configuration file testng.xml which should match your needs

1529816
junit	testng
but i think you could also do that in junit which i am not too familiar with
what is nice in testng is that you can define dependencies

1530016
jquery	simplemodal
even with jquery do not confuse with jquery ui
i would recommend you simplemodal plugin by eric martin he is on stackoverflow too and has at least tried to answer every question that s related with his product

1530058
post	get
3 as has been mentioned elsewhere in the post it is generally a good idea not to just throw an exception as having information about how and where it occurred is often very useful in debugging
1 having a return statement after a thrown exception will not compile and you should get an unreachable code warning

1531002
daemons	systemd
the way to write a mac os x daemons is very much like the way you would approach it on a regular unix systemd
accordingly there are a few things to keep in mind non-interactive you don t get direct input from the user but you also have to use something like syslogd for output as the process is not attached to a terminal environment don t assume it has a particular current directory path default permissions or any other environmental settings - explicitly set these up security ensure the daemons has the barest minimum privileges required to perform its function and no more this is a huge topic in itself signals you will need to trap and respond to certain signals as these are typically used for process control eg

1531940
cng	cryptoapi
all new cng functionality is of course not
do you mean if windows 7 and windows server 2008 cryptoapi is backwards compatible with older versions of cryptoapi then yes

1532002
hex	binary
you can also use oct to translate binary octal or hex strings to numbers based on the prefix 0b - binary 0 - octal 0x - hex
if you have you can use and you ll get hex doesn t require the 0x at the beginning of the string

1533094
super	implements
it is not super obvious how to do this
but you can create a shared instance on nsconditionlock in the variable condlock like this and this is then how you would implements the waiting in my_connect and this is how you would signal the nsconditionlock that it is time to continue from you delegate method

1533097
int	double
if directly accessing the xloper via a c++ xll then you technically could access int values but this is a very non-standard and you can t do this from vb.net or c#. therefore i would focus on these int parameters first particularly with respect to passing in an int value directly versus passing in a cell reference that holds a numeric value
i m guessing that the non-optional a parameter might be able to accept a cell reference -- but maybe not i m not sure -- but i m even less sure that the optional parameters can accept a cell reference holding a double data type

1533114
xslt	xquery
i don t think they ll add support for xpath 2.0 or xslt 2.0 any time soon
however you shouldn t feel bad if these are not part of the bcl as long as you have 3rd party implementations available saxon xpath 3.1 xquery 3.1 xslt 3.0 xmlprime xpath 3.1 xquery 3.1 xslt 2.0 querymachine xpath 2.0 xquery 1.0 lightweight xpath2 for .net xpath 2.0 exselt xslt 3.0 microsoft is customer oriented

1533905
strdup	malloc	strdup	calloc
but to do what you want copy a string and allocate necessary space it will be more simple and more efficient to use strdup that does exactly that a malloc and a strcopy
you should also not forget to free space you allocated yourself using malloc calloc strdup or any other allocation function

1534229
stringbuilder	bufferedreader
i don t know clojure so i can t tell if you have some detail wrong in your code but using stringbuffer and appending the input line by line is the correct way to do it well using a stringbuilder initialized to the expected final size if known would bring significant but not dramatic improvements
if you run out of memory then maybe the content of your bufferedreader is simply too large to fit into your memory and there is no way to have it as a single string - in that case you ll either have to increase your heap size or find a way to process the data one small chunk at a time

1534286
inherited	properties
a has name return that however when you do a write the interpreter doesn t actually care about the inherited properties
interpreter i need to assign to properties name

1534769
uitableview	uisearchbar
actually if you removed the uisearchbar from the uitableview everything would have fit and it wouldn t need to scroll
my guess is that it s incorrectly determining the geometry when the uisearchbar is attached

1535237
nunit	mstest
unless you have a particular reason to take the nunit testdriven.net approach like you need a certain feature or you just prefer that way of setting up tests and trying to integrate it back into vs then i don t see any reason not to just use mstest which works right out of the box
if it just a simple application the mstest framework built into vs2008 should tick all the boxes

1535381
nunit	moq
nunit has something bundled for mocks but i d definitely point you to moq
rhino mocks has been the top dog for a while now but moq has an easier learning curve from online docs although it may not always handle edge scenarios.

1535381
nunit	mstest
i d recommend getting a thin book pragmatic unit testing in c# with nunit and going through it atleast once
on the nunit v mstest line i m not fit to comment

1535381
nunit	mstest
on the nunit v mstest line i m not fit to comment
0 flying-time with mstest

1536379
post	get
also you should use the prg post redirect get pattern to make sure that the credit card numbers aren t submitted twice
after the post don t just render a different view send a redirect so their browser does a get against another url - probably your confirmation page

1536379
ssl	https
you ll want to make sure you can t hit your controllers when you are not using ssl
this will help you catch any errors and ensure that no one uses http instead of https

1537265
sysml	uml
i suspect that now the much cheaper and more agile enterprise architect uml tool has an sysml offering that success will erode
i haven t talked to ea s designers but ea is built on a sql database back-end and the automation api is very obviously not a pure oo solution - for example you have to update different parts of the same property of a uml object using different apis a uml package is represented by both a package object and an element element and if you change the name of the package in one api you have to remember to change it in the other or it ll have a different name in the package tree and on any diagram

1537313
subclass	inherited
of course i would prefer that any subsequent subclass instances not get values from other instances but if that s going to happen it should be consistent
then don t inherited from a new instance of a inherited from a s prototype

1538783
pop-up	dialog
if winwait returns without success the dialog probably did not pop-up
if you know where in the setup the dialog pops up you can try this after you move through the wizard to this point winwait for the dialog

1539011
getter	setter
if the current value of the property as returned by the getter is same as the value to be set the setter is not called
traced output get called false set called with true current is false get called true note that the getter was called twice but the setter was called only once

1539011
getter	setter
traced output get called false set called with true current is false get called true note that the getter was called twice but the setter was called only once
in the second assignment since the current value and value to be set are same true the setter is not called

1539517
dictionary	map
use a reverse dictionary
the reverse dictionary will map each function reference to the exact name you gave it in fun_dict which may or may not be the name you used when you defined the function

1540080
post	get
the standard - and cleanest - approach is to have the same url display the form when fetched with get and accept the data when fetched with post
there s no clean way of doing this because you cannot redirect post requests and have the redirected request also make a post

1540216
put	get
but if for some reason your plugin is reloading anyway and you don t want it to you can put this in your plugin s init.rb to explicitly say it shouldn t reload see the rails docs on the configuration class for more detail
at first i was going to advise something about adding a development directory to the front of your load path in development mode so that your revisions would always get reloaded first.

1540382
hash	md5
not to repeat too much but instead to give a more detailed answer as sam152 said you must create an md5 hash from the user s email address which is then used in a get request to the gravatar server
the easiest way to gain access to md5 hashes is through digest part of the actionpack inside actionview gem

1540819
for-loop	loops
the simplest way is to use a for-loop another option is to use an extension method .
it s not possible with a standard foreach loops

1540898
versioning	upgrade
if you want to use the script i think it would be something like c change-svn-wc-format.py d my_repos 1.5 where you can use 1.4 1.5 or 1.6 as the repository versioning you want to use
--skip-unknown-format means that if the script finds a versioning it doesn t understand in some directory it skips that directory and continues with the upgrade

1541790
x86	mips
unfortunately x86 does not have a similar instruction breakdown as mips due to it being a cisc architecture
an x86 instruction can have anywhere between 1 and 16

1542553
passenger	webrick
this may not be the answer you re looking for but i ve found it very straightforward to just run passenger locally for development
you can always tail the development.log it s really just as easy as watching the terminal output from webrick

1543392
try-catch	exception-handling
you cannot achieve what you want with the use of try-catch
if g.run takes too much time or goes into an infinite loop that doesn t mean an exception-handling will be thrown

1544082
children	parent
the recommended way to create tabbed dialogs is to make the tab pages children of the dialog
the tab control simply controls which of the pages is visible but is not their parent

1544546
keydown	keyup
on keydown check what s in the list
however i m not sure that there are keydown keyup events for modifier keys like ctrl shift alt

1544992
inherited	properties
the following bindingflags modifier flags can be used to change how the search works bindingflags.declaredonly to search only the properties declared on the type not properties that were simply inherited
to summarize if you use the getproperties overload without parameters you will get all public properties

1545148
content-disposition	content-type	content-disposition	content-length
as for browsers not doing what you expect in terms of downloading things you might want to look at the content-disposition header
so anyhow the logic goes like this if the client indicates they can handle gzip encoding via the accept-encoding header or or similar then compress the file cache the compressed result somewhere write the correct headers for the response content-encoding gzip content-length n content-type text plain etc and then use sendfile 2 however that may or may not have been made available in your environment to copy the content from the open file descriptor into your response stream

1545401
ant	maven
i don t know of any ant doxia task it really would be simpler to use maven or the invoke mvn ant task from within your ant build to invoke doxia.
if this is really not feasible it should be fairly straightforward to cobble together a custom ant task to invoke doxia

1545401
ant	maven
if this is really not feasible it should be fairly straightforward to cobble together a custom ant task to invoke doxia
as requested some pointers to get started maven is based on plexus and the doxia components are available from the plexus container to an application

1546159
division	addition
however this is not true in the c# version because of the parentheses the addition will come first then the division
looks to me like you may have a problem in your c# code here math.pow 1d + interestrate 12d ... your vb6 code has 1 + m_dblinterestrate 12 ... vb6 has a higher precedence for the and operators than the + and - so the division will occur before the add

1547493
int	boolean	int	chars	int	double
in a 64-bit processor the registers are all 64-bit so if your local variable is assigned to a register and is a boolean byte short chars int float double or long it doesn t use memory and doesn t save any resources. objects are 8-byte aligned so they always take up a multiple of 8-byte in memory
this means boolean byte short chars integer long float and double atomicboolean atomicinteger atomiclong atomicreference all use the same amount of memory

1547501
onchange	onblur
and maybe keep the onchange event in order to know whether the onblur event handler should trigger the ajax request or not
i haven t really tried this except a few tests for answering this question but maybe you could get it working using the onblur event

1547810
curry	first-class
as for the example above we can use a notation s k 2 k i curry feys craig 1958 162 5 c 5 based on the fact that s k x y and k i x y can be proven to be equal already without resorting to extensionality
here x and y are not metavariables for infinitely many possible instances of cl-terms in equation schemes but are first-class citizens of the object language itself

1547996
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
technically yes but it s risky because while css syntax is mostly case-insensitive in some browsers under certain conditions class names are treated as case-sensitive as the spec does not specify how browsers should handle case when matching css rules to html class names
from the spec section 4.1.3 all css syntax is case-insensitive within the ascii range.

1548167
put	get
you could put it in the session or if you want to send it via a form you can serialize it the session has the advantage that the client doesn t see it therefore can t tamper with it and it s faster if the array is large
the disadvantage is it could get confused if the user has multiple tabs open

1548710
octal	hex
screen doesn t have any shorthand syntax for alt bindings but you can give it the octal code directly
for instance on my machine alt-x has the hex code f8 or 370 octal so putting escape 370x in my screenrc changed the escape code to alt-x tested and works with screen 4.00.03 on linux

1549350
put	get
using this article as a base about copy paste you may see that you can only put something to the clipboard but not directly changing the content of a foreign s process textbox
you might want to get the window handle of the box and send a message to it using the windows api

1549854
inherited	subclassing
answers isinstance caters for inherited an instance of a derived class is an instance of a base class too while checking for equality of type does not it demands identity of types and rejects instances of subtypes aka subclassing
normally in python you want your code to support inherited of course since inherited is so handy it would be bad to stop code using yours from using it

1549985
capitalize	capitalization
split the string into a list of words capitalize the first letter of each word join the words into a single string one-liner clear example
if str.title doesn t work for you do the capitalization yourself

1550287
post	get
this is because the actionlink method doesn t post any form values when it performs the ajax request
formcollection has a default binder associated with it which always initializes the collection and you should never get null

1551068
yacc	bison
recommendation get hold of the o reilly book on lex and yacc from the library or flex and bison an august 2009 update rewrite - probably not in the library yet
if you need a resource quicker then i suggest the unix version 7 manuals or the bison manual - both of which are available online

1551254
equals	compareto
it appears that both methods pretty much do the same thing but the compareto method takes in a string not an object and adds some extra functionality on top of the normal equals method
if all you care about is equality then the equals method is the best choice simply because it makes more sense to the next programmer that takes a look at your code

1551256
equals	compareto
i believe his opinion was just a matter of taste and i agree with you -- if all you need to know is the equality of the strings and not which one comes first lexicographically then i would use equals
the 2 main differences are that equals will take any object as a parameter but compareto will only take strings

1551256
equals	compareto
the 2 main differences are that equals will take any object as a parameter but compareto will only take strings
equals only tells you whether they re equal or not but compareto gives information on how the strings compare lexicographically

1551906
codeigniter	cakephp
codeigniter is another wonderful php framework but not quite so rails-ish
i would say cakephp is more rails-ish in its approach

1552324
int	double
i d tweak it a bit differently from the other posts create table measurement int measurementid not null auto_increment primary key id
create table measurementdata int measurementid not null int measurementdataentry not null double value not null primary key measurementid measurementdataentry constraint fk_data foreign key measurementid references measurement measurementid as per lukled measrementdataenry would be an ordinal value starting at 1 and incrementing by one for each data entry for that measurementid

1552777
equals	tostring
while you shouldn t rely on an ide eclipse provides this canned functionality by pressing alt + shift + s and selecting the equals and hashcode menu options
there is also a tostring option

1553734
vsto	add-in
but even vsto does not seem very native to excel
your requirement is exactly what lead me to develop exceldna after finding the automation add-in inadequate

1554330
srp	ocp	srp	principles
this is not .net specific but the most important i think is the solid principle. robert martin aka unclebob has a nice reference here . i will quote the most important section srp the single responsibility principles a class should have one and only one reason to change
ocp the open closed principles you should be able to extend a classes behavior without modifying it

1554330
lsp	principles
lsp the liskov substitution principles derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes
dip the dependency inversion principles depend on abstractions not on concretions

1555310
comparator	icomparer
if not methods such as contains must call the object.. equals object method which boxes the affected list element. if the value type implements the comparator interface and you own the source code also implement the comparator of t generic interface to prevent the binarysearch and sort methods from boxing list elements
if you do not own the source code pass an icomparer of t object to the binarysearch and sort methods moreover i particularly like the very last section of that paragraph which states it is to your advantage to use the type-specific implementation of the list of t class instead of using the arraylist class or writing a strongly typed wrapper collection yourself

1555534
war	manifest.mf
following files are not included in the signature meta-inf manifest.mf meta-inf sig- meta-inf .sf meta-inf .dsa meta-inf .rsa it doesn t know anything about war
if you sign the war it will be treated as jar so all the rules will apply

1557382
decoder	encoder
an amf3 decoder should not use the traits from a partially-constructed object -- such input should be flagged as erroneous
the strings-reference table is implemented at the encoder by tagging in-memory string objects as they are serialized

1558336
inherited	subclassing
two other inherited mapping strategies are table per class which won t work for you as it doesn t support identity and joined subclassing which will require you to split your orders table into two abstractorder and order plus add another table for externalorder
2 you can t override attributes on id within inherited hierarchy

1558343
rss	feed
the rss feed is actually part of the api so you should be fine as long as you re able to parse rss
the rss feed is public for public profiles and does not require an api key

1559323
maven	pom.xml
afaik maven doesn t expose the username and password properties of a server defined in the settings and or provide a mechanism similar to what the op described
but it wouldn t be wrong to be able to access them from a pom.xml

1560565
disk	ram
alternatively you could buy a solid state disk and not care about the filesize
or you could just preload the entire data into a collection into memory if you don t depend on keeping ram usage low will also be the fastest option

1560803
try-catch	exception-handling
you can isolate each line into a try-catch block however that just wreaks of codesmell to me
if you are certain that the lines after line one do not throw exception-handling or need to be executed regardless of the exception-handling and will not throw additional errors you can add a finally block after the first catch

1561626
class-method	delegation
instance methods allow you to use polymorphism while class-method do not at least in java and other statically typed languages
so you may benefit from using runtime delegation and polymorphism if your code is instance code

1561982
equals	gethashcode
if you re implementing a class you should implement a gethashcode routine that returns the same hash code for items that are equals
ideally you want to return a different hash code for items that are not equals whenever possible as this will make your dictionary lookups much faster

1562002
tostring	string.format
if the benefit you find in overloading tostring is for the debugger you should start using system.diagnostics.debuggerdisplayattribute
as for needing this implementation for converting objects to strings via string.format and or console.writeline they could have deferred to the system.convert.tostring object and checked for something like istringable failing over to the type s name if not implemented

1562075
hash	md5
if you know the hash contents are limited to a short set of possibilities you can use a rainbow table to attempt to brute-force reverse the hash but this will not work in the general case
md5 is an asymmetric hash -- not an encryption mechanism

1562075
hash	md5
md5 is an asymmetric hash -- not an encryption mechanism
you can t decrypt an md5

1562096
hash	md5
to create a md5 hash of a string in python you do as follows
md5 is not a encryption algorithm it is a hashing algorithm

1563266
yslow	pagespeed
fixing yslow warnings is generally pretty easy but you have to be careful to avoid creating caching and other problems which is why the default server config doesn t do these things
another answer recommended the pagespeed offering

1563732
pem	pkcs#12
windows doesn t understand openssl s pem key format
after generating your key pair you ll need to cram them into a pkcs#12 .pfx format to be able to import the whole key pair

1563886
int	double
int main hexdump_double 6.1026988574311e-320
which produces some exciting output double 40 30 00 00 00 00 00 00 6.1027e-320 as you can see that little floating-point number isn t any random pattern of bits

1564457
exif	jfif
the actual exif data is stored in the form of a small tiff file with exif-specific tiff tags for information that doesn t have a home in the tiff specification
when placed in a jpeg file really a jfif bitstream it is stored in a jpeg app1 marker which limits the total size of the exif data to just a bit less than 64kb

1564457
exif	jfif
when placed in a jpeg file really a jfif bitstream it is stored in a jpeg app1 marker which limits the total size of the exif data to just a bit less than 64kb
it shouldn t be that difficult to locate the app1 marker confirm it contains exif data and then parse out a specific collection of exif tags with fairly brute force coding

1565162
int	chars
copy_va_args -- accepts a printf format string and va_list arguments. advances the va_list pointer in p_arg_src in accord with the specification in the format string. if arg_dest provided is not null each argument is copied from p_arg_src to arg_dest according to the format string. int copy_va_args const chars fmt va_list p_arg_src va_list arg_dest const chars pch fmt
int processing_format 0

concurrenthashmap	blockingqueue
so choose not to share state as much as possible because if you do you need to synchronize or use a data structure that supports concurrent access like the concurrenthashmap
this is a good source for some general information when you are in a multithreaded environment in java and you want to do many things in parallel i would suggest using an approach which uses the concurrent queue like blockingqueue or concurrentlinkedqueue implementations and a simple runnable that has a reference to the queue and pulls messages of the queue

1565309
codeigniter	kohana
it came out of codeigniter and loading models etc is done just the way you proposed
although kohana reuses many common design patterns and concepts there are some things that make kohana stand out community not company driven

1565640
public	protected
which behaves similarly to java accessors that are not given a visibility eg public private protected by changing the private in spy to protected all 6 of your statements work. protected methods can be called by any instance of the defining class or their subclasses
either explicitly or implicitly called on self are valid statements for protected methods so long as the caller is either the class of the object responding to the call or inherits from it

1566958
uiview	calayer
each individual layer does not have to be backed by a view but the root layer in the hierarchy must be backed by a uiview
the point is not to avoid having copies of the calayer s which are quite lightweight but to avoid having copies of uiviews or more specifically the graphics contexts that back uiview s

1567313
put	get
just put a conditional like myformulafield on suppress this section
this should probably be done in the query that drives the report so the report is not chewing through a lot of records that never get displayed but you could always suppress the section the meeting details are in based on the custom formula field

1567753
for-loop	loops
i guess you can just manually check the condition within your for-loop continue if it s not met but a while loops makes more sense imo
your loops should not be for loops they should be while loops with an increment step

1568626
post	get
try the above and if you still have a problem post more code
i doubt you will get a smoking gun answer here as you have not posted enough code

1568940
inherited	properties
if you say display as a common type it shouldn t have some hybrid fusion of inherited it should pick up the display properties of the type
in your case the border width inclusion properties of a table vs a div

1569246
maven	pom.xml
according to the information at the maven build profile docs this shouldn t work
specifically they say build as specified inside of a profile is not a full implementation of the traditional build pom.xml element

1569400
getter	setter
with getter you should be able to obj class.field but not class.field obj
with setter vice versa

1570490
dictionary	map
notably the complexity does not depend on the length of the dictionary
for your dictionary index build a map map bag char list string

1571420
ant	maven
sbt is definitely the way to go over ant
ant will not give you congruency with maven project structures and would force you to roll your own dependency management

1571900
post	get	put	get
notes keep in mind rails only verifies not idempotent methods post put patch and delete
get request are not checked for authenticity token

1571900
post	get	put	get
lessons use authenticity_token to protect your not idempotent methods post put patch and delete
also make sure not to allow any get requests that could potentially modify resources on the server

1571977
boost	allocator
there s probably something in boost that provides this the closest i ve personally seen is boost.array which is insufficient
however if you re just looking to model the important subset of std string it s not very difficult to make a fixed-length equivalent for anyone asking about why bothering to do this at all the main benefit is to avoid memory allocator without losing most of the useful std string api

1572125
set	bag
the semantics of a bag do not match that of a set which is that a set can only have unique instances and a bag can have duplicate instances
as a fair comment a list does not match exactly the semantics of a bag either a bag does not have an index but it s close enough for nhibernate

1572571
gwt	icefaces
if you decide not to abandon all your works - you can also leverage gwt with seam
jsf - richfaces or icefaces with seam it s a nice pack

1572688
onmouseup	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
updated so it looks like if your mouse is no longer over the element on which onmouseup is bound it won t see the mouseup event
makes sense when you stop and think about it but when the mousedown event happens over the element we expect as ui users for it to know when it was released even if it isn t over the element

1572902
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
from msdn while the sqldatareader is being used the associated sqlconnection is busy serving the sqldatareader and no other operations can be performed on the sqlconnection other than closing it
this is the case until the close method of the sqldatareader is called. for example you cannot retrieve output parameters until after you call close

1575282
punctuation	words
the general algorithm is going to go like this - obtain text - strip punctuation special characters etc. - strip simple words - split on spaces - loop over split text - add words to array hashtable etc if it doesn t exist
if it does increment counter for that words the end result is a frequency count of all words in the text

1575304
cpu	affinity
cpu affinity is a scheduler property that bonds a process to a given set of cpus on the system
the linux scheduler will honor the given cpu affinity and the process will not run on any other cpus

1575304
cpu	affinity
the linux scheduler will honor the given cpu affinity and the process will not run on any other cpus
note that the linux scheduler also supports natural cpu affinity the scheduler attempts to keep processes on the same cpu as long as practical for performance reasons

1575304
cpu	affinity
therefore forcing a specific cpu affinity is useful only in certain applications
the cpu affinity is represented as a bitmask with the lowest order bit corresponding to the first logical cpu and the highest order bit corresponding to the last logical cpu. not all cpus may exist on a given sys tem but a mask may specify more cpus than are present

1575675
dictionary	map
here is the entry point now that is simple enough it just builds a dictionary map for the objects during the clone and populates it with any object that should not be cloned
you will note the comparer provided to the dictionary is a referencecomparer let s take a look at what it does that was easy enough just a comparer that forces the use of the system.object s get hash and reference equality.

1576043
put	get
in any case i usually put all my code into sps some code generated whether they use views or not and that s that you pretty much only ever write the join once
create a view or inline table-valued function to get parameterization

1576208
submit	submission
it is just a normal button and will not submit the form unless you purposely make it submit the form via javascript
and in the case where a form element has no action attribute specified this submission simply sends the data back onto the same page

1576518
versioning	upgrade
edit that being said be advised that both drupal 4.7 and the 4.7 versioning of the openid module are not being maintained anymore and contain severe security issues
if you don t want your website to be taken over upgrade to drupal 5 or better 6 and use the maintained and secure openid modules of these versions

1576655
post	put
which is why post are not allowed
instead you want to use put because you re updating an existing record

1577153
ssl	https
we decided to use godaddy as we also use the ssl certificate for regular browsers and those show a warning message to the user if they encounter a self-signed certificate which obviously scares people away
if you use https ssl on the server side it shouldn t matter if you use xml-rpc or json-rpc

1577205
super	self
two small things i noticed which might help solve the problem you are not releasing the pin in the first code sample which would create a leak you are not checking if self super init
in your second code sample was successful if self super init ... return self

1577943
stdout	fflush
if that doesn t work pass system.out into your dll and use this printstream instead of stdout
but fflush stdout

1578723
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
following these guidelines you shouldn t catch exception since it doesn t fit either of the above criteria meaning it s not a runtimeexception and it s not a specialized exception sublcass to indicate an expected error
it s a long article but this proposes you use checked exceptions when the client expects this error to occur regularly and must handle it ex user-entered data did not pass validation use unchecked-exception for unexpected conditions ex db server went down in theory #1 expected errors should have their own exception type and the only place that should catch a #2 a runtimeexception is some type of top-level handler that catches the exception logs it and shows the user an error message and even here you should probably catch throwable to make sure any uncaught exceptions are handled

1578875
superclass	subclassing
add a method _validate_b self b single leading underscore to indicate protected callable from derived classes but not by general client code that validates the value of b which only subclassing know vs the value of a which the abstract superclass does know
make subclassing responsible for calling the validation method whenever they re doing something that could change their internal value for b

1578875
superclass	subclassing
in your very general case the superclass cannot identify when b s value changes
since the responsibility of that change lies entirely with the subclassing then the responsibility for triggering validation must also be with them the superclass can perform validation given the proposed new value of b but it cannot know when validity must be checked

1579042
superclass	subclassing
if this is what you want then your design must assign responsibility by decomposing things into the part the superclass is responsible for and the part the subclassing is responsible for
the golden rule is to encapsulate property_b so that the subclassing provides part of the implementation but not all of it

1579321
bazaar	svn
i haven t used bazaar myself but i read it s very nice
if you re considering svn because i don t need the distributed part the modern vcses are not only distributed but much much more elegant in functionality

1579334
gridview	formview
hence in a gridview you can access the column name through the sortexpression
there does not appear to be any way to get at this information from a formview as the column name is not stored at the level you want it

1579699
multiplying	add
on the x86 platform there are quite a few ways to multiplying something by 2
i would expect a compiler to do add ax ax which is intuitively more efficient than your shl because it doesn t involve a potentially stored constant 1 in your case

1579788
udp	tcp
udp information another point i would like to make is to not use raw socket as your first tcp connection use the tcpclient class. tcpclient
i would suggest using udp rather than tcp with manual ack commands this way you don t get the constant connected sockets as per your boss

1579936
cpu	processors
answering the first question apps which benefit most and most easily from multicore processors are server apps which service many clients and have high per-client cpu cost like web servers database servers and other application servers-- and apps which run on top of those servers
by spreading client load across several processors as long as those clients aren t contending on shared resources shared data or a disk drive you ll get a large speedup

1580424
int	double
when it is forced to assign that int result to a double variable it converts the int 0 to a double 0.0
it is not necessary to make both operands double if either one is double the compiler will convert the other to double as well before performing the operation

1580533
implements	extends
it is not however possible to have two different portions of a partial class implements the same partial method
generally partial methods are used in code-generated partial classes as a way of allowing the non-generated part of extends or customize the behavior of the portion that is generated or sometimes vice versa

1580612
ant	pom.xml	ant	maven
i believe this is how you would reference that jar in your ant file ideally you shouldn t have to reference specific jars but rather reference the entire classpath for the appropriate scope as the somewhat sparse documentation for the plug-in indicates
if you still have trouble please post the tag for a maven pom.xml dependency you are using and i can try to be more specific

1580623
x86	64bit
in that case the correct solution was to explicitly compile to x86 this is a small tool that would not gain from running in 64bit
so my application runs as a 32bit application even on a 64bit windows

1580870
submit	submission
personally i wouldn t submit my credit card details through an unsecured page
a large and increasing proportion of web users expect to see ssl the padlock when submission sensitive details over the web

1580919
bids	ssis
if the error was raised while you are in bids then ajdams solution will not work as it only applies to errors raised while running the package from the sql server agent
the primary problem is that ssis is struggling to resolve the meta data

1580919
put	get
instead create a working database and put all your objects in it
obviously this probably won t work if you are trying to get the data on a server where you aren t a dbo like a production server so you can t rely on this solution

1580936
integer	unsigned
depending on whether you re using an unsigned integer or not and which version of mysql you re running you run the rink of getting nasty negative values for the primary key or worse the row simply won t be inserted and will throw an error
that said you can easily change the size type of the integer in mysql using an alter command to preemptively stop this from happening

1581157
filesystems	ntfs
my guess is that one or both of your files are on a filesystems that splice does not support
your example runs on my system when both files are on ext3 but fails when i use an external drive i forget offhand if it is dos or ntfs

1581197
post	get
on the last page use post to go to the other page
although since you re not actually changing anything on your server you may want to stick with get anyway with the previous and next page buttons being form buttons your selections will be passed in the url

1581343
scrummaster	sprint
the scrummaster is part of the team and may decide to take on tasks to facilitate the removal of any impediments that the team runs into but that does not mean that the team reports to the scrummaster
the team also makes a commitment to the product owner po when they agree on the goal and deliverable for the sprint

1581365
for-loop	loops
a for-loop doesn t do that
so you cant define it again after the first loops

1581842
inherited	subclassing
my interpretation of prefer composition over inherited is roughly that if you don t need polymorphic behavior then you should use composition instead of inherited
with the itriggerable approach you re not solving the problem of having to write a subclassing for every new event

1581997
strtok	malloc
also if you re using threads and the crt is not thread-aware strtok will likely crash your app
they are then copied on to to a malloc d char in dest

1582007
google-chrome	firefox
file uploads using the xmlhttprequest object is not possible in all browsers only firefox and safari google-chrome support it so for a cross-browser implementation use the trick
if you want a real xhr file upload i have written an extended article on how to do it in firefox 3

1582611
udp	tcp
source addresses for udp cannot be trusted
source addresses for tcp can to an extent you know the data has to be coming from the ip address in question or someone along the route

1582763
pthreads	fork
linux osx actually pthreads programming any language that have pthreads calls general scheme setup a socket.
fork close 0 close 1 not necessary dup2 will close it too.

1582787
processors	hyperthreading
note here doesn t mean hyperthreading just normal multi-core processors functionalities
please google processors pipeline multi port parallel to learn more

1583082
free	malloc	free	calloc	free	realloc
second you must have as many calls to free as you do to malloc and calloc but realloc can mess with the counting
in my code i have in general terms unless parse allocates the space it keeps you cannot use the dest structure or more precisely the pointers into the line within the dest structure after the call to free

1583082
free	malloc
the first free of the part of dest probably has a pointer to line and therefore frees the whole block of memory
all the subsequent frees on the parts of dest are trying to free an address not returned by malloc and valgrind is trying to tell you that

1583082
free	malloc
all the subsequent frees on the parts of dest are trying to free an address not returned by malloc and valgrind is trying to tell you that
the free line operation then fails because the first free of the pointers in dest already freed that space

1583082
strdup	strtok
the function strdup already mentioned by others will do the job neatly and reliably
note that after refactoring you will still need to release line but you will not release any of the pointers returned by strtok

1583082
free	strdup
note that you will need to free each of the separately allocated strdup d strings as well as the array of character pointers that are accessed via dest
alternatively do not free line immediately after calling parse

1583336
put	get
they can it s the only wrong thing i can see. put your javascript into cdata tags
see unfortunately this is not parsed correctly by every browser so you ll have to javascript- comment it out to get it working

1583370
udp	tcp
if it receives it as udp is not as reliable as tcp of course
i you are reading from a tcp socket you can t assume when the end of line will be reached. therfore you ll need something like that assuming you are using n n as a delimiter

1583479
public	protected
you can expose the base protected method with a public method on the derived class for example you might be using this extract and override pattern already to override virtual properties of the base class for dependency injection in which case this may be a viable option for you
i agree with the point that has been made about not testing private methods per se and that tests should be written against the public api but there is another option you haven t listed above

1583479
public	protected
i agree with the point that has been made about not testing private methods per se and that tests should be written against the public api but there is another option you haven t listed above
you could make the methods protected then derive from the class under test

1583683
packets	multicast
in particular the egress ipv6 packets egress path ip6_output.c while you re in there you could also take a look at the socket calls leading up to it etc
for multicast assuming you re making it to ip6_output it looks like the only possible way to get this error is by not specifying the interface to send on

1584076
xsl-fo	xslt
there are a number of ways you can edit the template for documents to be created in xsl-fo
typically this template is xslt that you apply to your xml data but this is not a requirement

1584131
lisp	scheme
it s a lisp which is worth learning
you get lisp macros destructuring first class functions and closures the repl and dynamic typing - plus literals for lists vectors maps and sets - all on top of interoperability with java libraries and there s a clr version being developed too. it s not exactly the same as scheme or common lisp but learning it will help you if you ever want to work through the structure and interpretation of computer programs or grok what paul graham s talking about in his essays and you can relate to this comic from xkcd

1584143
pyuic	pyqt
what was happening was that i called pyuic without the -x attribute so the code just creates the ui but not the code for running it anyway your help was very valuable
i m doing very newbie questions well because i m a pyqt newbie.

1584323
short	base
the short answer is that floating-point binary arithmetic is necessarily an approximation and it s not always the approximation you would guess
this is because cpus do arithmetic in base 2 while humans usually do arithmetic in base 10

1585114
strncmp	memcmp
for this example strncmp is ok
in general memcmp is better because it doesn t have to worry about string termination so even if the byte stream tag you are comparing contains ascii nul 0 characters memcmp will work

1585548
uiview	uiwindow
the interesting bit here is that uiwindow is itself a subclass of uiview so you can add all four views to your window directly
this may not be the best approach but it s perhaps the simplest. all you really have to do is initialize each of your four views programmatically with the location and dimensions you want them to have in the uiwindow

1585666
mouseover	mouseleave
edit the difference between mouseenter and mouseover is that mouseenter and mouseleave don t bubble
this means that you ll get a mouseover event if the mouse moves into any element inside the one you bound to which is probably not what you want whereas you ll only get a mouseenter event if the mouse entered that element itself

1586300
post	put
we had a situation where we needed to persist the url hash across asp.net post backs
as the browser does not send the hash to the server by default the only way to do it is to use some javascript when the form submits grab the hash window.location.hash and store it in a server-side hidden input field put this in a div with an id of urlhash so we can find it easily later

1586387
put	get
put another way the view layer should not care how exactly the data is retrieved and parsed and should have the flexibility to call on various sources of information
likewise the data layer should not care how the data should be processed and should only be concerned with where to get the data from

1586400
inherited	properties
from the docstring of the method utility to set up the prototype constructor and superclass properties to support an inherited strategy that can chain constructors and methods
static members will not be inherited

1586488
spaces	linefeed
if your fields alow zero-length strings and can have white spaces in them here s one solution i m assuming you re writing your sql to execute in access itself as trim and len are access vba functions both are provided by the access expression service using vba so this wouldn t work via odbc or oledb
now that ignores other kinds of issues in those fields such as tabs or cr linefeed characters

1586922
innodb	myisam
this will not work for innodb tables and may or may not work for other storage engines with which i am less familiar
mysqlhotcopy if you need to dump the contents of a database while the database server is running you can use mysqlhotcopy note that this only works for myisam and archive tables copying the entire data folder if you are copying the entire database installation so all of the databases and the contents of every database you can just shut down mysqld zip up your entire mysql data directory and copy it to the new server s data directory

1587060
client-side	server-side
as for the configuration utility sql server network configuration is all about configuration of network protocols on the server side of things sql native client configuration is the client-side configuration if you have a dev box with both on it you ll see both
a regular pc connecting to a sql server typically doesn t have sql server itself installed on it locally so the server-side settings are meaningless there obviously

1587150
integer	unsigned
for every unsigned 64-bit integer in ascending order iterate over the list until you find the target integer or you reach the end of the list
if you reach the end of the list the target integer is the smallest integer not in the list

1587509
hex	binary
you can use binary literals or hex for example binary literals only work for python 2.6 or later and are of the form 0b11110000
if you are using python 2.6 or later then you might want to look at the bytearray type as this will let you treat the data as binary and so not have to use the call to ord

1587792
imperative	declarative
when you use an api you instantiate objects and call methods in an imperative manner
on the other hand a good dsl should be declarative representing rules and relationships in your problem domain not instructions to be executed

1588292
versioning	upgrade
they switched to serials in drupal 5 but for some reason that i do not remember they still kept the sequences table until dropping it in versioning 6
so if i where in your position i d add an intermediate step and upgrade migrate to a drupal 5 install first then do another upgrade to drupal 6

1588365
feof	fread
google finds this it says the author has yet to see any student use the feof function correctly
to summarize the c file functions like fread and fwrite return status values anyway which you blink should not ignore blink

1588498
inherited	properties
the first version is better as improved upon by ck - use composition instead of inherited
you are advised not to add properties to collections which is effectively what you re doing in version 2

1588505
maven	m2e
the m2e plugin is not really needed for neither clover-maven nor clover-eclipse but it s nice when working with eclipse and maven
i m using the clover-report along with the automated site generation by maven

1588999
try-catch	exception-handling
a caller that suspects that they might say be causing a path not found exception-handling by calling your code cannot wrap their call in a try-catch which catches ioexception
they have to catch your recursionexception and then write a bunch of code to interrogate it to determine what kind of exception-handling it really was

1589207
lisp	prolog
well if you consider lambda calculus a form of logic then lisp has been showing off its benefits pretty well by being since 1958 the language whose expressive power other language aspire but do not manage to reach
then there s prolog the only other serious language i know that tries to be explicitly grounded in formal logic

1590087
ant	maven
based on the code that singleshot linked to and random poking until it worked here s how i got this problem working i say in quotes because it feels very tenuous. here s the way to make it properly work some important things to note you cannot use the maven dependency as a refid in setting the ant property
you have to use to get the maven var value

1590087
ant	maven
maven does address some things that aren t addressed implicitly by ant but with some up front planning ant is the much more flexible better documented and the less buggy tool
if you decide to go the ant route make sure to define a structure for your projects figure out your dependency system use one

1590491
gtk	cairo
i ve done something like that before for a different purpose with gtk on x which indirectly uses cairo
if you don t want to do it that way and cairo doesn t provide an api you might be able to add one

1590696
versioning	upgrade
that is your question shouldn t be what versioning number should i use but rather when should i do these changes
if you are totally committed to binary compatibility you should put off these changes until a release that contains significant improvements justifying the cost of upgrade

1591713
short	base
that last will put it over the top and cause a std bad_alloc exception since my limit is just short of 64k
unfortunately gcc s std basic_string max_size implementation does not base its result on the allocator you use so it will still claim to be able to allocate more

1591786
folder	directory
check if the files in your your bin folder are even under version control you can do an svn add if not
another possibility is that the files in the bin directory are being ignored by subversion

1591999
sudo	passwd
mine looks like this your apache configuration 4 i ve run sudo -u mysql mysql_install_db5
i ran mysqladmin -u root passwd mypw and got an error saying the mysql could not connect through the socket

1592312
chown	sudo
if you own the directory but not the file you can copy the file rm the original then mv it back and then you will be able to chown it
the easy way to temporarily be root is to run the command via sudo

1592446
post	put	post	get	put	get
this allows user agents to represent other methods such as post put and delete in a special way so that the user is made aware of the fact that a possibly unsafe action is being requested
there you go get should not change anything post is for thing that change the server unsafe operation

1592446
post	get
there you go get should not change anything post is for thing that change the server unsafe operation
i should be able to call get any number of time

1592510
post	get
i had a post half-prepared explaining this as a bug in warnings and then i realized it s not it s just a really evil subtlety in the way warnings works
warnings starts looking for a relevant stack frame to get the warning bits from in warnings warn s caller s caller

1592903
post	put
these methods are - put - delete - post
rfc 2616 states in section 13 that post requests should not be cached

1593069
width	margin
from msdn retrieves the width of the object including padding but not including margin border or scroll bar
try the clientwidth property like so from the mozilla developer center clientwidth is the inner width of an element in pixels

1593069
width	margin
try the clientwidth property like so from the mozilla developer center clientwidth is the inner width of an element in pixels
it includes padding but not the vertical scrollbar if present if rendered border or margin

1593846
superclass	subclassing
using member variables with the same name as in a superclass should be avoided as it s confusing and it s not doing what you might think it does
you are declaring member variables wheels and lights in class vehicle and then you re declaring member variables with the same name in subclassing car and bmwcar

1594240
maven	cargo
to me cargo shouldn t fail and this is likely a bug in cargo s maven 2 plugin or in the core api that should handle this case gracefully
i d open an issue in cargo s issue tracker

1594570
spweb	spsite
do it within a rwep and make sure you dispose of your spsite spweb objects correctly
not the most efficient solution to this problem but you can iterate through all the site collections webs in the web application and then call web.doesuserhavepermissions userid spbasepermissions.open where web is a spweb object and userid is domain user.name of the user you are checking access permissions for

1595326
superclass	subclassing
your case is a bit different in that your class is intended to be used as a superclass so testing it via a subclassing makes a lot of sense since the class isn t intended to stand on its own
in this case you are basically doing a variant of test-specific subclassing

1595869
superclass	subclassing
edit in the case of the generic abstract superclass there are a couple of options
one is have the constructor and then have the subclassing just have to call it by not having a no-arg constructor

1596156
folder	directory
if it doesn t find one in there it will also look for an index page in the shared folder
from the asp.net mvc nerd dinner sample chapter asp.net mvc applications by default use a convention-based directory naming structure when resolving view templates

1596646
ienumerable	ilist
if the collection is unordered or doesn t need random access ienumerable is correct
if it s a list and you want to expose it as one then declare the method or property to return ilist but you may well need to return a readonlycollection wrapper over that collection either directly or using syntax such as list.asreadonly

1597016
inherited	properties
one caveat prototypal inherited is for lack of a better word shallow
if the object has any array or object properties then modifying them will modify the original which may not be what you want

1597177
ninject	spring.net
for reference the software stack i m using is asp.net mvc fluent nhibernate on top of nhibernate ninject for dependency injection
i have not used spring.net so i can t comment on that

1597375
post	get
in general if you re not expecting a lot of information from the client i d set up the server to respond to get requests as opposed to post requests
an advantage i like is simply being able to specify what i want in the url this can t be done if it s expecting a post request

1597375
post	get
an advantage i like is simply being able to specify what i want in the url this can t be done if it s expecting a post request
i would point you to the rfc for http...probably the best source for information..maybe not the most user friendly way to get your answers but it should have all the answers you need

1598077
inherited	subclassing
for example here is a syntactical-sugar version either version has the drawback that the constructor function cannot be inherited as it is in many languages
so even if your subclassing adds nothing to the construction process it must remember to call the base constructor with whatever arguments the base wanted

1598429
strncmp	strcmp
if that s not what you want but you want to use strncmp anyway you would write this will correctly reject commander
you d be looking for strcmp from the header

1599446
qdockwidget	qwidget
alternatively if you want to implement an equivalent of qdockwidget from scratch you probably don t need the private qdockwidget
subclassing qwidget and then having a private qdockwidget attribute of course does make sense but it will probably not help you for implementing your own dock widget as long as i understand it correctly

1599815
jtextfield	jlabel
you cannot mix applet and swing components for instance you cannot place a jtextfield on an applet contentpane. if you are extending to an applet not japplet use textfield instead of jtextfield
button label textfield panel are for applet jbutton jlabel jtextfield jpanel are for japplet please take note of the prefix

1600035
versioning	upgrade
sometimes you do have to have objects that aren t perfect in design because you still have to support data from old versioning
this may not really be the answer you are looking for but it sounds like you are overcomplicating the problem by trying to manage this as an upgrade where you aren t going to continue to support the old version

1600586
division	multiplication
on most architectures the division instruction puts the quotient in one register and the remainder in another
if your division instruction is not fast enough but the multiplication instruction is you can use the following technique and it sounds as if this is the technique you re after

1601033
ordinals	difference
imho declaring ordinals types const makes no sense and as you say requires you to introduce local variables often
declaring ordinals types const makes no difference because they are copied anyway call-by-value so any changes to the variable do not affect the original variable

1601783
int	double
if your int consume less than 52 bits then it should be convertible without problem to ieee 754 double
i assume i know for sure in case of java but not c# and lazy to check that int is 32 bits and long is 64 bits

1601783
int	double
i assume i know for sure in case of java but not c# and lazy to check that int is 32 bits and long is 64 bits
so for sure int can fit in double without any problem both sign and unsign

1602386
interpreted-language	forth
interpreted-language can definitely be used in realtime environments
not all implementations of forth are interpreted though

1602680
int	chars
the + operator will translate to and i + s will return a string which cannot be assigned to an int
this cannot be allowed for a similar reason that c + s returns a string which you are trying to assign to a chars

1602981
hash	md5
as well re-applying the hash f f x isn t going to product x again
the details a hash function can be as simple as add 13 to the input or complex like a cryptographic hash such as md5 or sha1

1603140
cpu	affinity
however there are instances where it is necessary to set the cpu affinity
for example in real-time systems where the cost of migrating a thread from one core to another which can happen at any time if the cpu affinity has not been set can introduce unpredictable delays that can cause tasks to miss their deadlines and which preclude real-time guarantees

1603140
cpu	affinity
for example in real-time systems where the cost of migrating a thread from one core to another which can happen at any time if the cpu affinity has not been set can introduce unpredictable delays that can cause tasks to miss their deadlines and which preclude real-time guarantees
you can take a look at this article about a multi-core aware implementation of real-time corba that among other things had to set the cpu affinity so that cpu migration could not result in missed deadlines

1603333
converter	multibinding
it has no clue that your converter is actually based off of a sub-property
what you can do is use a multibinding where you bind not only the main property but also a specific sub-property

1603473
iasyncresult	idisposable
if iasyncresult was idisposable disposal of the object would take care of cleaning up the handle
as it is not the handles get cleaned up when the garbage collector runs and calls the finalizer of the iasyncresult object

1603679
mp3	ogg
but it does not support mp3 only ogg
on chrome it might work with mp3

1604257
super	extends
it would have been super correct if adding a final qualifier to class test would have allowed access to field s but it does not
extends test and not test

1604301
allocator	stl
unfortunately stl allocator cannot have state or at least have to be very careful how that state is used - each instance of a particular allocator type must be equivalent for stl containers to work effectively with them
i don t recall the details right now but i know that scott meyers discusses this problem at length in effective stl item 10 be aware of allocator conventions and restrictions

1604301
allocator	stl
for example see this paragraph from an article by anthony aue improving performance with custom pool allocator for stl a potentially more serious caveat is that since the allocator uses nonstatic data it s not technically standard compliant because the standard requires that allocator of the same type be equivalent
see effective stl item 10 for a thorough explanation of the issue

1604800
folder	directory
the only rule is upon extracting the extraction happens to a particular root or parent folder
you cannot extract to 7 different directory scattered about the filesystem the resulting exe requires the .net framework 2.0 or later in order to run but nothing else

1605197
jobs	cron
i m just saying that administration of jobs doesn t end when you deploy them
you can probably use something like cfengine chef for deployment it can deploy everything - including cron jobs however if you ask this question - it could be that you have many production servers each running large number of scheduled jobs. if this is the case you probably want a tool that can not only deploy jobs but also track success failure allow you to easily look at logs from the last run run statistics allow you to easily change the schedule for many jobs and servers at once due to planned maintenance... etc

1606481
maven	pom.xml	inherited	properties
the project has the following structure . |-- my-module | |-- pom.xml | -- src | |-- main | | -- java | -- test | -- java -- pom.xml the parent pom.xml is defined as follow adapted to my platform and this is the pom.xml of the module if i run maven from the parent and if i run maven from the module as you can see the profile is activated but not active and the properties defined in the profile in the parent pom.xml is inherited
project inheritance should work here properties are inherited if you place them in the parent pom.xml and if the profile is activated

1606923
dictionary	map
if you would solve the problem in the object model using dictionary there is the option of directly map the dictionary as map but then the data is not in columns but in rows
or you map the dictionary as dynamic component which will map to columns

1607031
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc
instead you have to do something like of course i understand the rationale behind keeping the original buffer intact on failure but my use case has popped up enough that i generally code my own functions to handle that case something like the relevant section in the c11 standard states my italics 7.20.3.4 the realloc function if ptr is a null pointer the realloc function behaves like the malloc function for the specified size
otherwise if ptr does not match a pointer earlier returned by the calloc malloc or realloc function or if the space has been deallocated by a call to the free or realloc function the behavior is undefined

1607775
submit	submission
only one form will be submitted you can not submit multiple forms. you can create multiple hidden fields or you can construct a single hidden field in that form then use javascript to collect all the data from the various forms then create a json string set the value of the hidden one and submit
edit say you have a single hidden input like this you could use jquery to do this to get the value from other forms is as simple as calling #elementid .val before form submission

1608621
getter	setter
i usually use getreference method when i do not need to access database state i mean getter method
just to change state i mean setter method

1609031
waitpid	posix
the original posix standard left the behaviour of setting sigchld to sig_ign unspecified. linux 2.6 conforms to this specification. however linux 2.4 and earlier does not if a wait or waitpid call is made while sigchld is being ignored the call behaves just as though sigchld were not being ignored that is the call blocks until the next child terminates and then returns the process id and status of that child
i was ignoring sigchld from the waitpid man page posix.1-2001 specifies that if the disposition of sigchld is set to sig_ign or the sa_nocldwait flag is set for sigchld see sigaction 2 then children that terminate do not become zombies and a call to wait or waitpid will block until all children have terminated and then fail with errno set to echild

1609708
libevent	epoll
unfortunately there is no abstraction library to do this that works on most unix platforms note that libevent is only single-threaded as are most of these event-loop libraries so you ll have to do the dirty work yourself
on linux that means using edge-triggered epoll with a pool of worker threads windows would have i o completion ports which also works fine in a multithreaded environment - i am not sure about other unixes

1610079
getter	setter
i have always preferred to omit the get on my getter as you do with rate instead of getrate
but overloading for the setter does not seem like a very good idea to me since the name rate doesn t convey that the object is being mutated

1610454
return-type	return-value
-wreturn-type warn whenever a function is defined with a return-type that defaults to int
also warn about any return statement with no return-value in a function whose return-type is not void falling off the end of the function body is considered returning without a value and about a return statement with an expression in a function whose return-type is void

1610562
interpreted-language	compiled-language
this is certainly not to say that performance is not an issue with interpreted-language just that it is often not as bad as most would suggest
keep in mind that even with the performance problems though it is often easier to achieve the same tasks as a compiled-language in less and more efficient code making the performance loss during compilation negligible over the execution time of a program

1610563
interpreted-language	compiled-language
advantages of interpreted-language interpreted-language give programs certain extra flexibility over compiled-language
features that are easier to implement in interpreters than in compilers include but are not limited to platform independence java s byte code for example reflection and reflective usage of the evaluator a first-order eval function dynamic typing ease of debugging it is easier to get source code information in interpreted-language small program size since interpreted-language have flexibility to choose instruction code dynamic scoping automatic memory management disadvantages of interpreted-language an execution by an interpreter is usually much less efficient then regular program execution

1610991
versioning	upgrade
incompatibilities between java se 6 and j2se 5.0 incompatibilities in j2se 5.0 since 1.4.2 incompatibilities in j2se 1.4.2 incompatibilities in j2se 1.4.1 so as written each versioning of java se has upwards binary-compatibility with the previous versioning except for the listed incompatibilities which are considered as minor
that said no one forces you to upgrade as long as support is not an issue

1611172
width	height
a span is by default an inline element you cannot set the width height and other properties associated with blocks
on the other hand an element with the property inline-block will still flow with any surrounding text but you may set properties such as width height etc

1611172
width	margin
on the other hand an element with the property inline-block will still flow with any surrounding text but you may set properties such as width height etc
a span with the property display block will not flow in the same way as an inline-block element but will create a carriage return and have default margin

1611370
cfstring	nsstring
most of nsstring is actually implemented in with corefoundation cfstring so there s obviously a path from a cfstringref - -utf8string
it s just not as neat and simple as nsstring s -utf8string

1611464
actionscript	mxml
you cannot remove an event listener that was defined in the mxml tag define your httpservice objects in actionscript creationcomplete of the app and add event listeners using addeventlistener method so that you can call removeeventlistener on them to reuse
you cannot remove event listeners added in the mxml tag. livedocs says you can remove only event listeners that you added with the addeventlistener method in an actionscript block

1611630
inline	inlining
every compiler uses some heuristics to determine whether the function should be inline or not but normally every compiler uses its own ones
so to say that a loop will have some universal effect on inlining is not correct

1611781
free	realloc
if size is 0 either a null pointer or a unique pointer that can be successfully passed to free is returned
if there is not enough available memory realloc returns a null pointer and sets errno to enomem

1612179
put	get
it s actually not recommended to submit your site to their page because then you re put at the end of the queue
but if you have a link on a page that google indexes in the next minute it will get to you much faster

1612220
put	get
subclass whatever you want to put in as a key and provide a __hash__ function which returns an unique key to this object
to illustrate if your hash is not unique enough you will get collisions

1612308
firefox	safari
ie4 5 6 7 8 use the eot files while ttf support is only provided by firefox versions 3.1
about safari and opera i m not sure but safari 4 worked for me and opera 10 too

1612540
accessor	properties
it s not a good idea to put locks inside accessor locks should be explicitly obtained like the previous answer suggests though it doesn t have to be with syncroots any object will do
locking access to properties inside of accessor may lead to bogus results

1612890
getter	setter
then cache calculation result that you get in total getter to a local class field and reuse that if dirty flag is not set clear it on recalculation
add calculation logic to the total getter this way you do not even need setter

1612935
jlist	jtable
if you want the table to display the items in the list you need an implementation of the tablemodel interface not a jlist
edit if you want the jlist and the jtable to be displayed next to each other you have to addthem both to a jpanel before adding that to the scrollpane

1613338
free	realloc
find this place - probably just before the hash itself is free - and add it
valgrind isn t saying that the leak is happening at the realloc line - it s saying that the memory that was allocated by that realloc line is the memory that s getting leaked eventually

1614004
qcombobox	qcompleter
for your second try you can add a qcompleter object to you qcombbox in order to filter your items as you want.the qcompleter member of the qcombobox is to offer an easy way to use qcompleter
anyway if you are not satisfied with this method you can manage a qcompleter object by yourself

1614890
ssl	https
this has grown to my general brain dump of best practices for working with passwords in php mysql. the ideas presented here are generally not my own but the best of what i ve found to date. ensure you are using ssl for all operations involving user information
all pages that involve these forms should check they are being called via https and refuse to work otherwise

1615540
filtering	grouping
however you cannot grouping clauses joined by an or and then join the grouping to another clause with an and like this lastname smith or lastname jones and firstname john instead you would construct this filtering as lastname smith and firstname john or lastname jones and firstname john so you would have to construct your filtering like this
ado recordset object filtering property there is no precedence between and and or

1615629
subclass	superclass
you are creating a subclass of uiviewcontroller which you are calling super
this class may be great but it is not the superclass of uiviewcontroller it is a subclass

1615629
superclass	subclassing
this class may be great but it is not the superclass of uiviewcontroller it is a subclassing
yes your subclassing of this subclassing will inherited all of the methods and capabilities of superviewcontroller so there is nothing in the very little which you have shown which is incorrect as far as that goes

1615765
folder	directory
spaces_to_underscores.bat source usage spaces_to_underscores my directory given this directory structure my directory ola and me private topsecretpictures it will rename the folder ola and me to ola_and_me and also rename any files such as photo 001.jpg to photo_001.jpg
the starting directory my directory will not be renamed

1615807
int	boolean
they need to be compared with int
in sql the bit types cannot be used in boolean expressions d oh

1616136
inherited	properties
and you re exactly right they ll inherited the style assigned to the element type but id class name variables will take precedence if they are set
no need to repeat the properties not sure if it s bad practice per se but it s definitely something you could optimize

1616467
post	get
if you aren t then that s very strange and you should post your code
if you get one strange character or set of characters replacing and another replacing you can just scan the string and replace

1618274
jobs	cron
are not executed before cron jobs so a lot of environment variables that you normaly have in the command line will be missing
so if your program doesn t work in the cron job embedd it in a script that sets all the necessary environment variables

1618621
udp	tcp
udp does not guarantee that a given packet was actually received so encoding whatever you transmit as a difference from last time is problematic -- you can t know that your counterpart has the same idea as you about what the last time was
essentially you d have to build some overhead on top of udp to check what packets have been received tagging each packet with a unique id -- everybody who s tried to go this route will agree that more often than not you find yourself more or less duplicating the tcp streaming infrastructure on top of udp.

1618621
udp	tcp
essentially you d have to build some overhead on top of udp to check what packets have been received tagging each packet with a unique id -- everybody who s tried to go this route will agree that more often than not you find yourself more or less duplicating the tcp streaming infrastructure on top of udp.
only most likely not as solid and well-developed although admittedly sometimes you can take advantage of very special characteristics of your payloads in order to gain some modest advantage over plain good old tcp

1618675
put	get
as daren schwenke pointed it out you d better work on the security yourself and not put this in the user hands
but it s good to provide some hints to the user of how strong his password is because the best way to get a password is still social engenering

1618749
pop-up	dialog
after tomorrow s weekly code push the dialog will pop-up in a separate browser window with an address bar which matches the user login flow when the user is not logged in to facebook and tries to connect accounts with your site. story 312
previously the connect with facebook dialog appeared in an iframe lightbox within the browser window

1618932
tftp	tcp
for more information check out the rfc for the tftp protocol which uses this strategy. finally if possible you may want to consider using tcp instead
udp unlike tcp is not a reliable protocol

1619256
post	get
edit david koontz replied to this post and i had a chance to look 5 years into the past
i m leaving my post intact below but for anyone reading this now avoid 3des if you have the opportunity and if not get an expert to look at your specific system

1619440
hash	md5
firstly md5 is a cryptographic hash function not necessarily an encryption method
a hash is designed to only be performed in one direction and cannot be reversed

1619440
hash	md5
a hash is designed to only be performed in one direction and cannot be reversed
this is a good thing md5 is however cryptographically broken not considered secure anymore

1619925
folder	directory
make sure you are in the directory that contains the mypack folder
you should not be within the mypack folder

1620587
serializable	deserialization
there are many ways of doing this but the first step will be to make your class serializable by adding the serializable attribute then you can use for instance the xmlserializer class to handle the serializable deserialization
update i should mention that you can use xmlserializer even if your class is not decorated with the serializable attribute

1620593
onclick	onchange
you could use the onclick event instead
my guess is that ie doesn t fire the onchange event until after the radio element loses focus

1622291
gif	png
it may just be the tools i m using but gif files usually seem to be a bit smaller than a comparible png but using them just seems so 1987. it probably is your tools
from the png faq there are two main reasons behind this phenomenon comparing apples and oranges that is not comparing the same image types and using bad tools. continued.

1622414
qpushbutton	qwidget
in these conditions your qpushbutton will be considered as child of the qwidget but not member of the parent s layout
so it will be a floating child and you must manage it s behaviour when resizing parent s qwidget

1622610
filesystems	ntfs
whether or not your filesystems can do transactions depends on which filesystems and os you are using
ntfs on windows vista supports transactional ntfs

1623229
client-side	server-side
since javascript is client-side executing a history.back renders the control to the browser which then decides which page was last in the history keeping in mind that the last page may not be a page within your domain
when you re using server-side php the http header referrer is whatever the browser supplied to you

1623814
google-chrome	firefox
a it seems that google-chrome converts the #0000ff to rgb 0 0 255 but the same does not apply to blue b firefox will display very diferent results depending on the property you are asking for
specificaly for the background-color property it converts the colors to the format rgb 0 0 255 just watch google-chrome #39

1624497
inherited	properties
as ichangeable inherited from ibasic i m assuming you want an implementation of ichangeable to have an implementation of get
maybe i ve misunderstood your question but wouldn t you just do let ichangeable override the properties but keep the get present

1624627
rss	feed
well rss is just a schema for the encoding of syndicatable information - it doesn t give any display semantics at all
the reason it seems to work is that ie has a builtin transform to html for rss feed as does safari so they convert the rss into something more human friendly

1624961
range	minimum
especially the previous end iterator is now beyond the begin end range and cannot be used safely within stl algorithms for example
1 the internal structure of a std vector is an array of t this is due for compatibility with the c-programs using myvector.front as the address of the array and because it guarantees contiguity and a minimum space overhead ie the amount of space taken by the vector own data vs the amount of space occupied by an object at any moment you can know how many objects a vector can hold using .capacity method

1625263
filewriter	bufferedwriter
in this case a buffered writer is better notes the second parameter to the filewriter constructor will tell it to append to the file rather than writing a new file
if the file does not exist it will be created. using a bufferedwriter is recommended for an expensive writer such as filewriter

1625263
filewriter	printwriter
if the file does not exist it will be created. using a bufferedwriter is recommended for an expensive writer such as filewriter
using a printwriter gives you access to println syntax that you re probably used to from system.out

1625876
inherited	properties
it sounds like you re trying to force oop to do something it s not intended to do or you re having trouble understanding inherited
every public or protected method and properties from class a is available in class b

1626966
children	parent
so the methods that the children must have are declared in the parent but not implemented
you might consider abstracting the parent class

1627568
maven	pom.xml
this seems thus equivalent to the actual situation without the messy local jars management with maven dependencies are managed through a local repository and this is a built-in feature
note if netbeans doesn t like nested modules it s possible to use a flat layout like this but this is more a detail for now my-app |-- parent | -- pom.xml |-- core-library | -- pom.xml |-- swing-app | -- pom.xml -- web-services -- pom.xml for implementation details the multi module project with eclipse might help you to get started very fast just skip the eclipse specific steps

1627653
int	chars
remember fgetc getc getchar all return an int not a chars
the int might be eof or a valid chars - but it returns one more value than the range supported by the chars type

1627971
lisp	scheme
in this particular case i believe you are interesting in lisp macros in particular
i think these may be interesting clojure documentation itself video macros in clojure in 20 minutes standard issue wikipedia - clojure note that macros in clojure work very similar to common lisp macros a type-2 lisp and not quite-so-much-like scheme macros

1629409
hmac	md5
since you cannot change the php implementation you will have to write an hmac implementation in objective c that has this same non-standard variation
first your objc2 is using sha1 not md5 this means you are probably getting a buffer overrun since sha1 is 20 bytes while md5 is 16 bytes

1629679
implements	extends
basically there are a couple of parts to implements a custom authenication chain in spring-security authenicationtoken - details of the authenication request and it s result ie contains credentials you require to authenticate authenicationprovider - registered with the authenicationmanager accepts your authenicationtoken and validates the user and returns a token with the granted authorities set authenciationfilter - doesn t actually have to be a filter just using abstractprocessingfilter will make your life a little easier
the trick here is that you need to create a new authenicationtoken maybe extends usernameandpasswordauthenicationtoken and as emills says you need to then implement a new authenciationprocessingfilter to map the request values to the token and submit these to the authenicationmanager

1629863
short	base
the short answer is that it doesn t matter
in terms of features the .net framework provides the base class library the run-time environment etc

1630095
allocator	stl
the stl allocator design makes it difficult to do this
some stl containers have a constructor that lets you pass an instance of an allocator but not all containers support this

1630095
allocator	stl
some stl containers have a constructor that lets you pass an instance of an allocator but not all containers support this
on containers that support this you can include a reference to some global map inside your allocator class and then pass an instance of your allocator to the constructor of each container

1630261
post	get
here is a good post on how to execute php from c# - i think it s a good example place to start with
in order to get php output you have to execute the php script not read it

1630859
opera	google-chrome	required	placeholder
the is required to make opera not show the broken image placeholder
the onerror is required for google-chrome and ie

1630987
postgresql	mysql
pl postgresql is actually a nice language + you can use many other languages
mysql doesn t have sequences so if you need them you have to roll your own

1631005
initializer	eigenclass
inside foo s initializer method self refers not to the class foo but to some particular instance of foo
its eigenclass is a subclass of foo but it is not foo

1631330
ready	each
i lose the sense that someone is staring over my shoulder criticizing me for being lazy when i m really just taking a moment to collect my thoughts. i also appreciate not having a commute even if i m only saving 20 minutes each way it s a huge load off of my back plus i don t have to dress to be in the office so i save time getting ready in the morning. i ve found that it s fairly easy to mitigate the communication issues by implementing a certain time during the day to be online we had people on the east and west coast so we had people stay online between 1-4p est
also just making sure that everyone has each other s phone numbers was a good thing there were many problems that could be resolved with a quick phone call. i wish that more businesses would support remote developers i m in an office right now and i feel that being here is so wasteful

1631340
post	put
as google doesn t care about the problem previous post were sent in june and we are now in october.
and the bug was reported directely to google i decided to put an image on my server that would suggest the user to click on the ad

1632004
submit	submission
for example it will be fired if the user submit a form clicks a link closes the window or tab or goes to a new page using the address bar search box or a bookmark
you could exclude form submission and hyperlinks except from other frames with the following code for jquery versions older than 1.7 try this the live method doesn t work with the submit event so if you add a new form you ll need to bind the handler to it as well

1632004
submit	submission
you could exclude form submission and hyperlinks except from other frames with the following code for jquery versions older than 1.7 try this the live method doesn t work with the submit event so if you add a new form you ll need to bind the handler to it as well
note that if a different event handler cancels the submit or navigation you will lose the confirmation prompt if the window is actually closed later

1632334
cassini	iis
cassini doesn t as far as i can tell support classic asp
an alternative would be to run a local install of apache since you can t won t use iis which will host asp but is probably asking for trouble

1633112
tiff	png
so doing something along the lines of would write that tiff image to file
i do not think nsimage has any built-in way of getting the data in png or jpeg form

1633338
csla	.net
you really should check out rocky lhotka s implementation of validation rules in his csla framework
note i did not say to use his framework en masse as it has some coupling issues that does break some srp efforts in the latest .net development trends

width	margin
you can either an html-element s width is calculated i think as the defined width + borders + margin + padding if you ve already defined the input as having 100 width of the parent and then the other attributes are added it will definitely overflow the parent div
you can set the margin padding borders to 0 but that would likely not look good

1633851
udp	tcp
typically game engines send udp packets because of latency
the fact is that tcp is just not fast enough and reliability is less of a concern than speed is

1634525
jruby	mri
yes because all the tutorials beginner docs and most of the devs who will normally be able to help you out are assuming mri so for each issue you have you must first eliminate a jruby related cause
from what i have seen certain gems aren t supported on jruby or things might be done a little differently in that ecosystem

1634536
jruby	mri
that said the most popular gems tend to work in jruby
performance in jruby still isn t quite as good as ruby 1.9 but in a lot of cases it s comparable to mri 1.8

1634536
jruby	mri
performance in jruby still isn t quite as good as ruby 1.9 but in a lot of cases it s comparable to mri 1.8
personally i d recommend treating jruby as an advanced ruby concept

1634671
postgresql	mysql
the replication story is more coherent for mysql than postgresql
postgresql is significantly more full-featured has a better optimizer but isn t as widely deployed

1634738
cpu	irq
the pic programmable interrupt controller can be used to modify which irqs will get mapped to which cpu interrupt
if you send the pic s io port the proper sequence using the out instruction you can map the irq in such a way that it doesn t conflict with the cpu interrupt from a floating point exception

1635052
feedback	review
if the program is bigger more like a complete product i mean you may need to collect some feedback from others since one man s thought can not cover everything
the hand drawn sketch still works invite more people to review it and give you some suggestions thus you can polish your design a lot

1635448
inherited	properties
first of all you should inherited your rootviewcontroller from uiviewcontroller not uitableviewcontroller
if you are using ib you have to refer your main view to your rootviewcontroller s view properties

1635781
folder	directory
just grant your user full control to folder allusersprofile application data microsoft crypto rsa machinekeys original source
this can happen on vista windows 7 when your account does not have permissions to he machinekeys directory

1635805
bibtex	latex
unless the long-announced bibtex v
1.0 or one of the many planned potential successing applications are ready latin1 iso-8859-1 or another 8-bit encoding has to be used for the bib file this does not affect the latex encoding which still can be utf8

1635860
submit	submission
it does not submit the form
use ajaxform in your document s ready function to prepare your form s for ajax submission

1636442
qt-creator	kdevelop
the qt-creator includes the best c++ gui library
do not even bother with eclipse or monodevelop for c++ try kdevelop or qtcreator

1636818
squeak	visualworks
as to learning smalltalk itself - i m most familiar with the resources available for learning visualworks objectstudio and squeak
for visualworks and objectstudio visit and specifically you might want to check out these pages smalltalk daily - a daily screencast focusing on an aspect of vw or os industry misinterpretations - a weekly podcast focused on smalltalk the entire spectrum of smalltalk not just cincom s offerings tutorials - there are a number of tutorials on the cincom smalltalk site both in video form and in step by step html page form

1636888
maven	pom.xml
as i explained here you must distinguish the parent and aggregation principles in maven which means that my-plugin would be considered as an aggregation project not necessarily a parent project for both my-plugin-client and my-plugin-parent
so to summarize my-plugin will define the base pom.xml for all your projects

1637510
post	get
if a https post request is acceptable for processing credit cards it is it s good enough for your app
one possible solution could be simple http get or post request but that wouldn t be secure

1638260
folder	dir	folder	directory
use more folder and limit the number of entries in any given folder
i m not sure about that with the number of entries and if you have millions of small files in the same directory even doing something like dir folder_with_millions_of_files can take minutes

1638289
implements	extends
for example if something is implements using com that will usually show up directly in your code that uses it
it s a strength because it s fairly easy to extends mfc to handle areas it doesn t by default as well as to simply bypass it and work directly with the api when you need to do so

1638460
accessor	properties
when you write a properties you write the get and set accessor like regular functions
get takes no parameters and returns the value of the properties and set takes a new value for the properties as a hidden parameter called value and doesn t return anything

1639022
firefox	safari
no idea what magic they changed but it was definitely something in the cert that firefox did not like
we had this problem and it was very much firefox specific -- could only repro in that browser safari ie8 chrome etc were all fine

1639868
put	get
to get it to map on startup you can put this in a batch file echo off net use computer share password user user hide it somewhere.
i couldn t find a way to get the literal credentials out of the net use string either

1640095
put	get
proxy|p force proxy this flag forces the substitution part to be internally sent as a proxy request and immediately rewrite processing stops here put through the proxy module. you must make sure that the substitution string is a valid uri typically starting with which can be handled by the apache proxy module
if not you will get an error from the proxy module

1640106
uilabel	uitextview
update if you are on newer versions of ios uilabel now has a lines property multiple lines of text in uilabel
it sounds like what you actually want is a giant uilabel inside a uiscrollview and not a uitextview

1640879
spy++	sendmessage
it s not that bad grab a copy of spy++ and have fun
afaik you re left with playing with sendmessage games

1641045
pull	push
if you pull a branch that isn t currently checked out i think it will still create a merge for you
if you haven t done anything weird then the reason for this is that the remote has a commit that you are not aware of and allowing the push to continue would ignore that commit entirely

1641091
free	malloc
you also have to ensure that you do not destroy free the old block if the malloc fails - you just return 0
you also don t need to multiply the size by sizeof int in the malloc

1641130
free	realloc
the point of realloc is that it tries to merge the block of memory with a free one behind that if possible
only if there isn t a free one will it allocate new memory copy everything over and frees the old block

1641189
versioning	upgrade
with queue you re guaranteed to be threadsafe in any implementation and versioning of python
relying on this or that method of some other object being atomic in a given implementation and versioning typically leaves you at the mercy of this atomicity not being a strong guarantee just an implementation artifact for the specific point release c you re using and therefore subtle very hard-to-debug race conditions being introduced with any upgrade or port to other python implementations

1641690
post	put	post	get
solution - for your prototype use a helper like inheritprototype i showed the whole implementation of this in this post inheritprototype method fwiw this essentially came from a combination of page 181 of zakas s book and some crockford study
no privacy but then again you d need to use something like the durable object pattern to get this and that may not be what you want object definition is left dangling solution - put an if statement checking for any of your prototype s functions and then define the prototype with a prototype literal

1641749
google-chrome	firefox
and a goggle google-chrome one with 4 tabs
not sure exactly why i don t currently have any firefox open probably just forgot to restart it after upgrading to 3.5.4 recently but normally there would be 2-3 windows there with another 8-10 tabs

1641794
jar	war
the -0 option tells the jar command to not compress the member files when creating the war file
then when rsync compares the old and new versions of the war file the delta-transfer algorithm should be able to create small diffs

1641837
subtract	add
the thing that got me confused is every time something gets push ed into stack stack pointer gets subtract
shouldn t it add to it

1641853
int	double
the route from an int via a double to a is just marginally too contorted convoluted for the c++ language to follow it according to the standard and with the huge complications already arising from free-wheeling conversions and cohercions it s hard to criticize that aspect of the standard
i guess the super-special case of allowing uncasted int s as operands to its operators was just not deemed frequent and important enough to warrant specifying template specializations for that extremely individual case considering how trivially easy it is for the programmer to cast the int to double when that s what they actually want

1641916
client-side	server-side
if you d use add service reference then visual studio will inspect the service based on its metadata and create a new set of client-side objects which look the same in terms of their fields and all but they re a separate distinct type and thus you wouldn t be able to use your shared validation on both the server-side and the client-side objects
if you control both sides of the wire the server-side service and the client-side then you could do the following put all your service and data contracts into a shared assembly reference that contracts assembly from both the server and the client manually create the client proxy by deriving from or by creating it from a - do not use add service reference or svcutil.exe

1642528
implements	extends
note that the interface itself doesn t extends idictionary - it s just that the implementation also implements idictionary
this works because implements idictionary - but it will indeed fail at execution time if someone calls idictionary.add object object with a non-string key - you ll get an argumentexception

1642573
udp	tcp
you basically just throw a packet out there with a destination address and it may or may not arrive - that s the u in udp unreliable
you shouldn t be lulled into thinking the connection of tcp results in all packets taking the same physical path

1642592
udp	tcp
as a consequence the lower level protocols in the ip stack do not guarantee that packets are received at the destination packets are received in any particular order packets are received at the destination just once udp in particular does not try to solve these issues
on the other hand tcp protocol has to get rid of these issues

1642608
put	get
the safest would of course be if the third party could just put up a page that returns the ip adress that the request comes from so that you know that you are sending the request in the exact same way as the web service request
it might be possible to get the information from the router programmatically but that would not be trivial.

1642839
fgets	feof
the problem is that for the last line fgets will fail
however you aren t checking feof until the next loop so you still call fputs which will print the contents of buffer the previous line

1643319
post	get
i was going to give an example but it would be almost identical to this post pass masterpage imagebutton event to content page which another so user already has linked to in the answers here too
i m not sure about c# but in vb.net i ve done it with these four steps add events to the masterpage code behind raise these events as required add this to the content aspx page add event handlers to trap the event on the content page codebehind this is where things get very different between c# and vb.net add your required code to the events in the codebehind update from your sample code i can see you re not raising an event in the masterpage which you can respond to the content page

1643589
agile	sprint
ideally qa and testers should be involved if not from the day one then from very early stages of a software development project regardless of the process used waterfall or agile
the test team will need to ensure that project or sprint requirements are clear measurable and testable

1643617
short	base
in short using this method has the right level of modularity works with caching works with regular asp.net as well as with mvc
do not attempt to do authentication in a base controller class

1643721
punctuation	words
if such info has not readily be lost your question implies that maybe the tokenization has readily been done during the tokenization words parsing in this case process look for patterns that may define expression boundaries such as punctuation particularly periods and also multiple lf cr separation use these
also words like the can often be used as boundaries

1644441
inherited	properties
this collection is not in the logical or visual tree therefore the datacontext is not being inherited which leads to there being nothing to bind to.
i don t know if this applies to sl but you can check this out the columns collection is just a properties in the datagrid

1644474
superclass	subclassing
because constructing your subclassing object may be done in a different way from how your superclass is constructed
you may not want clients of the subclassing to be able to call certain constructors available in the superclass

1644681
filesystems	fat
fat s dos attributes do not map well to the unix filesystems model so linux s vfat driver does not reflect them
instead of mounting the filesystems use mtools to read the filesystems from userspace

1645190
hash	salt
adding a random salt to a hash ensures that the same password will produce many different hash
the salt is usually stored in the database together with the result of the hash function. salting a hash is good for a number of reasons salting greatly increases the difficulty cost of precomputated attacks including rainbow tables salting makes sure that the same password does not result in the same hash

1645190
hash	salt
a salt is not a secret key instead a salt works by making the hash function specific to each instance
with salt hash there is not one hash function but one for every possible salt value

1645190
hash	salt
a secret salt is not a salt it is called a key and it means that you are no longer computing a hash but a message authentication code mac
computing mac is tricky business much trickier than simply slapping together a key and a value into a hash function and it is a very different subject altogether

1645295
folder	directory
so for example you could do something like in which case all classes from myjar1.jar myjar2 jar and some classes folder directory will be available to you
if you had myjar3.jar in some classes folder the above declaration would not add it to classpath

1645300
identifier	ambiguous
an identifier cannot have the same spelling unicode character sequence as a keyword 3.9 boolean literal 3.10.3 or the null literal 3.10.7
as for why this decision was made probably because this simplifies parsing avoids ambiguous grammar allows introduction of special syntax in a later version of the language and or for historical reasons because most other languages have the same restrictionsimilar restrictions

1645947
put	get
the way you do ors in django is like this so if you actually wanted to do this you would need to put them both in the same filter call so you wouldn t be able to add the other or clause in a later filter call
i think the reason you may be trying to do this would be that you are concerned about hitting the database again but the only way to get accurate results would be to hit the database again

1646654
hash	md5
of course i have to link to the coding horror post on rainbow tables and salting your hash coding horror rainbow hash cracking
rather than convert the above subroutine to php here is a subroutine to convert a string to its md5 hash in vb.net in php you can use the md5 function by it s nature as a hash you cannot decrypt a hash you can only hash it and compare it to a stored hash

1647078
innodb	myisam
personally i still believe that the advantages of innodb triumphs myisam and myisam also has problems with data integrity from my experience
i am not sure if this is no longer true myisam is faster than innodb for reads

1647078
innodb	myisam
i am not sure if this is no longer true myisam is faster than innodb for reads
also myisam tables are stored in separate files and from what i can remember you can actually transport those files to another mysql database and is easier to backup

1647200
innodb	myisam
innodb supports fk s supports transactions uses a large memory buffer for operation supports row level locking but has a much higher maintenance cost -- you really need to tune your memory usage configure your table files etc
myisam has a bunch of special column features that innodb doesn t like full text indexes spatial columns i m pretty sure this doesn t work with innodb very fast for primary read append use cases table locks for updates deletes but not for inserts also typically has faster inserts caches indexes in memory key buffer but relies on the os to buffer the actual data pages for example i d use innodb for things like ecommerce user databases or anything that i want to use transactions in

1647753
filtering	grouping
if what you really want is to express filtering over your grouping data take a look at the having clause
i dont believe so like is effectively a binary state - something is like or not like there are not logical degrees of likeness that could be grouping together

1648031
win64	windows
there s a subtle difference between win64 and _win64 at least for the microsoft compilers - other compilers should follow suit but not all do _win64 is defined by the compiler when it s building a program for a windows 64-bit platform
note that this name is in the compiler implementor s namespace leading underscore followed by a capital letter win64 is defined by the windows platform sdk or whatever they re calling it this year when targeting a 64-bit platform

1648031
win64	windows
note that this name is in the compiler implementor s namespace leading underscore followed by a capital letter win64 is defined by the windows platform sdk or whatever they re calling it this year when targeting a 64-bit platform
so if you re only including standard headers and don t take other measures to define it win64 will not be defined

1648773
vim	textmate
vim offers coloration for diff files
if you d rather go graphical use macvim which is free or textmate not free

1648854
addeventlistener	preventdefault
if you instead set an event via an event handler property on the dom element or using addeventlistener attachevent then just returning false from that function does not work in every browser and you need to do the returnvalue and preventdefault stuff from my other answer
preventdefault is specified in the dom 2 spec and is implemented by most mainstream modern browsers

1650403
nexus	artifactory
i would recommend setting up one nexus server with at least four repositories
i would not recommend artifactory

1650677
for-loop	arrays
the for-loop given would remember the last object in the list with a given code which would mean a hash is not the solution
for small stable list sizes simply converting the list to an arrays of objects would show a performance increase on top of some better readability

1650750
post	put
i post this anticipating a flurry of downvotes but even if it is an ugly solution it should work
it s not the most elegant approach but rather than using the registry you could put a shortcut into the user s startup folder on their programs menu

1650789
boost	stl
not part of stl but well known library is boost
i would go the way of using boost date

1650980
disk	ram
when you start the second instance the memory allocated by the first instance is paged out to disk making room in ram for the second instance
the amount of ram you can allocate at any one time and in any one process depends not only on the amount of physical ram and virtual memory page file size you have available but also on the width of your memory addresses

1651347
cpython	ironpython
edit at least this surely holds in cpython
i thought it was part of the python standard definition but apparently ironpython and jython disagree not ensuring thread-safety of count.next in their current implementations so i may well be wrong

1652265
uiview	subviews
the uitableview is handling the hits because the b uiview is not in the responder chain at all
you need to make b-uiview a sibling of a-view instead of an invisible and inactive subviews

1652683
versioning	upgrade
you can have the user go to and it will say what versioning of the framework he she has and how to upgrade to the latest versioning
this user likely doesn t have the versioning of the .net framework installed that supports clickonce

1652842
sgml	schematron
sgml had a more powerful model using the connector but not all systems implemented it
edit if you wish to validate your xml at this level you could use schematron as a second validator after the schema

1654667
addition	multiplication
one approach is not to try to compute the time by repeated addition of this 0.1 seconds constant but to keep a simple integer clock-tick count
this tick count can be converted to a fixed-point time in seconds as needed usually using a multiplication followed by a division

1654684
vb.net	vb6
unfortunately i can only suggest a workaround not a solution if you do not find a suitable activex control for your vb6 application you might consider migrating the communication part of your application to vb.net
this has the following advantages calling .net code from vb6 is not hard

1654972
put	get
i just installed version 436 and it seems to do what you want when given -fx put it in the less env var with your other prefs to let anything use those prefs by just running less
if you can not get the new version you might try this instead the key is that the shell has to know if the there are more lines in the file than the screen before it potentially launches less the multi-io technique you initially used can only run things in the background

1655194
put	get
and you should put parens around the expression in the max_memory macro
i don t think there are any precedence problems you d get into without them as all the high precedence operators than multiplication wouldn t be correct syntax anyway

1655286
factors	mean
i would argue that either you factors out the read-only part and have a read-write method call a read-only method or that you just stop considering it read-only it isn t
just because the transaction is put into read-only mode for one transaction does not mean it will remain in read-only mode for the rest of the scope of the session osiv

1655364
git-rev-list	git-diff-tree
in this case the git-log help states the command takes options applicable to the git-rev-list command to control what is shown and how and options applicable to the git-diff- commands to control how the changes each commit introduces are shown
in this case you ll find the -m option under git-diff-tree ... -m by default git-diff-tree --stdin does not show differences for merge commits

1655518
innodb	myisam
in particular switching from myisam to innodb will break your application if it doesn t handle deadlocks appropriately deadlocks do not happen on myisam it expects table-level locking it relies on mostly dubious myisam features it is high performance and you have not understood how to tune innodb correctly but did tune myisam well or ok you have not assessed the disc space impact of switching engines
the myisam engine does support foreign keys

1656360
hash	md5
it is not true that the only way to crack an md5 hash is to generate every possible string and look for collisions
in fact if you have access to the original it is possible to modify it so that its md5 matches that of another file you can create

1656382
arithmeticexception	unchecked-exception
to put it another way imagine this code would have to check for classcastexception arrayindexoutofboundsexception arithmeticexception unsupportedoperationexception and nullpointerexception just off the top of my head
with java the issue isn t unchecked-exception

1656626
rss	feed
update there is now an rss subscription reader extension for chrome
this is a known bug in chrome that has yet to be fixed chrome does not display xml rss feed with any formatting whatsoever

1656728
put	get
on a typical day these instructions may be something along the lines of take the shirt from the rack wash the shirt dry the shirt iron the shirt fold the shirt put the shirt back on the rack take the pants from the rack wash the pants dry the pants fold the pants put the pants back on the rack take the coat from the rack wash the coat dry the coat iron the coat put the coat back on the rack the attendant follows these instructions to the tee being very careful not to ever do anything out of order
as you can imagine it takes a long time to get the day s laundry done because it takes a long time to fully wash dry and fold each piece of laundry and it must all be done one at a time

1656849
profiler	aqtime
visual studio team system or premium in vs2010 has a profiler but it s not available in professional
other well regarded options are aqtime which has 30 day trial and redgate s ants profiler which has a two week trial

1657423
banking	payment
plus there is - at least in theory i do not have own experience here - some protection through eu-wide banking regulations if something goes wrong
otherwise i do not know any international payment provider who has the reach and simplicity of paypal

1657438
floating-point	fractions	floating-point	integer	integer	fractions
this sounds like an integer quantity and i wouldn t take the detour through floating-point land
thus my approach would be multiplying by an integer 1000 preserves the fractions number perfectly and may be a little faster too

1657486
post	put
browsers typically only support post and get for form actions - but doing a post to a resource that already exists isn t restful
you would want to be doing a put instead

1657538
websphere	ibm
so to me the choices are actually sun s jvm unless i ve to run some websphere stuff in which case i d choose ibm j9
but to be honest i ve never faced a situation that i couldn t solve on a sun s jvm and that could have justified temporary swapping to ibm one so i can t actually tell if the troubleshooting features are that nice

1658613
folder	directory
one little gotcha you have to add the zendx folder to your library directory - the one which also has your zend directory
your lib path | +-zend | | | +- the full thing | +-zendx | | | +-jquery db console ... if you miss adding zendx to your library directory you get lots of errors messages like this fatal error uncaught exception zend_loader_pluginloader_exception with message plugin by name jquery was not found in the registry

1659289
haskell	scheme
and and or need to short-circuit -- stop argument evaluation as soon as the final result is known -- so they can t be regular procedures functions in any eager language lazy languages such as haskell -- where each argument is evaluated only if when and as needed -- are a very different breed and don t need this regular function versus special form distinction.
but alas scheme just isn t one of those

1659646
for-loop	arrays
your for-loop assumes you ll access the objects by their index but then after each iteration you re deleting something out of the arrays which shifts all the indexes after that point
you shouldn t be calling removeobjectatindex because you re trying to walk through the arrays at the same time

1659800
submit	submission
when that submit returns send the user to a new page or do whatever
your best bet is not to do this as a normal submission at all but use a method of ajax submission

1660109
boost	stl
boost shared_ptr for example if you use it inside a dll boost intrusive_ptr works over dll boundaries
edit like remarked in the comments stl strings are not guaranteed to be immutable by nature

1660270
tolower	uppercase	toupper	uppercase
if you want to change the case for comparison it s recommended that you use toupper rather than tolower
some exotic letters doesn t convert properly from upper to lower case but conversion from lower to uppercase works

1661117
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
for example i use ubuntu linux and perl is a component of the system
but the ubuntu system perl interpreter is not in good shape due to some dubious setup decisions by the debian people so installing things like cpan modules is tricky

1661383
octal	decimal
in this statement 005 is an octal constant
in this case it doesn t matter because a single digit octal constant has the same value as the equivalent decimal constant but in c whether an integer literal is expressed in octal decimal or hexadecimal once it is parsed by the compiler it is just treated as a value

1662366
many-to-many	one-to-many
so voucher id other attributes doesn t change from what you have now customer id other attributes doesn t change except for many-to-many
see below usedvoucher id voucher what voucher was used by that customer customer what customer has used that voucher changed voucher attributes if any additional attributes if needed such as date time when voucher was used your many-to-many on customer will become one-to-many collections of vouchers used by this customer if you need it as maintainable property

1663934
free	memcpy
either there is not 200 mb free space or the byte array is allocated to small and needs to grow
the only way for an array to hrow in java is by allocating a new and bigger array and do a memcpy

1664063
typedef	typename
dependent type information is easier to describe setint iterator and should you ever change your mind suppose you went to a hash_set instead of a std set is effectively updated immediately due to the typedef they describe intent better than built-in typename do typedef int errcode i m sure there are more i m not thinking of..
typedef s are mostly notational convenience but they do have a bunch of benefits declaring function pointer types for callbacks --notoriously hard to get right when spelled out completely

1664422
rsa	aes
to answer your question it s generally a better idea to create a session secret the aes key through a diffie-hellman exchange and each side use its private rsa key to sign its key-exchange data
otherwise if the session secret is not established through a dh exchange an adversary that gains access to the private rsa key which has to be stored somewhere could decrypt all traffic that was ever sent between the client and server

1664655
maven	pom.xml
it uses maven s conventions to describe dependencies but it s not about dependencies management
my understanding of the pomegranate draft specification is that servlet containers can use pomegranate as an extension to the web-inf lib with the following benefits shared .jar files in a common repository simplifying management and reducing .war sizes library dependency resolution including the ability to handle sub-module incompatibilities familiar maven pom.xml files to take advantage of current development practices

1664684
children	parent
this algorithm would look like this start at the root of the binary tree use a breadth-first or depth-first search to reach leaf nodes nodes which do not have any children nodes when you reach a leaf node check it s depth if it s not equal to the max depth ignore it and continue with the search if it s equal to the max depth then you ve found the end node of a largest path there could be more than one but it doesn t seem important to distinguish them at this point
go to the next step add this leaf node to the linked list then go to it s parent repeat that last step until you reach the root node and there is no parent - then your linked list has all the nodes of a longest path

1664743
margin	height
the following post demonstrates a technique utilizing the min-height fast hack by dustin diaz and a negative margin on the content container to achieve 100 height while not interfering with the header
you must ensure your body tag and content container also have height of 100

1664765
tostring	string.format
perhaps simplest just overload tostring for role which makes it suitable for use in string.format and friends but of course doesn t make it assignable
by default each entity class or poco should have a tostring overload anyway

1664899
datarow	dataview
if you can avoid creating a new table and work with the array of datarow s that datatable.select returns you can get a considerable improvement
since you re not returning a dataview but a datatable you should be able to get a performance boost - not order-of-magnitude but 25-30 - by using datatable.sort most of the time that s being taken up there is copying the data into the new table

1665043
pascal	delphi
searching the keyword pascal filtering the results with programming language pascal you ll find a bunch of applications of pascal if not enterprise level at least serious programmer s level
with so many open-source and cross-platform ides libraries i think pascal is still alive except the popular delphi dialect and could do practical tasks.as the results implies pascal could do operating system compiler cross-platform library desktop-programming.so it seems that pascal at least could do a lot of serious tasks if not too pratical to make moeny back instantly

1665680
salt	dpapi
the salt adds an additional layer of difficulty in doing so
dpapi cannot usually be used in web farms - the key store is specific to the machine

1665824
put	get
to get around this you have to run the java.exe through cmd.exe and start . i dont know why but if you put cmd c start infront it shows the command prompt as it runs
however the problem with start is that if there is a space in the path to the application which the path to the java exe usually have as it is in c program files java jre6 bin java.exe or similar then start just fails with cannot find c program so you have to put quotes around c program files java jre6 bin java.exe now start complains about parameters that you pass to java.exe the system cannot find the file -cp. escaping the space in program files with a backslash also does not work. so the idea is to not use space. generate a temporary file with the bat extension and then put your command with spaces in there and run the bat. however running a bat through start does not exit when done so you have to put exit at the end of the batch file

1666304
maven	pom.xml
i managed to solve this one after hours of studying the dependencies and looking at what each of them had inside i discovered that the dependency javax.xml.ws jaxws-api 2.1-1 was required but we had to take a copy of this dependency and take out then i had to include the following dependency in the pom.xml of my application this is far from ideal we have to maintain a separate proprietary dependency in our maven repository and remember to include this dependency
the annoying thing is maven doesn t allow me to exclude by version number only by groupid and artifactid

1666355
accessor	properties
because the backing field is inaccessible it can be read and written only through the properties accessor
this means that automatically implemented read-only or write-only properties do not make sense and are disallowed

1666401
repr	human-readable
str is used on string interpolation while repr is used by python internally on each object in a list or dict when you print the list or dict
as tendayi mawushe mentiones above string produced by repr isn t necessarily human-readable

1666455
margin	height
i try to explain if you set the line-height of the paragraph to 20px with a font-size 20px and the margin bottom and right of the img whose height is a multiple of 20 to 20px the line at the bottom of the img is forced to split to the right if there aren t at least 40px 20px margin-bottom + 20px line-height below the img
that it s normal because there isn t enough space for a line of 20px height

1666526
int	double
do not just cast the result of the int division to double the division was already performed as int division so the numbers behind the decimal are already lost
when you use only integers in a division you will get int division

1667192
google-chrome	firefox
for example google-chrome doesn t highlight the options in the drop down
firefox does but then it doesn t change them back if you move the mouse away and they are still pulled down

1668004
integer	unsigned
c99 6.2.5 9 ...a result that cannot be represented by the resulting unsigned integer type is reduced modulo the number that is one greater than the largest value that can be represented by the resulting type. this is the same in c and c++ in the c++ standard similar wording is found in footnote 41 -- it s not normative but it s explaining other wording that is
the requirements on unsigned arithmetic guarantee that casting -1 to an unsigned type will produce the largest number possible for the target type

1668235
hash	salt
a cryptographically secure hash would work
sha512 or sha256 would be ok however i would use a fairly secret salt that is not stored along with the cards to prevent any sort of rainbow table attack

1668275
hash	whirlpool
speed is not of the essence and slowness actually works against anyone trying a brute force reversal of your hash values
i like whirlpool personally - if you re using php check out the supported algorithms at the hash function docs whirlpool returns a string 128 characters long but you don t have to store all of it necessarily

1668466
post	get
the number of monodevelop users is dwarfed by visual studio users so there is far less online help such as blog post
i think a lot of developers are used to third-party tools like resharper which you wouldn t be able to get for monodevelop

1668548
hash	md5
this is 1 billion checksums and hash operations per set
i don t have any benchmarks handy but i m pretty sure 1 million hash operations per minute is not unreasonable for md5 or any flavor of sha on a suitably powerful machine

1668612
folder	directory
i don t know of many setups where desktop is a root folder like that
some examples if i have a file home bartek file1.txt and i type python to get my interpreter within the directory home bartek this will work and fetch file1.txt ok this will not work as that file is in another directory of some sort

1668625
int	chars
it s easy to convert an int to a unicode chars provided of course that there is a mapping for that code if you want the utf-8 encoding for that chars that s not very hard either you would have to check the unicode standard to see the number ranges where there are unicode chars defined
there is no utf-8 chars

1668920
inherited	properties
take a look at my answer to hibernate inherited strategy question for a detailed explanation
the most straightforward way to do this is to map properties you don t use often as lazy hibernate would not load such properties initially

1669137
mp3	ogg	mp3	flac	mp3	speex	wav	ogg	wav	flac	wav	speex	aiff	ogg
by the way audiere can also play certain audio files mp3 wav aiff mod s3m xm it by itself
ogg vorbis flac speex with external libraries not just pure generated tones

1670011
processors	hyperthreading
cpuid results are different between intel and amd processors at least for the interesting stuff like hyperthreading and cache topology and are not particularly stable across different processors versions
newer intel i7 processors introduce a new cpuid value eax 0xb which supercedes the information supported by cpuid on earlier processors

1670811
superclass	subclassing
at runtime you can substitute a subclassing of superclass this is the liskov substitution principle
method foobar does not know and should not know what the runtime type of obj is only that it derives from superclass and so dosomething can be called

1671267
intersect	contains
if you take the intersect of two lists as it looks like you re doing the result will be a single list that contains all of the elements that are in both of the lists
thus once you ve done the ienumerable in intersect doesn t need left or right

1671405
put	get
note that first won t always return the first thing you put in the collection and may only make sense for ordered collections
maybe that is why there isn t a get item call since the order isn t necessarily perserved

1671679
changeset	cherry-pick
however the drawback to using import export transplant and cherry-pick in general is that you can t really move over g without its ancestors because in mercurial a changeset s name is its hashid which includes the hashids of its parents
different parents g s new parent would be c and not f means a different hashid so it s not g anymore -- it s the work of g but a new changeset by name

1671863
entity-relationship	entities
there are different standards for how entity-relationship s are drawn -- your course will have already settled on one of them
i m not doing your homework but i d like to help all the same start by listing out what all the entities are. instructors courses etc

1671880
drawrect	imagenamed
therefore it of course loading procedure may be called many many times during running. furthermore os2.x s imagenamed method has a bug -- not cached the image and leaked it. therefore you d better to load the file in the initialization method not in the drawrect
btw you shouldn t load the image file in the drawrect method

1672424
mouseover	mouseleave	mouseout	mouseleave
details ie has events called mouseenter and mouseleave that are non-bubbling versions of mouseover and mouseout
other browsers do not but if they did setting a mouseleave listener on window or document would do the trick

1672424
mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseout
a gentleman named ken snyder comes to the rescue on a mouseover the relatedtarget property references the node from which the pointer came
on a mouseout the relatedtarget property references the node to which the pointer went.on any event the scope is the node to which the event is attached.when the relatedtarget is a not child of the currenttarget a mouseover event is equivalent to a mouseenter event and a mouseout event is equivalent to a mouseleave event

1672424
mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave
on a mouseout the relatedtarget property references the node to which the pointer went.on any event the scope is the node to which the event is attached.when the relatedtarget is a not child of the currenttarget a mouseover event is equivalent to a mouseenter event and a mouseout event is equivalent to a mouseleave event
-- this makes it possible to implement mouseenter and mouseleave in other browsers

1673862
awt	swing
iterator pattern in collections framework nested containers in awt swing use the composite pattern layout managers in awt swing are an example of strategy and many more i guess
observer pattern throughout whole swing observable observer mvc also in swing adapter pattern inputstreamreader and outputstreamwriter note containeradapter componentadapter focusadapter keyadapter mouseadapter are not adapters

1674249
post	get
if not i think your quickest response might come if you post on the fluent-nhibernate mailing list
i don t think you will manage to get the standard hilo generator working with a string

1674354
int	double
one solution - possibly even the best but certainly very reliable - is to pass an explicit null chars pointer to your function calls or this is standard recommended practice for the execl function in posix systems for example and for precisely the same reason - the trailing arguments of a variable-length argument list are subject to usual promotions chars or short to int
float to double but cannot otherwise be type safe

1674882
post	get
if you re building the request using something fiddler to explicitly use post then you re using post
if you re using get post with .net web services soap doesn t come in to the picture at all

1675024
onmouseover	mouseenter	onmouseover	mouseleave
i think what you are after are ie s mouseenter event fires when the user moves the mouse pointer inside the boundaries of the object and mouseleave event fires when the user moves the mouse pointer outside the boundaries of the object unlike the onmouseover event the onmouseenter event does not bubble
in other words the onmouseenter event does not fire when the user moves the mouse pointer over elements contained by the object whereas onmouseover does fire

1675051
stdout	stderr
so there was a good reason for making -h go to stdout but no good reason for changing -v
the -h option also used to print to stderr because it is not part of the output of your program the output is not produced by your python script but by the python interpreter itself

1675345
firefox	safari
using an arbitrary high value seems more reliable than in firefox and chrome. i ve made it is as a jquery plugin
if you re not using jquery i trust you can still get the gist easily enough. i ve tested in ie6 ie7 ie8 firefox 3.5.5 google chrome 3.0 safari 4.0.4 opera 10.00

1675527
typedef	struct
what i recommend is you combine your two examples this gives you the convenience of the more concise typedef name but still allows you to use the full struct name if you need
another difference not pointed out is that giving the struct a name struct mystruct also enables you to provide forward declarations of the struct

1676464
int	chars
now if the structure was as such your coworkers logic would probably lead to 3 chars s 3 bytes 2 int 2 4 bytes so 3 + 8 unfortunately due to padding the structure actually takes up 12 bytes
this is because you cannot fit three chars s and an int into that 4 byte word and so there s one byte of padded space there which pushes the int into it s own word

1676530
freebsd	linux
in your case if you re sure your .bashrc is going to be used only on gnu linux and on a bsd system you can check for switches that exist in one of the ls but not in the other for example -d doesn t seem to be an accepted switch by ls on my bsd machines freebsd and mac os x whereas it is for gnu ls
conversely -p is accepted on bsd but not on gnu linux

1676749
xsl-fo	xslt
the two technologies i ve used to produce pdfs xml - xsl-fo - apache fop formatting objects processor - pdf
advantages if you understand html and xslt creating output with xsl-fo is not a lot harder than creating html with xslt software is open source

1677114
inherited	properties
turns out this behavior is by design due to how interface inherited works
interfaces do not define implementations thus ilocation doesn t inherit the properties of ilocationsource

1677386
haskell	scheme
until someone showed me the equivalent haskell definition 2 lines
i am not so confident on the efficiency of my implementation - particularly the flatten step was quick to write but could end up calling append with a very large number of lists which may or may not be very efficient on some scheme implementations

1677864
postgresql	mysql
with postgresql 8.1 this has changed
however if this doesn t help you can use the union solution you tried this is a common solution for mysql users which continues to have a one-index-per-table limitation

1678256
put	get
b.hashcode then the hashset may not find where you put it
containers like hashset rely on the hash function to determine where to put it and where to get it from when asked for it

1678683
post	get
generally when passing lots of data to the server to be processed or stored using post is a good idea since get has a lower limit than that of post
post also has the added benefit of being relatively hidden to the user except during transmission if not encrypted

1678727
post	get
if you decide to get uber-strict on page expiration no-cache and the whole business when users click back on their browser pages generated with post data will not resend the post data to create the page where as the get request will remain the same as it was originally get requests make more sense to some users regarding your specific problem i infer that you want to take the user to a page where they can edit some page with id 12
if this is the case the link to the edit page should be a simple href with get you might want to consider using .htaccess rewrite to prettify your urls so it looks like edit 12 rather than

1678889
qtoolbutton	qwidget
if it isn t pass the event to qtoolbutton
subclass qtoolbutton using inheritance and override qwidget keypressevent

1679528
integer	radix
the ultimate in reliable speed would be if you could convert each extent to an integer or more generally some string with the property that if the strings are equal the extents are equal as well and if the strings are not equal then the extents are not equal either
the thing with strings is that they can be sorted in linear time with algorithms like radix sort radix tree etc

1680049
dotnetzip	sharpziplib
example code for your scenario just for the curious in dotnetzip you will get bit 3 set if you use the zipfile class and save it to a nonseekable stream like aspnet s response.outputstream or if you use the zipoutputstream class in dotnetzip which always writes forward only no seeking back . i think sharpziplib s zipoutputstream is also always forward only.
i don t know for sure because i am not very familiar with either sharpziplib or osx but i still might have some useful insight for you

1680049
dotnetzip	sharpziplib
i ve spent some time wading through the zip spec and actually i wrote dotnetzip which is a zip library for .net unrelated to sharpziplib
currently on the user forums for dotnetzip there s a discussion going on about zip files generated by dotnetzip that cannot be read on osx

1680214
windows	wow64
edit corrected link url edit 2 clarified that on 64-bit windows you need both folders not just the wow64 one
i ve had problems automating office from a windows service under windows server 2008 even though that works fine under windows server 2003

1680755
move	drag
the feature to move the window by pressing alt is also a function of your window manager not qt
there is just one way to make the window manager move the window add a drag bar

1680956
base	fractions
any value represented as base 2 mantissa and exponent 1.00110101001 x 2 -11101001101001 means take the mantissa value 1.00110101001 and multiply it by 2 raised to the power of the exponent when exponent is negative this is equivilent to dividing by 2 to the power of the absolute value of the exponent
this means that where the exponent is negative or where any portion of the mantissa is a fractions binary the number cannot be represented as a decimal mantissa and exponent and vice versa

1681111
put	get
you wouldn t want to put a deferred query in the using block and after the using block enumerate the results
you ll get an exception about the context being disposed

1681589
udp	mtu
here is some sample c# code from my own udp multicast server client on the server side where datasock is my socket bound to the udp multicast group also be sure and set socketoptionname.sendbuffer on your client side to match the buffer size your server is producing
i would also recommend if you were not already aware to make your packet sizes less than the mtu

1681625
accessor	properties
it is a factory properties that is used to return an instance of an object singleton accessor properties come to mind
you don t expect to need an instance properties with the same name c# does not allow duplicate named properties that only differ by whether they are instance vs

1681855
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
therefore your approach is exactly right use uinavigationcontroller s subclass of uiviewcontroller in place of standard view controllers when you want to achieve navigation within a given tab
the uitabbarcontroller represents its sub-tabs as an array of uiviewcontroller s not an array of uinavigationcontroller s

1683289
post	get
it uses annotations but you can do the same things with xml configuration in your app context. if i want to process via a post request and i wish to load an actual domain object from the domainvalue that is submitted i can do somethign like this for issuing the ajax request you can use jquery ajaxform module
assuming you have a form with id selectdomainform you need js that looks something like this you can google up the documentation for the ajaxform module in order to learn how to post instead of get and to send grab only certain fields and send them to a url that is not the intended url of the form

1683991
fossil	trac
what this means is that fossil integrates distributed version control distributed bug tracking and distributed wiki into one repository
not one ui like say trac but one single repository

1683991
bazaar	fossil	fossil	git	darcs	fossil
so if you clone a fossil repository you do not just get the latest version of the source code plus all its history like you would get with git mercurial bazaar monotone darcs or any other version control system you also get the current bug database plus all its history and the current wiki plus all its history
fossil is written by d

1683991
fossil	trac
fossil is written by d
richard hipp who is not only the author of sqlite but also cvstrac the precursor of trac

1684844
multiplying	add
you can perform three row operations multiplying row i by a constant c
0 interchange rows i and j add c times row i to row j just be aware that this is not a good way to find an inverse because it suffers from roundoff errors

1685300
daemons	systemd
if one was on a unix systemd one could send a kill signal to the worker daemons processes and they would restart without restart whole of apache
on unix this does not overly cause problems even when multiple sites in same process as the listener socket for port on which http requests are accepted is maintained open at all times so subsequent requests which arrive during the restart just queue up and will be handled once worker daemons processes are running again

1685870
children	parent
if a parent s visible property is set to false none of its children will be visible in the stage
but that doesn t mean that children s visible properties would be automatically set to false - they will continue to hold their original values

1685870
children	parent
but that doesn t mean that children s visible properties would be automatically set to false - they will continue to hold their original values
in short a displayobject with visible property true need not be visible on the stage - it depends on its parent visible value too

1686486
prng	random
it s unlikely your prng has enough bits of state to express every possible shuffle however so the real question is if your prng is random enough with regards to the set of shuffles it will actually produce and whether your seeding strategy is secure enough
only you can decide this as it depends on the consequences of a shuffle that isn t random enough

1686835
ready	each
ready fn is a special function in jquery that can be written in one or many blocks
if written in many blocks each block can not access others variables

1687241
lcs	np-hard
wikibooks has a java implementation of lcs here
i think although you say that performance isn t yet an issue this is an np-hard problem so it may never be possible to make it fast

1688187
gprof	callgrind	vtune	gprof
0 - call system s sleep or yield function so that when it returns you have a new timeslice 1 - rdtsc 2 - call your function 3 - rdtsc if your function is a long running one you have to use some sort of profiling tool like gprof it is very easy to use intel s vtune application which i have not used for a long time
after seeing art s answer i changed my mind from gprof to callgrind

1688717
implements	extends
if that s not possible try implements each of the interfaces that arrayobject implements one-by-one based on this manual to see which interface you really need to use for your object
make your class extends arrayobject if possible

1689290
idictionary	icollection
you cannot use the default xmlserializer implementation to de serialize idictionary objects to xml
from the msdn xmlserializer documentation the xmlserializer gives special treatment to classes that implement ienumerable or icollection

1689447
ant	pom.xml
it is not common to enrich a pom.xml with ant clutter
however some special tasks or legacy ant tasks are sometimes embedded into the pom.xml lifecycle but these are exceptions and not the common case

1689550
smtps	smtp-auth
basic smtps doesn t require auth at all
smtp-auth is defined in rfc 4954 but it doesn t define the specific type of auth you re using here auth login

1689804
margin	height
margin 0
do not set a width and height on the body this is unnecessary

1689996
realloc	malloc	free	malloc
malloc realloc free memory management is not actually aware about threads at least by now
so you should treat results of malloc as simple resource

1690059
ant	maven
this might seem tempting because you have the feeling that you regain control because you understand what is happening with ant but you are actually repeating yourself again and losing all advantages of maven
sure there is some learning curve with maven and i m not saying you ll learn it in one night but once you ll get it you ll feel the power

1690438
for-loop	arrays
your for-loop can start with the second element of the arrays because you have already initialized maxvalue with the first element
you must pass a valid arrays with at least one member to this function by definition the size of an arrays cannot be negative

1690710
free	malloc
second your function is fine but your example code has a memory leak because you never free the memory that the returned pointer points to
third as gbrandt pointed out you are not checking for success after the call to malloc

1690754
free	malloc	free	alloca
people don t remember to free the memory
there is also the problem that the caller will have to know that you used malloc and not alloca or new or something else

1691050
int	chars
normally range of int is much wider than that of chars
when you try to squeeze into a chars an int value that doesn t fit into the range of chars the value will not fit of course

1691658
jar	war
to do so you ll have to package your javaapplication as a jar including the .class files and the files under resources but not the libraries it depends on jars under lib
these dependencies will actually end up in the web-inf lib directory of the war beside the jar of your javaapplication

1692137
pexpect	subprocess
as i ve often said use pexpect not subprocess etc to run subprocess when you need to get their continuous output
pexpect fools the subprocess into believing it s running on a terminal so the subprocess will provide just the kind of output it would give on a real terminal.

1692456
put	get
the +initalize method for your test bundle to load the plugin would look like this the main method in your dummy_test host app can look like this other ideas for testing plugins use an independent bundle do not specify either bundle_loader or test_host and put your classes from the plugin also into the unittest bundle
put your test cases into the plugin and try to get that unittest

1692893
qtableview	qcombobox
views which are implemented in qt library and often do not require any modifications examples qtreeview qtableview and others
even some simpler controls like qcombobox can act as a view for a pyqt model

1693017
lisp	scheme
templates and classes were cool initially but after a while i realized that i was fighting them all the time and finding workarounds for language design problems common lisp which was ok but not widely used fo sci computing
not easy to integrate with c if compared to other languages but works scheme

1693253
innodb	myisam
i would only warn that this is going to be terribly slow in case of a innodb table as it doesn t support fulltext scans
if you want better performance with a like then you should use myisam

1693335
free	malloc
i ve frequently written malloc front-ends as a speed optimization for memory that doesn t need to be free in a steady-state
if the thread is just setting itself up you could malloc the memory prior to thread launch and have the thread call a front-end that just hands out unlinked unfreeable pieces of the dynamic block

1693671
punctuation	words
it doesn t cover interrupting phrases or clause structures or constituency tests or embedded clauses or punctuation or anything like that
also this solution requires a dictionary - a list of nouns and verbs and prepositions so that you can determine the lexical category of each words in the sentence

1694007
post	get
update updated the code below using sample code adapted from this blog post which will work better in a wider variety of outlook installations ones using both exchange and pst or accessing multiple exchange mailboxes
here s code which worked for me on outlook 2007 to set the oof status from an external to outlook exe make sure you re not running that code as administrator and outlook as non-administrator-- otherwise you may get a security-related error on vista

1694040
imperative	declarative
basically with declarative languages prolog you specifiy what you want to accomplish without specifying how to accomplish it which contrasts with imperative languages
you are confusing the concepts c and c++ are not declarative languages

1694073
class-method	delegation
then access it from the login controller and other controllers like so you could for example set mystring s value in the login controller you could read it in any other controller additionally some cocoa style tips do not capitalize class members accountsummary_button etc. do not capitalize class-method viewaccountsummary_method etc. the only thing you should capitalize are the classes themselves menu etc.
make a property in your application delegation for example an called mystring

1694580
cos	sin
you should not expect sin pi 6 to be equal to cos pi 3 for example
nor should you expect asin sin x to be equal to x even if x is in the domain for sin

1694615
int	double	16-bit	64bit
for example you might use base 10 000 where you pack one digit into a 16-bit word and you do your arithmetic on digits in 32-bit int
if you re on a 64bit machine you can double that and do base 1 000 000 000. this kind of code is relatively efficient timewise although not quite as fast as using the native power of two because you can t take advantage of the carry bit on the hardware. and you can t represent as many int in the same number of bits. but it s a whiz at converting to and from decimal because you get to convert the individual digits without any long division

1694989
post	get
in wordpress content in your site that is not controlled in the post pages widgets or links in the administration area almost always will be found in the .php files in your theme
so to find the test enjoy this article you ll need to get familiar with editing theme files

1695036
multi-tier	3-tier
by using a framework which makes a lot of sense if implementing a multi-tier architecture your are in a way forced or at least pushed into using oop which is not a bad thing
you could of course implement say a 3-tier architecture with pure functional calls but it would not scale that well based on my experience

1695210
int	boolean
javascript is not strictly typed it means in particular that it gives you some leeway int your data types and always tries to coerce the expression value to the data type it thinks to be your intention
in your if statement it tries co convert the part after || to boolean and result of conversion of postnum2 is always true

1695851
int	boolean
the method lookup attr returns a boolean but the token constructor is expecting an int as first argument
i can see public token int string but not public token boolean string maybe you are passing the wrong argument to the existing token constructor

1696122
dia	visio
some people have compared dia favorably to visio
i do not know visio but i have been using dia for almost 10 years and it s great

1697014
webclient	httpwebrequest
webclient is useful for those situations where you just want to do an operation eg post get form upload and cant be bothered to create and manage the httpwebrequest requeststream httpwebresponse and response stream
httpwebrequest exposes a lot more stuff that allows you fine grained protocol control for eg whether you want to use keep-alive what connection pool to use whether to buffer writes or not etc

1697158
cout	ofstream
i ve never written binary to cout so i can t say whether that s possible.
just make sure you write them out as binary and not human-readable text because that will make so much more difference than the difference between using ofstream or piping cout

1697158
cout	ofstream
just make sure you write them out as binary and not human-readable text because that will make so much more difference than the difference between using ofstream or piping cout
whether this means you have to use ofstream or not i don t know

1697196
public	protected
depending on the nature of the inheritance public private or protected this will affect the visibility of these data and member functions to clients users of your class
say you inherited b from a privately like this even though a has a public function it won t be visible to users of b so for example because of the private inheritance all data and member functions of a although available to the b class within the b class will not be available to code that simply uses an instance of a b class

1697205
integer	unsigned
what you have to watch out for is the following size_t is the same size as some unsigned integer type
it is not necessarily the same number of bytes as the largest unsigned integer type unsigned int unsigned long etc

1697205
integer	unsigned
it is not necessarily the same number of bytes as the largest unsigned integer type unsigned int unsigned long etc
sizeof size_t is an implementation-defined number of bytes so memcpy ing it or assigning into any integer type other than uintmax_t is a bad idea

1697569
post	get
think of an example post that could have come from an ajax request or a form by the time it hits your server it doesn t really matter
sure they re called form models because that s usually where get or post data comes from but it doesn t have to be from a form if you create a form model to represent your ajax request you get all the hooks and sanitization that come with it and it s all a little more django-esque

1698232
put	get
just put a style in a resourcedictionary as before except give it a x key and use border as it s target type this can be used as follows if you want all of your borders to have the new style it is even easier
just omit the x key and use border as your targettype this will cause all borders to get the style so you can just write answer to additional question asked in comment below to set the borderbrush the same as the background to set the child s background to the border s background generally not necessary since as long as child s background color isn t set the border s background color will show through

1698731
division	multiplication
another implementation using stl binary search on a lookup table which seems not bad not too long and still faster than division methods
it also seem easy and efficient to adapt for type much bigger than int will be faster than o digits methods and just needs multiplication no division or log function for this hypothetical type

1698851
realloc	malloc	free	malloc
if that returns non-null you can use to do something more sophisticated not bounded by an arbitrary size or spanning multiple lines you ll want to learn about dynamic memory allocation the functions malloc realloc free .
some links to help you manpages for file i o fopen fgets fclose for memory allocation malloc also just to throw it out there if you are interested in writing c++ instead of c that also has its own file i o and string stuff that you may find helpful and you won t have to do all the memory allocations yourself

1699006
equals	gethashcode
in addition i would create an almostequals method possibly even an overloaded equals which is free from the contract of equals
i would not put fuzzy logic into equals because equals as a strict contract with gethashcode

1699411
ssl	https
ssl works on site level not on folder level
once you install ssl certificate your website could be accessed using https protocol like so

1700318
put	get
it doesn t make sense to put block elements directly inside a table element and the browser might do anything at all
what you are trying to do is get shrink-to-fit width behaviour without using float which is a normal way of getting shrink-width but requires that the block in question goes to the left or right not centre

1700461
width	text-align	margin	text-align
by default div elements are the full width of the page and since you aren t specifying how wide it should be the auto margin will be 0 on both sides
in this case i would use a text-align center

1700745
lisp	smalltalk
for such an old programming language well maybe not lisp old but ruby is older than java after all and a community that fanatic about code quality style and beauty the ruby book market is surprisingly light on higher level books
there are several reasons for this a lot of rubyists are already seasoned smalltalk or lisp programmers when they pick up ruby so they don t need those books

1701079
floating-point	fractions
decimal fractions don t have exact floating-point representations
when you convert decimal fractions - binary fractions - decimal you do not have exact decimal representations and will have noise bits at the end of the binary representation

1702465
move	drag
if your drawing isn t already in a drawingbrush resource copy or move your drawing s xaml into a drawingbrush resource for example now you can edit your drawing like this go to the resources tab and find the drawingbrush create an empty window or find an empty area area of an existing window usercontrol etc drag the drawingbrush onto the artboard in the empty area select copy drawingbrush to canvas from the popup menu that appears edit the canvas using all the normal blend tools when you done editing select the canvas on the menu select now your drawing xaml will be updated inside the drawingbrush
you can move the drawing back wherever it was or you can choose to leave it there and use it as a drawingbrush

1702529
httpwebrequest	networkcredentials
the credentials set on httpwebrequest will only be passed through http s authorization header via basic digest or ntlm
so if your web service is protected with ws-security the networkcredentials will probably not be passed on to the authentication scheme at all because ws-security doesn t operate at the http level

1702742
integer	unsigned
the possible integer values modulo m are the integers from 0 to m-1 inclusive
negative values are not possible and -200 isn t a valid unsigned value under any circumstances

1702976
submit	submission
assuming you re talking about a web form i m no asp.net guru but the default behavior of an html form is to submit in this case
common causes for this are the html form fields not being contained within the form element or the submit button having a nonstandard javascript function fire instead of submission proper

1703209
cells	tablecell
however this does not address what happens when the user taps the cells and it goes highlighted - it will look squared off then
you can get around this by setting the highlighted image for your faked tablecell background image

1704015
hash	md5
you may wish to consider using another build system such as scons which does not rely solely on the timestamp but actually computes the md5 hash of source files and bases its decisions on the hash
on its web site reliable detection of build changes using md5 signatures

1704059
jar	war
i wrote up my findings in i downloaded metro 1.4 from version 1.5 is very new and i haven t looked at it which eventually unpacks to several jar files
copy webservices-api.jar webservices-rt.jar webservices-extra-api.jar and webservices-extra.jar four files to the folder containing blessed jarfiles common to all of tomcat - i believe it is tomcat lib for tomcat 6. 1 in your eclipse project eventually ending up to be a war file if your workspace jre is java 5 you must add webservices-api.jar to the classpath it should not be deployed in the end

1704644
bazaar	git
i don t know much about bazaar or monotone so i can t offer any feedback there
i can t speak for fogcreek but i know when i was choosing which dvcs to use many people commented that git does not work well on windows unless it s run in cygwin

1704807
persistent	transient
by default toplink jpa assumes that all the fields of an entity are persistent
if you want to specify a field or property of an entity that is not persistent you need to mark it with transient but this is not what you want here

1706274
apache	nginx
add the following before_filter to your applicationcontroller if you did want to do the redirect using apache you could use this
ideally you d do this in your web server apache nginx etc. configuation so that the request doesn t even touch rails at all

1706458
int	chars
the ord function in the data.char module gives an int code for each chars
given that this would be the function you re looking for i m not sure if ord c will return the ascii code for a chars or the unicode codepoint or if the result is machine dependent

1706506
hash	md5
ensuring low collisions is a design criteria for all hash and all mainstream hash do a good job of it - just use a mainstream hash md5
specific to the solution the poster is considering its not a given that parallel hashing weakens the hash

1706938
innodb	myisam
in general for any task default to innodb for its acid-compliance and row-level locking
consider resorting to myisam only for a fulltext search and b specific cases where performance under innodb isn t good enough it s fairly rare that this is significant but some types of data can benefit from myisam s profile

1707038
gedit	kdevelop	geany	kdevelop	qt-creator	kdevelop
here is a quick choice list emacs vi m multi-languages i m sure they are still used for c c++ development gedit multi-languages advanced text editor very good for rails can be pimped to mimic textmate geany another text editor based on the gtk2 toolkit eclipse netbeans intellij idea java oriented but with nice support of c c++ and php groovy grails rails monodevelop for .net development support a bunch of languages qt-creator for.
qt development anjuta kdevelop c c++ ides for gnome and kde respectively code blocks cross platform c++ ide as you can see gnu linux doesn t mean coding in a 80 columns shell potentially opened through ssh

1707475
loops	while-loop
i m not 100 sure if this is the cause but your while-loop doesn t terminate because decimal doesn t change until outside loops
thus running that loops should lock up your browser. the only other thing i can see in your updated code is that your prompt does not coerce decimal to a number

1707475
loops	while-loop
if the user doesn t input a number decimal 2 will return nan which will never equal zero so your loops won t terminate
i would suggest using parseint to convert to an integer and then if that returns nan you could either assign 0 to decimal or find some other way to skip your while-loop such as changing your while-loop s condition to

1707538
int	chars
indexb optional an int between 0 and the length of the string
substring extracts chars from indexa up to but not including indexb

1708475
subclass	superclass
from the event handling best practices emphasis added by me if you handle events in a subclass of uiview uiviewcontroller or in rare cases uiresponder you should implement all of the event-handling methods even if it is a null implementation
do not call the superclass implementation of the methods

1709233
submit	submission
if the token is missing from session variables the user is trying to submit the form again
- if the tokens do not match the user is replaying an old submission of the form

1709352
submit	submission
since you are programmatically submission the form there is no explicit user action on an individual submit button so nothing is sent
yes that is the correct behavior of htmlformelement.submit the reason your submit button value isn t sent is because html forms are designed so that they send the value of the submit button that was clicked or otherwise activated

1710140
error-handling	exception-handling
for most people the term reasonable includes all the usual expectations for error-handling that resources should not be leaked and that the program should remain in a well-defined state so that execution can continue
so the idea in the code snippet you supplied is to ensure that in the case of the exception-handling the program will return to a well-defined state

1710256
folder	directory
project- properties java build path source tab select excluded click click next to the exclusion patterns section on the bottom add the .svn folder and any others that do not need to be copied to the output directory
add the .svn folder to the excluded list for your source folder

1710483
folder	directory
put static files in the public folder within the app s directory static files static files are served from the . public directory
you can specify a different location by setting the public option set public file.dirname __file__ + static note that the public directory name is not included in the url

1710574
try-catch	exception-handling
the unhandledexception event does not capture the exception-handling in the traditional sense like a try-catch block to the best of my knowledge it is merely an information point allowing you to perform logging and such tasks
quoted from the msdn documentation this event provides notification of uncaught exception-handling

1711204
ienumerable	iqueryable
the where extension methods for ienumerable indeed take a system.func which is how you are trying to pass the predicate here
but you re working with iqueryable not ienumerable

1711204
ienumerable	iqueryable
but you re working with iqueryable not ienumerable
the where extension methods for iqueryable take a system.linq.expressions.expression not a system.func

1711392
post	get	put	get
http put and delete for example should always be idempotent but http post may or may not be
http get shouldn t substantially change the state of the system at all

1712020
xapian	whoosh
my advice is mostly related to haystack in general since i don t have experience with xapian as a backend
installing xapian from the haystack docs - note that haystack doesn t support xapian on its own it may be helpful to use whoosh during development or for testing certain things but keep in mind that it doesn t support all the features xapian does

1712020
xapian	whoosh
installing xapian from the haystack docs - note that haystack doesn t support xapian on its own it may be helpful to use whoosh during development or for testing certain things but keep in mind that it doesn t support all the features xapian does
haystack does a good job of failing gracefully a warning in your console if you try to use whoosh with a feature it doesn t support so switching between them is painless a snippet from my own code of switching between whoosh and solr easily as far as i m aware your choice of database doesn t make a difference as long as django supports it since haystack uses the orm

1713150
getdate	dateadd
recommended dateadd dd 0 datediff dd 0 getdate this is another alternative but it s risky because of casting to a float
it s also been demonstrated to not scale performance as well as the dateadd datediff approach

1713283
public	protected
the standard wcf datacontractserializer will serialize everything marked with - regardless of the .net visibility public protected private internal
when you switch to the xmlserializerformat the behavior changes - now the xmlserializer will serialize everything that has a public visibility and does not have a marked on it

1713384
.htaccess	httpd.conf
edit in response to your edit say you have a request for www.example.com dir1 dir2 dir3 file apache will look for a .htaccess in all 3 of those directories and the root for rules to apply to the request if you have overriding allowed
if you wont have to change your rules very often you should put them in the httpd.conf and turn off overriding in the top directory your rules apply to allowoverride none with no overriding your apache will not scan every directory for .htaccess files making less of an overhead for each request

1713384
.htaccess	httpd.conf
if you wont have to change your rules very often you should put them in the httpd.conf and turn off overriding in the top directory your rules apply to allowoverride none with no overriding your apache will not scan every directory for .htaccess files making less of an overhead for each request
whenever you do have to change your rules you will have to restart your apache server if you put it in your httpd.conf as opposed to them being instantly detected in .htaccess files because it reads them all on every request

1713895
folder	directory
if there isn t a controller for a url then i think pylons looks in the public folder next
for pylons you should be able to drop your static html files in the public directory

1713937
daemons	systemd
the other possibility and i think that s the standard way in windows is to have a daemons program running started by the admin so it has the necessary privileges and this daemons waits for commands to process by some means of ipc network etc. checks if the user should be allowed to do that however this is determined and eventually processes those commands
at least in unix-like operating systemd linux you cannot possibly do that in java not even with jni

1713976
stdout	fflush
the output stream stdout is usually line buffered
that means that incomplete lines need not be printed unless you force them with fflush

1715259
hash	md5
if you re asking whether you can determine if a given md5 hash is a hash of a hash or a hash of some other data then i believe the answer is no .
i m not quite sure if this is what you re asking but md5 is 128 bits 32 hex digits while sha-1 is 160 bits 40 hex digits so it s fairly easy to tell the difference between them providing of course that you know that your hashes will be either md5 or sha-1 and not something else

1715461
hash	md5
a md5 hash has no internal structure or any kind of signature that allows you detect if a 128 bit value is a md5 hash or not
a md5 hash is a 128 bit value

1716029
strtol	getline
you should probably use getline to read a line no matter what and then parse it with strtol or similar instead
yes getline is gnu-specific not posix

1716751
arp	tcp
it would appear from your question that the period of the tcp message is shorter than the arp refresh time
this implies that reuse of the arp is not causing it to stay refreshed which is possible behaviour that would be helpful in your situation

1716860
bluetooth	usb
the iphone doesn t have bluetooth file transfer i m afraid
the only way in via usb is through itunes

1716893
actionscript	mxml
once that load event is completed i instantiate my children in actionscript
i have a shell application that doesn t have any ui children declared in its mxml

1717036
post	put	post	get
anything that the code takes as input from the http request can be a sql injection vector post put content get url parameters cookies at a higher level these show up as _request or page.request values session variable it all depends on a miriad of factors
but ultimately is not just post forms

1717830
quicksort	heapsort
that allows for example a merge-sort or a linked-list version of a quicksort contrary to popular belief quicksort isn t necessarily unstable even though the most common implementation for arrays is
with that proviso the short answer is that in most current standard libraries std sort is implemented as a intro-sort introspective sort which is basically a quicksort that keeps track of its recursion depth and will switch to a heapsort usually slower but guaranteed o n log n complexity if the quicksort is using too deep of recursion

1717875
cpu	processors	cpu	affinity
so you may be starving ssis of cpu not memory
you could try changing processors affinity to allow sql server to use only 16 cores and let the memory find it s own level

1717875
affinity	processors
you could try changing processors affinity to allow sql server to use only 16 cores and let the memory find it s own level
i ve not played with the other io affinity option so have no comments

1718287
short	base
i wrote the following helper in php to generate these links works along with zend framework s zend____crypt____hmac please see for more information the following is the contents of _hex2b64 not original but helpful to see the long and short of it is that you can create a tokenized link structure that may have a ttl in a database table for example that is used to authenticate your user and authorize the download stream of your asset
as far as scalability is concerned you will need to explore all of your options including choice of database web server operating system overall efficiency of your server side code base etc

1718883
hex	binary
second you d need to use a hex editor to pick around inside the guts of the application
windows notepad will not give you the ability to edit a binary file like this

1719275
accessor	properties
this is what you achieve by forcing users to use an accessor
so in your case by making the accessor static you automatically declare and expose the fact that the corresponding properties is specific to the entire class not to a particular object of the class

1719275
accessor	properties
so in your case by making the accessor static you automatically declare and expose the fact that the corresponding properties is specific to the entire class not to a particular object of the class
note again that the static-ness of the data member is beside the point here no one will ever know or care whether there s a physical data member behind that accessor

1719350
x86	64bit
the setup was not much different other than the folder which it was installed into program files x86
i don t think there s much benefit from making cruisecontrol 64bit at the moment

1719437
floating-point	integer
the story goes that since a floating-point number always has an integer component to_int is a valid method
however i think this is spurious a float is not an integer as it has a non-integer component and so trying to equate their typeness doesn t make much sense

1719437
put	get
to put it another way oj doesn t make murder legal
so just because there is crap code in the ruby core library and believe me there is a lot doesn t mean you get to write crap too - in this particular case float#to_int is just plain wrong and shouldn t exist

1719920
ceil	floor
for your specific questions there are simple examples counterexamples for each for all x for all y floor x ceil y floor xy just take x 1 and y not integer then it s saying that ceil y floor y which is obviously not true
some x some y floor x ceil y floor xy again take x 1 and any y then it s saying that ceil y floor y which is true

1719920
ceil	floor
for all x for all y floor x ceil y ceil xy take x 1 again
it says that ceil y ceil y which cannot be true

1720228
put	get
if you are only willing to put one day in you aren t going to get a good product
why don t you just get one from someone else

1720578
fcntl	posix
the dup2 function is not marked obsolescent because it presents a type-safe version of functionality provided in a type-unsafe version by fcntl
it is used in the posix ada binding

1720747
subtract	add
however in real code you d want to actually get the heights from your existing visible components and subtract that number rather than hard-code it but you get the idea
one way to make this approach easier is to add your top fields to a separate panel that is autoheight true then after showing or hiding fields simply measure the height of that panel and subtract it from the window height plus margins padding to get your html editor height that s what i ve done in the past when i couldn t rely on a layout to manage it

1720941
int	chars
you can do this with templates template int someconstant 123 class someclass public void outputconstant cout we think the answer is someconstant
but that isn t precisely what you want because you have to declare an instance of the class as int main int argc chars argv someclass 123 myinstance

1721449
inherited	subclassing
creating a non-generic derived class just as a sort of type alias feels like an abuse of inherited to me
rather than using subclassing where there s no real specialization going on i would suggest using a separate static factory class the last method lets you use type inference as well this doesn t let you write new stuffdoer admittedly - but i think it s a cleaner solution

1721850
udp	tcp
this would happen only if you have a very big udp burst
at the risk of just pointing you back the comments to that post explain that udp doesn t block on the tcp ack but you could still block on a kernel buffer overflow

1722180
innodb	myisam
you should use innodb in such scenarios and most mysql gurus recommend using innodb by default anyway because it s considered more generally reliable than myisam despite being slower under some use cases
myisam is faster for reads and writes but not at the same time

1722714
webrat	cucumber
webrat won t help you here it s for browser based interactions so if you are specing an api it won t help
you can use post in cucumber but you need to provide the full path to the action not just the action

1723095
inherited	properties
this is pretty much the same thing andyp suggested but just looking at it from a data perspective which may not work in your scenario the other solution i could think of is to create a style targeted at some root uielement that all of your grid cell controls inherited from
in the style add a trigger to swap certain properties of your control based on some value name tag some other data binding

1723548
rss	feed
this is probably a more complicated approach than you re interested in but since the start page can show rss feed you could write a web app that would query vss via the com interface list your checkouts and publish that as a feed
if you re not looking to roll your own i did a quick search and came across vssrsssvc an application that generates rss feed from a vss database

1723585
queue	fifo
queue does not allow iteration through its elements
from the sgi stl docs a queue is an adaptor that provides a restricted subset of container functionality a queue is a fifo fifo data structure

1723660
swt	swing
check out swt and this
i think swing awt cannot do this without a guest program specific jni

1723831
inherited	properties
this helped me understand the reasoning the main difference is that the value of a normal .net properties is read directly from a private member in your class whereas the value of a dependencyproperty is resolved dynamically when calling the getvalue method that is inherited from dependencyobject
when you set a value of a dependency properties it is not stored in a field of your object but in a dictionary of keys and values provided by the base class dependencyobject

1724196
put	get
so in summary the situation is it works if you re willing to put the time into grabbing compiling and fixing stuff but it s not smooth with mainstream linux yet
mpx is where it s at for multiple-mouse and multitouch under linux but you ll need to be using xorg xserver 1.7 to get the proper version of it

1724231
x86	64bit
note that it only supports x86 and x64 and not itanium aka intel64
in order to install 64bit components the msi needs to be marked as being 64bit - otherwise filesystem and registry paths will be redirected

1724576
button	checkbox
i had to add the tooltip to the button and the image two separate ui elements and swap out the ui elements
i can t be positive but if using winforms and you have your checkbox disabled as in not enabled then the checkbox will not receive events

1724875
inherited	subclassing
but mpmovieplayercontroller inherited only from nsobject so you couldn t do that
perhaps you can subclassing mpmovieplayercontroller and setup your own stuff when play is called yet again i imagine mpmovieplayercontroller would display itself as a modal fullscreen view and hide anything you setup

1726026
int	boolean	int	chars	int	double
this is especially true if the definition of numeric is a bit different in your case according to code - unsigned int are not numerics
another thing is that datacolumn.datatype according to msdn only supports following types boolean byte chars datetime decimal double int16 int32 int64 sbyte single string timespan uint16 uint32 uint64 byte the bolded types are numerics as i define it so you need to make sure you check them

1726182
post	get
based on this blog post too it would seem setting the environment variable gomaxprocs lets you fix the number of threads
i m not sure how to get the default number of threads the runtime will manage if you do not specify this value however

1726468
sdlc	methodology
what your professsor is doing sounds like a classic case of the waterfall software design life cycle sdlc process
its major failing is not that construction phase coding is delayed but that design more or less stops when coding begins because of the impediments to change that the waterfall methodology creates

1726592
inherited	subclassing
we were testing out the grails inherited heirarchy the other day at work to look at polymorphism
we found the following scenarios abstract superclass - subclassing inherit the behavior of the parent but the parent cannot be used to reference a subclassing you want to store in the database

1726592
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
we found the following scenarios abstract superclass - subclassing inherited the behavior of the parent but the parent cannot be used to reference a subclassing you want to store in the database
superclass with tableperheirarchy false - subclassing store the parent s fields in the parent s table polymorphism works as expected

1726749
webclient	httpwebrequest
webclient does not allow you to set the timeout and the default for httpwebrequest what webclient uses is 100 seconds
i guess i will have to figure out how to get the progress when using httpwebrequest

1727033
fgets	strtok
two things first this line is not very good fgets always finish with 0 and this will give weird results with your input isn t finished exactly at n
second strtok cannot be called two times concurrently

1727035
int	chars
it can even change for the datatypes themselves an int may not be the same size from arch to arch
i attempted to demonstrate that a bit with the first two 8-bit chars followed by a 16-bit and a 32-bit for a total of 8 bytes

1727198
quicksort	mergesort
and yet most people use quicksort instead of mergesort
one psychological reason that has not been given is simply that quicksort is more cleverly named

1727499
prng	random
but it is important that you use a prng not a true rng and that you pick a prng that has the right properties
from what i can tell the random class offers a prng with a cycle length of

1727716
put	get
it tells you to put windsor.xsd somewhere on your hard drive and then reference it in the config file
what you get is not an error that will prevent you from running your application

1727963
hash	md5
the birthday paradox however tells us that if we re comparing all pairs of hash we should expect to see a collision once we have 2 16 hash on average - so don t rely on only 4 bytes on the basis that i have a lot less than 4 billion values
md5 isn t an ideal hash function as we know but the weaknesses are somewhat incidental here finding a collision on 4 bytes is well within the realm of a reasonable brute-force attack so there s no need to resort to cryptographic weaknesses

1728786
post	get
swap post for get if you re not
make the name have brackets on the end to distinguish it as an array then on the php side you would do something like if you re using post for your form

1729055
apache	nginx
one apache installation and multiple passenger processes
if you need better performance and scalability you can use nginx as a frontend proxy and forward all rails requests to multiple backend servers each one composed of apache + passenger. i m not going into the technical details here this solution is intended to be used by rails projects with an high level of traffic

1730148
ant	maven
i not maven expert but seems that maven could run ant task maven antrun plugin - usage and to my knowledge there is no unofficial support too
according to the is there a ice maven integration thread on the zeroc forums there is no official plugin for integrate ice with maven you can use ant and slice2java ant task

1730317
innodb	myisam
it is a massive over simplification in some cases and plain wrong in others to say we know that myisam is faster than innodb
if you ve tuned innodb properly for your server and are running proper server-grade hardware innodb should be able to compete with myisam on most queries excluding full table scans but you re not doing many of those right

1730676
scrollable	panels
or you can create a custom panels and implement the scrollable interface
the key in this case is overriding getscrollabletracksviewportwidth to return true so the viewports width and not the width of the panels is used for layout purposes

1730863
postgresql	mysql
my general thoughts on foreign keys is that they re great but not usable in mysql and that postgresql handles them much better
foreign keys in mysql are only available to certain database engines

1732272
dbf	dbase
i just double checked some dbf files that i have on hand and they do not have dbf in the header
sounds like a dbase file to me

1732402
filesystems	xfs
you first have the filesystems to be concerned with
not sure if you re using lvm ext3 xfs or what but if you re on lvm you might want to checkout the dmsetup man page

1733555
hex	binary	octal	binary
hex and octal are close enough to binary
most data on a hdd is binary data not meant to represent printable characters so if you use cat a command meant to output text not binary you get meaningless mush

1733945
free	malloc
if you call malloc several times to get several different chunks of memory in general it doesn t matter what order you call free when you have done with them
however the order is important here for a very specific reason you are using one chunk of malloc ed memory to hold the pointers to other chunks of malloc ed memory

1734289
persistent	transient
as for mom versioning the core data model versioning and data migration programming guide says core data s perspective on versioning is that it is only interested in features of the model that affect persistent
it doesn t clarify its position on transient properties however

1734444
ubuntu	linux
however unless you know how to fix future apt-get errors i d recommend not manually deleting any files that were installed by packages in ubuntu
j3ll3 in ubuntu or any dpkg-based linux os you can ask the question what package provides xyz by typing dpkg -s path to xyz so for example in ubuntu 9.10 dpkg -s usr lib python2.5 lib-dynload gdbm.so returns python-gdbm usr lib python2.5 lib-dynload gdbm.so you can find out more about the python-gdbm package by typing apt-cache show python-gdbm which says that python-gdbm provides gnu dbm database support for python . perhaps more interestingly if you type dpkg --listfiles python-gdbm you get to see a listing of all the files that python-gdbm installs ... usr lib python2.4 usr lib python2.4 lib-dynload usr lib python2.4 lib-dynload gdbm.so usr lib python2.5 usr lib python2.5 lib-dynload usr lib python2.5 lib-dynload gdbm.so usr lib python2.6 usr lib python2.6 lib-dynload usr lib python2.6 lib-dynload gdbm.so ... so it looks like this single package installs 3 .so libraries one for each version of python

1735120
objectdatasource	detailsview
here s an example illustrating how to use an objectdatasource with a detailsview
why not use a objectdatasource

1735300
next	except
to solve it your event handler should post a notification to the main thread which the main thread will handle asynchronously whenever it happens to next check for messages
if you have a recent-enough delphi version you could try the tthread.queue method which works a lot like synchronize except the calling thread doesn t block waiting for the main thread to run the given method

1735300
post	get
application.mainform is a tempting target but delphi forms are liable to be re-created without notice so whatever window handle your other threads use might not be valid at the time they try to post a message
and reading the mainform.handle property on demand isn t safe either since if the form has no handle at the time it will get created in the socket thread s context which will cause all sorts of problems later

1735300
post	get
it could look something like this prepare and post the message like this note that the caller allocates a new record pointer but it does not free it
it will get freed by the recipient

1735350
abc	subclassing
if our something method in the abc base class above has a relaxed precondition that permits any integer then all subclassing of abc must also permit any integer
a subclassing greenabc is not allowed to add an additional precondition to the something method that requires the parameter to be a positive integer

1735623
serializable	deserialization
if the class implementing serializable contains a field which you d like not to be stored on the disk file system for example private string password bad example but it should give you the idea then you can just declare it transient to avoid its value being serializable to disk private transient string password
you only have to live with the fact that it won t be restored with its original value after deserialization

1735989
codeigniter	yii
with codeigniter it is recommended that all controller methods that should not be accessible via browser are declared private
yii brings this to another level requiring that all such methods start name with action it would be actionedit in your example so you really cannot call some arbitrary method from outside

1737338
daemons	systemd
first the client which is part of the cgi and this is the main daemons loop
this seems the easiest path to me as it does not involve creating another communication channel client apache your cgized existing script embedded systemd as opposed to client apache new cgi script existing script embedded systemd i assume the reason is that you expect the cgi script to run multiple times simultaneously and the embedded systemd is not able to handle multiple connections

1737564
cil	ildasm
if you are just starting out here are the top 5 books learning tools i would recommend good for the cli and fundamentals of the cil ecma 335 spec serge lidin s apress book - expert .net 2.0 il assembler optional and a little outdated o rielly s shard source cli essentials with the pdf of the second edition s dreaft mentioned above
good for learning to program with cil jason bock s apress book cil programming this is .net 1.1 and doesn t have generics but is good to build upon #1 and #2 - this book helps you with writing apps in il reflector and ildasm ..

1737973
mp3	wav
don t forget that an mp3 file is compressed whereas a wav isn t
so the delay might be the time it takes to read the mp3 file into memory and decompress it which doesn t have to happen with the wav file

1738206
int	double
if is an array of double s the casting is correct although your code is overly complicated -- you should just use index i as the control variable in the loop and use it to index the input array of double s as well as the resulting array of int s
the resulting silence may be due to the input double s not being in the right range you might need some scaling

1738489
versioning	upgrade
chances are you have an old versioning of some build tool or app
sudo port selfupdate sudo port -u upgrade outdated edit based on your additional information more questions you have -i sw include and -l sw lib which are standard locations for fink not macports

1738793
turing	algol
c++ templates have been shown to be turing powerful
although not a formal reference here s a place to look in that regard i will venture a guess as old as a folkoric and concise cacm proof showing that algol in the 60 s could not be reprsented by a cfg and say that c++ cannot therefore be correctly parsed only by a cfg

1739928
installation	upgrade
with a 64-bit python installation and say 64 gb of memory a python 2 string of around 63 gb should be quite feasible if not maximally fast
if you can upgrade your memory much beyond that which will cost you an arm and a leg of course your maximum feasible strings should get proportionally longer

1740020
vb6	vba
a basic example might look like this it s not great but it s about as good as it s going to get with vba vb6
as jtolle indicated this is simply not possible in vba vb6

1740020
vb6	vba
as jtolle indicated this is simply not possible in vba vb6
there is no perfect way to work around this but what i personally do is create a public friend sub call initialize with the parameters i want in vba vb6 you use optional parameters for overloading and then put a quick check in all exposed members of the class that throws an exception if you try to access them without running the initialize method

1740122
matlab	simulink
an example of what matlab can do that r cannot is interface to real-time hardware for signal processing acquisition and control
a simulink model in matlab can be configured both to run in simulation on your machine before compiling the code to execute on a real system taking measured data as input and calculating appropriate outputs what was before a simulation of a control system is now a fully functioning one

1740756
hash	salt
naturally that will not be compatible with the auth module but i d like to mention it anyway since it s just best practice to use a slow hash and not to rely on secrets that are difficult to keep like the salt_patten
regarding point 1 the hash_password function is used both to generate the password hash against the salt and including the salt that is stored in the database at signup-time as well as to recreate that hash when the password needs to be verified at login-time

1740756
hash	salt
if the salt_pattern can be kept secret then that provides additional security since an adversary will not be able to do offline brute-forcing of the hash since the method of hashing is not reproducible if the salt_pattern can be kept secret the hash_password function will first hash the password against the salt and then insert each char of the salt into the password hash at the corresponding salt_pattern offset
find_salt will extract these salt chars so that the hash can be reproduced

1740756
hash	salt
although you can also see it has hash_password hiding the salt and find_salt finding it this method of encryption can t be called steganography i think because it is clear from the code that there is a salt stored with the password hash the existence of the salt is not secret
regarding point 2 using your own salt is straightforward and fully compatible with the auth module and an already existing database

1740756
salt	md5
regarding point 3 using a per user salt uniqid by default is not overkill
especially with md5 which is broken for security purposes and where finding collisions is already practical with today s technology

1740789
super	implements
of course remember to call super init first if you do go with just one method
for example and in the view controller you should alloc and init a testaccel object not an acc object also testaccel should implements the uiaccelerometerdelegate protocol and your view controller should not

1741105
switching	screens
in windows when the alt-tab dialog if dialog is the appropriate term doesn t persist i want to use mro for switching
i appreciate it in windows alt-tab switching but hate it for situations where tabs are visually present at the top of the screens

1741131
persistent	transient
also when creating the nsfetchedresultscontroller the sectionnamekeypath has this limitation if this key path is not the same as that specified by the first sort descriptor in fetchrequest they must generate the same relative orderings. for example the first sort descriptor in fetchrequest might specify the key for a persistent property
sectionnamekeypath might specify a key for a transient property derived from the persistent property

1741809
onsubmit	onload
opera s calling of load and unload events is inconsistent so you have to use onsubmit instead or setting the hidden field on a polling interval or something
worse when opera remembers previous form-field values it actually doesn t fill them in until after onload has fired

1742184
prepare	execute
in addition to preventing sql injection pdo allows you to prepare a query once and execute it multiple times
if your query is execute multiple times within a loop for instance this method should be more efficient i say should be because it looks like that is not always the case on older versions of mysql

1742307
hide	show
all i therefore have to do is set the appropriate value for display before i hide the elements
initial state calling .hide takes us to this state calling show brings us back to this state the main problem was that i was not giving the elements a value for display in my initial state

1743708
hash	md5
if not keep the files who have the same file size version and compute their md5 sha1 whatever-you-prefer hash
if the hash is the same you re definitely in presence of the same assembly twice

1744404
post	get
using post requests will not magically make your website secure against malicious attacks by a noticeable amount
however using get requests can make an otherwise secure application insecure

1744404
post	get
proxy cache caching proxies might retain get responses but not post responses
having said that get responses can be made non-cacheable with less effort than converting the url to a post handler

1745027
post	get
first your server requests for something like this should be post not get
only get requests should be idempotent and not doing so is actually a violation of the http specification

1745597
width	height	width	margin
so i have found out that all versions of ie do not play well with anything withing the tabs having 100 width or an absolute width that fits the largest amount possible within the tabs ex
you have a tab that s 600 pixels in width with 5px of padding on each side you cannot have a div that is 550px or larger for the width this also applies to the height in addition if you have multiple divs floating that come close to equaling the width height - padding margin when added together it will crash ie 6 but not ie 7

1746127
int	chars
if you really want to name your property int don t do this you can use the verbatim operator from msdn the prefix enables the use of keywords as identifiers which is useful when interfacing with other programming languages
the chars is not actually part of the identifier so the identifier might be seen in other languages as a normal identifier without the prefix

1746480
freebsd	linux	freebsd	opensolaris
i built three servers for my latest project using freebsd and couldn t be happier
here is a very good albeit a bit outdated article about freebsd vs linux vs windows sorry no opensolaris

1746956
fgets	getline
if you can bound the maximum length of a line fgets may be a better way to read each line
but since you mention c++ you might consider using instead getline caveat fgets also put the n in the buffer it fills getline doesn t

1747303
haskell	ocaml
what you want is just a non-tagged union which is not an algebraic data type and isn t supported by haskell
ocaml has polymorphic variants see other answers

1747886
doc	rtf
i remembered the rtf capabilities of the clipboard and realised that a class could be created that would copy rtf data to the clipboard paste to a word doc and output the resulting plain text
the benefit of this solution is that the word doc object would not have to be opened and closed for each rtf string

1749455
hash	md5
if it s a 1 1 compare just use import filecmp filecmp.cmp file_name_1 file_name_2 on the other hand a good hash is the only way to compare a large number of files with each-other
sha-1 and md5 sort of broken - but not for normal files

1749816
versioning	upgrade
this was for a jdeveloper project and it turned out that the jdeveloper upgrade 11.1.1.2.0 that i d just installed incorporated a later versioning of svnkit than the one i use for command-line svn access jsvn
so jdeveloper had quietly upgrade the format of the .svn files which meant that the command-line client couldn t understand them. the penny dropped when jsvn complained about a missing file .svn format in my project s top-level directory

1750090
memcached	apc
memcached in my experience is better at handling large numbers of concurrent writes to a single cache key
apc doesn t seem to cope very well with its cache filling up

1750638
geocoding	geocode
that doesn t explain that particular address but it does affect the geocoding of many uk locations
there was a bug in the api geocode maps.google.com geocoding was not affected a while ago that caused it to get wrong information about the existence of certain house numbers in a street

1750785
hash	md5
md5 isn t encryption it s a one-way hash
the only purpose of using a better one-way hash is to delay reversing the password

1750821
hash	md5
i think that it s worth upgrading to a better hash algorithm
also the motivation for ditching md5 in favor of sha-1 or sha-256 would be that md5 is broken. there are shortcuts to find hash collisions so that brute-force isn t required

1750879
post	get
you shouldn t have to worry about the size limit of the post string unless you know your server is configured to allow ridiculously small amounts of post data or that your xml file is heinously unimaginably large
the limits on get post string length are both theoretical and vary between browsers and servers

1751207
salt	md5
of course all passwords should always be stored with a salt for further obscurity
example there is also the md5 function but with the rise of colossal rainbow tables it s not 100 reliable as a way of completely obfuscating stored passwords

1751462
integer	unsigned
logical bit pattern bits of value-representation values of binary digits can only be preserved if the original signed value was non-negative because negative values cannot be represented by an unsigned integer variable
all you need to do is to assign your signed value to your unsigned integral object and you are done an explicit cast is not necessary but might be used to suppress compiler warnings

1751784
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
subclass the root view controller as uinavigationcontroller instead of uiviewcontroller
the app is trying to treat your uiviewcontroller like a uinavigationcontroller which it s not

1751958
versioning	upgrade
imo things have not changed too much from the versioning 2.1 which stephan keller described in his comprehensive answer
the company i am working for is currently using td versioning 5.1 and considering upgrade to td 5.2 next year

1752167
client-side	server-side
this essentially breaks all client-side validation
it s important to note that server-side validation does not automatically keep your page from processing

1752378
hash	md5
using a hash like md5 or sha on the id is not a good idea there is always the possibility of collisions
that is two different ids hash to the same value

1753040
hash	salt
storing the salt unencrypted in the database next to the hash passwords is not a problem
the purpose of the salt is not to be secret

1753464
phpunit	simpletest
i could not understand how to download and install phpunit
i could however easily understand how to install simpletest

1753503
post	get
this means that if a post response includes cache-control or expires or given a strict reading of section 13 even a validator like last-modified or etag the response can be used to satisfy future get requests
1 since the post is not sending a no-cache the default is the response won t be cached

1753739
jobs	cron
also when there s schedule changes just create too many cron jobs that cover the regular times and the different times then have the job check to see if this is a valid time to start
couldn t a cron job trigger twice

1753772
for-loop	arrays
most arrays count from 0 up to array.length-1 if you replace your for-loop with this you might this avoids the entire issue
instead of using this exception you should fix your code so that you do not go past arrays boundaries

1755134
maven	pom.xml
without ranges maven wouldn t have to check remote repositories for a newer version than the one available in your local repo
my idea to resolve this problem is to change jasper pom.xml and use proxy repository but i looking to another option

1755821
fast-forward	merge
you can test it easily enough here in a powershell session with git1.6.5.1 on xp first create a small bat utility genfile.bat then create a repo and add a file your file looks like this hello world 1 hello world 2 hello world 3 hello world 4 hello world 5 modify it in a branch you will have hello world 1 hello world 2_modified hello world 3 hello world 4 hello world 5 then modify it in master which gives you hello world 1_master hello world 2 hello world 3 hello world 4 hello world 5 clone that repo for a first experiment a merge of abranch into master that gives you a conflict clone the first repo again this time to rebase first abranch on top of master with no context your file is silently merge hello world 1_master hello world 2_modified hello world 3 hello world 4 hello world 5 off course if you switch back to master and now merge abranch the result will be a fast-forward merge
couple of comments first such a small example would never be merge anyway warning cannot merge binary files afile.txt head vs

1756131
hash	md5
however because the md5 hash function has been broken it s vulnerable to a collision attack any determined attacker can produce 2 colliding assets in a matter of seconds worth of cpu power
so if you want to use md5 make sure that such an attacker would not compromise the security of your application

1756180
qlayout	qwidget
depending of the qlayout you are using parameters of the add function will not be the same
you should add any qwidget to the qlayout of the form.this will put it into the display strategy of the form when resizing it

1757027
triples	virtuoso
yes in two ways as stephen says an rdbms will not natively execute sparql for you but may be used to store the triples as a backend
additionally you can use a rdbms as a store for relational data but with a dynamic mapping to rdf such as via d2rq or openlink virtuoso s rdf views system

1757330
profiling	debugging
i would recommend using a profiling as others have mentioned and compare only similar configurations
i don t think anyone has mentioned this yet but the debugging build may not only affect the way your code executes but also the way the timer itself executes

1757781
hex	binary
for parsing hex to an integer and then down to binary use something like this build the protocol packet with something like this
i see two mistakes token should be passed in binary and not in hex ascii

1757781
hex	binary
i see two mistakes token should be passed in binary and not in hex ascii
you can t use the binary syntax to turn lists into binaries

1758025
folder	directory
way the default resource manager works in asp.net is it picks the resex entries for the respective aspx file from the app_localresources folder in the current directory
as far as i know this behavior is not something you can configure i.e to ask it to pick entries from a different folder

1758384
maven	pom.xml
however if you want your modules to inherit common elements from the parent pom.xml then you have to use maven inheritance
strictly speaking if you are using inheritance and want to build only a sub-project then the parent pom.xml doesn t have to be present in the parent directory

1758403
intersect	contains
1 2 you can use the intersect extension method to do this
however if your second array contains elements not found in the first one these will then be in the resulting list intersect works symmetrically

1758706
put	get
you can put code in a php script to open a connection to a specific hostname or ip address and port. if you know the expected response you should be able to tell if you are getting a connection
if you get something like connection refused then either you are being blocked or the destination host is not accepting connections on that port

1759072
multibyte	substr	strlen	substr
you are using multibyte strings and strlen is not mb aware use the idioms substr session 0 -32 to get the payload part of the string
maybe substr doesn t cope with multibyte strings too use explicitally mb_substr or whatever it is called

1759117
hash	salt
in my limited experience you would take the user s inputted password hash it with a salt the same salt used to hash the stored password and compare with the stored hash value
if the validation fails the hash values are not equal log the plain text version of the password used for the attempt

1759130
calloc	malloc
you weren t checking the return value of malloc now calloc but same rules apply
if there isn t enough memory calloc returns null

1759292
ubuntu	debian
the debian guide can be quite useful when it comes to ubuntu normally programs install themselves in the usr local subdirectories
but debian packages must not use that directory since it is reserved for system administrator s or user s private use usr local bin seems to be acceptable according to the guide

1759575
inline	inlining
in maximally optimized code usually all private methods are inline whether you ask for it or not
as an aside to prevent inlining in gcc use __attribute__ noinline and in visual studio use __declspec noinline

1759711
installation	downgrade
finally if the new component was marked for installation and windows installer encounters a file with the same name as the one it is trying to install the file versioning rules determine whether the file is replaced or not
for example a file with a higher version will not be downgrade

1760034
inherited	properties
it s usual to restrict behavior of enherited controls even though it breaks the inherited concept
you have some options using editorbrowsableattribute will hide the properties from intellisense using browsableattribute will hide the properties from properties grids hiding the properties themselves using private new will hide them from everything things to consider using attributes will hide the properties depending on the implementation of the consumer but in a language level you aren t hiding anything

1760471
inline-functions	inlining
implicit template instantiations have special linkage as inline-functions do
there is also static keyword which has been deprecated in favor of anonymous namespaces so yes this specialization in your example has the same linkage as in fact the compiler may mumble about inlining the specialization in your example saying they do not match

1760867
public	protected
personally i prefer putting public methods first followed by protected methods following by private methods
member data should in general always be private or protected unless you have a good reason for it not to be so

1760924
atomic	interlocked
in the consumer if pshared- atomic.compareandswap_acquire 1 1 v pshared- goo without a read barrier here you won t know that the hardware hasn t gone and fetched goo for you before the atomic access is complete
the atomic ie memory manipulated with the interlocked functions doing stuff like lock cmpxchg is only atomic with respect to itself not other memory

1761003
ascx	scriptmanager
i was creating a custom ascx control and wanted to be able to not worry about whether or not the calling page had the scriptmanager declared
i got around the issues by adding the following to the ascx contorl itself

1761510
chunked	transfer-encoding
also chunked encoding is not activated for all responses - usually the server switches it on when content-length is not set or when the output buffer is flushed
rfc 2616 says all http 1.1 applications must be able to receive and decode the chunked transfer-coding transfer-encoding chunked is defined for http 1.1

1761510
chunked	transfer-encoding
rfc 2616 says all http 1.1 applications must be able to receive and decode the chunked transfer-coding transfer-encoding chunked is defined for http 1.1
in that case the server must not use transfer-encoding as it s not a part of the protocol

1762445
innodb	myisam
they probably had some problem with innodb and restored their database from backups
since innodb wasn t working it fell back to the myisam storage engine which doesn t support integrity constraints like foreign keys

1762445
innodb	myisam
since innodb wasn t working it fell back to the myisam storage engine which doesn t support integrity constraints like foreign keys
basically the problem is that if the innodb engine fails to start for whatever reason usually configuration problems -- then mysql silently falls back to the myisam engine

1762445
innodb	myisam
basically the problem is that if the innodb engine fails to start for whatever reason usually configuration problems -- then mysql silently falls back to the myisam engine
even if your statement says then if innodb isn t active mysql will happily create a myisam table without even warning you

1763222
hide	show
there s no special option in itunes connect to hide your app
while your application will be found when searched for as long as it s not installed in large numbers it won t show up in the top 50 lists

1763241
implements	extends
edit in this example objects implements sortedmap which extends map are accepted too so in your case you could create a baseinterface and extends that in the interfaces like acceptedinterface extends baseinterface you want to be accepted by your .register baseinterface arg method
to accept only objects that implement an interface as argument use the interface as type can be called with objects implements the map interface like hashmap but not with string s for instance as they do not implement map

1763304
rsa	3des	rsa	aes
pci dss does not require 1024 bit rsa to encrypt
older versions of the specification mentioned aes and 3des by name but i believe newer versions just specify strong encryption

1763557
jstl	trinidad
jsf-api are the interfaces and classes in javax.faces jstl is a standard set of tags used primarily in jsp - most of them are replaced with jsf-tags btw facelets is a presentation and templating framework like jsp myfaces is an implementation of the jsf standard
the other possibility if jsf ri reference implementation trinidad and tobago are component libraries - some goodies that aren t included in the default set of jsf components jsp is the alternative to facelets or vice versa which is as well a presentation framework

1763602
filtering	grouping
since you are looking for a list of events and using generic relations your only bet is probably to add some sql via the .extra filtering
i m not sure i would even know what sql you would need to run for this since it would probably need grouping by and having clauses

1764025
percentile	max
your e percentile is computed if you only want to show then the top 10 try the following it isn t totally clear what you re looking for but i think this could be helpful
edit after looking over the comments specifically riven s and larry lustig s and re-reading the question i d have to say that the sum of the video_views is incorrect so i went back and changed the sum s to max s

1764206
unsigned	short
the short of it is that your p invoke signature is broken -- it will only work correctly on 32-bit platforms because c# uint is always 32-bits while the unsigned long will be 64-bits on lp64 platforms and will fail rather horribly on 64-bit platforms
there are three fixes iff you will always be on unixy platforms ilp32 and lp64 platforms only not p64 win64 you can use uintptr for unsigned long

1764424
children	parent
this is not a real answer but since so many people seem to believe that win32 forbids creating children in other threads than the parent i feel obliged to post a demonstration to the contrary
the code below demonstrates creation of a child window on a parent belonging to a different process

1764797
base-class	subclassing
pushing all the methods from the subclassing to the base-class seems odd to say the least
why not attempt to dynamic_cast each object to the interface with the method you want to call - if the cast returns a nullptr then skip it alternatively call all of the actions from a single method in the subclassing - execute

1764927
post	get
if the site renders a textbox it ll know that the value may have changed and it updates its value based on the post data
if it renders a disabled textbox for instance it knows that the value cannot have changed and so you will not be able to get the changed text even if a javascript has enabled the textbox

1765105
cassini	iis
it does not work with the vs development web server cassini
also make sure that you have enabled asp debugging in iis iis home directory properties iis application configuration once you have the configuration in iis as noted above here is how to attach the debugger open the classic asp files in visual studio set a breakpoint anywhere you want to break in the server-side code view the page in a web browser ensures that the host process is running in visual studio debug menu - attach to process locate the iis asp worker process w3wp.exe on iis6 dllhost.exe on iis5.1 attach to the script code for the host process see below for example attach debugger dialog at this point the breakpoint should bind and you should be able to debug the classic asp pages

1765564
octal	hex	octal	decimal
- ie any number starting with 0 and not followed by x is octal 0 0 01 1 02 2 ... 07 7 010 8 011 9 012 10 ... -
by the way everyone 0x0 is hex as you have all mentioned but 0 is octal not decimal

1766808
gentoo	ubuntu
be warned gentoo is not a drop dead simple distro to use ubuntu -- you have to understand a bit about how the os works -- but it does provide an excellent developerment environment
as nick stinemates mentioned gentoo is an excellent distro for developing java

1767044
ilist	icollection
from msdn ilist is a descendant of the icollection interface and is the base interface of all non-generic lists. ilist implementations fall into three categories read-only fixed-size and variable-size
a read-only ilist cannot be modified

1767044
ilist	icollection
a variable-size ilist allows the addition removal and modification of elements
the icollection t interface does not have an indexer so a fixed-size icollection t is automatically readonly - there is no way to modify an existing item

1767552
firefox	safari
safari and ie interpret multiple references to the same image and make a single request while firefox appears to make a unique request for each image linked to via css
i realize its probably not specificly understood as a bug but in an era where browsers are competing for being labeled the fastest -- seems like a potential improvement for firefox

1768086
inherited	properties
the difference is in the latter example you re creating a static method which is not inherited if example is a constructor function
by defining properties in the prototype properties of a constructor function and creating objects with the new keyword the newly created objects inherit the prototype of the constructor and thus have access to those methods

1768123
int	double
i think i would implement the interface comparable in the class temperature and the implementation of this interface i would also add some static factory methods such as public static temperature fromcelsius double celsiustemperature and i would create some constants for known temperatures such as the water freezing point and then it would all be a matter of comparing then both perhaps you should use just an int to represent the temperature if you don t need the extra precision
you re not dealing with money so double should be enough but if it isn t then perhaps bigdecimal is more suitable

1768688
folder	directory
if you have downloaded the binary distribution then in the folder where ajaxcontroltoolkit.dll is found release or debug not sure which you should also see a whole bunch of directory named according to culture code such as fr zh-cht ja and so on each one containing ajaxcontroltoolkit.resources.dll
you need to copy the language folders you want to your website s bin directory so that the resources will be loaded and used by the .net runtime for the matching culture

1769144
google-chrome	firefox
i believe safari and google-chrome do too
the regular expression engine in firefox compiles some not all

1769319
multibyte	substr
as has been pointed out above all of the note glyphs are multibyte characters
additionally java char s are just 16 bits wide so a single char cannot reliably represent a single unicode character on its own - and subsequently the substr method isn t wholly multibyte friendly

1770148
maven	pom.xml
there is actually an issue about that mng-1991 but it won t be solved in maven 2.x and i m not sure that i don t know if overlays allow to workaround this issue
my understanding of the suggested solution is to duplicate the dependencies for example in a project of type pom.xml

1770469
appfuse	spring
it doesn t have the power of appfuse but is a good way to learn by example
mesir is simply a project skeleton using many useful frameworks including spring and hibernate

1771092
int	double
imagine for a moment this inheritance double extends int extends number
this is not correct in java but imagine that double is just an int plus a fractions part

1771258
folder	directory
the other is that you are trying to edit a folder location after costfinalize has set directory locations
to update directory at this time you cannot merely change their associated properties

1771523
profiler	perf
someone pointing at microbenchmarks showing that something like i j with j 0 is 10x slower catching div-by-zero than checking j 0 pragmatic answer of how to approach performance for apps in general usually along the lines of make perf goals for your scenarios ideally working with customers build it so it s maintainable readable and robust run it and check perf of goal scenarios if a set of scenarios aren t making goal use a profiler to tell you where your time is being spent and go from there
iow any perf changes especially micro-optimizations like this made without profiling data driving that decision is typically a huge waste of time

1772067
scrummaster	sprint
your scrummaster needs to take care of this there is no magical solution
when asking for more detail one is informed that you are asking for too much detail and since this is agile the requirement will become clearer later during the sprint 2 week sprint and you should not worry about the detail just then but rather to just give the story a weight in doll hairs and stop being difficult

1772264
post	get
i would do as above but you could hook it into your solutions post build event but this wouldn t be parallel more a quick switch
i think there s a registry hack out there to get multiple sites in iis or if memory serves if you create an additional site through a script it works it s just the gui that s locked down

1772873
folder	directory
restlib.php myapp appinclude.php myapp index.php in your second example the layout would need to be like this to work facebook php facebook.php myapp anotherdirectory index.php myapp appinclude.php notice the appinclude.php and index.php are not in the same folder
index.php looks for a file appinclude.php in the directory above itself and appinclude.php looks for a file facebook php facebook.php in the directory above itself

1773764
post	put
member post not so much as collection put delete
the missing member post is more a case of being made redundant by the default collection post action

1773941
put	get
otherwise you cannot put a list int and a list double together to get a set number which should logically be possible
once you get to generics nested inside generics things always get nasty

1774881
accessor	properties	inline	inlining
so all these properties accessor that would have been inline will be real calls now
thx to inlining simple properties will not add real overhead at runtime

1775953
des	aes	tripledes	aes
pem is a very old format so it only supports des tripledes
aes and blowfish were added later on but not supported by all implementations

1776561
put	get
then inside the mask clip do not set it as mask put a 10 alpha shape covering the entire background and a circular shape with 100 alpha that follows your mouse.
you can even put some blur to the circular shape so you get a nice gradient.

1776642
innodb	myisam
ok ok unless you absolutely have to often due to fulltext matching not being available in innodb
even then you re often better off putting the canonical data in innodb and the fulltext index on a separate myisam searchbait table which you can then process for stemming. do use binary columns when you want rigorous string matching otherwise you get a case-insensitive comparison by default

1776845
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari
you nest your video references so that browsers try these in order falling back if it s not supported ogg theora mp4 h.264 a flash container displaying #2 number 1 gets you firefox 3.5 and google-chrome
number 2 gets you safari and the mobile phone webkit browsers

1776875
width	height
you have set your peace-main div to have the width 100 so there is no room for the right content beside it
in standards compliant browsers however the div doesn t have any height as it only contains floating elements so it s not a problem that the right content ends up below it

1776966
post	get
do all aspects of the transaction begin transaction processing and commit all during the post triggered by the save button
the solution is not to open the transaction during the get phase

1777246
webclient	httpwebrequest
imho overriding getwebrequest is the best solution to webclient s limited functionalty
before i knew about this option i wrote lots of really painful code at the httpwebrequest layer because webclient almost but not quite did what i needed

1777448
postgresql	mysql
rails is married to mysql so i m not surprised that it generates sql that doesn t work in postgresql
mysql s totally non standards compliant group by can be emulated by postgresql distinct on

1777493
post	get
all good points however in answer to the question get requests are more useful in certain scenarios over post requests they can be bookmarked they can be cached they re faster they have known consequences assuming they don t change data so visiting them multiple times is not a problem
for the sake of posterity updating this comment with the blog notes re point #3 here all credit to omar al zabir the author of the referenced blog post atlas by default makes http post for all ajax calls

1777622
int	chars
unsigned chars y and e occupy the same space again depending on the fact that int is 32 bits so .y and .e are effectively aliases for each other
the unsigned chars a.z does not overlap any element of struct b so it is effectively immune to changes to b

1777759
innodb	myisam
innodb maintains referential integriry
myisam does not

1778345
inherited	subclassing	uisegmentedcontrol	uibutton
otherwise you should probably subclassing the uisegmentedcontrol which inherited from the uiresponder and handle the extra touches yourself don t forget to call super in any touch method you override
the uibutton does not inherited from the uiresponder so you can not get touchesbegan touchedended etc events directly

1778620
jboss	weblogic
this is actually a well known problems with jboss 4.2.3.ga and the convention plug-in 2.1.6
quoting chris vogel in this thread that faced the same problem with weblogic in case you haven t figured it out i ll tell you what i have learned. struts xworks scans for action classes and does this by scanning directories it is given by the class loader not just by looking at jar files

1778916
hash	md5
government applications will be required to move to the sha-2 family of hash functions by 2010. 8 i think one major problem with it is that there are rainbow tables of md5 hash all over these days so bare md5 is very susceptible to brute forcing
consider it a useful tool for minor obsfucation and sanitizing complex data sets but it is not a truly secure hash any more

1778916
hash	salt	hash	md5
consider it a useful tool for minor obsfucation and sanitizing complex data sets but it is not a truly secure hash any more
there may be special hoops that you can jump through like both using a salt and performing nested md5 hashings to make it more secure though i m no cryptographer

1778964
trie	tree
a trie is an uncompressed prefix tree a tree in which the paths from root to leaf nodes correspond to all the prefixes of a given string
tries should be compared to and offset against suffix tree suffix arrays and q-gram indices not so much against other search tree because the data that they search is different instead of discrete words in a corpus the latter index structures allow a factor search

1779064
spaces	delimiter
first off your linked udf s default delimiter is the character not spaces
so using the default delimiter as you are you re getting a single row back with both words in it

1779804
httpconnection	downloading
you are welcome to downloading files from urls via httpconnection or httpclient both part of the android sdk
the downloading manager is not part of the public sdk

1779818
versioning	upgrade
imagine you have an application that needs versioning 1 of libfoo but another application requires versioning 2
if you install everything into usr lib python2.4 site-packages or whatever your platform s standard location is it s easy to end up in a situation where you unintentionally upgrade an application that shouldn t be upgrade

1779946
plpgsql	plpython
plpgsql is very well integrated with sql - the source code should be very clean and readable
for sql languages like pljava or plpython sql statements have to be isolated - sql isn t part of language

1780463
int	chars
if you don t have this last guarantee you may simply write a function that creates your int array on the fly the caller is responsible for freeing the dest buffer. i m not sure if it really works i didn t test it
if you are working in c you have your string in a chars array that is of a size multiple of a int you can just take the pointer to the chars array cast it to a pointer to a int array and do whatever you want with your int array

1780746
webclient	httpwebrequest
for example you may need to authenticate with a web site before you can request the page you really want and webclient might not be able to do that
httpwebrequest will

1781252
ant	cruisecontrol
for example if you are using cruisecontrol anything that you can do from an ant script can be automated
and that includes calling other not necessarily ant scripts as well

1782401
put	get
because all of the machines are in your domain you can put together a vbscript that will get the macaddress es from the local machine and store it as an attribute of the computer object in active directory
here s a quick hack on how to do that save this as a .vbs-file because your clients aren t all in the member servers ou above you ll need to modify the above script to include a directory search for the strcomputername do get the computerlocation

1782787
equals	compareto	comparator	comparable
quoting note that the ordering maintained by a sorted map whether or not an explicit comparator is provided must be consistent with equals if this sorted map is to correctly implement the map interface
see comparable or comparator for a precise definition of consistent with equals. this is so because the map interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a map performs all key comparisons using its compareto or compare method so two keys that are deemed equal by this method are from the standpoint of the sorted map equal

1783231
inherited	subclassing
the way we solved it with nunit was to have an inherited structure within the unit tests we would not have the testfixture attribute on the base interface test but have the test attribute on all of the test methods
the testcalculator class is the testfixture but inherits all of the tests from the base class which leaves the subclassing responsible solely for providing the object to test for that interface

1783772
prng	random
if you do not initialize the prng the default is to have it initialized with the value 1
of course initializing it with some other constant value will not give you different pseudo random numbers for different runs of the program

1784203
for-loop	arrays
then just do a for-loop on that arrays
name each date field as if it s being added to a php arrays not the ids using the syntax sort of an array_push shortcut classdate will automatically become an arrays in _post

1784687
imperative	declarative
declarative programming is when you say what you want and imperative language is when you say how to get what you want
a simple example in python the first example is declarative because we do not specify any implementation details of building the list

1784702
imperative	declarative
with imperative programming you tell the compiler what you want to happen step by step
for example let s start with this collection and choose the odd numbers with imperative programming we d step through this and decide what we want here we re saying create a result collection step through each number in the collection check the number if it s odd add it to the results with declarative programming on the other hand you write code that describes what you want but not necessarily how to get it declare your desired results but not the step-by-step here we re saying give us everything where it s odd not step through the collection

1784716
imperative	declarative
c# is a much more imperative programming language but certain c# features are more declarative like linq the same thing could be written imperatively example from wikipedia linq
imperative programming is telling the computer explicitly what to do and how to do it like specifying order and such c# declarative is when you tell the computer what to do but not really how to do it

1785614
alarmmanager	wakelock
i ve never programmed on android but i was kinda bored so i googled around and found this which seems to be very related you ll need to sign in to your google account in order to read it i had another look at the alarmmanager documentation and i noticed that it only talks about using alarms to broadcast events not start services. i changed things around to use a broadcastreceiver instead that acquires the lock in its onreceive and stored the lock reference as a static member of another class following the example of the alarmclock application that seems to have worked
i guess what was happening was that my service starting alarms were being fired but the device was sometimes going back to sleep before i could acquire the wakelock

1786428
hash	md5
note that a hash of this sort will never be unique though with the use off an effective one you stand a very good chance of never having a collision
if you are not concerned with security someone deliberately trying to break your hashing then simply using the md5 hash will give you an excellent hash with minimal effort

1786428
hash	md5
if you are not concerned with security someone deliberately trying to break your hashing then simply using the md5 hash will give you an excellent hash with minimal effort
it is likely that you could do an sha hash of 100kb in well less than 10 second though and though sha-1 is still theoretically flawed it is of higher strength than md5

1786537
disk	ram
of course you don t ever want to page any part of the warm cache to disk
windows itself can begin nagging you about being out of memory but this is not the same urgency and applications will continue to be able to request ram and it will continue being given albeit serviced from the page file

1787040
superclass	subclassing
the buttons are protected variables in the superclass
so you need to override the installcomponents methods in the subclassing and make sure that you do not add the buttons

1787135
integer	fractions
convert each of these components into an integer value
multiply that integer by a fractions such as 0.5 making sure the result is also integer. alternatively subtract a set amount from that integer being sure not to go below 0

1787965
int	chars
see each directive is composed of one of the following...an optional non-zero decimal int that specifies the maximum field width
s matches a sequence of bytes that are not white-space chars

1788748
unix	bsd
the machinations you have to go through to do this are just the api to access this functionality note that system v based unix systems have an alternate method of file descriptor passing based on streams which uses a different api
i do not know the history but i would guess that the complexity of the bsd file descriptor passing api is due to shoehorning the functionality into the preexisting sendmsg 2 recvmsg 2 api

1789460
free	malloc
as per phil nash s comment for every new there is a corresponding delete likewise for every malloc there is a corresponding free
if the corresponding delete free is not there you have a leak

1790956
post	get
you could think of other solutions like copying all post data and doing a get request to your second form or storing all data in a temporary table transmitting an id to your second form and load the corresponding data there but i guess this implies modifying your second form and is not really acceptable
what you would need it to be able to do an http redirection and include the post data in it but this is as far as i know impossible

1791254
valgrind	gprof
better use something like oprofile or valgrind
gprof doesn t work with threads at all

1791451
post	get
in your code right after the point where e-mails are sent do a 302 redirect to a confirmation page with this kind of code the post to the original page will not end up in the browser history
this common pattern is known as the post redirect get pattern

1793056
document.write	settimeout
note you must not document.write document.close into the iframe directly that causes ie to hang hard
but settimeout function document.close 0 seems immune as does a document.close inside a loaded script sometimes

1793210
int	double
no you cannot use double to store 64-bit int without losing precision
however you can apply a lua patch that adds support for true 64-bit int to the lua interpreter

1793293
post	get
i added this not in your post or in your book but should be super-easy to do if you ve already done 2 and 3
trying to give homework-friendly advice 1 make sure you know how to get a median

1793458
short	base
if you don t there are encoding detection heuristics but on short strings there are not reliable
of course you could have luck and the function outputs rely on various unknow encodings but using ascii as a code base therefor they would allocate the same value for the bytes from 0 to 127 like utf-8

1794527
put	get
this solution is not ideal i think a better approach would be to use an mvc approach and have a controller which accepts the value to put in the text area
sharing objects between threads can get very messy you may want to read about the actor model for a different approach

1794717
goto	break
the only thing you can do is stack cases in the following manner but that break or another jump statement like goto just needs to be there
c# doesn t support implicit fall through construct but the break or goto nonetheless has to be there msdn

1794902
put	get
seriously - if people think you re trying to hide something they ll go looking and the more effort you ve put into hiding it the harder they ll look
eventually you ll get to the point where you ll have a negative impact on your regular users who wouldn t even think about trying to reverse engineer your product

1795117
postgresql	mysql
some things i ve personally used or seen used in postgresql that don t really exist in mysql afaict
transactions and full-text search together i know it s popular to use an external fts since mysql doesn t have one

1795117
postgresql	mysql
in postgresql i just do it all in one transaction and there s no chance i ll end up with this transaction partially applied
in mysql it can do the data conversion step in a transaction sure but if it has to rollback the new column has still been added so you need to clean it up by hand or write a more complex transaction to deal with that and even then it s still not atomic in the db

1795312
srp	principles
like if your car had srp then there wouldn t be a class that adjusted the temperature and also put the windows up and down
that would violate the principles

1795502
ready	each
javascript execution hits kkk.png is downloaded and loads into #img the event is actually the event fired when all page components are loaded and ready
read more about it edit - this portion elaborates more on the parallel or not part by default and from my current understanding browser usually runs each page on 3 ways html parser javascript dom and css

1796397
for-loop	arrays
gcc is right this is not standard-compliant c++ code seeing as even a for-loop variable i is not redeclared sometimes
declare the arrays r separately as a static member of the class ps however i d mention that the design of the class is questionable

1796546
folder	directory
i suggest that keep all images in sub-directory images under application installed folder myapp images when you debug the project images will not copy into debug or release folder you have to copy paste them manually or as matt mentioned select an image file from solution explorer and in properties select copy to output directory as copy always or copy if newer
it will also keep the directory structure and then copy whole debug or release folder into the device

1796989
bash	subshell
the bash manual entry states this clearly each command in a pipeline is executed as a separate process in a subshell
the same construct executed with the korn shell ksh runs the while in the same process not in a subshell and hence gives the expected answer

1797103
int	boolean
i am not sure whether now i can revert from int column type to boolean though
i changed the type of the column from boolean to int and it started working

1797236
postgresql	mysql
it appears that mysql doesn t provide this functionality unlike postgresql according to the docs of regexbuddy mysql s support for regular expressions is rather limited but still very useful
mysql only has one operator that allows you to work with regular expressions

1797747
children	parent
the syntax of handling events are different actionscript 3 actionscript 2 actionscript 1 you might find this page helpful migrating from as2 to as3 as3 way of adding a new children is new followed by addchild it used to be createmovieclip and createtextfield methods earlier - not sure about exact version though
earlier if you had the name property of a child you could access the child from the parent using parent.childname even if the parent class didn t have a property called childname

1798021
rsa	aes
this way the data will only be readable by people who have the private rsa key as anyone else wouldn t be able to decrypt the symmetric aes key
.net s rsacryptoserviceprovider class can read public keys from xml using the fromxmlstring method in the following format edit as i understand your procedure you re using the rsa public key as an aes symmetric key

1799041
superclass	subclassing
the above though is broken because the superclass doesn t have a default constructor
also parameterised constructor of superclass is not inherited by subclassing

1799041
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
also parameterised constructor of superclass is not inherited by subclassing
in fact logically a subclassing never inherited the constructors or destructors of the superclass

1799202
floating-point	fractions	floating-point	integer
data can be lost when floating-point representations are converted to integral representations as the fractions components of the floating-point values will be truncated rounded down
conversely converting from an integral representation to a floating-point one can also lose precision since the floating-point type may be unable to represent the integer exactly for example float might be an ieee 754 single precision type which cannot represent the integer 16777217 exactly while a 32-bit integer type can

1799202
floating-point	integer
conversely converting from an integral representation to a floating-point one can also lose precision since the floating-point type may be unable to represent the integer exactly for example float might be an ieee 754 single precision type which cannot represent the integer 16777217 exactly while a 32-bit integer type can
this can lead to situations such as storing the same integer value into two variables of type integer and type real which return false if compared for equality

1799247
aggregate-functions	sum
you shouldn t group by some columns and then select other columns unless you use aggregate-functions
only p.partnumberp and sum remainderint make sense here

1799452
folder	directory
try open your project properties - java build path select libraries tab and click on add class folder button then select the parent directory of sprites
the getresource method searches your classpath to find the file likely the sprites directory is not in your classpath

1799830
std	ostream
use std count to count the number of elements which is equal to some value or std count_if to count the elements which satisfies some predicate if you just want to copy the contents of a container to an ostream object like std cout use std copy instead if you need the return value from each invocation of the function use std transform std transform is also overloaded so it works for binary functions as well as unary functions
std for_each isn t designed for that

1800446
wordpress	joomla
wordpress has been used as a cms for a while now and i think it s often a great place to start
i love wordpress but it s not the only cms out there you should look at drupal joomla movable type or one of many other open source or even commercial cms

1800446
wordpress	joomla
i love wordpress but it s not the only cms out there you should look at drupal joomla movable type or one of many other open source or even commercial cms
you may also want to look at other products in the automattic family such as wordpress mu buddypress and bbpress

1801162
factors	mean
sometimes the log factors are ignored entirely and you might see õ f n o with a tilde above it which means o f n polylog f n o f n log f n k for some k
abuse of notation or not polylog n does mean some polynomial in log n just as poly n can mean some polynomial in n

1801208
gtk	motif
kde chose qt as there was not much of a selection back then motif tcl tk to name a few the gimp was starting to be developed and at the time the window toolkits were not up to scratch for what the developers needed so they started to write the gimp tool kit gtk
after some time it was decided to re-write gtk and make it object orientated gtk+

1801708
client-side	server-side
dhtml is mostly used to describe client-side functionality and you use javascript for that
but if you mean dynamic web pages server-side functionality and you must use c you can use cgi common gateway interface rfc3875 however using c for web pages is not a good choice

1801943
innodb	myisam
basically the problem is that if the innodb engine fails to start for whatever reason usually configuration problems -- then mysql silently falls back to the myisam engine
even if your statement says then if innodb isn t active mysql will happily create a myisam table without even warning you

1801943
innodb	myisam
even if your statement says then if innodb isn t active mysql will happily create a myisam table without even warning you
even if you later discover and fix the innodb problem all tables created during the problem remain myisam

1801977
boost	allocator
with all that out of the way i do recommend that every c++ programmer is at least familiar with the fact that boost exists and some of the core libraries like the smart pointer library regular expressions etc
i would not expect anybody working for me to be an expert in all facets of boost but i do expect even fairly inexperienced c++ programmers to know where they can find it and that they will be better off using code from boost rather than trying to say write their own pooled memory allocator

1802269
filesystems	ntfs
but the case conversion table is stored on the filesystems itself for ntfs and it does change between versions for instance the vista case conversion table was brought to the unicode 5 level so vista ntfs and xp ntfs have different case conversion rules
and the thing that matters is the os that formatted the filesystems not the current os

expression-blend	silverlight
expression-blend is almost entirely written in c# wpf
there is also at least one text editor component under development not sure if it is already available from a commercial third party actipro which is supposedly going to be available in silverlight and wpf versions

1804468
integer	unsigned
i find myself slightly thinking that if by integer you mean signed 32-bit integer then pseudocode has a certain beautiful simplicity to it the last number is 3 19 so there aren t an absurd number of cases
even for an unsigned 64-bit integer there still be only 41 cases thanks alexandru for pointing out my brain-slip

1806259
put	get
so you could pattern match every single value providing a default if it is not of the correct type or temporarily put all the data into some structure that can be pattern matched
i guess your problem is you want to be able to patten match the map that you get from parsefull but map doesn t have an unapply

1806347
curses	readline
but in case that you re not here are some console irb-related gems i ve written that may be useful hirb - view framework for associating classes with views bond - custom readline completion made easy boson - console command framework now to answer your questions though i don t know how to do it there is this nice curses app whose source code you could read
require readline gives you those keybindings require highline

1806648
post	put	post	get
form_questions_answers modify_rule 60 would not accept post on a map.resources basis
it would either be a get or a put in line with rest

1807127
agile	sprint
agile selfmanagement. that said here s what we did in my previous team part of a 300+ developer effort that was relatively new to agile and scum we had two boards - one with index cards for forthcoming stories so we could tell what was coming up and one with the current sprint s work
our columns on the current sprint board were simply not started under development dev done in qa complete done done and a box in the corner for blocked

1807250
recvfrom	datagram
peter hosey is correct in stating that the given result of recvfrom means that there is no data to be read
if you are sending several udp datagram at a time from some host to your iphone some of those datagram may be discarded because the receive buffer size on the iphone is not large enough to accommodate that much data at once

1807677
versioning	upgrade
if the table field value doesn t exist then we know it s versioning 0 where we forgot to add that bit in
during development as and when we need to upgrade the database we write a ddl script to do the work and once happy that it s working ok it gets added as a text resource to the app

implements	extends
b we have written a class which implements drag gesture listener
public class filedraggesturelistener extends dragsourceadapter implements draggesturelistener public void draggesturerecognized draggestureevent dge class textfiletransferable implements transferable so this is how we can able to download the file up to temp then we can not move that file to a location where is has been dropped

public class filedraggesturelistener extends dragsourceadapter implements draggesturelistener public void draggesturerecognized draggestureevent dge class textfiletransferable implements transferable so this is how we can able to download the file up to temp then we can not move that file to a location where is has been dropped
please suggest where i am wrong or what best approach to implement this drag and drop

1808196
post	get
you shouldn t have any trouble with caching since post are not supposed to be cached
also try passing all params on the query string as a get

1808236
post	get
if you don t want that you can use get instead of post for your form method
ie you should use something like this instead of this way the parameters used in the form will be sent in the url and not by post and users will be able to use back with no problem independantly of the browser s cache bookmark the result page which is nice and i should add that in theory post has to be used when you want to create modify data and get has to be used when you want to.

well get data

1808748
hash	md5
you re using md5 hash but if you look at the linked articles you will see that md5 alone is not enough and one can easily pick most of your passwords back if they have your database
for a quick test just throw an md5 hash into google and you will see that unless your password is really wicked you will get it back

1810158
put	get
well simply put c doesn t do things that way
an array of type t is passed around as a pointer to the first t in the array and that s all you get

1810235
serializable	deserialization
i also try to abstract the versioning handling directly in my serializable framework + a few other things because dry should be adhered to on error-handling to ease error-detection i usually use a pair of markers special bytes to separate one object from another
it allows me to immediately throw during deserialization because i can detect a problem of desynchronization of the stream ie somewhat ate too much bytes or did not ate sufficiently

1810781
ready	each
column names not started just started half-way almost done ready for showcase passed qa the first row is specially reserved for bug fixing - like a fixed priority for clearing bugs
the simpsons characters represent each member of the team

1810844
erlang	lisp
those that do not understand erlang are doomed to re-implement it badly
okay the original was about lisp but.

1810856
super	self
if self.clean_ship_to_billing return self.clean_billing_street return super orderform self .clean_shipping_street if you weren t as lazy as i was when i wrote the code you might want to avoid so many duplicate validations of the boolean field
this should be faster provided the default field isn t run unless it s needed - not sure on that myself def clean_shipping_street self print validating

1811167
fast-forward	merge
already up-to-date fast-forward those aren t merge strategies i guess the first one is when there s nothing to merge obviously supported
the second isn t a merge updating in hg is equivalent to fast-forward there s nothing to merge

1811167
fast-forward	merge

octopus doesn t apply to mercurial merge are always between two heads

1811452
config	ini
it simply declares the config from an ini file within an array
the exit function exists so the config file cannot be read directly from a browser with a leading

1811720
free	strdup
if you do use strdup be sure to free the result later
if you set all your .name s to string constants then no strdup is not strictly needed

1812362
int	chars
note this holds true even if the int was 32 bit - check amnon s answer
it is implementation dependent and results might vary on a different platform compiler but it seems this is what is happening 515 in binary is 1000000011 padding zeros to make it two bytes assuming 16 bit int 0000001000000011 the two bytes are 00000010 and 00000011 which is 2 and 3 hope someone explains why they are reversed - my guess is that chars are not reversed but the int is little endian

1812724
inline	inlining
keep in mind that the compiler is written by people way smarter then most mere mortals including myself and has access to more information when deciding to inline or not so when it doesn t inline it probably has a good reason
if you want to force inlining then use include files

1813464
int	chars
the language spec states 14.1 an enum declaration may explicitly declare an underlying type of byte sbyte short ushort int uint long or ulong
note that chars cannot be used as an underlying type

1813757
perforce	svn	perforce	cvs
i don t know but you may want to check with perforce on this as this might be something specific to their plugin rather than something in the team su8pport i never have this problem with svn or cvs though maybe my builds are not big enough
also from what i understand the first generation perforce plugin had major problems but they have a new one that s much better

1814522
np-hard	subset-sum
probably not without the simplifying assumption your problem is np-hard
here s a trivial reduction to subset-sum

1814583
post	get
if you cannot change your post requests you are going to need to post each request including sorting which will require javascript attached to your sort links
the benefit to using get is that your users can bookmark specific searches since all the data would be contained in the query string

1814693
octal	hex
this still doesn t explain the why octal question but it does answer the why one
002 means 02 interpreted as an octal base 8 number similar to how x02 would be the same for a hex base 16 number

1814697
jar	manifest.mf
it doesn t contain com.gorkwobble.logmanager.logmanager this is what the error is saying check the content of the jar
a slightly different error when i double-click the jar-with-dependencies.jar failed to load main-class manifest attribute from c eclipseprojects logmanager target logmanager-0.1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar again if you configured the assembly plugin as suggested you have something like this with this setup logmanager-0.1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar contains the classes from the current module and its dependencies but according to the error its meta-inf manifest.mf doesn t contain a main-class entry its likely not the same manifest.mf as in logmanager-0.1.0.jar

1814990
floating-point	integer
floating-point numbers are not precise for numbers which can t be represented using a certain number of binary digits
it might be possible that at some point math.log is returning something that s barely less than or greater depending on the direction of your off-by-1 result an integer boundary and thus int is truncating it to the wrong value

1815047
udp	tcp
udp is completely stateless so after firing off a packet the only way an application can expect a response is if it knows the other end is going to send one
depending on the udp application i d expect that the response would come on the same port for simplicity -- this is not the case for protocols like tcp which have an intentionally random and high source port

1815326
folder	directory
i don t see why you shouldn t just delete the folder representing the gems for which don t don t need documentation you can always regenerate it
gem documentation is installed in ruby lib ruby gems doc where ruby is the directory into which you installed ruby c ruby on my machine

1815372
vim	emacs
i would advise that checking out both is worth the time because of various reasons already covered by other answers or emacs vs vim vs xy threads
still if you would have to pick one of them i d go with vim because of one thing availability vi m has the advantage that it is installed not only available by default on almost any nix system

1815559
post	get
as someone else mentioned here s a good blog post explaining how to do comet with asp.net
if you are not expecting many clients then opening connections from the client to the server can be a viable solution take a look at these msdn pages for information and a basic example - tcplistener - tcpclient if you re expecting many clients more than 50 depending on your server hardware then your options depend on the answers to the other questions if your clients get data frequently and short seconds delays are acceptable then polling is an easy solution you can hide the implementation from the client so it appears that the data is being pushed but in reality there s a thread in the client that is polling every few seconds

1815879
next	except
andrei alexandrescu is releasing a book titled the d programming language next march and right now there is a push to stabilize the spec for version 2 of the language in time for the book
while d is not a formal superset of c it is what i d call an idiomatic superset except for the lack of a preprocessor

1816137
pow	math.h
i couldn t even get the program to compile without when using math functions like this you should always include math.h and make sure you are calling the right pow function
who knows what the other pow function might be .

1816165
visualvm	hprof
however you may be able to skip the hprof dump to get just basic information from the running vm by using jmap jstack and visualvm included in the jdk package. typical memory leaks for example should be visible from the jmap heap histogram already as you might be able to guess the places that produce or retain objects just by looking at the number of instances of a particular class
hprof files have a format that doesn t really work well without loading it fully and then applying some cross-referencing afterwards

1816201
pop-up	dialog
the main factor for deciding what pop-up window will be blocked is the good pop-up window must be show after user do some action like click or do some other event like press enter
however you can use in-page pop-up window like jquery ui dialog that all pop-up blocker cannot block it because it just is html tag like span or div

1816201
pop-up	dialog
however you can use in-page pop-up window like jquery ui dialog that all pop-up blocker cannot block it because it just is html tag like span or div
therefore it does not clever enough for understanding content inside pop-up tag

1817256
junit	jsfunit	jsfunit	cactus
this is not what exactly what you are asking for but jsfunit which uses junit cactus htmlunit and httpunit seems to be a serious candidate for testing in the jsf land
maybe have a look at the jsfunit wiki and its getting started guide

1817701
nsmutablestring	nsstring
this is because an nsmutablestring is a subclass of nsstring so it is a nsstring. you can however create a mutable string from an nsstring with
you can set an nsmutablestring to an nsstring but not the other way around is okay but is not

1818090
post	get
curl is great for working with apis especially when you need to post data
i ve heard that it s quicker to use file_get_contents for basic get requests grabbing an rss feed that doesn t require authentication but i haven t tried myself

1818196
pop-up	dialog
you could also create a dialog as a page and then use a pop-up window to display it as a real native os modal dialog but this is perhaps more annoying. unfortunately javascript s browser built in dialog are pretty limited
if you truly cannot rephrase the question as ok cancel then you will need to create your own dialog in a div or something and pop it up to the user

1818755
range	minimum
note that estimates aren t single-point values they re a range with numbers with a percentage of confidence
for instance a proper estimate wouldn t be 2 weeks it would be 50 confidence of 2 weeks 80 confidence of 4 weeks. if i were the person assigned with the unenviable task of providing an estimate to completion for a project being managed as arbitrarily as in the original post i d try to figure out a range based upon the minimum number of folks assigned 48 to 66 weeks given 2 developers 50 to 80 confident and a range associated with the average number of folks assigned 25 to 45 weeks with 5 developers 50 to 80 confident and use the low figure from the average number along with the high figure from the minimum number 25 to 66 weeks given anywhere from 2 to 5 developers 50 to 80 confident and even then i d put a disclaimer on it plus 10 for the lost time due to context switching

1818779
onmousedown	onmousemove
i presume that the following event happens by user interaction user moves mouse over the image - onmousemove - displays move on the label user clicks on image left button click - onmousedown - diaplsya left click on the label user moves mouse out of the image - onmousemove - displays move on the label the onmousemove will fire even user moves the mouse just a pixel on the image
so the solution for your problem would be have a global flag set it in the event handler of onmousedown check that flag in event handler of onmousemove if it is not set then display move on the label and if it is set then do not do anything have an event hanlder of onmouseout reset the flag in this event handler so again whenever onmousemove fires it will check the flag and since it has not been set by click event onmousemove will display move on the label

1819084
stateless	stateful
the web application is by nature stateless so even if your users should log-in it does not make the application stateful
couple the things which are stateful in asp.net are session state cache which can be configured appropriately in a webfarm

1819102
packets	multicast
then you can verify if the packets are actually broadcast or not over the air
broadcast data will be transmitted as unicast data from a station to an access point and the access point will then retransmit the data as broadcast multicast traffic so it will use twice the on-air bandwidth compared to when the sender sits on the wired side of the ap

1819102
packets	multicast
also iirc broadcast multicast traffic does not use the rts cts procedure for reserving the media which exarbates the dropped packets problem
it could actually be the case that multiple unicast streams work better than a single multicast stream under less-than-ideal radio conditions given that the aggregated bandwidth is high enough

1819248
int	double
now do that for long s shorts and any other int value you re curious about
nb this approach will not work for floating point numbers double or float

1819925
post	get
you can t post from a get request
if the calling application is simply executing a url this is a get request. if the payment site does not support posting back to you then you can t do it

1819932
post	put
also keep in mind that csrf will protect your post put delete without a token so you ll need to disable it for this method and hopefully you have some other way of authenticating that request
if the external service isn t calling your url with a post then it is an issue with that service not your application

1820354
put	get
i usually just put the format.html first
that way when ie sends a weird accepts header like it doesn t get fouled up

1820480
google-chrome	firefox
it currently works in ie versions 6 and up as well as safari and google-chrome
it s not supported by firefox so this isn t really a useful answer yet but it s worth keeping in mind that the real best way will eventually be to let css handle this

1820817
put	get
the most obvious thing to do here is to put the expanders in a container other than a listview the container resizes around content just fine
if you absolutely must have it in a listview which is possible then i don t know of a way to get a listview to resize easily once it s grown beyond setting explicit sizes of the whole thing which is clumsy and not useful

1821881
memcached	apc
zend cache supports different backend storage devices including memcached file storage apc etc
each one has its own implementation - as you can see in the zend library - and apparently the memcached implementation doesn t support automatic cleaning

1822061
folder	directory
as well as the dbfactories code to use the dll s in my bin folder and not the servers gac
secondly i had to create individual msl ssdl csdl i did this by creating a windows form application and change the manifest to copy to output directory

1822235
versioning	upgrade
7.4 is going to be removed from supported versioning pretty soon so i wouldn t wait for it to happen with 7.4 in production
the best approach to your problem is to upgrade pg to something less archaic seriously

1822738
win64	windows
handles there s no reason to use the high 32 bits of a on win64
windows handles are indexes not pointers at least as far as i can tell so unless ms wanted to allow more than 2 32 windows file mutex etc

1822956
nhibernate	llblgenpro
and that s not nhibernate s fault
llblgenpro i have no idea what the linq support is like now but before linq was supported it was a pita to write queries

1823693
unification	inference
another simple form of unification is when you use a regular expression for matching for example at a command prompt you might say which will match some but not all file names
artificial intelligence likes to make use of inference engines to try to simulate reasoning from a corpus of knowledge usually in the form of statements in a logic

1823704
maven	pom.xml
time to start using maven
i don t know what documentation you are referring to as you didn t post any link so i didn t check what it is saying but i think that you you are missing the jpa-api dependency that i can see in the pom.xml of hibernate-parent-3.5.0-beta-2 it provides javax.persistence.spi.providerutil you can get it from the jboss maven repository it doesn t seem to be included in the bundle released on sourceforge

1824102
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
javascript does not allow you to use a string to simulate a variable name so create an arrays and in the for-loop loops it
i think you should just put all the urls in an arrays and loops thru it by index

1824795
post	get
note that the last post is actually from john lam looks like march 2009 where he seems comfortable asserting that rubyclr is still functional.
i can think of a few possibilities write or get someone to write a com wrapper for your dll if it doesn t already have one then use ruby s win32ole library to call it

1824887
for-loop	arrays
also junmats s comment is correct you are only running the query outside the for-loop which doesn t make sense
to access arrays variable element values used inside a double-quote string need braces delimiters another way to code this is by concatenation in which case you don t need the extra delimiters don t forget if the input data is unpredictable you need to filter out characters that can break your sequel or compromise security principles

1826306
firefox-addon	greasemonkey
you might have a look at the clear cache button - firefox-addon
download not install the extension extract it with 7zip winrar winzip winace ... and have a look at the code executed onclick. the same should work as greasemonkey script

1827046
uninstall	upgrade
the rub is that the cpan toolchain doesn t care and will happily install new files over old ones without giving you a way to uninstall your damage
if i m working on a big project where i m going to upgrade modules i like to put the new modules in their own new directory

1827221
profiling	debugging	ssl	https
bear in mind to do that on a separate meaning not for other browsing activities firefox profiling in order to intercept https zap will install a new ssl certificate
wireshark won t help you if you have to debugging https requests unless you can get the encryption keys for both endpoints - see the wireshark site for details

1827266
innodb	myisam
you must switch to innodb
if you are reverse-engineering a myisam database you won t get foreign keys since they aren t supported by the engine

1828951
listview	gridview
i replaced with my listview with an items control
so i am not using the gridview of the list view anymore

1829735
terminate	timeout
if an oracle net connection is not established in the time specified the connect attempt is terminate
the client receives an ora-12170 tns connect timeout occurred error

1830280
getter	setter
is directly equal to the great part about having the simplified getter setter is that when you want to fill in the implementation with a little bit more guts later you do not break abi compatibility
don t worry about getter setter slowing down your code through indirection

1830399
awt	swing
your code is a bit messy there will be more syntax errors if compiled. you should not mix swing awt components for instance instead of using label use jlabel in swing for panel use jpanel
take note of the j prefix for swing you should be reading books perhaps if you want to know more on swing or even read some basic tutorials

1830722
kerberos	ntlm
the error you re seeing is an sspi error specifically and kerberos ntlm error and you should approach it using the kerberos ntlm tools and methodologies
most if not all kerberos ntlm issues can be troubleshoot using the troubleshooting kerberos errors document

1830742
post	get
that s why your code is hanging the bufferedreader is trying to read more bytes than are available on the socket since the post data doesn t have an end of line and it is waiting for more bytes which will never be available
the process to simply parse a post request is to use the inputstream directly for each line in the header read a byte at a time until you get a r and then a n look for a line that starts with content-length extract the number at the end of that line

1830868
pecl	pear
in my case i ve installed the extension with pecl install geoip and i ve downloaded the geolitecity database and copied it to usr share geoip geoipcity.dat so it s found by the pecl extension
note there should also be some pear package pear net_geoip to help you if you cannot install any pecl extension

1831229
folder	directory
a sparse checkout is basically checking out only the folder structure without populating the content files
so you checkout only the directory structures and need not checkout all the files as was the concern. reference step 1 proceed to repository browser step 2 right click the parent folder within the repository containing all the files that you wish to work on and select checkout

1831229
folder	directory
so you checkout only the directory structures and need not checkout all the files as was the concern. reference step 1 proceed to repository browser step 2 right click the parent folder within the repository containing all the files that you wish to work on and select checkout

1831822
folder	directory
you now specify that your applicationcontext.xml is located in your root folder of your system where it probably isn t since you say it is at etc ws
i see two possible solutions use move your applicationcontext.xml file into your project for example in your web-inf folder and use in case 2 you have to make sure that the directory in which you place your applicationcontext.xml is located in your classpath

1831844
post	get
if we sum up we need 150-56-4-3.6-2 85bits for storing chess position if there were no takings and probably not much more if there are takings and promotions taken in account but i will write about that later if somebody will find this long post usefull
at each position get the number of all possible moves

1832437
jruby	mri
netbeans bundles jruby which is based and powered by java virtual machine jvm
sqlite3 ruby bindings are not compatible with jvm these needs the original and native ruby implementation also known as mri matz ruby implementation or c ruby

1832563
folder	directory
however it is better to change gid of the folder it is best you look into a fresh created repository to match the permissions
note that usually the setgid is set on subversions repository directory and their child directory drwxr-sr-x svnowner svnusers 4096 2008-11-01 . by chmod 775 you unset this setgid bit and thats why the problems occurred the setgid means if you create a file the group will be set to svnusers in my example not your primary group

1832644
put	get
a normal c c++ compiler will not put every variable on the stack anyway
the problem with your foo function could be that the variable could get passed via the stack to the function the abi of your system hardware os defines that

1832758
firefox	safari
it s for sure a certificate issue - it will work with https firefox and an official certificate
i use swfupload in combination with https on the site invoiceplatform.com and it works with ie safari firefox and chrome did not test other browsers

1833763
udp	tcp
you can use this call to create socket public socket inetaddress address int port inetaddress localaddr int localport throws ioexception this is normally done for udp and this is not advised for tcp connections
if you do this for tcp on both ends you can only have one tcp connection

1834397
boost	stl
also boost iterator_facade may be useful here.
to prevent exposing set iterator to not promise to users more than needed you can create a wrapper thus you will get rid of internal iterator because it s quite restrictive to be able to have only one iterator and will get ability to use algorithms from stl on particle s iterators

1834791
cpython	ironpython
for the cpython implementation of python yes it is guaranteed to be closed when its reference count goes to zero
for python as an abstract language including jython ironpython etc no it is not guaranteed to be closed

1835223
hash	md5
typically you d just use md5 or similar to create a hash
this isn t guaranteed to be unique though so i d recommend you use the hash as a starting point

1835294
submit	submission
plain javascript approaches form is still submitted even though listener function returns false jquery approaches how to not submit a form if validation is false
an onsubmit handler function needs to return false to cancel the event form submission if you want to not submit and show a validation error message instead

1835645
octal	hex
using octal for 8-bit bytes requires 3 octal digits of which the first can only have the values 0 1 2 and 3 the first digit is really tetral not octal . there is no reason to go to base32 unless somebody develops a system in which bytes are ten bits long so a ten-bit byte could be represented as two 5-bit nybbles
the zero prefix for octal and 0x for hex are from the early days of unix

1836274
cpython	ironpython
python s best feature is the batteries included standard library and even though this is not distributed with ironpython much of it will work if you just point ironpython to the installed library folder from cpython
in fact most pure python libraries no compiled c or c++ modules will work fine with ironpython

1836433
many-to-one	one-to-many
if you do not have the poolid property mapped in the poolitem class and you just have the many-to-one object mapping named pool then replace in the detached criteria the pitem.poolid with pitem.pool.id
try this assuming the poolitem table has a poolid column as a foreign key of the pool table. the relationship is a one-to-many

1836504
post	get
i m now running a http proxy servlet one of the ones from this post that catches any of my server-bound requests and forwards them to the right port
since it s a servlet it s easily distributable through our source control system launches automatically when debugging and doesn t get thrown in with the resulting javascript when compiling

1837111
for-loop	arrays
edit if you have an arrays of objects and you wanted to do it in a way other than a for-loop with tests you could do this
use implode to clarify if there is only one object in the arrays the separator will not be used at all and a string containing the single item would be returned

1837943
nunit	moq
nunit also has a nunit.mock but it is not well-known
the syntax for moq can be found here also note that you can only mock interface so if your object from system.io.file doesn t have an interface then probably you can t do

1838351
mouse	keyboard
update just re-read the question i dont think what you want is the ability to record keyboard mouse actions as its not guarenteed that the application will keep up with the mouse clicks windows could open in slightly different places or there could be a slight delay etc... what you want is some screen capture software
there are literally hundreds of keyboard mouse automation apps out there i recommend do it again - its free easy to use and works well although if i remember correctly it has a quirk where it doesn t work particularly well over a remote desktop connection

1838400
gridbaglayout	miglayout
once you get the hang of gridbaglayout it s not that bad to write initially but it s still not pretty to work with or to debug later on
i tried miglayout for something recently and was disappointed to find that the miglayout actually ended up being more complicated to use than the gridbaglayout in that particular case

1839232
terminate	timeout
thread.__stop doesn t terminate thread but rather set internal flag so that it s considered already stopped
i think the best way in your case is to set socket timeout instead of spawning thread also you can set global default timeout with socket.setdefaulttimeout function

1839468
int	double
small int can all be represented exactly and division by a power of 2 transforms a number that can be represented into another that can be represented as long as you do not enter the realm of denormalized numbers
this answer to complement the existing ones note that 0.7 is not representable exactly either as a float or as a double

1839774
superclass	subclassing
there are plenty of instances object and string for example where the superclass has a no-arg constructor and a subclassing does not
because subclassing of bar might not have an no-arg constructor

1840855
hex	binary	octal	binary	octal	hex
hex is actually a bit too much already but octal has the problem that it doesn t evenly fit in a byte
this is part of why ada uses the form 16# to introduce hex constants 8# for octal 2# for binary etc

1840999
postgresql	mysql
also starting with version 8.3 of postgresql it is pretty much on-par performance wise with mysql it isn t like the older 7.x versions which were s-l-o-w
the biggest reason why i recommend postgresql to people who have more oracle mssql experience as opposed to mysql is that the sql syntaxes and general feel of the database engine match pretty closely

1841447
serializable	deserialization
if you only need serializable and not deserialization you could probably just do ast.tostringtree the above will give you a lisp like tree structure
an easy way to do serializable would be to use that in combination with a custom ast node class with an overridden tostring

1841636
ubuntu	linux
there are some very good recommendations here already but let me suggest that you develop your applet not so much for ubuntu as for gnome
it doesn t take much extra effort to also make rpm packages for distributions such as fedora and arch linux packages to name two examples

1842322
lan	localhost
either way the requests look like they are proxy requests and 8000 is a common port to run a proxy on so some process on your machine or some external lan or internet based service has discovered it and is trying to abuse it
if so it should only be bound to localhost 127.0.0.1 which shouldn t be accessible from anywhere except your machine

1842383
factors	mean
it s of course easier to make the code work in ie6 if you don t have to think about valid code at the same time but that s just because there are more factors to consider not because the factors are incompatible per se
it s a bit of work to make the code work in ie6 and there is a bit of work to make the code validate but that doesn t mean that it s the same kind of work or that one of them will make the other impossible

1842682
hash	whirlpool
it contains files without extension inside directories with a dot in their name filename which already has a hash in it test on idempotency filename with two extensions newlines in names tree a a |-- b | -- c.d | |-- f | |-- f.ext1.ext2 | -- g.d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e |-- c.ext mnewline | -- f -- f jnewline.ext1 7 directories 5 files result tree a a |-- b | -- c.d | |-- f.0bee89b07a248e27c83fc3d5951213c1 | |-- f.ext1.614dd0e977becb4c6f7fa99e64549b12.ext2 | -- g.d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e |-- c.ext mnewline | -- f.0bee89b07a248e27c83fc3d5951213c1 -- f jnewline.b6fe8bb902ca1b80aaa632b776d77f83.ext1 7 directories 5 files the solution works correctly for all cases
whirlpool hash is not in python s stdlib but there are both pure python and c extensions that support it python-mhash

1842796
post	put
i would go with the jasper trimspaces directive and if you have whitespace that is significant in your layout you can strategically insert whitespace like this or like this other options for trimming whitespace that haven t been mentioned in your post are write a servlet filter that trims whitespace as a post render step this will have to be clever enough to not trim your significant whitespace
put all your jsp tags on one line just kidding don t do this

1842806
fgets	feof
check the result of your input call whether you use fgets or fscanf to see if it succeeded then check feof if you got an error condition
fgets reads entire strings not individual characters so you don t want to pass the address of each individual character in your string

1843149
children	parent
if so then assuming a zero-indexed list the children of a node at index i are found at indices 2i + 1 and 2i + 2
as a result a parent node is not necessarily stored right next to its child nodes

1843585
inherited	properties
if you make a class that inherited inotifypropertychange that handles dictionary add and remove items when you change the key or that only change the value when you are changing the value perhaps it works
if you look at the keyvaluepair implementation it is a struct with both key and value as readonly properties so my guess is that it s not possible to make a twoway binding in this case

1843653
put	get
while this may be the coolest example of template meta programming around it has a couple of problems that lead me to recommend against trying to put it to serious use
compile times with it can get excruciating -- 10 minutes is common and a larger more complex grammar can take even longer assuming it doesn t crash the compiler

a shouldn t know about it s super-superclass unless explicitly exposed in some way by its superclass
this is actually desirable because you don t need to know how c is implemented when you subclassing b

1844577
hash	md5
say you have a list of emails maybe you d concatenate all their ids and read unread statuses and take an md5 hash using that as your fragment identifier
this kind of redirect hash only doesn t try to fetch anything from the server but it does insert a slot in the browser s history list

1844993
rss	feed
while encoding the data isn t really that hard using a library to generate a good compatible rss or atom feed is probably a good solution and after all is what you ve asked for
zend_feed provides feed creation in addition to feed reading

int	chars
i m not sure whether it s a good idea to use int at all
some numbers might contain special chars # as part of the extension for example which you should be able to handle too

1846875
set	bag
difference is semantic a set should be used when your collection is unordered and can contain each item only once a bag is still unordered however - it can contain some items many times well - at least with many-to-many mappings a list is a collection that is ordered and can contains some items many times - you have a guarantee that items will be retrieved in the same order as they were saved nhibernate will manage specified index column for you however both bag and list can be represented with ilist in code - that s perfectly ok but you have to remember that you cannot rely on order of items in a bag
when choosing how to map your list choose the option that best matches your collection - if you don t need order choose bag if you need order - choose list

html 4.0 and xhtml 1.0 only support get and post requests via so it is commonplace to tunnel a put delete via a hidden form field which is read by the server and dispathced appropriately

1848762
int	double
go on ask me what the largest int is such that it and all smaller int can be stored in ieee 64-bit double without losing precision
an ieee 64-bit double has 52 bits of mantissa so i think it s 2 53 2 53 + 1 cannot be stored because the 1 at the start and the 1 at the end have too many zeros in between

1849457
queue	fifo
in that kind of situation a solution if often to not do that kind of heavy work within the apache processes but either run an external php process using something like shell_exec for instance -- this is if you must work in synchronous mode ie if you cannot execute the task a couple of minutes later push the task to a fifo system and immediatly return a message to the user saying your task will be processed soon and have some other process launched via a crontab every minute for instance check that fifo queue and do the processing it there is something in the queue that process itself can run in low priority mode
as often as possible especially if the heavy calculations take some time i would go for the second solution it allows users to get some feedback immediatly the server has received your request and will process it soon it doesn t keep apaches s processes working for long the heavy stuff is done by other processes if one day you need such an amount of processing power that one server is not enough anymore this kind of system will be easier to scale just add a second server that ll pick from the same fifo queue if your server is really too loaded you can stop processing from the queue at least for some time so the load can get better -- for instance this can be usefull if your critical web-services are used a lot in a specific time-frame

1850400
width	margin
take a look at pekka for an alternative though if the row of thumbnails don t fill the whole row they would be centered by themselves on the last row you would need to have a fixed width on the parent object .container with margin-left auto and margin-right auto which you cannot do since it is a fluid width page
here is how i would go about doing it though it is sure to have some bugs you will need to work around bind a javascript event to the window.resize event get the new document width and see how many thumbnails would fit on one row set the width of the div.container to be that width plus the little bit of margin on the right

mvp	presenter
mvp places majority of meaningful functionality inside classes called presenter
presenter do not rely upon gwt implementation classes but instead depend on gwt interfaces mostly

1851599
int	chars
the value eof is a negative int usually -1 so clearly you can t store it in an unsigned chars or in a plain chars that is unsigned
assuming that your system uses 8-bit chars which nearly all do eof will be converted to decimal 255 and your program will not work

1851967
int	chars
note that the return value of std cin.peek is actually of type which is the same as which is an int and not a chars
more important than that the value returned in that int is not necessarily a simple cast from chars to int but is the result of calling on the next chars in the stream or which is defined to be eof if there is no chars

1851967
int	chars
more important than that the value returned in that int is not necessarily a simple cast from chars to int but is the result of calling on the next chars in the stream or which is defined to be eof if there is no chars
typically this is all implemented in exactly the same way as fgetc casts the chars to an unsigned chars and then to an int for its return value so that you can distinguish all valid chars values from eof

1851967
int	chars
if you perform a comparison like this where ch is an int as above you may not get the correct results
you need to use on ch or on the chars constant to get a consistent result

1852348
put	get
if the values i used aren t suitable either put in some values which are or else compile that test but don t run it
if you don t have unit tests either get some or else add the following to the class instead of inheriting from the base class you don t usually need to make constructors part of an interface defined by an abstract base class

wxpython has support for playing wav files on windows and unix - i am not sure if this includes macs

1852692
int	double
with an array of double this might not be easy since equality comparisons on double are pretty problematic. if you can get away with using int you can do something like the following this will have o n performance so it should be pretty optimal in asymptotic performance behaviour
if your double are not the results of calculations but come from an other source that is if you can be sure that values which are basically the same will be represented equally you might get away with using the same method for double however i would still recommend being careful that this is really the case

1852715
interbase	firebird
it is known that the firebird team changed the sqlda structure for blobs in 2.1 and hence the interbase driver cannot be used anymore
you have some options here recommended imho upgrade to delphi 2010 - besides of a dbx firebird driver you will get much more things to play with see here for more buy a 3rd party driver for firebird which works in delphi 2009 downgrade your firebird use it as a last resort of course change your connectivity library

1852804
feof	fread
i think that for this format the most direct way that you can use is to use fscanf in a loop being sure to check the return value and on failure ferror and or feof to check whether you hit the end of file or some other error
you can t use fread as that doesn t parse the form of file that you have

1853586
turing	decidable
wikipedia defines them as follows a set of natural numbers is said to be a computable set also called a decidable recursive or turing computable set if there is a turing machine that given a number n halts with output 1 if n is in the set and halts with output 0 if n is not in the set
a function f from the natural numbers to themselves is a recursive or turing computable function if there is a turing machine that on input n halts and returns output f n

1855241
int	chars
note that operands narrower than int are widened either to int or unsigned int during expression evaluation anyway
well the first issue is that it s not defined by the c standard whether plain chars is signed or unsigned - so the only range you can portably rely on is 0 to 127

1855254
int	chars
this is why c defines types and operations as it does - the size of int is not mandated by the standard allowing compiler authors to make it correspond to a machine word and expression evaluation is defined to promote smaller int types to int greatly reducing the number of points at which results must be coerced to some target type
valid reasons to use chars for storing int values are when the space really matters that much not as often as you might think and when describing some external data format protocol that you are marshalling data to from

1855994
cpu	processors
in architectures which do not natively support unaligned access for example the 68000 and 68010 the 68020 adds unaligned access it s truly a performance and or maintenance problem since the cpu will fault or maybe trap to a handler to perform unaligned access
the ideal alignment for various processors can be estimated 4-byte alignment is appropriate for architectures with a 32-bit data path

switching	screens
this is as opposed to what it sounds like you were asking for which was new frames which imo doesn t really help if you have limited screens real estate because you re now having to switching frames graphical windows
one option is to tell emacs to never split windows which can be done like so setq same-window-regexps . this will keep your window from splitting and then you use your regular commands to switching buffers to get back to what you were looking at

1857064
post	put	put	get
i think this is probably the method we are stuck with until something in html spec changes and the browsers with it however get post put and delete are supported in ajax by the major browsers so there should be no need for a hidden input if you aren t relying on the html form
in order to simulate the put delete etc

1857342
np-hard	np-complete

1857927
goto	break
the prosaic side is that an upward pointing goto can implement a perfectly reasonable loop and a downward-pointing goto can do a perfectly reasonable break or return
of course an actual while break or return would be a lot more readable as the poor human wouldn t have to simulate the effect of the goto in order to get the big picture

1857927
goto	break
the evil side involves a routine not using goto for while break or return but using it for what s called spaghetti logic
in this case the goto-happy developer is constructing pieces of code out of a maze of goto s and the only way to understand it is to simulate it mentally as a whole a terribly tiring task when there are many goto s

1858532
jar	war	jar	manifest.mf
double check that the war you deploy on tomcat has the following structure my-webapp |-- meta-inf | -- manifest.mf |-- web-inf | |-- classes | | |-- x | | | -- y | | | -- z.class | | -- another | | -- packagename | | -- anotherclass.class | |-- lib | | |-- ajar.jar | | |-- bjar.jar | | -- zjar.jar | -- web.xml |-- a.jsp |-- b.jsp -- index.jsp or that the jar that bundles x.y.z.class is present under web-inf lib
well you are not really providing enough details on your webapp but my guess is that you have a jsp with something like that and x.y.z can t be found on the classpath is not present under web-inf classes nor in a jar of web-inf lib

1861688
skip-lists	tree
the following types describe implementation linked list double linked list skip-lists array dynamic array hash table binary tree managed binary tree heaps leveled tree etc. tree where insertion and deletion is not done directly but through a procedure that guarantees certain constraints for the tree graph although very fancy the following describe purpose stack means filo can be implemented by a linked list but also with an array or vector queue means fifo can be implemented by a double linked list or maybe in other sensible ways dequeue ... priority queue means highest lowest key first out this is an abstract concept that can be implemented in many different ways map associative array dictionary means you map keys to values
often requires an extra function to convert keys into valid keys for the underlying hash table or tree set means it s a collection that is iterable and can tell whether a value is an element of the set or not

1861790
inline	inlining
you should simply mark functions as inline when 1 it is convenient for you and 2 you want to ensure that the compiler has the option of applying the inlining optimization
but you re not forcing the compiler to inline anything

1861856
inline	inlining
as others stated inline in c++ doesn t mean that compiler will inline function. and the other way around lack of inline will not stop strongly optimizing compiler and linker from inlining some function when they think it ll speed-up the program
inline in c++ says only one thing to the compiler this function is defined in header file and so it may be compiled independently in multiple compilation units. it is not an error so don t emit any error or warning message. instead during consolidation multiple versions of this function should be treated as one

1862456
qtkit	quicktime
if you are working on os x only i would stick with the qtkit apis because they are much higher level and generally easier to work with
the general gist of what you want to do is step through each frame in a movie get a image representation for the current frame save the current frame s image to a file on disk to step through the frames in a quicktime movie you can use the qtmovie class in qtkit to do this as follows this code compiles but has not been fully tested

because of that this new versioning of the uploader is not backwards compatible with the code written to work with the previous versioning it is however compatible with flash player 9
do not upgrade to this versioning without carefully reading the documentation and reviewing the new examples

1863484
superclass	subclassing
when compiling class derived the compiler actually emits two methods the method printarg derivedarg and a synthetic method printarg basearg which overrides the superclass method in terms even a virtual machine ignorant of type parameters can understand and delegates to printarg derivedarg
you can verify this by throwing an exception in printart derivedarg while calling it on a reference of type base and examining the stack trace as for finding this in the java language specification i first missed it as well as it is not as one might expect specified where overriding or the subsignature relation is discussed but in members and constructors of parameterized types 4.5.2 which reveals that formal type parameters of the superclass are syntactically replaced by the actual type parameter in the subclassing prior to checking for override equivalence

1863560
public	protected
looking at permission descriptions like this makes me believe it must be at least partially possible this grants code permission to query a class for its public protected default package access and private fields and or methods
although the code would have access to the private and protected field and method names it would not have access to the private protected field data and would not be able to invoke any private methods

1864249
integer	unsigned
yes perl automatically handles large integer arithmetic for you
however perl does not offer a distinction between signed and unsigned types there s no need since there are not fixed bounds on large integer range

1864524
inherited	subclassing
this is done using composition to avoid inherited
firstly i wouldn t subclassing the piece class because it s unnecessary

1864524
subclass	inherited
firstly i wouldn t subclass the piece class because it s unnecessary
the piece class should be capable of describing any shape without using inherited

1864549
comparator	icomparer
you can specify an implementation of the icomparer t generic interface by using a constructor that accepts a comparator parameter
if you do not specify an implementation the default generic comparator comparator t .default is used

1864858
cdr	cons
cdr isn t a car at all.
in lisp a linked list element is called a cons

1865403
post	get
maybe you can spot the differences and post here
i think it means that true will copy the attributes from the xmlreader because of this function in the xmlreader class getattribute when overridden in a derived class gets the value of an attribute. edit an attribute is the date part 1st line maybe the date doesn t get written automaticly

1865716
versioning	upgrade
if you cannot upgrade to the latest versioning you should use t.column first_name string syntax
check your versioning of rails

1866020
xsl-fo	xslt
if you wish to avoid .net then xsl-fo is worth a look
try the foray project. xslt can be a steep learn if you do not have experience already

1866239
doc	rtf
this makes it easy to do something approximating form-filling on word .doc files using just standard file-utils and some trivial rtf- doc tweaking
i suggest generating rtf on the server it s easy enough to automatically generate using cpan s rtf writer has converters generating good pdf can be edited by hand in word oo-writer textedit doesn t have any really bad compatibility issues between the main editing applications and has decent text resource extraction tools with text extraction being rather better than pdf

1866788
filesystems	fat	filesystems	ntfs
renaming a file in the fat filesystems can also change the file id but only if the new file name is longer than the old one
in the ntfs filesystems a file keeps the same file id until it is deleted . you can replace one file with another file without changing the file id by using the replacefile function. however the file id of the replacement file not the replaced file is retained as the file id of the resulting file

1866939
superclass	subclassing
the superclass should not know about its subclassing
you should implement the - void doacommonbehaviour method in every subclassing and there edit - clarification if all the subclassing are going to implement -doauniquebehaviour then it should be implemented in the superclass even empty and each subclassing will override it to its needs

1867309
super	implements
personally i do not find the uri type to be super useful but there are 2 options that i can think of create a new user type by implements iusertype see - search for the uri implementation it s about half way down create a protected string property that is mapped in nhibernate and wrap a public uri around it
update i haven t played with this but given that you are looking to map the properties of the uri i think you want to look at implements the icompositeusertype instead of iusertype

1868559
mouseover	mouseout
basically have a timer start in the mouseover event and that timer changes a variable
the mouseout event then only closes the window if it s ok to close like this doesn t directly answer your question but it will work as a workaround

1868849
filtering	grouping	hide	show
without going much on why you want to do that here s an idea you could create a filtering based in a column say a yes no column named hide from view and on the filtering options in the modify view settings you choose to not display items that are not equal to your hide from view column
create new yes no column name hidefromview default value no edit modify the view go to the filtering grouping select the option show items only when the following is true configure with show the items when column hidefromview is equal to no edit your list items and mark a few checkboxes for this column

1870362
folder	directory
as an addition to the other use a module suggestions if you plan on reusing the module a lot you will want to get this installed into either your site library usually under ... perl install folder ... site lib
if not perhaps it has limited reusability outside the script you can keep it in the directory with your script and import it like so use lib . lib

1870480
children	parent
you need to do it yourself which on the other hand is not very hard this takes care of both checking and unchecking all children regardless of how many levels down there may be child nodes
update expanded code sample that will also check uncheck parent node if all of its child nodes are checked or unchecked manually not thoroughly tested could probably be done more elegantly the if-block that is added in the setchildrenchecked method will prevent a stackoverflowexception in the case where you check a node with child nodes they get checked and when the last one is checked the parent the one you clicked on gets cecked and triggers the aftercheck event again which surprises me a bit

1870940
nsobject	nsmanagedobject
the methods its complaining about are implemented in nsobject so i can t imagine that they aren t there
i d always used the actual entity class that was retrieved -- looks like list in your case -- rather than calling it an nsmanagedobject

1871035
post	get
dropping a unique key was a problem i dealt with too though not mentioned in the post
i worked around it by implemented an existence check before creating the record realizing that we d still get occasional dupes due to the race condition

1871795
post	get
i m not exactly sure but i thought it was defined in the post use of parameters for mysql_query excerpt see point 2 magic_quotes_gpc automatically escapes things you receive in requests from clients.
but it cannot detect so-called second-level injections you get a malicious query from a client and store its contents in the database

1872348
cvs	svn
cvs2svn does not have a feature to discard part of the cvs history
but you can convert the whole history then use svnadmin dump and svnadmin load to discard part of the repository after the conversion svnadmin dump -r r head path to full repo | svnadmin load path to abbreviated repo where r is the svn revision number of the first revision you would like to retain

1872666
folder	directory
try using temp folder instead think path.gettemppath
you simply may not have enough permissions to write to this directory

1872718
implements	modifiers
a destructor is a member that implements the actions required to destruct an instance of a class
destructors cannot have parameters they cannot have accessibility modifiers and they cannot be invoked explicitly

1873200
post	get
when using post method the parameters are sent in the post body
generally if your parameters have very few characters and do not contain sensitive information then you send them via get method

1874256
int	chars
not directly an answer but here s how i would do the encoding the first line uses horner s schema to arithmetically assemble 5 bits of each chars into an int
it will fail horribly if any of your input chars fall outside the range a-

1874334
ubuntu	linux
edit by calmarius this trivial code reproduces the problem when compiled with this command gcc -wl --no-as-needed -g -o stuff main.c -ldl -lpthread even the latest valgrind 3.11 can reproduce this on ubuntu 14.04 upstream bug has been reported
was able to reproduce this issue with some hello world code which doesn t even call any symbols in the loaded object. i assume it s a bug in libc or valgrind. reproducible on ubuntu 9.04 and scientific linux 5.3 20 and 32 bytes respectively

1875320
freebsd	linux
the canonical example of a full system profiling tool for solaris os x freebsd is dtrace
but it is not yet fully available on linux you can try here but the site is down for me at the moment and i haven t tried it myself

1875376
temporary	tablespace
you could increase the size of your temp tablespace or create a separate temporary tablespace just for the user s that will own these objects if you wanted to segregate these large temporary tables into a separate tablespace
you can t and wouldn t want to store them in your permanent tablespace

1875702
inherited	properties
the text properties for instance is on control but it doesn t make sense on every class that inherited from control
so in monthcalendar for instance it appears like this per reflector browsable indicates whether the member shows up in the properties window

1876205
inherited	properties
one word inherited
properties are inheritable while fields are not

1877869
keydown	keyup
for all the letters and digits you can send 0 for keydown and the correct letter for keyup
backspace seems to need a real keydown not 0 but control-backspace doesn t seem to do much in ie so if c vbback keydown needs to be different

1877912
post	get
i m gonna go ahead and post my solution even though i realize it may not be the most elegant secure or practical in terms of best practices
first of all i had extendend the webformviewengine class and overridden the findview method what i did was add a static property to my utility class like so and modified the findview method to capture the viewengineresult and get the viewpath this gave me the virtual path to the view which is just what i needed

1878715
yaws	inets
yaws is the older project and may be more stable as a result but not neccessarily
i ve almost no experience with inets so i m not going to comment on it

1879020
mechanize	hpricot
fortunately it s not that big of a leap to move between open-uri nokogiri and mechanize so use the first one that meets your needs and revise your code once you realize you need the capabilities of one of the other libraries
i suggest using nokogiri or hpricot to open and parse html documents

1879748
implements	extends
as far as i know there is no built-in c# or .net library function for this so you d have to implements something on your own or find some code online whose license suits your needs
a simple greedy algorithm shouldn t be too difficult to implements however until the required number of characters is reached extends the shortest sequence of spaces by one choose one randomly if there is more than one such sequence . i d distribute the spaces randomly rather than starting at the center to make sure the spaces are evenly distributed among your text rather than concentrated at one position

1879817
temporary	tablespace
you obviously need very large temporary tablespace but you re not consuming more space overall unless you ve been making heavy use of table compression unavailable in gtt s at least up to 10gr2
look into the use of tablespace groups using a tablespace group rather than a single temporary tablespace can alleviate problems caused where one tablespace is inadequate to hold the results of a sort particularly on a table that has many partitions

1880993
g++	gcc
i m doing which prints out foo bar works with msvc2005 but not with gcc g++
edit to make it work with gcc g++ you can abuse variadic macros however it s your discipline not to use the macro with too many parameters

1881052
implements	extends
another solution which would perhaps be easier to implements and still arguably pretty neat would be to overwrite or wrap jquery s function with a function of your own that stringifies the json on the client this is done anyway to create the request in the first place so it shouldn t be a lot of overhead and checks length there
the gain with this approach is that you don t have to mess with extends the service handler but also the part of truncating the object would be easier as your javascript object is readliy at hand

1881169
g++	gcc
well this thread is already a bit old however i was dealing with the same problem and found a way to initialize an array of pointers to arrays like this and i get the output compiling with gnu g++ 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and compiling with intel icpc 0 1 1 40896 32767 -961756724 0 32767 4198878 0 so the syntax seems to be in principle correct just that the intel compiler does not correcly support it probably due to a lack of common use of this style
--- edit --- here is also a c version as demanded i tested it with gcc and clang and it prints the correct result. btw

1882326
folder	directory
if it s activestate perl you may need to install the module manually see a paragraph or two down. if it happens to have a build.pl then you need to do a slightly different set of steps perl build.pl build build test build install of course you may want to consider not installing if make build test fails but that s up to you. as a final alternative if your module has no xs files ie code that needs to be compiled on install and all dependencies are met you can simply move the files in the lib folder to your perl installation s site lib folder
if you re interested in just using it for one project you can add a perl5lib environmental variable pointing to a new custom library directory eg my project lib and then before running your tool make sure the environment is set up

1882528
put	get
try this i will put my comment here otherwise the code will not be readable
try this what it does is wget - get the index file sed - cut out some parts and put it together in different order

1883384
hash	md5
if you want to create dmy touch files you can create a custom builder like it is very important to put the timestamp into the dummy file because scons uses md5 hash
if you have an empty file the md5 will always be the same and it may decide to not do subsequent build steps

1883519
django	web2py
web2py was very much inspired by django and if you know one it is easy to learn the other
we added some features we did not find in django including database migrations alter tables automatically tickets on errors a web based ide a database abstraction layer that works on google app engine a role based access control mechanism with pluggable login modules

1883519
django	web2py
one of the fundamental design differences is that in django apps are implemented as modules and therefore you need to restart the server when you edit them
in web2py instead models views controllers are not modules they are executed not imported by the frameworks and therefore you do not need to restart the server when they change

1884628
hash	salt
however the combination of a salt and a password may lead to the same string or hash in the end and the hash will be exactly the same so make sure to use a combination of salt and password where two different combination won t lead to the same hash
another intention behind the use of a salt is to make sure two users with the same password won t end up having the same hash in the users table assuming their salt are not the same

1884693
prepare	pdostatement
what you may want cached are the results returned from the same sql query either raw or built by prepare and this is a feature of your dbms mysql for instance not php
two subsequent calls to pdo prepare even with the same sql query should return two different pdostatement or handles to avoid collisions especially between previous and current bindings you may apply to it

1885340
range	max
normalize the word_matches counts to range 0..1
find max count then divide any count by this - you should store floats there not ints

1885365
for-loop	arrays
i would recommend you to avoid problems and iterate using a normal for-loop if i m wrong and actors is not an arrays i would recommend you to use the hasownproperty method to ensure that the property exists in the object itself not up somewhere in the prototype chain
the for...in statement is meant to be used to iterate over object properties by looking your code seems that actors is an arrays you are setting the initial element with index 0

1885560
hash	salt	hash	md5	salt	md5
if the attacker knows that you use a single salt for all member accounts then he can create a single set of pre-calculated hash values from dictionary words using your salt
md5 is not a very strong hash function

1885560
hash	md5
md5 is not a very strong hash function
some methods to compromise md5 have been published

1885637
hash	md5
since your md5 hash will always be the same size you should probably use a char
however you shouldn t be using md5 in the first place

1886025
ssl	https
https is http over ssl encrypted connection
ssl certificates are free getting them signed by a known certificate authority isn t free nor cheap

1887094
gtk	clutter
gtk doesn t offer that much although you can use clutter alongside with it
if you re specifically looking into db xml gtk has a parser for a subset of xml and threading gtk has glib features then qt will offer all that in qtsql qtxml and qtconcurrent

1888071
maven	pom.xml
so try run maven with additional params
there is king of bug in maven simply because maven does not skip taking an artifact if one of the maven repo sends a 301 moved permanantly and it simply take that message and write it as the pom.xml file

1888071
maven	pom.xml
there is king of bug in maven simply because maven does not skip taking an artifact if one of the maven repo sends a 301 moved permanantly and it simply take that message and write it as the pom.xml file
simply if the maven repo sends 404 it skip that repo and go for another but here with 301 it just dump the message as the pom.xml file and later on this failes

1888841
illegalargumentexception	runtimeexception	illegalargumentexception	unchecked-exception
the compiler is telling you to remove illegalargumentexception from the throws clause of your method
unchecked-exception also known as runtimeexception are those that the compiler does not force you to catch

1888925
versioning	upgrade
as the symfony development is test driven i assume the new versioning are stable and reliable
but do not upgrade to 1.4 but to version 1.3

1891212
gridview	repeater
if you need to be able to sort your results by column however you may want to look at the gridview control
i prefer using the standard asp.net listview control mostly because it is not much more complex than a repeater but the listview can support data paging

1891634
versioning	upgrade
anyone who used gettext library for ruby probably noticed that its activerecord integration has been broken with each rails major upgrade because aliased versioning has been following the semantics of an old method
the purpose of a decorator in general is not to change the internals of any given method and still be able to call the original one from a modified versioning but to enhance the function behavior

1891919
wan	lan
the first step is to forward ports on your router so that connecting to your router on port 3689 from the dorm s lan from the router s perspective this is the wan connects to port 3689 on your laptop from the router s perspective this is the lan
from your dorm lan s perspective this doesn t exist

1892054
put	get
an example of a non self sufficient header might be something like this - in this example myclass.h uses std string without first #including . for this to work in myclass.cpp you need to put the before #include myclass.h
if myclass s user fails to do this he will get an error that std string is not included

1892668
versioning	upgrade
each sql server runtime versioning sql 2008 sp1 sql 2008 rtm sql 2005 sp2 sql 2005 sp1 sql 2005 rtm etc knows how to upgrade to its own versioning
unfortunately once upgrade the database cannot be downgraded

1893103
put	get
put the definition of node before it is used
compiler is not able to get the definition of node when gethead is encountered

1893180
innodb	myisam
on testing the foreign keys are not created on my machine using this syntax but they are when i use this create statement an easy way to see if foreign keys exist on a table is show create table bugs_products or you can query the information schema also check you re using the innodb storage engine
the myisam engine does not support foreign keys

1893638
freebsd	linux
all servers are nix-like freebsd os x linux but not all run apache
my freebsd mirror runs xshttpd somebody most knowledgable must be dedicated maintainer for a long time

1894078
hash	salt
the formal statement of this problem would be one that accepts as input the hash value and salt and attempts to find a password that will generate that hash your basic known cyphertext collision finding problem
depending on the quality of the hash this might not require exponential time

1894270
maven	pom.xml
then select maven project and choose the gwt-maven-plugin archetype
edit the generated pom.xml update the gwt.version property to 2.0.0 which has been released in the central repo add the codehaus snapshot repository and set the gwt-maven-plugin version to 1.2-snapshot the version 1.2 isn t released in central this should happen soon 1.2 which has been released in central too

1894270
maven	pom.xml	maven	m2e
manually enable gwt on the project from project preference by setting the use google web toolkit checkbox this step is unnecessary since you ll be building running with a maven run configuration not the gwt plugin for eclipse
this is how my pom.xml actually looks like run the gwt eclipse goal using m2e maven2 build... to setup your environment and create the launch configuration for your gwt modules

1894988
put	get
put it in your awakefromnib method
this is called on all objects that get deserialized from your nib like your application delegate but it isn t called until all objects are deserialized and wired so you can use your text field for instance

1895060
post	get
i want to suggest you using post redirect get pattern
post action should be your problem is propably connected to populated modelstate which is not empty because you didn t use redirection

1895703
put	get
i think it s fine to put a primary key in a url but security is a separate topic
if someone can change that url and get access to something they shouldn t have access to then it s a security problem and needs to be handled by authentication and authorization

1896589
many-to-many	one-to-many
where a many-to-many occurs is the relationship different between one of the mappings in particular and all the rest
but if it s just the same kind of relationship just one that usually but not always is one-to-many then it s still a many-to-many relationship and modelling it any other way will be making a rod for your own back

1896610
jstl	taglib
installing jstl shouldn t be that hard place the jstl-1.2.jar file in webapp web-inf lib
or when you re using maven declare the taglib in jsp file with the right tld uri

1896729
multiplying	division
in order to get two decimal places multiplying the number by 100 floor it then divide by 100
and note that the number you will return will not really have only two decimal places because division by 100 cannot be represented exactly in ieee-754 floating-point arithmetic most of the time

1896962
for-loop	arrays
standard way is but you ll find these functions can simplify things a lot usage in a stackoverflow greasemonkey script to show all questions on page regardless if they re ignored or not don t worry if the for-loop looks weird in that it skips every other element
the specifics of stackoverflow s dom layout with extra nodes between questions aren t important here. as to document.getelementsbyclassname it returns an arrays of dom elements with the specific class as you would suspect

1897700
folder	directory
and the library folder would have pear zend etc propel
as far as the include_path problem why not store that in a common directory across all your machines

1897934
lsp	principles
no not that lsp
the liskov substitution principles which states that objects of a subtype can be substituted for objects of a supertype

1898066
subclass	superclass
subclasses can not access these fields and so i wouldn t consider a private member to be part of the subclass has-a relationship
in terms of the java language when a subclass is created the superclass is also constructed either implicitly or explicitly

1898214
multiplying	addition	multiplying	multiplication
however given that you don t have a fast multiplying i m not sure it s worth it - you might want to first work on implementing a fast multiplication algorithm
first implement multiplying using repeated addition

1898425
int	chars
so for example if you filled it with 0x02 bytes and you have a 4-byte int type you will get the int 0x02020202 33686018 not 0x02 as you may expect
if you want to see what the first chars value is use and based on your latest question update for example if you to print the chars c it prints like a weird chars that looks like for the value 4 0 0 0 4 if that s a single chars and you re printing it as a chars there s probably nothing wrong at all

1898687
crypt	md5	crypt	hash	hash	md5
python crypt.crypt this module implements an interface to the crypt 3 routine which is a one-way hash function based upon a modified des algorithm
c# the .net framework doesn t include an api for the unix crypt function but here are some libraryies that provide implementations cryptapi cryptapi is a c# library that contains unimplemented algorithms in the .net framework nt ntlm blowfish des and md5 linking and emulating the crypt unix function re-programmed in c#

1900794
profiling	benchmarking
and then examine exactly what the compiler is doing in your case by profiling timing and on when necessary by examining the individual instructions
and when timing your code be aware of all the caveats and gotchas that can invalidate your benchmarking make sure optimizations are enabled but also that the code you re trying to measure isn t optimized away

1901673
profiling	debugging
i have no idea if and how the nhprof reports batching but using the normal sql profiling you cannot notice it
to verify how it works and if it is indeed enabled as i have set it up i had to debugging the nhibernate s code

1902209
public	protected
can t you can t override a public method with a protected one
when overriding a method you can only make it more public not more private

1902209
public	protected
when overriding a method you can only make it more public not more private
i don t know why you use the word general remember that ordering from least to most restrictive yes protected is a less restrictive access modifier than default when no modifier is used so you can override a default method marking the overriding method as protected but not do the opposite

1902331
folder	directory
10 finally navigate to the build output folder and check to see if the file config file has changed
update you might find that vshost.exe file that ends up in the output directory might mess things up as i noticed my config object was pointed to one of these xml file and not my config file

1902795
teamcity	nant
teamcity has some basic build test capabilities but for more advanced options build installer documentation etc. you ll need some script runner at work we use finalbuilder - it s not free but has very good editor
if you re looking for a free alternative have a look at ant or nant - but be prepared to edit a lot of xml

1903136
accessor	properties
as it provides a well-defined set of services serialization accessor nullary constructor but of course all components are not necessarily javabean
they can be also viewed as properties manager as they allow discovery and access of their properties through propertydescriptor as well as managing constraints between properties

1904186
mouse	keyboard
if you want further validation you can handle the selectionchanged event on the combobox and see that selecting the null item actually gives an empty array of addeditems in its selectionchangedeventargs and deselecting the null item by selecting hello with the mouse gives an empty array of removeditems
the null item is not being selected by the keyboard at all - rather the previous item is being unselected and no subsequent item is able to be selected

1904584
hash	md5
here s my implementation first some utility functions implementing the basic hash functions in mathematica is not quite trivial
see this question cryptographic hash sha1 or md5 of data given as a string in mathematica

1904946
boost	stl
in the case of hashed containers there s a whole progression from the various implementations of hash_map to the boost containers to the tr1 containers to those that will be included in the standard library in c++ 0x
depending on how you define stl there s a pretty good chance that at least one of those isn t stl and another is but there s no one point at which it s likely to make sense to treat one differently from another

1905153
hash	salt
a salt is generally used when using a hash algorithm
rijndael is not a hash but a two-way encryption algorithm

1905153
hash	salt
rijndael is not a hash but a two-way encryption algorithm
ergo a salt is not necessarily needed for encrypting the data

1905301
pbkdf2	hash
since you want to use standard .net library i suggest rfc2898derivebytes which is an implementation of pbkdf2
ben s answer is incorrect you should not be using sha functions to hash passwords

1905514
jtextpane	jeditorpane
you can change jtextpane s font only as a whole it doesn t do rich text
there s a document underneath jeditorpane and apparently jtextpane too which you get a hold of with getdocument

1906337
post	put	post	get	put	get
if your web service has a resource that isn t side-effect free it changes something in a database you should use put post or delete put for updates post for creating and delete for delete as the http specs state the gets shouldn t have side-effects
similarly put and delete should be safe to repeat if you get an error back or the network connection times out

1906478
firefox	safari
when you go back in the browser history safari and afaik firefox as well doesn t request the page again
instead safari webkit keeps a copy in memory of the previous visited page so that going back is almost instantaneous

1906558
post	get
you ll need to change the action to post to the php file itself and then use http_redirect to redirect the user to log.txt after checking the password
having said that it s still not going to be very secure though as anyone could get to log.txt by using a direct url so you ll need to do some kind of authorisation there

1907151
int	chars
this does not happen for an int
an int is always signed but with chars you can not be sure

1907151
int	chars
an int is always signed but with chars you can not be sure
you have to assume that a chars can have either unsigned or signed arithmetics

1907243
floating-point	integer
in practice it may requires more instruction to ensure that so you shouldn t rely on accurate and repeatable results with floating-point
in the sum of a float and a integer is there any precision lost

1907836
accessor	properties
you should manually declare a backing field and the accessor c++ cli supports automatic properties with a very simple syntax public properties string somevalue
update reply to comment in c++ cli you cannot control the accessibility of each accessor method separately when you use the automatic properties syntax

1907927
innodb	myisam
you then have to make sure you update the myisam tables from any new text inserted into the innodb tables after a successful transaction
whilst the lack of transaction support in myisam risks occasionally making the data inconsistent in concurrent or error conditions a danger that obviously also applies to the separate fulltext store solution like sphinx lucene et al that s not a big problem in reality as it s only the searchbait that becomes inconsistent and not your actual data

1908049
arp	tcp
the first syn can t be sent until the arp response arrives
maybe the os or tcp stack uses a timeout instead of an event for threads beyond the first one that try to open a connection when the associated mac address isn t known

1908368
superclass	subclassing
sun s java tutorial has this to say on the matter within a class a field that has the same name as a field in the superclass hides the superclass s field even if their types are different
within the subclassing the field in the superclass cannot be referenced by its simple name

1908601
ffmpeg	libavformat
if you just want to extract the frames from a video and save them to file you can just use ffmpeg at the command line ffmpeg -i video.avi image d.jpg for this method you do not need to build ffmpeg as there should be a windows binary available for download
if you are wanting to display the frames or perform some other processing on them you may want to use libavformat and libavcodec main parts of the ffmpeg project to extract the video frames in code

1908733
xslt	xquery
if your input is based on more than one xml document you are pretty much stuck with xquery if your output is not xml based you are pretty much stuck with xslt
xslt is designed to take one xml document and transform it into something else csv html or a different xml format xhtml

1908733
xslt	xquery
the flwr syntax of xquery is quite intuitive if you have an sql back-ground imo xslt is the more powerful language when dealing with one input one output situations especially if the output will not be xml
personally i find the xml based syntax and the declarative nature of xslt slightly difficult to read and maintain

1909320
int	double
javascript doesn t have int
it only has double precision floating-point numbers

1910175
wadl	wsdl
following on the comment above about wadl you can also try wsdl 2.0
while not widely adopted yet wsdl 2.0 does contain good support for rest style services

1911068
post	get
they won t be real words but they will match expected english patterns and people will be able to pronounce and read them completely naturally. i bet if you read that post you will get ideas about how to improve upon what you already have working
this isn t a technical answer but the daily wtf had a post a while back describing a guy who wrote the exact type of thing that you are trying to create the reason it was daily wtf material is because the generator ended up spitting out things that sounded like curse words

1911332
maven	pom.xml
but actually the information you are looking for is available by default by maven unless you configured it to not do so which is very unlikely if you are not aware of that
the pom.xml and pom.properties files are packaged up in the jar so that each artifact produced by maven is self-describing and also allows you to utilize the metadata in your own application if the need arises

1911650
vsto	add-in
i suggest you to download the sample code and apply the following modifications in connect.cs in panelmanager.cs the proof-of-concept is a managed com add-in and not using vsto but a very similar approach should also work for vsto
let me know in case you need any further help as the proof-of-concept already requires some knowledge about subclassing and the office add-in architecture idtextensibility2

1911793
maven	pom.xml
have a look at windows preferences maven installations
you will see a message like this note embedded runtime is always used for dependency resolution but does not use global settings when it is used to launch maven. to learn more visit the maven web page. translating to english it means that eclipse will continue to employ its internal maven instance in order to perform some tasks. when you run as maven install it will run your pom.xml script employing the external maven instance you specified but when eclipse performs some of its internal stuff it will continue to use the embedded maven instance whatever version it is

1912484
puts	gets
i believe what happens is that you re clicking on the button when pop is shown which makes it to close and sets button s ischecked field to false which puts the button into untoggled state
then the click gets processed by the button itself and since it not toggled it becomes toggled and popup gets shown again

1912492
abstract-class	base-class
it makes no sense to create just a stream but via the abstract-class you can code to the stream api without knowing the details
most commonly to serve as a base-class or interface some languages have a separate interface construct some don t - it doesn t know the implementation that is to be provided by the subclasses implementing classes abstraction and re-use when the base-class can provide no meaningful default-implementation for a method but allowing subclasses to re-use the non-abstract parts of the implementation

1912607
cpython	ironpython
the gil is not actually part of python it s an implementation detail of cpython the reference implementation that the core python devs work on and that you usually get if you just run python on your linux box or something
jython ironpython and any other reimplementations of python generally do not have a gil and multiple pure-python threads can execute simultaneously

1913701
free	malloc
you never pass size to free free just knows how much to free because the size of a malloc -ed block is saved somewhere in front of the block
back to c++ new delete and new delete are usually implemented in terms of malloc although they don t have to be you shouldn t rely on that

1914152
inline-functions	inlining
but if you are curious about the compiler internals it will fold constants but it will not inline-functions or unroll loops
inlining functions is a hard problem in a dynamic language

1914401
public	protected
probably one of the simplest ways to go about this if you don t have a problem with the method in app2 being public is to simply create a web service exposing that method and call if from app1
if you want app2 s method to be essentially protected so that it can be called by app1 but not by public clients then there are several alternative options

1914587
versioning	upgrade
in the clickonce deployment setup leave the minimum required versioning as the older versioning
this will give them the choice of whether or not to upgrade

1914780
button	checkbox
explanation test will return true if body of document contains an radio button which is checked and that has the value information
there are cases when you cannot rely on checkbox having ids or labels or where label text changes

1914781
primes	modulus
select primes content with specified id
if you really want to store primes as numbers and one of questions stopping you is primes numbers can not be broken down into factors there are another thing store it in list of modulus of any number ordered by sequence

1914781
primes	modulus
if you really want to store primes as numbers and one of questions stopping you is primes can not be broken down into factors there are another thing store it in list of modulus of any number ordered by sequence
small example list is 81 17 83 2 in real application is useful to split by modulus of 2 32 32-bits integers specially if primes in processing application stored as byte arrays

1914781
primes	modulus
small example list is 81 17 83 2 in real application is useful to split by modulus of 2 32 32-bits integers specially if primes in processing application stored as byte arrays
storage in db create table primes prime_id number not null part_order number 20 not null prime_part_value number not null

1915139
agile	metrics
in general if you practice scrum or any other agile methodology you should follow the time-boxing principle and avoid extending delaying your sprint
in particular code coverage metrics alone is not enough to estimate the test readiness status of your application

1915547
hide	show
you could be running into a clash with python s own commands module which doesn t have submodules like yours -- naming your own modules and packages in ways that are meant to hide ones in the standard library just like naming your variables in ways that are meant to hide builtin names like list or file is always a perilous undertaking even though it should work there s always potential for confusion
if that s the case you can then open a ticket on gae s tracker because it would show a minor but undeniable bug in gae s runtime but meanwhile your problem is solved

1915586
codeigniter	pyrocms
unlike other cms i have seen built on frameworks pyrocms doesn t touch the core framework at all which means future upgrades of codeigniter will be easy
a free cms built on codeigniter is pyrocms

1915949
command-pattern	memento
also as pointed out command-pattern which is potentially less resource intensive so i will concede that in specific cases where there is a large object state to be persisted and or there are no destructive methods and where reciprocal commands can be used very trivially to reverse any action taken command-pattern may be a better fit but not necessarily it will depend very much on the situation
in other cases i would use the memento pattern

1916511
jboss	weblogic
for example an application which uses ejbs can run on ibm websphere redhat s jboss bea s weblogic etc and not have to comply with jboss s license
maybe shipping jboss and your app on the same cd would violate the license for jboss but your app is otherwise free of restrictions unless it includes parts of jboss in it

1916901
super	implements
you can find an example of that in classwritercomputeframestest that introduces a classinfo abstraction similarly simpleverifier.getclass method is used by simpleverifier.isassignablefrom and you can overwrite the latter and use the classinfo abstraction to find the common super type
if i am not mistaken aspectwerkz project had implements similar thing in its type pattern matching code

1916935
pull	push
if you can t touch the subversion server instance on your production server you have a couple of options publish the code elsewhere then use the subversion client on your production server to pull down a copy of the code from the published location
make sure you use svn export not svn checkout so that you don t get .svn directories scattered all over or else protect your .svn directories in some way. use a post-commit hook on your local development environment to push the code to the server for example via ftp

1917726
inherited	subclassing
this leads me to believe that a canvas element cannot take focus and has simply inherited access to the focusmanager through inherited of uicomponent
the only solutions i can see are to utilize something other than canvas to handle your focus related concerns or subclassing canvas and implement ifocusmanagercomponent though that looks fairly complex

1917826
maven	pom.xml
as documented in the usage page of the maven deploy plugin the deploy deploy-file mojo is used primarily for deploying artifacts to which were not built by maven
the project s development team may or may not provide a pom.xml for the artifact and in some cases you may want to deploy the artifact to an internal remote repository

1917866
division	subtract
i m sure that there is a more elegant way of adding the records in the union but i hope that the idea comes across. then run you count id group by division on this recordset may be a temporary query and subtract the dummy record from the count so the select clause would be select division count id -1
i m not exactly sure how to do this properly in access but here is an idea of making sure that there is always at least one row in the result set basically this statement adds a dummy record for each division

1917918
gina	winlogon
hosting .net in winlogon where gina dlls are loaded is probably not such a hot idea- could cause all sorts of conflicts if something else decides to do the same thing and if you trash winlogon you re not getting anywhere with that pc
also gina has been replaced as of vista with icredentialprovider see here - so your investment would be lost as soon as you move to a newer os

1917918
gina	winlogon
also gina has been replaced as of vista with icredentialprovider see here - so your investment would be lost as soon as you move to a newer os
even there the same thing applies custom credential providers are loaded into winlogon so probably not a great idea to use .net there

1918210
for-loop	loops
is exactly equivalent to the while loops the for-loop is more compact and thus easier to parse for such a common idiom
loops is equivalent to as you can see from reading that code it doesn t matter whether you use the post or pre decrement operator in the third section of the for-loop

1918210
for-loop	loops
loops is equivalent to as you can see from reading that code it doesn t matter whether you use the post or pre decrement operator in the third section of the for-loop
more generally any for-loop of the form for forinit

1918478
width	height
for all integer zoom levels in between you would have an integer width and a non-integer height of this text
but text output doesn t work this way you can t set the width of a line of text and have the system compute the height of it

1918478
width	height
but text output doesn t work this way you can t set the width of a line of text and have the system compute the height of it
so the only way to do it is to force the font height to 20 pixels for 100 to 104 zoom but set a font of 21 pixels height for 105 to 109 zoom and so on

1918612
nswindow	nsresponder
any attempt to archive or unarchive an nswindow object using a keyed coding object raises an nsinvalidargumentexception exception
straight from the nswindow documentation note although the nswindow class inherits the nscoding protocol from nsresponder the class does not support coding

1918683
superclass	subclassing
besides the problems mentioned in the question and answer there are other aspects which may give rise to subtle problems from within a class a field that has the same name as a field in the superclass hides the superclass s field even if their types are different
within the subclassing the field in the superclass cannot be referenced by its simple name

1919178
set	bag
bags or multisets are as you can see from the links above a type of set which does allow the objects within it to be duplicates of other objects
these are not generally used as lists ordering can be ignored and hence treated as a bag

1920221
free	alloca
code example from wikipedia imo what makes obstacks special it does not need malloc nor free but the memory still can be allocated dynamically
it is like alloca on steroids

1921177
webrat	cucumber
you can use webrat for any application not just rails
what you do is to use cucumber + webrat + mechanize adapter

1921272
mp3	wav
the iphone can play multiple of these files at the same time mp3 aac cannot because you need the hardware decoder
you can convert wav to caf with the following terminal command on mac os x also if you play these with avaudioplayer avfoundation you will not have to worry about caching as avaudioplayer already does this

1921478
pull	push
it is much easier to identify a bottleneck in a pull system because work items will be queuing up at some stage in the process
in a push system work is pushed through the system whether it is done done or not so its difficult to find bottlenecks

1921585
ubuntu	linux
only if you have a friendly linux geek next to you for a week go for ubuntu server on the first day
linux is case sensitive totally new default locations u g o r w x permissions can come as a rude shock to people new to linux symlinks can be helpful but confusing because of windows links not shortcuts being a bit different if mysql stores tables as files with the same name which it does in general case senstitivity can make you feel very lost as nothing works in both php filesystem and mysql my documents to home username documents is a big change in thinking for people new to linux various service configs for server security might confuse you initially any hardware compatibility issues for your linux and your hardware usually very minor problem but can take up hours of figuring out what the problem is. don t expect a cakewalk if the app is real-world and giving you some income

1921844
inherited	subclassing
normal oo design does not treat static methods as inherited and it gets very confusing especially when you start talking about overriding them
if the method is public static or protected static in the superclass it will be accessible in the subclassing

1922486
postgresql	mysql
mysql is not less complicated that postgresql -- they re the same thing
what i need to know is whether the porposed solution is suitable for such a small project and could not be easily replaced by less complicated languages frameworks dmbses like php with mysql etc. yes

1922524
put	get
brantheman is correct i hit this issues a few years ago and we decompiled bits of asp.net and found that it will take the file and put it in a byte array
so you cannot get around this

1922688
equals	icomparable
it s not clear which type you re calling indexof on anyway but most collections won t use icomparable anyway - they ll just use equals and do a linear search
unless you ve overridden equals or implemented a class will be compared by reference identity and a struct will have auto-generated equality comparisons

1922764
comparator	comparable
on the other hand you can provide a comparator when constructing the treemap and it will use that object to compare objects and determine the sort order
you can use comparators to compare objects that do not implement comparable or enforce a different sorting strategy

1923510
filtering	grouping
breaking it apart for the folks that are not used to django aggregation models.annot.objects.select_related select_related is forcing all tables related to annot to be retrieved in the same query this is what will allow me to specify tag__name and sample__name in the values call values tag__name sample__name values is limiting the fields to retrieve to tag.name and sample.name this makes sure that my aggregation on count of clients will grouping by just these fields annotate adds an aggregation as an extra field to a query and finally i filtering on the aggregate count
if you want to add an additional filtering on what users should be taken into account you need to do this i think that is it

1924747
xsl-fo	xslt
an editor like oxygen xml has in built fop support which makes it easy to quickly test your xsl-fo and should make it easier to learn xsl-fo but you can do the same thng from the command line and several other editors as well
i d recommend michael kays xslt book as it s a great reference book for xslt xslt programmer s reference 2nd edition link also the fop book by dave pawson is the best available xsl-fo reference book i know of although there is admittedly not much available

1925216
post	get
you can get away with this see this stackoverflow post for an explanation why not disposing your context doesn t cause connection leaks or stuff like that
the repository and context will get cleaned up by the garbage collector when the entities that were fetched by them fall out of scope when building a website at the end of the request

1926172
versioning	upgrade
for example instance variables that the new versioning of the class initializies in its initialize method may not have been defined by the old versioning but there could aso be subtler bugs than this
so care and a well-planned upgrade path is needed no matter how you pull this off

1926367
ant	maven
i am not sure how familiar you are with ant but using ant will give you more control over the build process at the expense of requiring defining the process
other tools like maven and gradle have a prescribed way of structuring the code that reduces the amount of configuration for a build and in the case of maven i am not sure that one can change how it expects the project layout to be

1926657
serializable	deserialization
because in your first example you re creating an anonymous subclass of arraylist via double-brace initialization and arraylist implements the serializable interface
the serialversionuid is used in deserialization and it s a good practice to provide one though not strictly necessary

1926847
implements	extends
only a few classes implements ifocusmanagercomponent as others mentioned and canvas is not one of them
if you really must call focusmanager.setfocus you will have to extends the canvas class to implements this interface and use that class instead

1926968
disk	ram
the disk space is advertised on the box 8gb 16gb or 32gb
apple does not advertise the amount of ram but the iphone and iphone 3g have 128mb and the 3gs has 256mb

1927076
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
objectoutputstream writes every time the value of serialversionuid to the output stream
objectinputstream reads it back and if the value read from the stream does not agree with the serialversionuid value in the current version of the class then it throws the invalidclassexception

1928041
versioning	upgrade
it is possible for different versioning of the application to have different settings saved out
2 when you upgrade an application the settings class may have been altered and may not be compatible with what s saved out which can lead to problems

1928407
put	get
i think the question you need to be asking is why do you need to break 4.0 strict to get the functionality you want anything that you could use a custom attribute for you you could use a in an existing attribute could be it will be some extra cycles to parse all the class information but so long as you don t put any css info on that class it doesn t change display doesn t put you in quirks mode and doesn t get you in fights at work
if its a goal to maintain valid html4.0 strict then it doesn t matter why you want to put in custom attributes you are breaking the goal

1928816
interpreted-language	dynamic-languages
given that and that just about the only advantages of a compiler are typechecking difficult to do in a dynamic-languages and speed there s not much incentive to write compilers for most interpreted-language
raw compute performance is probably not a goal of most interpreted-language

1929426
jobs	cron
since you don t want outside process and postgresql doesn t support jobs - you are out of luck
if you ll reconsider using outside processes then you re most likely want something like cron or better yet pgagent

1929790
onreadystatechange	onload
in these browsers only the onload listener is useful to detect the end of a script loading the onreadystatechange is not needed
in firefox safari and chrome the onreadystatechange handler nevers gets called

1929891
onreadystatechange	onload
en presto 2.2.15 version 10.10 test for script.readystate behavior started added script with onreadystatechange handler test1.js start test1.js start of closure test1.js end of closure readystatechange loaded readystatechange loaded these different behaviors indicate that onreadystatechange is not a reliable way to detect the end of a script loading in opera
since opera also supports the onload listener this other mechanism should be used instead

1930131
imperative	declarative
cmake s build model for c++ is more declarative and less imperative and thus to me easier to use
the cmake language syntax isn t great but a declarative build with odd syntax beats an imperative build in python

1930150
folder	directory
see the iphone docs for info on how to modify the returns of the nssearchpathfordirectoriesindomains or nshomedirectory functions to find the locations of these folder - somewhere to place data
you cannot write to the bundle directory

1930482
folder	directory
not sure what you mean by respective local folder about dev-deploy but this sounds like what mvn pacakge is doing and bundle indeed sounds like a maven assembly
i ve seen that the assembly plugin can create either archives tar gz etc. or exploded directory from the same assembly descriptor

1930483
udp	tcp
you can get udp type behaviours over unicast tcp pubsub
re udp i am not sure if udp would be useful here

1931181
hide	show
meanwhile arguing that setting the pointer to null might hide errors to me sounds like arguing that you shouldn t fix a bug because the fix might hide another bug
the only bugs that might show if the pointer is not set to null would be the ones that try to use the pointer

1931389
valgrind	memcheck
such a modification is not trivial but valgrind was designed with the idea in mind that users could create new tools
i think a simple modification to the memcheck tool would detect your unaligned references

1931450
post	get
but it is not possible to redirect user s browser from some action in controller to make another post - if it would be possible then i could redirect user to for example email change form of gmail or other forms
you can only redirect user to other site which user s browser then get s

1931639
spaces	delimiter
the yyyy-mm-dd hh mm ss format has a locale language issue on sql server 2005 an example is french but is fixed in sql 2008 so do not use this format yyyy-mm-dd hh mm ss spaces separator
only use yyyy-mm-ddthh mm ss t separator or yyyymmdd hh mm ss no dash delimiter important if you re generating scripts that include datetime constants

1931702
post	get
this is the case with all post insert generators. if do not want that to happen and also to gain many other benefits you should select to use one of the orm style generators like the hilo sequence hilo generator have a look at this for more info
if your entity s primary key is identy column this is normal behavior as nhibernate has to persist the data to the database in order to get the entity s id so it can place it in its session

1931836
queue	fifo
queue a collection used to hold multiple elements prior to processing. besides basic collection operations a queue provides additional insertion extraction and inspection operations
queues typically but do not necessarily order elements in a fifo fifo manner

1931836
queue	fifo
queue typically but do not necessarily order elements in a fifo fifo manner
among the exceptions are priority queue which order elements according to a supplied comparator or the elements natural ordering

1931915
opml	xml
so the easiest answer is it depends on what s in your db and whether it s appropriate to express in opml
this is sort of a weird question -- opml is an xml format with very specific definitions and requirements it s not like just any database table would contain opml-appropriate data

1931916
folder	directory
you only have the dele command defined in section 4.1.3 to delete a file and the way to delete an entire tree using ftp is to recursively delete files and folder rmd one by one
the ftp rfc or the extensions to ftp rfc does not define any command to recursively delete a directory

1932236
des	rsa
this was especially true in france which for a time outlawed all non-governmental uses of crypto even very weak 40-bit des
although france has loosened up a bit they still seem to behind most other developed countries in understanding that a their citizens have a valid right to privacy and b there s not much they can do to stop it in a world where 4096 bit rsa is available all over the net

1932349
implements	extends
the most flexible way to program for this is provide the interface provide the abstract class that implements the interface provide the concrete classes that either extends from the abstract class or extends from another class and implements the interface alway unless you cannot declare variables parameters constants as the interface rather than the abstract class or concrete classes there is no point in having the concrete classes implements the interface more later . there is no point in having the abstract class repeat the abstract methods from the interface
by doing #4 you ensure that all classes that implements the interface can be used - if you were to use the abstract class instead then classes that implements the interface but do not extends the abstract class cannot be used

1932349
implements	extends
by doing #4 you ensure that all classes that implements the interface can be used - if you were to use the abstract class instead then classes that implements the interface but do not extends the abstract class cannot be used
later part the one argument for having the abstract class and the concrete classes implements the interface is that if you were to later change the concrete class to no longer extends the abstract class then you could forget to also implements the interface which in some cases could break the code without the compiler complaining

1932371
inline	inlining
about performance the wise approach is as always to profile the application then eventually inline a set of functions representing a bottleneck
references to inline or not to inline 9 inline functions policies binary compatibility issues with c++ gotw #33 inline inline redux effective c++ - item 33 use inlining judiciously edit bjarne stroustrup the c++ programming language a function can be defined to be inline

1932371
inline	inlining
references to inline or not to inline 9 inline-functions policies binary compatibility issues with c++ gotw #33 inline inline redux effective c++ - item 33 use inlining judiciously edit bjarne stroustrup the c++ programming language a function can be defined to be inline
for example the inline specifier is a hint to the compiler that it should attempt to generate code for a call of fac inline rather than laying down the code for the function once and then calling through the usual function call mechanism

1932371
inline	inlining
to make inlining possible in the absence of unusually clever compilation and linking facilities the definition and not just the declaration of an inline-functions must be in scope 9.2
an inline especifier does not affect the semantics of a function

1933109
try-catch	exception-handling
in the situation you describe ie not using a smart pointer you have to free the resource in the destructor and if the constructor of someclass throws an exception-handling with a try-catch block
which you can t do if an exception-handling is thrown in the initialisation list

1933537
subclass	accessor
looking at it another way the instance variables that are not marked private are part of a contract with the subclass programmer whereas the ones marked private are not
this means that instance variables should usually be marked private so that they can only be accessed through their accessor methods if at all

1934225
put	get
if your really worried about it you can put it in the config file and use protected config file sections to encrypt it
in order to get the code the attacker would need to get the executable from the machine not just the result of the page

1934311
put	get
put the class connecter which you should probably rename to connector into a header file .h instead of .cpp and add include guards into the file
that is at the beginning of your con.h file add lines #ifndef con_h_included #define con_h_included and at the very end add the line #endif this way even if you #include con.h twice the second time it will not get read because the symbol con_h_included has been defined on the first time so the #ifndef-#endif pair hides the content

1934787
onbeforeunload	onload
at this point you d want to record a start time then you can listen for the onunload or onbeforeunload event and use an image to send a get request with the info you ll have to do some testing to see whether the requests are always sent--i m sure sometimes the browser closes or the tab switches before they finish firing
if you want to implement this yourself you need to decide when to get the start time--you can put a script tag at the top of the page which may execute before the content has rendered on the onload event which will wait until all images and scripts have loaded or something like the the jquery ready event which occurs when the dom is ready but doesn t wait for resources to load

1935090
udp	tcp
you mention udp and even raw sockets but it s not clear to me why
web services are typically http which means they re over tcp

1935264
memcached	apc
memcached does not have any bytecode or php acceleration features which is why i would run it side-by-side with apc or xcache
memcached is more along the lines of a distributed object cache vs something like apc or xcache which stores php bytecode in memory so you avoid having to parse it each time

1935367
stateless	stateful
you should always use a connection pool and if you re running inside an application server which if you re using ejbs then you are then you can easily use your appserver s datasource configuration to create a connection pool and use that inside your stateless session bean slsb
this is not what stateful session beans sfsb are intended to be used for

1935790
innodb	myisam
t-sql it doesn t have a specific name but yes it supports stored procedures and functions manual chapter 19 transactions yes mysql supports them in some of its storage engines innodb for instance
some storage engines don t support them myisam for instance but you can just not use those

inherited	properties
all have a container properties you can access to get their immediate container but making sure you have the final container in their inhertance path that s not a form requires some code to walk-up the inherited tree which is demonstrated here
you may also wish to check out the haschildren properties of control which is usually useful in dealing with issues of focus activecontrol and select in winforms

1936371
jboss	weblogic
the coldfusion support matrix lists a limited number of java ee servers that they support weblogic server 9.2 10.3 websphere application server nd 6.1 nd 7 jrun updater 7 jboss 4.2 5.01 your choice from this list is going to be dictated by commercial realities not technical ones - weblogic and websphere are the leading servers but commercial and expensive
jboss is free although you can pay for a support contract

1936372
awt	swing
you should not be using a windowlistener to close the frame again this is an old awt technique
swing applications now use the frame.setdefaultcloseoperation ... method to control this

1936521
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
observablecollection oc implements inotifycollectionchanged incc where as you say the collection itself notifies wpf and anyone else equipped to handle the updates of updates to its items collection additions deletions etc
if the oc contains objects that do not themselves implement inotifypropertychanged then wpf has no way of knowing how each items properties have changed

1936579
tableview	nsoutlineview
instead you should interrogate the table view s data source. there is an informal protocol if you are really insistent on using the tableview which is numberofrowsintableview nstabledatasource informal protocol
there is a method called numberofrows which returns a nsinteger. your nsoutlineview is called outlineview documentation here typically you should not ask the table view how many rows it has

1936593
int	chars
if you are using the real lex and not flex i believe you can simply define your own int input void
this can return chars from a string or whatever you want

1937094
public	protected
that is it s available only if a client accesses the observablecollection via a reference of type inotifypropertychanged in which case it s effectively public
so now clients who want to use the fact that observablecollection implements inotifypropertychanged will be happy because the event they re looking for is there but the added propertychanged doesn t conflict with the protected member with the same name because it s scoped with that inotifypropertychanged

1937216
int	double
your seg fault us because you pass in an int effectively
a 2d array is not a double pointer .

1937638
superclass	subclassing
as i understand it subclassing is not encouraged because objective c allows a subclassing too much access to the internal workings of its superclass
the suggested alternative to writing a subclassing is to write a delegate in this case a uinavigationcontrollerdelegate

1938106
profiler	aqtime
it is actually an amazingly good profiler similar to aqtime with wonderfully great profile results
its only downfall is that it only analyzes down to the procedure level and not to the line level and that s the only reason i favor aqtime

1938284
verilog	vhdl
verilog is based on c so knowing c will help with learning verilog however fpgas are by nature parallel so even though the syntax might look similar not much else translates
like others have said most fpga s are designed using vhdl or verilog

1938295
int	chars
so this becomes to turn chars 7 into int 7 and so forth
first lose that call to int - you re converting a string of chars to an int which isn t what you want you want to treat each chars as its own number

1938393
ws-addressing	soap
the default config on wshttpbinding uses advanced ws-security and ws-addressing features that aren t understood by the vanilla php soapclient
there are other php-accessible soap clients that might be able to work apache axis2+rampart c for instance or you can try to shut off some of the incompatible wshttpbinding features message security is probably the first

1938431
inherited	properties
refer to the w3c s specification for inherited value
excerpt the inherited value can be used to strengthen inherited values and it can also be used on properties that are not normally inherited

1938431
inherited	properties
excerpt the inherited value can be used to strengthen inherited values and it can also be used on properties that are not normally inherited
to me this is a better phrasing rather than increase the weight of the inherited properties

1938557
width	height
100 width will be the width of the browser window if the element is not sized absolutely 600px or contained within another sized element
the height of the page is determined by how much space the content takes up vertically

1939736
uiview	subviews
the view controller s view is still of type uiview therefore you cannot call tran s -dosomething on the view controller s view because that view is not of type tran
your subclass of uiview should be capitalized to tran for readability class names are capitalized you are adding m_view to the view controller s view via -addsubview therefore the view controller view has a subviews array and that array contains an object instance of type however neither using -addsubview nor casting via makes the view controller view of type tran

1939838
jboss	glassfish
i am not connected in any way with redhat jboss or sun glassfish my company erudis.pl is supporting and developing for both servers
a number of things from my own experience glassfish has much better administration console jboss has three consoles each of them far from being ideal

1941029
inherited	subclassing
if you encounter such clashes in semantics or naming within an inherited hierarchy you should re-evaluate your design
in most cases straight subclassing is not needed and creates a for too tight coupling

1941719
move	drag
i have seen cases where the dragged object doesn t move exactly with the mouse and for a short while the mouse is actually hovering over another object causing the mouseout event to fire thus changing the cursor
i would look at the mouseout event and determine if its firing when you re moving the mouse during a drag

1942215
int	double
this is considered safe if you re starting with a type having a more restricted range than the one you re ending up with short to int is ok as is float to double
i m quite surprised that gcc isn t generating a warning when converting a double to a float

1942779
int	boolean
i would avoid it but otherwise map it to int too
the mysql boolean alias bool alias tinyint 1 is not compatible with the pg boolean type

1942779
tinyint	boolean
the mysql boolean alias bool alias tinyint 1 is not compatible with the postgresql boolean type
you may or may not be able to port apps depending on what they use as boolean literals

1943251
coalesce	isnull
also as of 2008 i don t know whether the option exists in 2005 one can persist a computed column and add a constraint create table t c1 int null c2 as isnull c1 1 persisted not null c3 as isnull c1 null persisted not null c4 as coalesce c1 1 persisted not null c5 as coalesce c1 null persisted not null go insert into t c1 values null results in a constraint violation
i d prefer the ansi standard coalesce function but isnull is fine

1943251
coalesce	isnull
to use coalesce define your computed column as coalesce dbo.fn_getprice itemid 0 edit learn something new everyday
i did the following create table t c1 int null c2 as isnull c1 1 c3 as isnull c1 null c4 as coalesce c1 1 c5 as coalesce c1 null exec sp_help t and c2 is indeed not nullable according to sp_help but c4 is reported as being nullable even though there is no way that coalesce expression could result in a null value

1943933
hash	md5
if you want a hash function to serialize something to disk you might consider the kepler project s implementation of md5 hashing for lua
the hash function is not exposed

1944048
put	get
but if you put a user with certain information then when you use get then it should retrieve that person just as when i put my 4th vacation photo when i call get i expect that photo but it may be transformed by converting to a different format or have some other transforms but if i get the 5th photo instead then that is a problem
if you are transforming then it would make sense that what you put is not what you get so i don t see why it is a problem

1944214
int	double
this will tell you if the double represents an int
disclaimer 1 i m saying int and not int as a double can represent numbers that are integers but whose magnitudes are too great to store in an int

1944214
int	double
disclaimer 1 i m saying int and not int as a double can represent numbers that are int but whose magnitudes are too great to store in an int
disclaimer 2 double will hold the closest possible value that they can to any real number

1944351
floor	isinteger
fpus are fast enough these days that doing a double -to- int conversion or a floor really isn t that slow
here are a couple of answers and a test harness compile as gcc isinteger.c -o3 -c -o isinteger.o gcc main.c isinteger.o -o isinteger my results on an intel core duo conclusion the bit twiddling isn t as fast as i might have guessed

1945180
floating-point	integer
apart from being not so elegant and maybe being slow adding step continuously to get close to the number being checked will result in less accurate calculations because floating-point errors tend to accumulate
i don t know java well but an algorithm to do this would be to take the ratio value-min step round it to the nearest integer n and then calculate

1945369
google-chrome	firefox
its not a google-chrome webkit issue
infact its a firefox issue

1945694
libxml2	hpricot
also i get the feeling that nokogiri is being more actively maintained although it doesn t have a dependency on libxml2
since i couldn t find any enlightenment here or elsewhere i switched from hpricot to nokigiri and it works flawlessly across all machines now

1945742
haskell	ocaml
i found that learning a less aggressively functional language before moving on to haskell is a step worth taking
you may want to consider ocaml objective caml another functional programming language that is not pure nor lazy

1946757
udp	tcp
it might not be quite as efficient as udp if you were not worrying about packet loss but you should be able to transmit the data just fine
tcp ip would work

1946968
for-loop	loops
i would say personally i find foreach a bit more readable over for loops but you should use the best for the job at hand and not have to write extra long code to include a foreach loops if a for-loop is more appropriate
it seems a bit strange to totally forbid the use of something like a for-loop

1947423
postgresql	mysql
unfortunately mysql does not support function based indexes like postgresql and oracle
source a possible workaround in mysql is to add another column for lower case e-mail addresses and a trigger that populates it with lower case e-mails on all updates and inserts

1947683
hash	salt
even though a man in the middle may not know the plain password if the javascript is not modified he will know the hash and he can perfectly use that hash to perform a login on his own by just replaying it
even if you include a salt nonce the man in the middle could still be able to use those tokens at the moment and even steal the account by performing a password email change

1948426
ienumerable	iqueryable
thanks to itowlson for pointing out that it has to be not just ienumerable
you ll have to turn it into two queries it s important that query be ienumerable instead of var or iqueryable it s important that you call asenumerable so that you get back an as we want to force the second query to use linq to objects on the results of the first linq to sql query

1949755
jboss	glassfish
if you want to run in container tests then you could indeed use an embedded container and my current preference goes to glassfish v3 even for java ee 5 i may be wrong but i m pretty disappointed by the starting time of the latest jboss releases so it isn t getting much of my attention
see the post glassfish embedded reloaded an appserver in your pocket for sample code that you could use from your tests or using maven plugin for v3 embedded glassfish if you are using maven

1950180
qtimer	qthread
however a more elegant solution would be to refactor your code to use a qtimer - this might require you saving the state so you know what to do when the timer goes off
it isn t pretty but i found this in the qt mailing list archives the sleep method of qthread is protected but you can expose it like so then just call sleeperthread msleep 1000

1951172
cpython	pypy	cpython	ironpython
in cpython today you need not worry -- reference counting in practice does ensure timely closure
but most other python implementations jython on the jvm ironpython on .net pypy on all sorts of backends pynie on parrot unladen swallow on llvm if and when it matures per its published roadmap ... do not guarantee the use of reference counting -- many garbage collection strategies may be involved with all sort of other advantages

1951182
webrat	cucumber
actually the problem lies in webrat not cucumber
the sequence of events is roughly cucumber runs your feature when the i am on the home page step is reached it invokes webrat to make the request to the controller webrat constructs a request and sends it to the controller step fails because the request does not have an accept-language header apparently webrat does not add this header when it builds the request

1951182
webrat	cucumber
the sequence of events is roughly cucumber runs your feature when the i am on the home page step is reached it invokes webrat to make the request to the controller webrat constructs a request and sends it to the controller step fails because the request does not have an accept-language header apparently webrat does not add this header when it builds the request
however webrat gives you a workaround the header method with which any header can be set for the duration of the request

1951458
hash	salt
edit as op noted just using a hash algorithm isn t enough
you must to add a salt to make it harder to break

1951706
screens	mdpi
the actual screens density is ignored
so a g1 will show mdpi bitmaps slightly smaller than a mdpi device with a true 160dpi screens but this is a very small difference so it s not a big deal

1951706
screens	mdpi	screens	hdpi	mdpi	hdpi
so a g1 will show mdpi bitmaps slightly smaller than a mdpi device with a true 160dpi screens but this is a very small difference so it s not a big deal
note that other dimension types such as in and mm do take into account the screens density. so for densities you have 3 choices ldpi 120 mdpi 160 and hdpi 240

1952066
lsp	principles
in your case however your base class is abstract so the lsp doesn t fit perfectly but i think you understand what i m getting at
it s breaks liskov s substitution principles a.k.a

1952389
gif	png
no the gif format does not support alpha-channel transparency like png does
you can only select one out of the 256 possible colors in a gif to be transparent

1952390
gif	png
the gif format doesn t support this so unfortunately no there isn t a way to do it
the edges in a png are smooth because of anti-aliasing and thus variable opacity

1953683
profiling	benchmarking
some top tips from mysql performance tips forge specific query performance use explain to profiling the query execution plan use slow query log always have it on
don t use distinct when you have or could use group by insert performance batch insert and replace use load data instead of insert limit m n may not be as fast as it sounds don t use order by rand if you have 2k records use sql_no_cache when you are selecting frequently updated data or large sets of data avoid wildcards at the start of like queries avoid correlated subqueries and in select and where clause try to avoid in scaling performance tips use benchmarking isolate workloads don t let administrative work interfere with customer performance

1954290
client-side	server-side
any other method mentioned--cookies javascript http referer--depends on client-side data which is insecure and should always be suspected of being fake forged hijacked and maliciously constructed
really the most secure way to do this is to as you suggested use server-side sessions as these cannot be crafted as cookies can

1955108
for-loop	loops
also i changed your for-loop to a foreach
why not refactor so that each method performs a single action rather then doing loops

1955763
for-loop	arrays
this means that that loops is very likely to change the value of i in a completely different for-loop in another function and you ll have absoutely no idea what s going on
if i m understanding the code correctly this should work if it s not an arrays create an arrays that contains only that one item

1956275
put	get
in general webservices require more care and feeding than you would normally put into an etl process but they can be surprisingly effective at the task as well
i did not get enough specifics for your scenario to say whether it would work

1956312
loops	while-loop
while isn t a conditional it is a loops
the difference being that the body of a while-loop can be executed many times the body of a conditional will only be executed once or not at all

1957114
free	malloc
only free pointers obtained from malloc never adjust them prior to that
the problem is free must be very fast so it doesn t try to find the allocation your adjusted address belongs to but instead tries to return the block at exactly the adjusted address to the heap

1957119
free	malloc
but they generally don t support to free on a different pointer than what was returned by malloc or equivalent function
most if not all implementation will lookup the amount of data to free a few bytes before the actual pointer you are manipulating. doing a wild free will lead to memory map corruption

1957310
django-filter	django-haystack
another option separate from django-haystack and searching is django-filter by alex gaynor it allows you to filter fields based on the contents of the model and not on an index
therefore it can be used on models that aren t indexed with django-haystack

1957688
post	get
removed original part of the post here since it is not the solution then the only solution i can see is to perform the loop that you have now the number of times that you have digits
so first you calculate all digits till you get to the last and then print it

1957820
super	self
two links with examples of super and multiple inheritance things to know about python super 1 of 3 python s super is nifty but you can t use it
super classtype self .__init__ is not redundant in a cooperative multiple inheritance scheme -- classtype is not necessarily the type of self but the class from which you want to do the cooperative call to __init__

1957820
super	self
then in b.__init__ you must pass the class type b to super -- since you want to resolve calling superclasses of b or rather the next in the mro after b of the class c
class a object def __init__ self pass class b a def __init__ self super b self .__init__ class c b def __init__ self super c self .__init__ if you now instantiate you see that the class type is not redundant -- super self .__init__ inside b.__init__ would not really work

1957820
super	self
class a object def __init__ self pass class b a def __init__ self super b self .__init__ class c b def __init__ self super c self .__init__ if you now instantiate you see that the class type is not redundant -- super self .__init__ inside b.__init__ would not really work
what you do is that you manually specify in which class the method calling super is an this is solved in python 3 s super by a hidden variable pointing to the method s class

1957862
stdout	fflush
you should add an fflush stdout after this to make sure the output appears before scanf is called
by default stdout is line buffered on many systems so the prompt may not appear before your program waits for input

1958214
autofac	castle-windsor
- autofac - ninject - unity structuremap and spring.net currently do not support silverlight with shipping binaries
list of silverlight supported ioc containers - ayende s building an ioc container in 15 seconds - castle-windsor - you can grab the binary from the rhinomocks for silverlight download

1958493
put	get
put a lock around the access to shared state to make it thread safe
unless mutableboolean uses a lock in it s set get value methods or it s an atomic operation then this isn t threadsafe

1958856
put	get
if not put a breakpoint a loadpopup and step through the code
get firefox and install the firebug plugin

1959277
folder	directory
the reason is that doesn t evaluate to hidden files and folder
that means your .svn directory containing the administrative area of the working copy aren t copied

1959795
innodb	myisam
then you can pretty much forget about myisam and not devote resources to it and get the full benefits of using innodb
anyone who thinks myisam is faster is either not tuning innodb correctly or has such small data that who cares

1959842
switching	screens
simplest case points state is private not only to the compilation unit but also to the event_handler. special cases may be handled separately from the main switching using whatever construct deemed necessary
more complex case when the switching gets bigger than a couple of screens full split it into functions that handle each state using a state table to look up the function directly

1960165
put	get
first block elements had to be put inside td elements in order to get z-index working in several browsers
i used span elements with display block to fill the entire td which means some td css properties will have to be put inside those span elements and further nested but not yet added span elements borders and padding in particular

1960552
versioning	upgrade
almost every host will provide php but may not have the versioning or database options you would like
not everyone has the luxury of installing upgrade at will on a dedicated server

1960622
versioning	upgrade
while it could be done in asp.net in .net 2.0 it just isn t practical given the amount of work involved and the fact that it s already done for you in a later versioning of the framework
if there is any possible way to upgrade to .net 3.5 then i highly recommend that you do that and use asp.net mvc

1960996
memcpy	memmove
also on some architectures memcpy can benefit from using cpu instructions for moving blocks of memory - something that memmove cannot use
memcpy doesn t have any special handling for overlapping buffers so it lacks some checks therefore it is faster than memmove

1961534
width	margin
float your second div on the right and set its width
then your third div will not float but you ll set its left margin to the width of the left column its right margin to the width of the right column

1961534
width	height	margin	height
then your third div will not float but you ll set its left margin to the width of the left column its right margin to the width of the right column
there will be some issues to resolve if either of your columns are greater in height than your middle div but that s solvable by creating a containing floated div

1961646
sequence	permutation
nevertheless factorials which count the permutation of a sequence of length n also grow pretty fast
the mersenne twister for example might be able to produce all permutation of a sequence of length 2080 but definitely not of one of length 2081 or higher

1961646
sequence	permutation
the mersenne twister for example might be able to produce all permutation of a sequence of length 2080 but definitely not of one of length 2081 or higher
were it not for the lifetime of the universe issue the docs worry about even rather small len x would be justified -- we know that many possible permutation can never be reached by shuffling with such a pseudo-rng as soon as we have a reasonably long sequence so one might worry about what kind of bias we re actually introducing with even a few shuffles

1961774
hash	md5
it s not hard to do in c or perl or python using any of the many md5 implementations -- at its heart md5 is a hash function that goes from a character vector to a character vector
so just write a outer program that reads your 3 million strings and then feed them one by one to the md5 implementation of your choice

1961894
maven	m2e
this has worked tremendously well and doesn t require any additional support or plugins from any of ides out there which is a great plus - number two reason we didn t choose maven was seeing how m2e basically took over eclipse
and since you must be wondering number one reason for rejecting maven was the clunkiness of maven itself endless amount of lengthy xml declarations for configuration and the related learning curve was considered a too big cost as to what we would get from using it

1962851
httphandler	httpmodule	isapi	httpmodule
in iis6 isapi filters extensions were analogous to httpmodule httphandler
in terms of httpmodule they cannot deliver the exact same functionality as isapi filters

1962851
isapi	httpmodule
in terms of httpmodule they cannot deliver the exact same functionality as isapi filters
one limitation is that non asp.net resources do not have access to the httpmodule

1964247
subclass	inherited
remember that you can subclass python s built-in exception classes and typeerror would surely be the right built-in exception class to raise here -- that s what python raises if the number of arguments does not match the signature in normal cases without or forms in the signature
i like having every package define its own class error exception and then specific exceptions as needed can multiply inherited as appropriate class wrongnumberofarguments thispackage.error typeerror then i d raise wrongnumberofarguments when i detect such a problem situation

1964735
webclient	httpwebrequest
when using the .net compact framework you can use system.net.httpwebrequest instead of webclient which isn t supported on .net cf
since webclient is implemented on top of httpwebrequest you can do everything with httpwebrequest that you can with webclient albeit with more code

1964772
boost	allocator
note about boost pool
when testing performance of boost pool test not only allocator but also deallocation

1964772
boost	allocator
when testing performance of boost pool test not only allocator but also deallocation
i experienced that boost pool and boost fast_pool deallocation time can be extremally large

1964796
strstr	strcmp
even if you wanted to create strstr which is a c function and not a c++ function you really don t need to avoid using strcmp
and even then implementing strcmp yourself in a separate function is going to make this clearer. on top of that your static variables make this function only work once

1965463
libcurl	libssh
protocols tftp ftp telnet dict ldap http file https ftps features gss-negotiate ipv6 largefile ntlm ssl libz you may find it simpler to build your libcurl as a static library and link against that than to build a shared library and copy it into your app s frameworks subdirectory
now i m pretty sure that mac os x does not ship with libcurl installed yes it does curl --version 0 curl 7.19.4 universal-apple-darwin10.0 libcurl 7.19.4 openssl 0.9.8k zlib 1.2.3 and even if it did it most likely wasn t built with libssh which i would also need

1965541
int	double	division	multiplication
the code compiled with gcc tdiv.c -o1 -o tdiv.s -s the division by 2 and the multiplication by 0.5 however when i changed those int s to double s which is what python would probably do i got this division flds lc0 fstl -8 ebp fldl -8 ebp flds lc1 fmul st st 1 fxch st 1 fstpl -8 ebp fxch st 1 multiplication fstpl -16 ebp fldl -16 ebp fmulp st st 1 fstpl -16 ebp i haven t benchmarked any of this code but just by examining the code you can see that using int division by 2 is shorter than multiplication by 2
using double multiplication is shorter because the compiler uses the processor s floating point opcodes which probably run faster but actually i don t know than not using them for the same operation

1965845
config	ini
with any stable setup there is on the face of it very little point in storing your config file above the web root although given murphy s law it is worth doing if you can that or use .htaccess or the equilivent for your server to deny user access to a directory
i store it in a plain text ini style config file usually above the web root so as not to allow users access to it

1965891
swt	nebula
as with all frameworks there might be points in time where it just does not work and you have to dig deeper into the secrets of swt jface ui forms or databinding alt text
aside from the swt jface examples and introduction courses you have some projects based on jface controls jface data binding celllabelprovider treeviewer example nebula project nebula is a place where different eclipse-projects and independent developers collaborate on building custom swt widgets and reuseable ui-components useable in ui-applications built using swt and jface

1966531
int	chars
the toint code appears to be trying to build up an int out of individual bytes and likely you aren t doing the conversion properly specifically the part where you try to handle negative values
generally when converting code from a c-like language and i ll include java in that set here you want to find a higher-level way to express the code than working with individual bytes and chars

1966580
int	chars
int keys is nominal
chars keys may degrade performance depending on the number of chars that the database needs to compare to determine whether keys are equal or not equal

1966649
inline	inlining
note that i have to force the function not to be inline
otherwise gcc detects that there aren t any aliasing pointers in my benchmark code and restrict wouldn t make a difference due to inlining

1966720
int	chars
beyond 1-character names and obvious ways to minimize spacing the key ideas include single for division same as the nicer for int in python 2
an if else expression in lieu of an if elif else statement extend with a genexp rather than a nested loop with append allows the removal of some spaces and punctuation not binding to a name subexpressions that occur just once binding to a name subexpressions that would otherwise get repeated including the .extend attribute lookup semicolons rather than newlines where feasible only if the separate lines would have to be indented otherwise counting a newline as 1 chars there is no saving

1966773
16-bit	64bit
assuming the value d is in the interval i m not sure what you mean by 16-bit values
double precision values are 64bit on any system using ieee-754

1966855
debugdiag	debugging
if not monitoring the output folder with crash dumps from your iis hang debugdiag rule and restarting iis whenever new files appear should definitely do the trick.
to create the memory dump of your web application the microsoft debugging diagnostic tools are your best option

1966926
range	max
however assuming that this is 16 bit unsigned data normalised to 1.0 so the values range from 0.0 s 1.0 then all you need to do to expand them to 8bit integer values is to multiply each sample by 255
if the range is not 0.0 s 1.0 but 0.0 s max then either way there is no quantisation function other than one you might write yourself

1967152
config	ini
except its not in ini format because it doesn t contain but just key which chokes config ini
alas this is one of the few ini parsers i could find that will deal with a string

1967867
rss	feed
given that rss is stateless it doesn t know when you last requested the feed and therefore couldn t provide which items in the current feed are new or not compared to the last time you queried the feed
simply storing the slug for the rss item should be enough for a simple comparison to determine what is new or not

1967902
realloc	malloc
new returns a pointer of proper type but the pointer what malloc returns has to be typecasted c++ new delete does not have realloc alternative unlike new delete these things are not going to make much of difference in your program
so as stated above it is perfectly fine to go for new your code will not fail unless new or malloc fails in which case new throws an exception and malloc return a null pointer

1968421
alloca	calloc
edited use alloca instead of calloc
there are two different situations to consider 1 an object is created in the local scope and it is not needed outside this local scope. in this case you could allocate storage with calloc alloca or with a raii approach

1968421
alloca	calloc
there are two different situations to consider 1 an object is created in the local scope and it is not needed outside this local scope. in this case you could allocate storage with calloc alloca or with a raii approach
using calloc alloca has the big advantage that you don t have to care about calling free because the allocated memory is automatically freed when the local scope is left

1969488
regression	least-squares
when this is not the case for example when relationships between variables are bidirectional linear regression using ordinary least squares ols no longer provides optimal model estimates
two-stage least-squares regression uses instrumental variables that are uncorrelated with the error terms to compute estimated values of the problematic predictor s the first stage and then uses those computed values to estimate a linear regression model of the dependent variable the second stage

1969842
folder	directory
storing information within the web application folder does not always work
some application servers do not expand the deployed war file and hence there is no working directory for a web application

1971884
free	strdup	free	malloc	free	calloc	free	realloc
memory leaks are blocks which are allocated by not free during the program execution
when wrapping the malloc api one must wrap all of the related functions including calloc realloc and strdup

1972067
nunit	mstest
i ve actually never used mstest myself since i started learning tdd with nunit right away
one of the reasons i did not try out mstest first was that i heard mostly negative opinions whenever i mentioned it to most tdd ers

1972526
mutators	getter	mutators	setter
you have a few choices when loading and saving the objects use some kind of workaround like serializing the object modifying it s string representation and bringing it back with unserialize make all the fields public keep them private protected and write mutators accessors for each of them the first method has the possibility of breaking with a new release and is very crude hack the second one is considered a very bad practice
the third option is also considered bad practice since you should not provide getter setter for all of your fields only the ones that need it

1972773
disk	ram
if you map the entire file but only change one byte then unmap it you ll find that there s not much disk i o at all
of course if you touch every byte in the file then yes it will all be loaded at some point but not necessarily in physical ram all at once

1973660
multibyte	substr
maybe using mb_substr could help here the functions have been created specifically for multibyte encodings
substr is counting using bytes and not characters

1973884
folder	dir
when you open index.php working dir is set to the folder this file resides in
and inside insluded f1.php this working dir does not change

1975731
entity-relationship	entities
in entity-relationship model there are no such things as double relationship expired relationship ternary relationship etc
a pair of entities are either related or not and the relationship is always binary

1976050
folder	directory
the rules for naming files and folder is on msdn
you cannot in general use user-generated text to create windows directory names

1976218
accessor	properties
you can however write an accessor function that will return the protected properties
you cannot make a protected properties public

1976528
for-loop	loops
you could get the textbox control inside the corresponding cell of the gridview using the controls property or the findcontrol string id method or where index could be 0 for the first row or an iterator inside a for-loop
alternatively you can use a foreach loops over the gridview s rows besides you have to keep in mind that if you re creating the gridview dynamically and not declaratively in the web form you won t be able to get this control after a page postback

1977069
serializable	deserialization
datacontractserializer it s fast - around 10 faster than xmlserializer it s interoperable - works flawlessly with java ruby - you name it uses explicit opt-in model - you need to mark what gets serializable doesn t require any constructor can serializable non-public members and internal fields doesn t support attributes on xml nodes you tell the dcs explicitly what to serializable but you don t have much influence over how it s done
xmlserializer serializes only public fields and properties serializes everything except those you exclude opt-out model support attributes and everything it s interoperable - works flawlessly with java ruby - you name it requires a parameterless constructor for deserialization you tell the xmlserializer pretty clearly how and what to serializable but you cannot serializable everything - only publicly visible properties

1977094
folder	directory
you re expecting the current working directory to be the folder where your application is located but it doesn t have to be in fact you should never assume that it is
the context menu isn t setting the working directory first

1977512
nsstring	nsdata
as yuji mentioned it s not a good idea to encode an arbitrary byte sequence into an nsstring although it can contain null bytes as encoding transformations can and probably will destroy your byte sequence
if you want access to the raw bytes of a float you may want to consider storing them as an nsdata object though i suggest you think through your reasons for wanting this first

1977765
int	double
note that as you can only use int and strings as array keys and casting floating point numbers to either int or strings will result in a loss of precision you should convert floating point numbers to their bit-string equivalents if you re using latitude and longitude as keys
a simple should work or you could use if you know your latitude and longitude are stored as floats and not double though i m fairly certain php only uses double you can use f as the pack format rather than d

1978191
vmware	virtualbox
but when the virtual machine bears no resemblance to the machine it is running on then there s no need for special help from the operating system and hardware and no need for anything as complex as vm 370 or vmware
a jvm is not virtual in the same sense as a virtualbox or vmware virtual machine

1978278
emacs	aquamacs
try learning to browse through the documentation within info mode in emacs rather than resorting to the web to get more used to how navigation works in emacs
oh and try using an emacs that doesn t have the aquamacs key bindings

1978278
emacs	aquamacs
oh and try using an emacs that doesn t have the aquamacs key bindings
there is a command line version of emacs included on mac os x though using the meta key is a pain there you have to either set your terminal preferences to use option as meta or always use esc

1978338
filesystems	ntfs
i can think of one good reason not to use them and that s this little tidbit from their how to use guide alternate data streams are strictly a feature of the ntfs filesystems and may not be supported in future filesystems
however ntfs will be supported in future versions of windows nt

1978560
inherited	properties
private static members in inherited classes are not returned
static members include fields methods events and properties

1979389
jsf	wicket	tapestry	wicket
for high traffic sites i d use a framework that doesn t manage client state on the server - wicket jsf and tapestry are managing client state on the server
i d only use those frameworks wicket is my favourite if the application should be more like a desktop application

1979395
onclick	onsubmit
to form element c use the submit procedure form action ... method get no onclick event the browser will be happy and you can control the submit in the onsubmit event you can cancel it or not
means put a button in the page and do whatever the onclick event says

1980006
webclient	httpwebrequest
of course if you want to download the resource if it exists it would most likely be more efficient to send a get request instead by not setting the method property to head or by using the webclient class
if you re attempting to verify the existence of a web resource i would recommend using the httpwebrequest class

1980138
xdebug	xhprof
i suggest not using xdebug on live site and if needed configuring it to activate on demand through trigger as described in docs
as bender said xhprof 1 2 is much lighter then xdebug and i prefer it for taking profiling info about the live site

1981029
margin	height
also i noticed after i removed that issues with margin and padding on the body tag
finally the border-top on the .footer makes the height of the footer 46px not 45px.

1981078
bazaar	git
bazaar get is alias of bazaar branch which is roughly equivalent of git clone
in the case of bazaar checkout you should not use bazaar pull but should use bazaar update instead

1981192
bazaar	svn
if you change your mind later and want it to behave more like svn you can do a bazaar bind and any commits you make will automatically be committed to the parent branch
basically you have the option of not being tied to the branch you got the code from if you want a standalone copy use bazaar get if you want to be automatically bound to the original branch use bazaar checkout

1983391
int	chars
c89 436 chars original source 75 lines 1074 chars compressed source with line breaks added for your sanity note that this solution assumes 4-byte int
if int are not 4 bytes on your system replace the 4 in the call to memcmp with your integer size

1983719
post	put
x being the number of comments for that post
i m a little rusty with wordpress templates so i m not 100 sure where you would put all of that

1984399
memcheck	callgrind
i have not tried opening output of cachegrind but it should work i guess. from the valkyrie page as of date currently valkyrie supports memcheck only although work is in progress to handle cachegrind and massif.
it seems that wincachegrind cannot open output of callgrind

1985606
content-disposition	content-type
firstly if you re just embedding the video on a web page you do not need the content-disposition header so just remove that line
secondly can you please show us which content-type values you are using for each video type

1985919
gridview	rowdatabound
if this isn t feasible in your case you can undo the html encoding for these cells on the gridview s rowdatabound event
i m assuming from your example that your gridview has 2 columns and the image column is the second one hence cells 1 in each row

1986486
disk	ram
they can be paged to disk or in the standby page list no longer in use but not paged yet either
working set refers to the total physical memory ram used by the process

1987240
nsurl	nsstring
you are passing the nsurl object as the title argument to the uialertview initializer
the title argument expects an nsstring which you clearly are not passing to it

1987465
decimal	ieee
however money and decimal are
ieee 754 and related floating point numbers cannot accurately represent many decimal values

1988044
cassini	iis
there is nothing wrong with cassini
it s simple webserver but it s not the only alternative to iis

1989066
pseudo-class	visited
the pseudo-class link and visited are only for links a elements with an href attribute the link pseudo-class applies for links that have not yet been visited
the visited pseudo-class applies once the link has been visited by the user

1989104
unix	solaris
see the docs for tzset they clearly say availability unix
so you would have it in say macosx solaris or linux but not on windows

1989291
datamapper	activerecord
this is one of the reasons that ruby-on-rails upcoming move to merb has been generally seen as a positive move for ruby-on-rails as merb makes use of the datamapper pattern in addition to activerecord
i m not sure demeter is the primary concern with activerecord

1989455
gif	png
png gif
the gif image format does not support alpha transparency

1989492
gif	png
as other posters have pointed out gif doesn t support alpha transparency--but a single color in the gif can be set as fully-transparent
you could convert the png to a 256-color paletted bitmap and replace any fully-transparent a 255 to colors.transparent and then save the new image as a gif

1989821
postgresql	mysql
also outside the standard postgresql has many peculiar data types including user-defined types and multi-dimensional arrays mysql has unsigned integers
i would say that two of the largest differences are with queries and window functions -- standard sql features from the sql-99 standard that are also available in other major sql implementations such as oracle db2 sql server ... but not in mysql

1989833
floating-point	integer
because 30.6 is not exactly representable in ieee 754 floating-point the precise results you get will not be exactly correct
so you might get slightly less than 5.0 before casting to an integer and then the integer cast rounds down to 4

1989971
super	implements
if you re ok with changing all the run implementations and calling run instead of run_all in d this works note that i don t use super in the root class -- it knows there s no further superclass to go up to object does not define a run method
unfortunately in python 2 this is inevitably verbose and not well suited to implements via a decorator either

1990160
filesystems	xfs
the problem is that your write performance is going to depend heavily on at least four things which filesystems you re using what disk-scheduling algorithm the kernel is using the hardware characteristics of your disk the hardware interconnect you re using for example usb is slower than ide which is slower than sata
it wouldn t surprise me if xfs were much faster than ext2 for writing many small files

1990914
jndi	jta
so this should be more or less your minimal persistence.xml file in java ee environments the jta-data-source and non-jta-data-source elements are used to specify the global jndi name of the jta and or non-jta data source to be used by the persistence provider
so if your target application server supports jta jboss websphere glassfish your persistence.xml looks like if your target application server does not support jta tomcat your persistence.xml looks like if your data source is not bound to a global jndi for instance outside a java ee container so you would usually define jpa provider driver url user and password properties

1991116
nunit	mstest
you can just create a class library add a reference to nunit and mark your tests with the corresponding attribute
the wizards are only for mstest and even then not required

1991849
filtering	grouping
the map contains only the positions which must be assigned this day. after the filtering you must look up the grouping and delete any positions on the map which cannot be assigned this day
your grouping description is a bit unclear

1991849
put	get
assign you choose the position to assign get list of members which can fill the position remove available members from list and put them into the priorityqueue assign the position by extract from priorityqueue correct assignment is done automaticially
each member which is assigned will gets its value increased by one so the decrease and increase levels out if you are here and working . if you are here and not assigned to a position for whatever reason you get a small penalty of one

1992567
hex	binary
some examples of outputting an integer as hex
integers in .net are not stored as decimal they are stored as binary in two s complement representation

1992574
innodb	myisam
the same won t happen on other storage engines in mysql such as innodb
but really you want to be using innodb and not myisam in most cases for a variety of other reasons

1993708
hash	md5
md5 is relatively fast but if you can t afford full-text comparisons on hash collisions you should probably use a stronger hash like sha-256
md5 has known vulnerabilities at this point but that may not be a problem for your application

1993748
hash	md5
what you are talking about is a checksum which is related to but not the same as a cryptographic hash
yes both md5 and even crc work just fine as checksums as long as you are not concerned with a malicious user intentionally crafting two different files with the same checksum

1994459
super	self
usually we ll write because super s initialization method might return an object that s not the same as the one that was allocated
so that s why we use self in initxxx method and we don t need to use self in other kinds of methods

1994487
accessor	properties
you can restructure the code to solve this problem one final note the symmetry between an event and a properties is a bit lost the c# compiler automatically generates the add remove accessor if you don t write them explicitly
it doesn t do this for a properties

1994601
qtabwidget	qwidget
if your requirement is such that you do not want to close the tab widget when the application is running then the following is applicable --- you wrote the problem here is i want to catch the minimize and close event of qtabwidget by default this widget do not have any slot named close or minimize to hide the widget .. qtabwidget inherits qwidget and qwidget implements close
so in a class that inherits qtabwidget you can reimplement the method closeevent to capture the close event in your code you can try this the above code will make sure that widget will be closed only when the exit button in system tray is clicked and x button of the tab widget won t close hide that widget

1995378
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
in this case you need to work on a case-sensitive file system or you will need to edit the repository to ensure that no collisions of this sort occur
a case-insensitive file system simply cannot store the contents of this repository

1995475
addeventlistener	onload
well first the library iwebkit you are using is doing a bad thing by taking the entire onload event to itself instead of using the proper addeventlistener function to attach itself to the onload function
onload is the proper place to put it but here is how you will need to call the popup on page load add this after the line if that doesn t work it might be because both your function and their onload stuff is running at the same time

1995699
salt	md5
when it comes to security it s not really an issue of how strong your salt is it s an issue of how computationally expensive the hashing function is
sha1 and md5 are cheap

1996062
accessor	properties
it s probably not a problem since it is in your dealloc method but if you re going to use a properties accessor you should leave the retain and release to it
if you had that line in any other place you d cause a exc_bad_access later if the mailbutton properties was reassigned

1996581
sharepoint	spsite
this is not just an iis problem but sharepoint related as well
a lot of referencing in sharepoint is done by using a url as a starting point just look at the constructor of spsite

1996811
hash	salt
the whole point of salting is that the same password does not always result in the same encrypted hash string
if you make the salt dependent on just the password the same password will always result in the same hash

1996972
strncmp	strncpy
your strncmp for example just implements the wrong algorithm it s not the case that a shorter string is always less than a longer one z is not less than aa -- so you can t start by comparing the lengths only
your strncpy is checking where it should be checking instead among other issues

1998373
udp	tcp
in case of udp packets will be lost
with tcp this cannot happen

1998575
maven	pom.xml
from my experience and maven best practices there are two kinds of parent poms company parent pom.xml - this pom.xml contains your company specific information and configuration that inherit every pom.xml and doesn t need to be copied
these informations are repositories distribution managment sections common plugins configurations like maven-compiler-plugin source and target versions organization developers etc preparing this parent pom.xml need to be done with caution because all your company poms will inherit from it so this pom.xml have to be mature and stable releasing a version of parent pom.xml should not affect to release all your company projects

1998575
maven	pom.xml
i prefer your first solution - this is a default maven convention for multi module projects very often represents vcs code structure the intention is to be scalable to a large scale build so should be scalable to a large number of projects and artifacts
mutliprojects have structure of trees - so you aren t arrown down to one level of parent pom.xml

1999033
windows	wow64
if the process is a 64-bit application running under 64-bit windows the value is also set to false
if you know you are running on 64-bit windows then if it a process is running in wow64 mode then it must be 32-bit that is what wow64 is for - running 32-bit applications on 64-bit windows if not then you can assume 64-bit

1999033
windows	wow64
if you know you are running on 64-bit windows then if it a process is running in wow64 mode then it must be 32-bit that is what wow64 is for - running 32-bit applications on 64-bit windows if not then you can assume 64-bit
from msdn wow64 is the x86 emulator that allows 32-bit windows-based applications to run seamlessly on 64-bit windows

1999956
entity-relationship	entities
the entity-relationship model is useful for conceptualizing a schema and understanding the requirements but it should not be confused with a database design
the tables that represent entities from an entity-relationship model should have a smiple pk

2000456
ienumerable	ilist
ienumerable does not allow indexed access to the collection whereas ilist does
thus ilist is more than ienumerable and you won t be able to get away with it

2000456
ienumerable	ilist
if you need to go from ienumerable to ilist you may try a cast first if you get lucky it will work
if not you ll have to foreach over the ienumerable collection and build a new ilist

2001615
put	get
if you re using json to pass data remotely then i would say it is bad practice to put methods in the json because you may not have modeled your client-server interaction well
and further when wishing to use json as a data description language i would say you could get yourself into trouble by embedding methods because some json parsers were written with only data description in mind and may not support method definitions in the structure

2001833
post	put
post should be used for creating new ones
api users when called with put creates user record doesn t feel right to me

2002092
post	put
of course you can include this uri in the response on post to users too
using put will ensure your request is idempotent it can safely be sent again if the client isn t sure about success

2002223
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
this may not be the core problem but i don t think you want to wrap stream in an objectoutputstream since that is used for object serialization
it could be that it is adding extra data to the file so it can be deserialized with objectinputstream

2002304
maven	pom.xml
if the answer is yes and this is the case of most projects that have been mentioned in the question or in comments then the parent pom.xml needs his own module from a vcs and from a maven point of view and you ll end up with something like this at the vcs level root |-- parent-pom | |-- branches | |-- tags | -- trunk | -- pom.xml -- projecta |-- branches |-- tags -- trunk |-- module1 | -- pom.xml |-- modulen | -- pom.xml -- pom.xml this makes the checkout a bit painful and a common way to deal with that is to use svn externals
for example add a trunks directory root |-- parent-pom | |-- branches | |-- tags | -- trunk | -- pom.xml |-- projecta | |-- branches | |-- tags | -- trunk | |-- module1 | | -- pom.xml | |-- modulen | | -- pom.xml | -- pom.xml -- trunks with the following externals definition parent-pom projecta a checkout of trunks would then result in the following local structure pattern #2 root parent-pom pom.xml projecta optionally you can even add a pom.xml in the trunks directory root |-- parent-pom | |-- branches | |-- tags | -- trunk | -- pom.xml |-- projecta | |-- branches | |-- tags | -- trunk | |-- module1 | | -- pom.xml | |-- modulen | | -- pom.xml | -- pom.xml -- trunks -- pom.xml this pom.xml is a kind of fake pom.xml it is never released it doesn t contain a real version since this file is never released it only contains a list of modules

2002565
implements	sealed
based on that thought you can subclass toolstripbutton or desired type to have bindings and implements ibindablecomponent for it
this works for all kinds of source and target types as long as they re not sealed

2002620
struts	stripes
reason i am asking is i am looking at a web application and they seem to be using both spring and struts
using struts 2 or stripes doesn t exclude using spring for dependency injection and other services

2002740
inherited	properties
if myapp.pluginsconfiguration is a configurationsection then you can define a new class that inherited from configurationelementcollection and make the new class a configurationproperty of myapp.pluginsconfiguration check this article for some in-depth info about those types
i also blogged about having nested properties but not specifically for collections

2003499
innodb	myisam
for example innodb stores multiple tables in its tablespace and the data file timestamp does not apply
for myisam the data file timestamp is used

2003782
int	double
if you want to get a 32-bit ieee754 representation of a single-precision value in a number which remember is not an int either
the only number type you get in javascript is double you will have to make it yourself by fiddling the sign exponent and mantissa bits together

2003793
hash	md5
it s a message digest secure hash algorithm
md5 isn t really symmetric or asymmetric encryption because it isn t reversible either symmetrically or asymmetrically

2004900
inherited	properties
if you use that constructor and then call something like keyset inherited from its hashtable superclass you ll get an empty set because the map methods of properties do not take account of the default properties object that you passed into the constructor
the defaults are only recognised if you use the methods defined in properties itself such as getproperty and propertynames among others

2005181
udp	tcp
the dangerous part of udp is that unlike tcp ip it doesn t do any handshake
effectively this means that an attack app could be built that floods a local network with udp packets

2005181
icmp	udp
the external server doesn t have to send anything at all back only nice boxes will send back icmp errors
i also imagine there could be some pretty creative ways to overwhelm a firewall that supports udp traversal

2005516
implements	extends
of course you you can specialize once you have these types but this has to be done by someone who implements these types
2 do not provide default one and specialize for basic types it s not ideal too depends on how many basic types you expect to use 3 use isderivedfrom trick calling test outputs as i understand that s your goal extends it to work with more types like wrap is possible but messy too but it does the trick - you don t need to do a bunch of specializations

2005786
vb.net	vb6
vb6 created the .exe in the same directory as the project vb.net doesn t
vb6 s app.path really does do the same thing as application.executablepath it is just that the .exe is written to a different directory

2006580
int	chars
this will handle high surrogate chars that cannot be represented by a single int within the range that a chars can represent
in the example you ve given this is not strictly necessary - if the unicode chars can fit inside a single java chars such as the registered local variable then it must fall within the u0000 to uffff range and you won t need to worry about surrogate pairs

2006682
spweb	spsite
found a solution myself the trick i did not know is that if you use a long url in the constructor of the spsite it gives you the spweb object with the deepest possible address that matches your url described here still i have to loop through all the lists to find out which list has the required url
a simple function that does what i need update 2012-08-01 no need to loop through list collection there is a getlist method in spweb object

2006820
inherited	properties
listener doesn t inherited the values it can get a reference to the object that dispatched the event using the event.target properties or a reference to the object with which the event listener was registered using the event.currenttarget properties
so basically you can access the public properties of the object that dispatched event using the reference obtained from target currenttarget properties of the event

2008353
punctuation	words
a valid name in javascript must start with a unicode letter dollar sign or underscore then can contain any of those characters as well as numbers combining diacritical accent characters and various joiner punctuation and zero-width spaces
additionally it cannot be a words reserved by the javascript language abstract as boolean break byte case etc

2008613
client-side	server-side
you cannot access it from client-side code javascript
the repeater and the dataitem s are server-side control which is available from the code-behind of your pages controls

2009332
int	chars
in the second 3-line version the assignment isn t allowed because the int variable could take any value from -2147483648 to 2147483647 inclusive most of which are out of range for the chars variable to contain
because in java chars is an integral data type whose values are 16-bit unsigned integers representing utf-16 code units

2009535
firefox	safari
update you can see your code working here if you visit the page in firefox 3.5
known bug this does not work in safari 4 but it has been fixed in the yet unreleased at the time of this writing 1.8 version of jquery ui

2010790
try-catch	exception-handling
the basic construct you want is if you find yourself writing this sequence a lot then wrap it in a helper method and call that instead of littering your code with spurious try-catch blocks
bear in mind that elementnotfoundexception is not a checked exception-handling so you could ignore it

dictionary	map
however you can iterate over the dictionary noting which keys map to the desired value obviously this is not efficient for large dictionary though
yes the dictionary is basically a one way street

2010813
dictionary	map
dictionary do not work like this nor are they intended to
how would you resolve the following you could do this but if you really need to go back and forth between keys and values you should consider encapsulating the problem into a two-way map

2010896
initializer	class-method
from the php documenation this will not initializer the class and will allow you to get an array of all of the classes methods
i m not completely certain that this won t return parent class-method but get_class_methods will work for uninstantiated classes

2011899
put	get
indeed put an exit or a die afer the header
it is quite easy not to follow the header redirection and to get what is executed aferwise

2012554
multiplying	multiplication
execution time is not used to multiplying those values
instead multiplication is done at compile time

2012976
udp	tcp
but for handling udp broadcasts you should have a look at jgroups jgroups is a toolkit for reliable multicast communication
note that this doesn t necessarily mean ip multicast jgroups can also use transports such as tcp

2013530
superclass	subclassing
you need to specify something like this the trick here is that since you specify a constructor for the superclass the compiler doesn t create a no-arg constructor for you
when you make your zero-arg constructor in the superclass it tries to call the no-arg constructor in the subclassing and fails to find anything

2013530
superclass	subclassing
when you make your zero-arg constructor in the superclass it tries to call the no-arg constructor in the subclassing and fails to find anything
in short calling another constructor either in the superclass or in the same class in your constructor is not optional

2014241
apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx
even with the most lightweight apache however the cost is about 2-3mb per worker so with apache alone you might be talking 3gb+ of memory just to handle the connections not to mention other possibly limited os resources like process ids file descriptors and buffers and this is before considering your application code
for lighttpd nginx they can handle a large number of connections thousands in a tiny memory footprint often just a few megs per thousand connections depends on factors like buffers and how async io apis are set up

2014241
apache	nginx
for a production deployment we have been very happy with nginx in front of apache with mod_wsgi in this instance
the apache does not do any access logging nor does it handle static files allowing us to disable a large number of the modules inside apache to keep it small footprint

2014928
int	boolean
nsnumber objects are also used to represent and persist boolean as well as int and floats but not currency in core data
you can convert a boolean to an nsnumber using the convenience constructor class method numberwithbool

2015090
int	boolean
the values 1 and 0 are of type int and are not implicitly convertible to boolean
java unlike languages like c and c++ treats boolean as a completely separate data type which has 2 distinct values true and false

2015092
int	boolean
using int weakens type-checking an int value besides 1 or 0 could be passed in and the compiler couldn t guard against it
because the people who created java wanted boolean to mean unambiguously true or false not 1 or 0

2015409
post	get
post data can not be added in the address bar
you should always check sanitize all data you get in your php code because anyone could post data to all of your pages

2015485
post	get
no it is not possible to post data from the address bar
you can only initiate get requests from there by adding params to the url

2015780
websphere	ibm
see the websphere example below
this still applies even after the big update above. and is there an unofficial version table jdk 1.4 goes well with j2ee 1.3 jdk 1.5 goes well with j2ee 1.4 jdk 1.6 with java ee 5 and so on as i said above goes well doesn t really makes sense as this depends on the container you are using and containers might have different compatibility requirements for example ibm websphere s j2ee 1.4 server may not work with jdk 5

2015838
glassfish	geronimo
jdk 6 with java ee 6 currently only available from the java ee page the java se page still has jdk 6 with java ee 5 note that these download packages actually include sun s version of java ee glassfish these days which is different than apache s version of java ee tomcat geronimo or ibm s version of java ee websphere
if you choose not to use glassfish you can download just jdk6 and one of the other java ee packages

2016745
dictionary	map
dictionary can t be used as keys because they re not hashable
this doesn t make any less meaningful practical necessary to map dictionary to other objects

2016745
dictionary	map
this doesn t make any less meaningful practical necessary to map dictionary to other objects
as i understand the python binding system you can bind any dictionary to a number of variables or the reverse depends on your terminology which means that these variables all know the same unique pointer to that dictionary

2017193
client-side	server-side
why this works you do not start the timer before they see the quiz the network delay is factored in because the timer does not start until the ajax request comes in if they have a slow connection the ajax request will be slow ping is not spoofable because you make sure the session variable does not exist before storing edit i wanted to add that you could continue to keep client-side time and include it in the final post
then you can compare it with your server-side calculated time

2017724
implements	modifiers
1.6.7.6 of the spec says 1.6.7.6 destructors a destructor is a member that implements the actions required to destruct an instance of a class
destructors cannot have parameters they cannot have accessibility modifiers and they cannot be invoked explicitly

2017832
width	margin
for those on mobile browsers with a tiny 360px or smaller width they will simply get the biggest possible size for your container that fits in their screen size but then your inside layout will have to scale gracefully too. also of note is that max-width does not work on ie6
margin 0 auto

2018092
post	get
initial thoughts before solution created use post for large data instead of get
with post no querystring will be used for data and therefore url length restriction isn t a concern

2018943
jar	manifest.mf
an executable jar has a main class defined in the jar s manifest.mf file and the manifest also allows the definition of a class path to include libraries that the code in the executable jar will need
the class path definition in the manifest must enumerate every jar or folder to put on the class path relative paths are relative to the location of the executable jar - not to paths contained inside the executable jar

2018943
jar	manifest.mf
any libraries your code needs is placed as jar files in the final jar s lib folder
and last but not least the final jar s manifest.mf file tells one-jar what your main class is

2019103
put	get
nservicebus runs all handlers in a transactionscope that means that if your code throws an exception the message will be put back in the queue and retried later
so you shouldn t worry about catching any exceptions managing how messages get removed from the queue nsb takes care of that for you

2020498
versioning	upgrade
if you want to get rid of the warning you have different possibilities upgrade to a newer versioning of python
recommended but might not be possible if your production systems are not upgrade also

2021306
inline	inlining	inline-functions	inlining
one way to find out if the function is inline is to use -winline gcc option -winline warn if a function can not be inline and it was declared as inline. even with this option the compiler will not warn about failures to inline-functions declared in system headers. the compiler uses a variety of heuristics to determine whether or not to inline a function
for example the compiler takes into account the size of the function being inline and the amount of inlining that has already been done in the current function

2021476
rss	feed
your main problem here is that the xml node path on this line is only valid for rss feed not atom feed
one way i ve got over this in the past is to use a simple function to convert an atom feed into an rss feed

2021476
rss	feed
one way i ve got over this in the past is to use a simple function to convert an atom feed into an rss feed
of course you could go the other way or not convert at all however converting to a single format enables you to write one generic chunk of code that will pull out the various elements of a feed s items that you may be interested in date title etc. there is an atom to rss converter article on code project that provides such a conversion however that is in c#

2021551
children	parent
i think you may not be assigning to a parent s children properly
accepts_nested_attributes_for as used in your question creates a child_attributes writer on the parent

2021600
opera	google-chrome
if it works in safari and opera you can t be too far off
i would suggest double-checking wherever you ve made browser checks - particularly making sure things you do for ie aren t getting applied to google-chrome

2021960
nant	cruisecontrol
it s probably not the account that nant is running under but the account that cruisecontrol is running under since it s the one executing that process
so i d check which account is running cruisecontrol

2022006
nfa	dfa
if you do not count the starting state then you can do the following construction create n nodes and for each set out of 2 n create a unique label and in the nfa add a transition with this label to each node of that set
this gives you a nfa with n+1 states 1 being the starting state where the dfa requires 2 n +1 states

2022050
folder	directory
you have two options require the assembly to be installed in the gac on the target machine in which case xcopy deployment is not possible or include all required assemblies in the bin folder either by copying them in or writing a post-build script that does so
you can find the .dll by using the command prompt and going to c windows assembly gac find the assembly you are interested in cd into that directory and then cd into the directory with the version you are interested in

2022410
realloc	malloc
it is possible to realloc a non null malloc 0 pointer
having a malloc 0 verbatim is not much use though

2022777
set-cover	np-complete
if you combine the words with a dash like in your example and the words in a2 do not contain dashes then it s a just set-cover in disguise an np-complete optimization problem
you can then solve the problem using any solution strategy available for set-cover

2022942
public	protected
if setconnection is to be protected connection will have to be public
if the class connection is internal a class deriving accessor won t be able to call protected setconnection since it doesn t have access to connection

2023448
udp	tcp
uhh jason tcp does not use udp
tcp uses ip which is why you often see it referred to as tcp ip

2023757
for-loop	loops
seems like a for-loop would work better for you where you could actually use the standard read iteration operator
it doesn t look like you want to shortcut loops at all

2023781
integer	unsigned
an unsigned integer cannot be negative which offers some sanity protection on index values
among other things it becomes easier to sort out accidental integer overflow underflow

2023863
maven	pom.xml
therefore it doesn t contain hibernate 3.5 which is beta as well as it hadn t contained spring 3 until it was released by the way you don t need to specify special spring repository for spring 3 any more - release is already in maven central slf4j is a very special kind of dependency - its runtime behavior depends on which implementation of slf4j you use
therefore to control its behavior you have to specify slf4j implementation explicitly about management skills to get useful information for maintaining your pom.xml you can use mvn dependency tree especially with and mvn dependency analyze

2024372
queue	fifo
since disabling interrupts is like owning a lock in this context you could implement the queue as contiguous memory or ontop of a slist
the former means copying out the memory to the stack of the main-loop on pop which might be slower -- however provided your fifo has enough memory you should not have to allocate slist nodes from a heap -- which means no memory management headaches

2024701
superclass	subclassing
you re adding a new method in a subclassing which does not exist in the superclass
there is no way to call the new method in the subclassing using a reference to the superclass

2025113
ssl	https
therefore if you have ssl enabled for the webserver simply adding https to the url will encrypt the connection and whatever page the url points to will be encrypted while in transit
so is encrypted and is not encrypted i prefer for that to never happen so i always put my encrypted pages in a subdomain eg. ssl comes with a couple of gotcha s 1 a basic ssl certificate will only be valid for a specific domain name so if the certificate for is www.website.com and someone follows a link for website.com a warning will be displayed

2025182
jsf	stripes	jsf	wicket
personally i m a jsf 1.x skeptic so i would not go in this direction there isn t lots of demand for jsf in my country anyway but rather choose an alternative
i think that struts 2 spring mvc stripes this one is my preferred one wicket this one is getting more and more attention are all decent choices they ll all get the job done the 2 first one being i believe more asked on the job market but not the smartest

2025423
one-definition-rule	inlining
you are running into the one-definition-rule
you are not seeing any error because some violations particularly those that span translation units are not required to be diagnosed what going on under the covers is that the compiler is not inlining those functions many compilers will not inline a function unless the code is compiled with the optimizer

2025423
inline	inlining
you are not seeing any error because some violations particularly those that span translation units are not required to be diagnosed what going on under the covers is that the compiler is not inlining those functions many compilers will not inline a function unless the code is compiled with the optimizer
since the function is inline and can appear in multiple translation units the compiler will mark the function as link-once which tells the linker that it not treat multiple definitions as an error but just use one of them

2026688
uiview	subviews
create a uiview containing a date picker and a toolbar with a done button on it
in code or use interface builder doesn t matter. add the popup view as a subviews of your main view

2027842
division	subtraction
gcd can of course be done much faster if you use division rather than subtraction o n 2
so when we say that testing primality was proved in 2002 to be done in polynomial time that s the technical definition of complexity and we mean polynomial in the number of digits which is the tricky part not polynomial in the input number itself which is trivially easy to do in sub-linear time using trial division

2027842
division	subtraction
again this is not ambiguous once you know what the terms of reference are but beware of incorrectly comparing the first analysis i gave of euclid s algorithm with division o n 2 against this analysis of the algorithm with subtraction o n
n is not the same in each and subtraction is not faster

2027872
google-chrome	safari
for example i have noticed that onclick attribute doesn t work in google-chrome when onclick is typed
safari nor google-chrome doesn t respect some attributes

2028244
folder	directory
we also know that 64bit release build s target folder would have the longest pathname of any of our configurations
we have shortened the path by renaming our top level directory under which our source tree is checked out and the problem looks to have gone away - obviously we will repeat this a few times to make sure it isn t a fluke

2028368
subclass	inherited
its not going to work in .net 3.5 and below - subclass is not of type for any t its only of type
and the generic classes do not follow the inherited of their template type is not a subclass of - they are completely different classes in c#

2028408
factors	mean
these factors are sometimes mutually exclusive in terms of standard definitions of efficiency one would often utilize big-0 notation however in the real world outside academia normally one would profiling benchmarking both equations and then compare the results it s often difficult to make general assumptions about big-0 notation as this is primarily concerned with looping and assumes a fixed cost for the code within a loop so benchmarking would be the better way to go one caveat to watch out for is that sometimes the result can vary significantly based on the dataset size you re working with - for small n in a loop one will sometimes not find much difference
firstly one would need to define what more efficient means does it mean quicker uses less system resources such as memory etc.

2028530
rss	feed
so we created our own customised rss feed.
its not the most elaborate of things and is customised to our liking you can mix the fields around in print_item to change the look of the feed

2029368
abstract-class	superclass
but you cannot instantiate the superclass since it is an abstract-class
just adding to what has been already answered for the 2nd question for java as mentioned in other answer by balusc if your superclass tells that it implements an interface and doesn t provide implementation of method s in the interface then you have to mark the superclass as an abstract-class

2029496
nhibernate	automapper
you can keep the interfaces but mapped properties and collections must use the concrete types of which nhibernate knows
it s not a restriction imposed by fluent or its automapper but by nhibernate itself

b interpolation if you have a function where some points but not the whole curve

superclass	subclassing
imagine that a superclass a has two subclassing b and c
we say that the inheritance relationship between a b and c is disjoint when a instances cannot be at the same time b instances and c instances instances of a supertype only appear at most in a subclassing

2030586
subclass	inherited
class in turn is a subclass of module although arguably it shouldn t be because it violates the liskov substition principle but that is a discussion for another forum and is also a dead horse that has already been beaten many many times
and in you will find the definition you are looking for which class inherited from module and instances of class like integer understand

2030761
post	get
that s not a hard and fast rule however and you should take steps to prevent csrf even when accepting post
in some instances accepting a get rather than a post could make you more subject to a csrf attack

2030775
post	get	put	get
this allows user agents to represent other methods such as post put and delete in a special way so that the user is made aware of the fact that a possibly unsafe action is being requested
naturally it is not possible to ensure that the server does not generate side-effects as a result of performing a get request

2031196
post	get
if a get works for you use that don t just switch to post it isn t buying you anything unless of course you re using ssl for the post then it d be more secure
the proper syntax is to use .post and change the return type 4th param to json as per the docs for .post not quote sure the post data is how you want it formatted but i hope you get the idea

2031379
post	get
if someone has a reason to only get the post get the variables are still there
i think everyone s missing the point of your question or maybe i m just misunderstanding it. you re not asking the difference between get post you re wondering if its a good or bad idea for the framework that you re building to automatically merge the results of these two together into one safe variable

2031456
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
unchecked-exception -- runtimeexception and subclasses -- are not declared and may be thrown by any method
that said if your method commonly throws an unchecked-exception it s a good idea to document that fact in javadoc

2031555
allocator	stl
with stl containers you can provide your own allocator via an optional template parameter
i wouldn t recommend writing an entire allocator from scratch but you could write one that s just a wrapper around new and delete but ensures that the returned memory meets your alignment requirement

2031917
int	boolean	int	chars	int	double
you had primitives int chars byte boolean float double long and the rest in the java world were classes including the corresponging wrappers int chars byte booelan float double long
the core data structures of java worked with objects so if you needed to store numbers into a list you had to wrap your value the wrappers are just regular classes that hold a primitive type for instance this may be my own int wrapper nothing fancy that s in general terms how the wrapper classes are implemented of course there are a lot of utility methods there so again if you wanted to use it in a list which only holds objects you ll have to calling list.add 1024 directly wasn t possible because 1024 is an int literal not an object

2032605
post	get
the reason there are two inputs is that checkboxes that are unchecked post no value at all
that means asp.net mvc can t tell the difference between this wasn t posted at all as opposed to this was posted but it was not checked. by having two inputs asp.net mvc is guaranteed to always get at least one input

2032769
integer	unsigned
when compiled on my mac intel little-endian the output is integer value 2249459722 integer value 0x8614080a dotted decimal 10.8.20.134 when compiled on my sun sparc big-endian the output is integer value 2249459722 integer value 0x8614080a dotted decimal 134.20.8.10 using gcc 4.4.2 on the sparc i get a warning xx.c 4 warning this decimal constant is unsigned only in iso c90 using gcc 4.2.1 on mac - with lots of warnings enabled - i don t get that warning which is interesting. i can remove that by adding a u suffix to the integer constant
another way of looking at the problems is illustrated with the following code and the extremely fussy compiler settings shown above this fails to compile because of the -werror setting with the message remove the -werror setting and it compiles but then shows the next problem that you have - the one of not checking for error indications from functions that can fail direct operations integer value 2249459722 integer value 0x8614080a dotted decimal 10.8.20.134 indirect operations conversion failed for 2249459722 basically the sscanf function reports that it failed to convert the string to a signed integer because the value is too large to fit - see the warning from gcc 4.4.2 but your code was not checking for the error return from sscanf so you were using whatever value happened to be left in c at the time

2032794
int	double
int is not one of those types one definition of mean ought to cover all of and but without the rational bits and without the type annotation the type inferred for mean is because of the division by the length of the list
it turns out that int float and double are instances of the typeclass real and any real may be converted to rational and rational may be converted to fractional finally for large lists there s also a chance that we could overflow a machine double but rational gives us arbitrary precision

2032889
pull	push
but if you need git hooks on the git side i would recommend setting up an intermediate bare git repository bare for easy push pull
not about svn but just here to detail a similar setup of an extra repo if the intermediate repo validate your push it could trigger the git svn dcommit

2033156
int	double
until a better solution comes along you could roll your own conversion like this to convert a bignum to an int you could then think of something like this but this is rather dangerous it ll overflow quite easily
a better version of numtoint would be to convert to a double first and then convert to int still both conversions aren t ideal for numerators denominators of more than 308 digits which will still overflow a double while the fractions itself could be small

2034228
int	chars
if we can use int type instead of chars type why do we decide to use one over the other at certain times
if you wanted an integer value that took up less space you could use a short int which i believe is 2 bytes or if you were really concerned with memory usage you could use a chars though mostly this is not necessary

2034270
interpreted-language	dynamic-languages

uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i did not want any of the uiviewcontroller included in the more tab to rotate
my solution was to create my own uitabbarcontroller which i called mytabbarcontroller then i implemented the shouldautorotatetointerfaceorientation method i needed to discover if the more tab was selected

2034888
int	double
not now and not for value-types such as int double in 4.0
simply f_int doesn t return a double

2035266
disk	ram
what would make this scheme sort of manageable from performance point is that for this purpose java nio has bytebuffer which is a high level representation of low level byte mapping on disk
not directly helpful and will be interesting at least to develop but you could throw in an ssd ram drive accessible to both the java and c++ application and have a sort of juggle between data ops in there with file-based locking and all that odd stuff

2035852
lisp	scheme
it is relatively common in the lisp community
some university classes will use scheme to write a language subset this is not a compiler class activity

2035917
ssl	https
serving static content on a cloud like amazon is an option and some of the cloud providers let you use https as well as long as you are fine with using a subdomain of their domain name due to technical limitations in ssl
while serving pages over http may be faster though i doubt https is not monstrously slow for small files a good lot of browsers will complain if included resources such as images and js are not on https url s

2036160
versioning	upgrade
h2 is stored on the file system but it would be better to use the backup tools that you reference because the file format can change between versioning of h2
if you upgrade h2 it may not any longer be able to read the files it created in a previous version

2036205
cpu	processors
the optimization comes from the fact that the cpu doesn t have to waste cycles realigning data padding the leading bits on a read and doing a read-modify-write on a write
truth is a lot of processors such as recent x86s have hardware in the cpu that optimizes these access pretty well at least the padding and read-modify-write parts since they re so common and usually only involve transfers between the processors and cache

2036314
hide	show
that should give you access to .show hide helpers... also why use the divs
it looks to me like all your show hide links are calling the same function show_details etc which show hides all posts because of the loop not specific ones

2037074
multiplying	add
usually you want to multiplying them gl_texture_env_mode gl_modulate rather than gl_combine
also you did not set the source0_alpha and source1_alpha so i m not sure what exactly you add to generate the stage 1 alpha output

2037163
post	get
see this msdn forum post textbox baseline here s a method i wrote that extracts that value
it uses reflection to get the relevant properties because they are not common to any single base class they are defined separately on control textblock page textelement and maybe others

typedef	struct
abuse c++ automatic typedef s note that the struct needs to be declared in an inner scope so that it takes precedence over the outer name in c++. a similar version that doesn t rely on the ambiguity between sizeof type and sizeof variable using only types 2
abuse c++ struct class equivalence automatic typedef s and automatically-generated default constructors 3

2038541
typedef	typename
you forgot typedef
the typename just says that you are going to use a typename that at the point of the template declaration is not yet known as a type

2039346
jobs	cron
i d suggest having some kind of persistence mechanism like a jobs table job id started_by status not started running complete started_when completed_when
and rather than firing off such jobs as an exec have a cron job that looks for jobs that need to be started and start them

see this just use a basic for-loop for arrays iteration
for..in is not meant for arrays iteration

2040103
x86	64bit
if you mark you c# program as x86 and not any cpu then it will see hkey_local_machine software wow6432node app as hkey_local_machine software app
a .net program for any cpu will run as a 64bit process if 64bit .net is installed

plone	buildout
buildout works just fine with plone 3.1.2
i ve also done buildouts for plone 2.5.5 and even one for plone 2.1 although this last one was a bit tricky because the required python for that version doesn t do buildout

i ve also done buildouts for plone 2.5.5 and even one for plone 2.1 although this last one was a bit tricky because the required python for that version doesn t do buildout
so if you prefer the buildout route just do it

2042154
git-svn	svn2git
this is similar to so question cloning a non-standard svn repository with git-svn and i am not sure there is a process to fix the git repo after that initial clone
the deep clone is the official way but i like the encapsulation provided by svn2git

2042700
pop-up	dialog
if your dialog is a regular pop-up window it is not possible to prevent the user from closing the window
you could use a jquery modal dialog plugin such as jqmodal

2043101
hash	salt
since it is common practice to prepend the salt to the password hash the salt is generally known to an attacker
but this does not defeat the purpose of the salt

2043101
hash	salt
it is generally speaking not a a good idead to add the login username to the hash vinzz s solution as it will cause problems if the user changes his or her username
a better solution is to use a random salt

2043597
int	double
bonus strangeness due to a bug in the ms compiler never to be fixed - it would break backward compatibility it s actually various zero constants not just an int
so execute 0d and execute 0m will convert a double and a decimal to the enum too

2044274
floating-point	integer	integer	fractions
when you convert a floating-point value to integer type the fractions part is simply discarded not the nearest value is taken but the number is rounded towards zero
if the result does not fit into the target integer type the behavior is undefined

2044311
awt	swing
i have used both and i prefer swing over awt
also you do not need to learn awt to learn swing basics

2044538
x86	64bit
historically x86 has been very backward compatible
x86-64 has thrown away some very old instructions like bcd instructions but it s unlikely that these kind of changes are going to happen again at least not until something huge as 64bit address space transition happens

2044870
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox
here are where we stand so far test page firefox 2.0 -- pass grey 1px line firefox 3.0 -- fail firefox 3.5 -- pass shadow internet explorer 6.0 -- pass grey 1px line internet explorer 7.0 -- pass grey 1px line internet explorer 8.0 -- pass grey 1px line safari 3.0 -- pass shadow safari 4.0 -- pass shadow google-chrome 3.0 -- pass shadow opera 10 -- fail
this will not cover all scenarios and i think it fails in opera but i would do this test results apparently rgba was introduced in firefox 3.0 but -moz-box-shadow was introduced in 3.5

2044870
opera	firefox
this will not cover all scenarios and i think it fails in opera but i would do this test results apparently rgba was introduced in firefox 3.0 but -moz-box-shadow was introduced in 3.5
so firefox 3.0 fails the test

2045370
post	put
but as neil mentioned in his post any of these things results in undefined behavior so the code is not required at runtime to generate a seg fault
for the first example the compiler probably put the string in writable memory so there is no seg fault when trying to change it

2045870
int	double
assuming 32 bit int and ieee 32 bit floats it s possible for an int- float conversion to be imprecise
assuming also 64 bit ieee double it is not possible for an int- double conversion to be imprecise because all int values can be exactly represented as a double

2046095
google-chrome	firefox
here s a few links to get you going in the right direction google-chrome mozilla firefox i can t seem to find any for internet explorer i m sorry i cannot give you a definitive answer but hopefully this should get the ball rolling for you at least
the best solution would be to develop a plug-in for the browser used by your user whether it be for internet explorer firefox or google-chrome etc

2046179
magento	oscommerce
which is why the average site does not customize and why so many magento stores look so much alike
unlike magento oscommerce has and always will be intended as a core ecommerce solution on which you build you own unique ecommerce solution

2046585
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
uiviewcontroller by does not support push pop of view controllers
you need to replace your use of uiviewcontroller with a uinavigationcontroller

2046718
restrict	shared
if it s other users on the shared system then make sure you have directory permissions properly restrict to your user
if it s the shared hosting provider itself then there s not much you can do since obfuscation won t buy you all that much

2047089
button	checkbox
edit an asp.net button control has a commandargument property you could use to store this but it does not appear this is settable from the client side
first i would recommend that you reconsider why you re trying to discover which checkbox are selected on the client side and pass that as an argument to the form post

2047251
children	parent
what this means is that parent.children children will work the same as child.parents.add parent
i have not seen a way to do it exactly like nhibernate where you can apply attribute meta data directly to the parent class

2047252
inherited	properties
your class does not inherited from displayobject so the stage properties does not exist for your class
even if your class did inherited from displayobject it needs to be added to the stage via addchild from a parent display object

2047252
inherited	properties
even if your class did inherited from displayobject it needs to be added to the stage via addchild from a parent display object
if your class is not meant to be a display object but needs the stage object for measurements or other properties send it as an argument to the constructor

2048118
integer	fractions
so the image view may have an integer size but it s absolute frame when taking the parent s into consideration may not be
one thing i ve had before is blurred controls caused by fractions pixel offsets

2048467
inherited	properties
if the view inherited from then the model properties will be of type mydto
if the view is not strongly typed then the model properties is of type object so you would need to cast it

2049167
folder	directory
if you want the application folder use the application.startuppath property
yes it s normal and no the current directory is not always the application folder

2049167
folder	directory
yes it s normal and no the current directory is not always the application folder
run cmd and use the cd command to change the directory

2049361
aggregate-functions	sum
it does not shrink several records into one instead it returns the total value along with each record -- this is an aggregate-functions
it shrinks all records into one record and returns the total sum with q name number as select test1 0 union all select test2 22 union all select test3 28 select sum number from q -- 50 -- this is an analytical function

2049832
post	get
it is much more convenient to get the post details and use post_id of the post to find the comments belonging to the post
using one sql query is not very convenient since you have 1 post and multiple comments

2049962
addeventlistener	onload
use addeventlistener attachevent or a library that normalises them across browsers such as yui or jquery
i m too lazy but the nutshell is copy onload to another variable if onload if a function set it to a new function that runs the passed function then the old function if it isn t just make the passed function run onload window.onload func

2050605
put	get
but if you only ever put built-in types and tiny arrays and structs on the stack and if you only ever recurse to depth log n then again you ll be fine pretty much anywhere
hopefully you ll get an obvious crash if you re not fine but you can t be sure

2051084
superclass	subclassing
the is maybe superfluous but it shows the fact that the parent superclass should not be instanciated
the subclassing has no additional property so the subclassing tag is empty

2051408
post	get
while i have not read this next post this one looks potentially helpful for you as well subversion 1.6.0 and tree conflicts
the above is probably the best starting point reference for why you sometimes get that type of mergeinfo behavior

2051963
onclick	onsubmit
you are assigning submitsearch to the onclick event for the submit button and the onsubmit event for the form
since the onclick event is fired before the onsubmit event the onsubmit event will not even fire if the onclick event didn t return true

2052116
put	get
once you change the variable to a decimal append will give you as many digits as you put in
you can convert the float to a string using a format string like this result.append attributeorder.tostring g9 or alternatively however you will not be able to get more than 9 digits of precision from a float and digits 8 and 9 will be inaccurate

2052357
versioning	upgrade
that should then revert back to the apple-supplied versioning which is installed elsewhere
if you are using another versioning of python and installed pyobjc yourself you still may be able to use easy_install to revert to it since normally easy_install does not remove previous versions when you upgrade

2052694
folder	directory
this attribute specifies the folder that contains the coldfusion client-side files for all subsequent tags on the current page not just for ajax-based tags
therefore the directory tree must include all coldfusion client-side files used by those tags

2054040
superclass	subclassing
subclassing constructors may specify as the first thing they do which constructor in the superclass to invoke before executing the code in the subclassing s constructor
if the subclassing constructor does not specify which superclass constructor to invoke then the compiler will automatically call the accessible no-args constructor in the superclass

2054040
superclass	subclassing
if the subclassing constructor does not specify which superclass constructor to invoke then the compiler will automatically call the accessible no-args constructor in the superclass
if the superclass has no no-arg constructor or it isn t accessible then not specifying the superclass constructor to be called in the subclassing constructor is a compiler error so it must be specified

2054301
pexpect	subprocess
that s why for such purposes i suggest instead using pexpect everywhere but windows wexpect on windows which is designed exactly for this purpose -- letting your program simulate from the subprocess s viewpoint a human user typing input commands and looking at results at a terminal console
trying to drive a subprocess interactively more often than not runs into issues with the subprocess doing some buffering which blocks things

2054971
jlist	jtable
jlist is not yet editable and might never be
jtable would handle the layout problems for you and you can easily access the values via the table

2055664
set	bag
the asset is a way to explicitly change your hasmany to a set in situations where fnh might not be able to determine it by type for example if you re exposing your collection as an ienumerable it would default to a bag and calling asset would override that
assuming your type is an iesi set then there s no difference

2056760
loops	while-loop	loops	if-statement	if-statement	while-loop
so a fix would be as for the id of the nodes you could extend your while loops condition like this also the first if-statement where you check whether firstnode is null is not necessary in your case
if it s null the program will not get into the while-loop and will go directly to the first if-statement after the while-loop

2058304
fixed-point	fractions
for performance you wouldn t actually do this but instead use clever fixed-point math an implementation matter i leave to you
first to get the edge effects between different colored areas add or subtract some fractions of the r g and b channels to the texture image you could get fancier with with nonlinear forumulas thresholding the r g and b channels or computing some mathematical expression involving them

2058585
maven	pom.xml
using the latest maven 3.0-alpha-6 you get

post	get
three things you may not be doing marking the method static performing a post hand an empty for the data in jquery
there may be a way to call the method with a get i ve only ever used post

2059183
bash	tcsh
bash is one shell
technically linux is not a shell but in fact the kernel but many different shells can run on top of it bash tcsh pdksh etc.

2059254
x86	64bit
the x86 compiled managed assemblies or native binaries will run in wow64 and prevent any need for the silent remote debugging
obviously this doesn t help if it is a 64bit only problem .

2059284
prepare	pdostatement	prepare	bindparam
you ll have to use the pdostatement from your prepare call instead
the bindparam function is a method of a pdostatement object not a pdo object

2059293
prepare	pdostatement	prepare	bindparam
the statement is the result of the prepare method
the bindparam method is inside the pdostatement class not the pdo class

2059598
put	get
you can put a check e.g if
yourform.isdisposed yourform.invoke ... but that may not work sometime as the invoke is posted to ui thread and by the time it is process form may already be disposed and you will still get that exception

2060188
sudo	passwd
be sure to completely lock down the commands that that user can run via sudo
you should set up your sudoers not to require a passwd nopasswd for the user that your php is running as

2060801
profiling	instrumentation
obviously this isn t programatically but you only need to worry about the cpu of a single app at a time if your developing and using this you can profiling the app in question very easily
you can use instrumentation to do this open up instrumentation developer applications instrumentation and choose iphone - activity monitor and hit record it ll give you all the applications running and how much cpu ram and everything else they are running

2061645
maven	m2e
actually it doesn t provide real integration it just generates the .project and .classpath files it has also wtp support from a maven project
i ve used this plugin during years and was very happy with it and very unsatisfied at this time by eclipse plugins for maven like m2e

2061645
maven	m2e
the m2e plugin is one of the eclipse plugins for maven
it s actually the first and most mature of the projects aimed at integrating maven within the eclipse ide this has not always been the case it was not really usable 2 years ago see the feedback in mevenide vs

2061645
maven	m2e
it s actually the first and most mature of the projects aimed at integrating maven within the eclipse ide this has not always been the case it was not really usable 2 years ago see the feedback in mevenide vs
m2e q for eclipse iam

2061645
m2e	pom.xml
m2e q for eclipse iam
but even if i do not use things like creating a maven project from eclipse or the pom.xml editor or other fancy wizards i have to say that this plugin is now totally usable provides very smooth integration has nice features.

2062172
floating-point	integer
sure the range of most fp number implementations is larger than the range of most integer implementations but i could invent a language tomorrow in which i allow 512-bit integers but only 16-bit floating-point numbers 1 sign bit 3 exponent bits 12 significand bits
the integers are still not closed under division and the floating-point numbers are still no use for counting because while there is a successor function on fp numbers there isn t on real numbers and we like to pretend that fp numbers are a close implementation of real numbers

2062172
int	boolean
the int are still not closed under division and the floating-point numbers are still no use for counting because while there is a successor function on fp numbers there isn t on real numbers and we like to pretend that fp numbers are a close implementation of real numbers
no int are not easier on the processor the processor does fundamental boolean logic operations on bits

2062470
g++	gcc
and in a round about way if you had used the c++ compiler driver or g++ in your original example you wouldn t have encountered this problem shell g++ -m64 hello.cc shell . a.out hello world the reason for this is gcc essentially says use c rules when driving the tool chain and g++ says use c++ rules when driving the tool chain
g++ knows that to create a working executable it needs to pass -lstdc++ to the linker stage whereas gcc obviously doesn t think this is necessary even though it knew to use the c++ compiler at the compile the source code stage because of the .cc file ending

2062498
post	get
then the net effect will be what you re looking for - the author will be cached and hibernate can use that to set the post s foreign key
configure the 2nd-level cache for author and get calls will be retrieved from the cache and not from the database for the most part instances in the cache will get flushed when edited

2062617
src	attr
tested and works demo online -- with -- -- works with your original syntax too -- an interesting bug we know that our src value is foo.jpg yet the following fails so i was curious if jquery s interpretation of the src would be equal to the string literal source i provided in the html this makes the whole situation very strange
jquery argues that the src value is not equal to foo.jpg when you pass it in as part of the selector but it is equal to the string literal when you compare from a call to attr

2062961
profiling	debugging
now i wouldn t do this because there s great profiling tools out there already jetbrains dottrace to name one and with intellitrace in vs2010 all these headaches will simply go away.
intellitrace will let you do time traveling debugging

2064670
versioning	upgrade
the discussion focuses on how the function can be used to upgrade versioning of custom tables but it s probably used for the upgrade of wordpress itself
because of this adding a column to wp_posts will probably not cause a problem for upgrade but may cause problems for the upgrade but probably would remove your column

2064862
crypt	md5
for more details on the crypt algorithm see
md5 is a hashing algorithm not encryption

2065300
inherited	properties
i m not sure this is working but here is an idea based on some investigation is made in the datagrid s source code using reflector 1 create a class which inherited datagridcellspanel
this is the panel that is used internally by the datagrid in order to arrange the cells 2 override the bringindexintoview method by an empty method without calling the base method 3 set the itemspaneltemplate properties in your xaml it seems that when a mousedown event occurs at some point the bringindexintoview method of the panel is called to do the auto-scroll

2066159
post	get
with regards to security jsessionid is just as vunerable with http get as http post
the base64 encoding http post does is not a security measure at all

2066330
stdout	fflush
2 the i o to an output stream is probably buffered which means that if the subprocess writes some information to stdout without explicitly calling fflush which is almost always the case you might not see the output
fflush is automatically called when the process exits so if it s a short small subprocess you should be ok but if it s not you have no real way of forcing its output to show up when you want it to

2067260
cpu	processors
it is managed by the processors and provides a way to ensure that data needed by the cpu is close at hand so that it does not have to wait for the bus to fetch it
it is totally up to the cpu to ensure that what is in main memory is the same as what is stored in the cache

2067735
g++	gcc
not helpeful but perhaps informative on a fresh install of opensolaris and g++ i see the same results
in the man page for gcc ++ on opensolaris it notes the default level of debuging information is 2 .

2067789
junit	testng
se seems to work flawlessly with junit
probably testng as well but have not tried that yet it s on my todo list

2067808
int	double
a common instance is determining if something is an int or range or real value
here you can see we match either an int and then lookahead if we find a double period then we know that the int is really an int and not a real

2067808
int	double
here you can see we match either an int and then lookahead if we find a double period then we know that the int is really an int and not a real
in this case we set the variable _ttype to be int

2068023
maven	pom.xml
update to cover questions from the op in comments fighting against maven doesn t sound fun
this is a parent pom.xml used for project aggregation

2068169
superclass	subclassing
it sounds like your parent superclass doesn t override equals
if this is the case then you need to compare the fields from the parent class when you override this method in the subclassing

2068485
post	get	put	get
the difference concerns redirecting post put and delete requests and what the expectations of the server are for the user agent behavior rfc 2616 note rfc 1945 and rfc 2068 specify that the client is not allowed to change the method on the redirected request
however most existing user agent implementations treat 302 as if it were a 303 response performing a get on the location field-value regardless of the original request method

2068690
ant	maven
if you are not tied to using ant and are prepared to use maven then it is simply a matter of setting up maven with the eclipse plugin which generates the eclipse projects for you
hudson already knows how to build maven projects so that is taken care of

2069008
folder	directory
however assuming you cannot do that place all of the assemblies that you need to reference from the web project into a folder somewhere lib web and add a pre-build event to your web project that copies the content of that folder into the bin folder of the web directory
now whenever you want to add a dependency to your web project you can drop it in the lib web folder and add the reference

2069484
int	chars
in spite of its name getc returns an int not a chars so that it can represent all of the possible chars values and in addition eof end of file
if getc returned a chars there would be no way to indicate the end of file without using one of the values that could possibly be in the file

2069987
for-loop	arrays
by the way your for-loop is probably not what you want if you want to iterate through the arrays you ll need to increment the pointer ptr++ not the value to which it points ptr++
if i understand you correctly you want to iterate through the arrays and stop when ptr has a certain value

2070274
int	chars	int	double
here are the simplest alternatives and how you can use them replace double with int or almost any other type and everything here works the same
nothing new here that isn t said in other answers but i m going to try to succinctly provide explanation and examples without losing clarity. looping through a chars array checking for 0 works because c-style strings have a convention that int double and most other types don t have null-termination

2070274
int	chars
nothing new here that isn t said in other answers but i m going to try to succinctly provide explanation and examples without losing clarity. looping through a chars array checking for 0 works because c-style strings have a convention that int double and most other types don t have null-termination
that 0 chars is called null or nul but rarely null to avoid confusion with the macro by that name. since int and double arrays do not have this convention you must use something else

2070312
try-catch	exception-handling
you do not have any control over the initialization process and static blocks cannot be called from your source so that you could surround them with try-catch
because you cannot handle any error indicated by a checked exception-handling it was decided to disallow throwing of checked exception-handling static blocks

2070418
implements	modifiers
automatically implements properties are a compact way of writing if your property doesn t follow that pattern modulo access modifiers for the property then automatic properties won t help you
if so you re using c# 2 which doesn t support automatically implements properties

2072623
dictionary	map	post	get
original post python allows you to use a translation dictionary to map characters to a replacement string
a simple version for you case would be and then you can call print u những-viên-kẹo .translate vietnamese_map to get u nhung-vien-keo for more advanced use ie a dynamic dictionary see eg note that the above is just to show you what the map needs to look like it s not a particularly convenient way of entering the data

2072633
put	get
generally though you re going to have to put a lot into it as an oss project to get anything out and if you can t or won t make that commitment probably best not to go down that road
in terms of what you get lose by essentially handing over your intellectual property i d see that in this instance as slightly secondary

2072717
folder	directory
2005 c program files x86 microsoft visual studio 8 common7 ide itemtemplates csharp 1033 class.zip 2008 c program files x86 microsoft visual studio 9.0 common7 ide itemtemplates csharp code 1033 class.zip 2010 c program files x86 microsoft visual studio 10.0 common7 ide itemtemplates csharp code 1033 class.zip starting with visual studio 2012 the templates are not zipped so you can edit each .cs template in each applicable folder directly

2072772
post	get
you often see a lot of code that looks something like this since you re using a polymorphic association you may be able to do something like this instead the trouble with this approach where you have one controller that serves two entirely different routes is that generating error messages such as user not found versus post not found
this can be tricky to get right if you re not inheriting from a users basecontroller for instance

2073042
post	get
thus you re actually not redirecting the request but just post ing and forwarding the request
you will namely get this error page whenever you tries to get a non-cached post request from the browser history

2073042
post	get
assuming that your webapplication is well designed and that you re using a servlet to control preprocess and postprocess requests then all you need to do is to invoke httpservletresponse#sendredirect instead of requestdispatcher#forward this way the post request won t be taken in the browser history
pressing the back button will not get the post request anymore but the request which was invoked before it the request used to open view the page with the form

2073190
tostring	getter
and you should not be using tostring for non debug purposes
using getter in tostring is an overkill

2073232
regsvr32	atl
usually all you need is to have the proxy interface registered on the client side as well as on the server-side via regsvr32
if your atl objects are all idispatch based and thats how you call them not via a custom interface then a default proxy is already registered on windows machines

2073928
base	fractions
the log of 1 for any base is 0 which means we don t need to add any more
if result + fractions is not greater than result then we ve hit the limits of precision for our numbering system

2074016
int	chars
hence converting int to pointer
your strtolower makes all its changes in place there is no reason for it to return anything especially not a chars

2074319
put	get
put into the tag to prevent posting by users who do have js enabled
the straightforward option is just a regular form post even if it is to the url voteup id and i m not sure why you can t do that or even the get you mentioned

2074433
pop-up	dialog
of course you might be posting the form elements from your pop-up form to its own controller method directly and that is also a perfectly good approach
there shouldn t be any issues if you are binding elements from your pop-up dialog to corresponding hidden elements in your main view

2074811
put	get
you can also do this with the is operator which looks nicer but will make fxcop cry in general by the way you probably want to look for an opportunity to put a virtual method on animal and implement that method polymorphically rather than having monster if-statements which result in brittle coupling to a specific set of derived classes
you can use typeof to get the actual type or use the is or as operators to test and optionally cast i haven t used else clauses here which could cause errors if you re testing against types which might be in a hierarchy if you had both kangaroo and marsupial clauses you probably would not want both to be executed

2075012
put	get
you may need to put it on a form that loads on top of the word window or in a menu toolbar so that clicking it does not affect the selection in the document itself
edit i think you can use application.selection.previous to get at what you need

2075114
queue	fifo
the stack and the queue are more advanced ways to handle a collection that the array itself which doesn t establish any order in the way the elements behave inside the collection
the stack lifo - last in first out and a queue fifo - fifo establish and order in which your elements are inserted and removed from a collection

2075264
inline	inlining
these are good candidates for inlining whether it be as #define macros or inline-functions
yes i know inline is only a suggestion but in this case i consider it as a reminder to the compiler. remove dead and redundant code if the code isn t used or does not contribute to the program s result get rid of it

2075657
implements	extends
if your delegate interface has a lot of methods and it would be convenient to make some of them optional you could define an adapter class that implements the delegate interface providing a default implementation for each of the methods
to use it your delegate class must either extends the adapter class or if that is not possible define a private inner class that extends the adapter class

2076043
fseek	ftell
in fact the return value of ftell for streams opened in text mode is useful only in calls to fseek and not to determine file size
if it is a binary file opened with b in the second parameter to fopen then the c standard has this to say setting the file position indicator to end-of-file as with fseek file 0 seek_end has undefined behavior for a binary stream because of possible trailing null characters or for any stream with state-dependent encoding that does not assuredly end in the initial shift state

2076098
onclick	onkeyup	onchange	onkeyup	onchange	keyup
the cleanest or at least a clean way to do it if you re using a js framework give all your numeral-only inputs a class that indicates the fact class numeric or something like that and add forcenumeric as a callback for keyup change and click to any input element with that class if you re using straight js i d recommend not using straight js either use element.addeventlistener or onkeyup onchange and onclick
the quickest that won t stop people from pasting things in with their mouse so an onchange and onclick are probably desirable too

2076951
postgresql	mysql
so i suggest you might want to take a look on how the database.yml is configured with mysql and also try that out with the postgresql gem
also make sure that you compiled postgresql with ssl support. see if that all does not work maybe you can try to monkey-patch the database connection from rails and add connection_parameters to the ssl connection

2078180
free	strcpy	free	malloc
then you will need a corresponding freeentry function to free up the space
another way to do this would be to declare your struct differently then your addentry function doesn t need the malloc calls for firstname lastname and phonenumber but you still need to copy data using strcpy

2078368
lisp	scheme
i think lambda is simplest in lisp since it was designed for that kind of thing and of the dialects scheme tends to be the simplest
not coincidentally the greatest computer science book ever written uses scheme

2078411
ggplot2	lattice
first i would point you to a very nice tutorial on ggplot2 and ggobi from looking at data earlier this year
beyond that i would just highlight one visualization from r and two graphics packages which are not as widely used as base graphics lattice or ggplot heat maps i really like visualizations that can handle multivariate data especially time series data

2078582
int	double
this would work with it now about the 2nd one its a function that receives a pointer to a pointer to an int and if you give it nothing it defaults to 0
update a practical application of this kind of double pointers is a memory allocation routine like this function returns true false depending on whether or not it worked and would update the pointer you pass in with the real memory address like this you pass in an uninitialized pointer and the function can overwrite it with a real value because you passed a pointer to the actual pointer

2078709
children	parent
if this is not supposed to be a full binary tree then there is no deterministic way to interpret the problem since each of node 1 and 2 could have 1 or 2 children given your picture
this does sound like homework so i won t write code but here are a couple of hints this could be done even if your triangle were written as a list like 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 because it seems like this is a full binary tree assuming your triangle is wrong and the third row is actually supposed to be 3 4 5 6 you could maintain a parent queue whose head is the next parent that needs children

2079261
free	malloc
of course this completely depends on the malloc implementation but in this case with no calls to free most malloc implementations will probably give you the same algorithmic speed
as another answer commented usually there will be a list of free blocks but if you have not called free there will just be one so it should be o 1 in both cases

2079490
vb.net	vb6
you can utilize the vb upgrade wizard but that will only get you to vb.net potentially as there as some things that cannot be upgraded
or you can compile your vb6 app to a com dll.

2079582
sorting	filtering	filtering	grouping
regarding filtering sorting and grouping as per aron s answer these are not available on a view over a compositecollection
but for the record here are the ways you can detect changes for views that do support these features it looks like you ll get a collectionchanged event when the filtering changes though i can t find this documented

2080152
gmail	hotmail
pop3 available for all users of gmail but not recommended because of pop3 inherent limitations no folder no get new messages
hotmail pop3 available for all users but again pop3 inherent limitations no folder no sent mail no get new messages in addition to hotmail limitation called 15-minutes-delay-necessary for pop3 access

2080431
dependency-injection	singleton
all kinds of service locators or dependency-injection frameworks still rely on global not always static variable but always global of some sort storage of objects
however singleton are a sign of a problem first singleton as a canonical pattern doesn t go well with interfaces and abstraction

2080528
ati	nvidia
the support has been added very recently this generation and not everywhere ati hd5870 and hd5850 have it at decent speed not as fast as single though hd5770 does not have it despite being in the same generation as the hd5870
nvidia gt200 based cards have double support but at a double single ratio that is very low

2080590
children	parent
if maybe the parent class should manage initializing it s children
if not you could dispatch an event from the class your are writing and listen for that event in the parent

2080901
post	get
i wouldn t call post more or less secure than get
admittedly parameters are displayed as part of the url when using get so any sensitive data will be immediately visible to the user

2080940
post	get
get requests can easily be foreged see cross-site request forgery by just placing an image on a page while forging post requests is not that easy this is also a reason why you should only allow authorized post requests
the get method is meant for data retrieval only and should not have any side-effects

2081470
profiling	instrumentation
a profiling will not be a solution to a coding style that is x slower than optimal however you still need to spend time fine-tuning those parts of your code that are used more often than others
because of instrumentation profiled code on average will run slower than non-profiled code

2081561
profiling	instrumentation
i m not surprised by the fact that you get worst results when profiling your application as instrumenting java code will typically always slow its execution
this is actually nicely captured by the wikipedia page on profiling which mentions that instrumentation can causes changes in the performance of a program potentially causing inaccurate inaccurate results and heisenbugs due to the observer effect observers affect what they are observing by the mere act of observing it alone

2081967
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
the prohibition on modifying what pascal calls the control variable of a for-loop combined with the lack of a break statement means that it is possible to know how many times loops body is executed without studying its contents
without a break statement and not being able to use the control variable after loops terminates is more of a restriction than not being able to modify the control variable inside loops as it prevents some string and arrays processing algorithms from being written in the obvious way

2082136
drive	createfile
standard users may not have write access to the exe and that would probably drive anti-virus nuts
and no createfilemapping and getmappedfilename definitely won t work since they don t give you a file name that can be passed to createfile

2082570
inline	inlining
the compiler will make up its own mind whether to inline a function or not - it might take the programmer suggests inlining this into account but on most compilers simply declaring a function as inline doesn t guarantee it will be
inline is a suggestion to the compiler to inline the function - instead of generating a block of code for the function and call instructions wherever it s used it effectively cut-and-pastes the generated code wherever that function is called

2083665
children	parent
the homepage checks all its children except gallery using the same method
alternatively you can choose not to pass the path as an array but instead just transition to the parent page if none of the children or the children s children match cause you re sure the target is not under this page

2085082
udp	tcp
if you are using udp you are going to lose data
the way that you avoid losing data is to use tcp not udp

2085801
put	get
at least it should throw that xmlelement with jagged array properties are not supported instead of failing at trying to put into
i m able to get almost the same structure using the xmlarrayitem attribute but i still get a top-level groups element

2087849
hash	salt
if you feel paranoid pick two salt values sprefix and ssuffix and calculate the hash of the concatenated triple sprefix r ssuffix
use an n-bit serial number r combined with an m-bit hash h of the concatenated pair r s where s is some secret salt s which you do not publish

2087943
inline	inlining
btw inlining is of significant value only if the routines being inline are small and don t call functions themselves and if the lines where they are being called are active enough of the time to be significant
as for the order of magnitude performance ratio between debug and release build it may be due to a number of things maybe or maybe not the inlining

2088188
daemons	systemd
alternatively you could further raise the technological stakes by having the daemons return not the password but rather the open socket ready to be wrapped in a db-api compliant wrapper
some unix systemd allow open file descriptors to be sent between unrelated processes a prereq for this approach -- and of course you d have to substantially rework the mysql-based db api to allow opening a connection around an already-open socket rather than a freshly made one

2088482
firefox	safari
unfortunately it seems safari also doesn t implement the onpagehide function firefox introduced to go with the bfcache so you can t catch that
another option would be to browser-sniff for safari and when found disable the bfcache by setting a window.onunload function even one that does nothing

2088992
client-side	server-side
you cannot do it with 100 client-side javascript with the default security settings
you ll need to implement some server-side logic

2089174
awt	swing
awt is not the newest technology on the block
so unless you have a specific requirement to do work in awt i would recommend you to check out the modern replacements swing or swt - much more comfortable flexible customizable and predictable in their behaviour than awt

2089449
ready	each
being reference by your object s fields does not keep these com objects alive because your object is no longer referenced by or traced from a root and therefore the com objects do not trace from a root either. so your object and all the com objects it references are all ready to be garbage collected at the same time
some time later the garbage collector will cleanup your object and call its finalizer as it will also do with the com objects each of which is really a runtime callable wrapper rcw

2090108
folder	directory
when you install moss 2007 using the default install locations the moss 2007 log files will not reside in the program files microsoft office servers 12.0 logs directory folder as expected
they will reside in the wss directory folder program files common files microsoft shared web server extensions 12 logs

2091012
put	get
to call it put the function in parenthesis and add after it like for a normal function call
your code just defines the function and assigns it to x the function doesn t get called

2091238
innodb	myisam
see when you delete the parent row users you can declare your desired behavior in foreign key constraints in dependent tables restrict meaning don t delete the parent if there are dependent rows cascade meaning delete any dependent rows automatically and atomically set null meaning change the value in the foreign key column in the child table to null set default meaning change the value in the foreign key column to the default defined for that column of course these constraints work only in innodb
foreign keys are not supported in myisam

2091324
filesystems	ntfs
same for setfilepointerex last word you have be aware that some filesystems limit the maximum filesize the fat32 won t handle file bigger than 4 gb by design ntfs would handle any size but the api generally is made for 4 gb or less big file
i am not sure but the limit is 4 gb os api and the standard libraries using theses api and the filesystems used

2091553
submit	submission
also change your method attribute to get the error is stating that you cannot submit post requests
you need to return false and call preventdefault on the event object in order to prevent submission of the form

2091852
versioning	upgrade
but to be honest it s not really clear what versioning are affected by mrelease-202 the comments are confusing so i wonder if the issue is fixed or not
anyway if the version you are using is affected then upgrade to a more recent version

2093883
hash	salt
if you re dead set on going down the roll my own authentication scheme path here s how i d make the scheme you described above more secure caveat i m not a cryptographer - i believe that there are serious weaknesses in what i m describing here instead of sending the password directly send a one-way-function also known as a owf often implemented as a cryptographic hash like sha256 or stronger of the password
in other words have the server send the client a salt value add the salt to the password compute the owf of the password+salt value and send the owf result to the server

2094126
svg	vml
there s a few to choose from in this blog post canvas svg vml drawing roundup
you can just make a call to that function provided by google and it will return true if vml is supported and false if not

2094503
nsfilemanager	writetofile
if it does fail you could try the nsfilemanager class that has a createdirectoryatpath attributes method
the writetofile might fail because the directory does not exist

2094827
hide	show
use the page.showsnavigationui property to hide it
from the msdn documentation you may do this in xaml or in code also the toolbar does not appear in browsers where wpf integration allows the native browser navigation ui to control the xbap application because wpf does not integrate with the navigation ui for microsoft internet explorer 6 it provides its own navigation ui which can be show or hidden by setting showsnavigationui

2095061
versioning	upgrade
looking at the logs on the server i saw the problem comes from old versioning of openssl generating bad not random enough keys on my old linux box
since i cannot upgrade embedded development i generated both the public and private keys on another machine and copied them to the linux box

2095347
public	protected
in exactly the same way that making internal data or methods public
if it was designed to be protected by the initial designer of x then chances are that y implementor did not want it to be public.

2095650
width	margin	box-sizing	margin
you can read the w3c box model specification here but i suggest you to read a more easy-to-read but really good article like this another thing to say is that the css 3 specifications will include the box-sizing property which will allow to specify for every element the way to interpret the width property so if excluding or including padding and borders . anyway it will take years for the majority of browsers to implement the new and not yet finished css 3 specifications
the w3c css 2.1 box model specification says that the width of an element does not include margin border or padding

2095650
width	margin	margin	height
the w3c css 2.1 box model specification says that the width of an element does not include margin border or padding
in fact by specifying the css width or height properties you specify the space available to the content of a box that is called content area in the specification which does not include padding margin or border

2095650
width	margin
in fact by specifying the css width or height properties you specify the space available to the content of a box that is called content area in the specification which does not include padding margin or border
look at this example the distance between the vertical borders including them is width + padding-left + padding-right + border-right-width + border-left-width. margins are outside of the border-box. the width as intended by the css specifications is instead 100px

2096032
cpu	affinity
but multithreading is a program architecture not a cpu facility
most operating systems have a facility for changing a process cpu affinity thereby restricting it to a single physical or virtual core

2096717
stdout	stderr
stdout is line-buffered by default so that is relatively safe
stderr is not

2097127
implements	modifiers
when you use abstract modifiers for class it means class is partially implements and there will be sub-class of this class which will give complete implementation you cannot instantiate abstract class you can have zero or more abstract methods in abstract class abstract method is an method whose implementation is not known
when you use final modifiers for class it means class is fully implements and there should not be any sub-class of this class

2097127
implements	modifiers
when you use final modifiers for class it means class is fully implements and there should not be any sub-class of this class
modifiers final is totally opposite of abstract modifiers

2097534
peer	p2p
this isn t foolproof and often requires a proxy server mediating the connection between 2 nat d peer but it s used in many deployments
stun turn and ice are additional methods that help with nat scenarios and especially in p2p serverless situations

2097573
allocator	stl
when there is expansion it will try to reallocate in place but this is a bit silly and doesn t normally work think windows 98 heap compaction but usually will end up making a whole new allocator and copying over
a standard stl vector is always all together but not all implementations work like that i know having written some of them

2097729
post	get
this is the blog post that got me started using machine.spec rob goes through the complete setup from installation to writing specs
it doesn t use ef but it should still get you headed in the right direction

2098154
temporary	tablespace
temporary here means that the data that is stored is temporary by nature not that the tablespace itself is temporary
think of it like of tmp directory in unix or temp folded in windows the directory folder itself is permanent but the data stored within it are temporary

2098154
temporary	tablespace
not sure about 11g but in previous versions of oracle this option was not available for temporary tablespace
alter user me temporary tablespace ts_tmp

2098528
for-loop	loops
the for-loop present in c doesn t technically count as a for-loop because you don t necessarily know how many times loops will iterate before executing it
you can hack loops counter to run forever the class of problems you can solve with while loops is strictly more powerful than those you could have solved with the strict for-loop found in pascal

2098528
for-loop	loops
if you implemented for the c-way the for-loop would just be an alternative syntax for while... in strictly theoretical terms you shouldn t ever need to modify the counter within a for-loop
if you could get away with it you d just have an alternative syntax for a while loops

2098807
dao	facade
the answer would be very broad so i would suggest you to use the the data access object dao design pattern to abstract the source of the data database or webservice the strategy pattern to abstract the algorithm by which the data is merged when both sources are available and one there is only one and finally the state design pattern to change the way your application works depending on which source is available
all this wrapped why not in a nice facade

2099773
explode	substr
explode the string then use two nested loops along with array_slice to get the relevant elements
substr are not permutations

2099844
ubuntu	linux
moblin is produced by the linux foundation and is not based on ubuntu
ubuntu netbook remix unr is produced by canonical and based on ubuntu

2100193
int	boolean
example if something and something_else do_a becomes if this_letter_is a and something and something_else and something_i_dont_care_about_here do_a if this_letter_is a and something and something_else and not something_i_dont_care_about_here do_a if this_letter_is q and something and something_else and something_i_dont_care_about_here do_a if this_letter_is q and something and something_else and not something_i_dont_care_about_here do_a now if you have n boolean and m letters you should have m 2 n if s. just imagine you have stored the boolean in a bitfield so each possible combination of boolean represents an int
hence the above becomes which then becomes this int value for the bitfield is the turing machine state

2100411
put	get
do not put anything in a cookie that should not be in the hands of a user or of someone who might somehow steal the cookie
similarly be suspicious of information you get out of a cookie. do not assume that the data is the same as when you wrote it out

2100474
post	put
edit also note that you will need more php coding to implement caching but this is a very nice coding experience on the other hand it is easy to implement a javascript script to fetch such things as updates from twitter twitter api rate limiting as read on twitter.api twitter limits rest requests to 150 requests hour using ip based rules or counting requests for authenticated api usage get requests like fetching twitter feeds timelines through rest api do count post requests like updating statuses do not count account rate limit status available at where you can check how many request you can do in specified time limit
you can have custom css styling in both ways so this shouldn t be a problem when using php api try to cache all the info you need and put it in eg

2100520
base	fractions
just like some fractions like 1 3 cannot be represented precisely in base 10
in python explain how some fractions cannot be represented precisely in binary

2100541
folder	directory
edit i think when you say and in my include apr folder i have the following header file apr.h that might be what s wrong
you should not have an apr.h file in your local directory mdash

2101186
rss	feed
example jinja2 template atom not rss but you get the idea assuming that the items are 3-tuples title link html code to feed content to the template and output the result
i suggest you use a template and feed the list of items to the template

2101311
postgresql	mysql
thus for purely functional reasons because postgresql supports a feature which most databases do not ddl in postgresql must be different than in other databases
a similar situation arises in mysql because it allows the use of different isam engines with different capabilities

2101612
post	put
on the view i d have my dropdown with the id for my category but the list from my categories when your data post back to the server you should observe that the class contains the id value
when i work with my viewmodel i d have a property categoryid and put my range validator on that not the dropdown

2102517
firefox	safari
this happens with webkit - it seems to display the images as they are and doesn t apply automatic scaling like firefox and ie do
it probably looks like that in safari as well

2102528
jfreechart	jchart2d
i did a live plotter application over the summer and used jfreechart for that
the guy who had started the project had used jchart2d but i found that it doesn t have enough options for tweaking the chart look and feel

2103392
lisp	scheme
here is an example for sicp exercises in common lisp
sicp is more a general book about programming and computer science not so that much about scheme or lisp programming

2103619
punctuation	words
words selection provides correct interpretation of punctuation marks within and following words
characters that are not part of a words such as symbols or punctuation marks have word-breaks on both sides

2103789
packets	multicast
what you need is winpcap or something like it with which you can construct raw ethernet frames and receive answering packets at that same level
the oid part of the mac address you give 01 00 0c isn t the same as the one used for ipv4 multicast 01 00 5e so you can t use anything in winsock to send this packet

2104098
int	double
this first unboxes the boxed double and then casts to an int
to do this in older versions of .net an alternative is here we do not need an unboxing operation because we have first converted the arraylist to an array of unboxed double s

2104528
post	put
post is not idempotent
so you should not use for the update or the delete instead use put and delete from rest 2 a better choice is to use the header content-type on the ws call like application xml 3 also on the header content-type u can use it application-v1.0 xml 4 not sure if it is the best but probably the easiest way is to use http s built-in authentication mechanisms in rfc 2617

2104572
propertychangelistener	listeners
settingsnode will not get reclaimed until after the propertychangelistener is removed
using anonymous classes for listeners clike this an be a common cause of memory leaks

2105477
post	get
as for mysql not liking the post var if you insert it directly for some runs but not others then you should make sure you re using consistent data and setups for each test
if some test are done using a get then your post vars will be empty

2105903
nunit	moq
this can be shown following your example with the following nunit test furthermore an interface cannot be created which inherits the from interop interface to workaround the problem as it will also inherit the marshalled add remove methods
this issue was reported on the moq issue tracker here update until this is addressed by the moq developers the only workaround may be to use reflection to modify the interface which seems to defeat the purpose of using moq

2106329
innodb	myisam
for myisam if the value is less than or equal to the maximum value currently in the auto_increment column the value is reset to the current maximum plus one. for innodb if the value is less than the current maximum value in the column no error occurs and the current sequence value is not changed
i ran a small test that confirmed this for a myisam table

2106687
folder	directory
i assume you sanitized the folder name for your example and you re not actually looking for folder
the current working directory of the service may not be what you expect

2107586
inherited	properties
this technique can be better than simple object augmentation because the inherited properties aren t copied over all the new object instances since the base object is set as the of the extended object in the above example subinstance contains physically only the member3 properties
in javascript you don t have classes but you can get inheritance and behavior reuse in many ways pseudo-classical inheritance through prototyping should be used with the new operator function application or constructor chaining this approach should also be used with the new operator the difference with the first example is that when we apply the super constructor to the this object inside sub it adds the properties assigned to this on super directly on the new instance subinstance contains the properties member1 and member2 directly

2107798
distance	polygons
either that or make sure that the distance between the points stay regular in the step before
geodesic snakes repeat the last two steps until convergence you now have an outline polygons that touches the visible person-background border and continues smoothly where the border is not visible or has low contrast

2107982
folder	dir	folder	directory
you have only one place the cd to change if you want more actions to take place in this folder -maxdepth 1 and -mindepth 1 make sure that find really only looks in the current dir and doesn t include
in the result -type d looks only for directory -printf f n prints only the found folder s name plus a newline for each hit

2108433
allocator	stl
also in the setstring method you re not allocator enough space for the trailing 0 in the array
if you want to do correct oo-oriented programming in c++ you should maybe stay away from direct pointer management but use the stl string class and use references instead of pointers

2108499
folder	directory
if you added the file to folder one via the vs solution explorer and added it as a link then it will be part of the project and will be included twice but it will be placed in folder1 under the bin debug or bin release folder upon building
there will be no clash because they are in different folders and they are not compiled simply copied to the folder structure under the output directory

2109036
firefox	safari
work well with firefox
do not work with ie 7 safari

2109240
squash	branch
to clean your history and build your real commits you can rebase the granular branch on top of master in an interactive way git checkout master git rebase -i granular that was you pick squash or edit commits made in granular replaying a cleaner set of commits on master
that rewrites granular history but this is not too bad if nobody pull directly from this branch

2109972
wicket	seam
for those interested in looking at code i re-implemented the seam hotel booking demo in scala + wicket here browse | svn - the java + wicket version is here browse | svn i used the not yet final scala 2.8 and the netbeans plugin
was meaning to blog in detail about it there s even a groovy + wicket implementation in place but a few high-level impressions below

2110069
jar	war
however this support is limited to the ejb3 mbean and the jar files it manages
any jar files which are loaded from a war such as servlets jsf backing beans and so forth do not undergo this processing

2110069
jboss	glassfish	jboss	weblogic
in fact jboss 4.2.2 is a transitional version that doesn t claim full java ee 5 compliance
consequently either stick with you actual version of jboss but use a jdni lookup to get your bean - or - swith to jboss 5 as that fully supports the entire java 5 enterprise edition specification but has horrible startup performances - or - swith to another java ee 5 application server like glassfish v2 or even v3 or weblogic 10

2110093
implements	sealed
curiously this is the way most enums are implements in java which doesn t have a special keyword for them
if you go this route it s generally a good idea to make the class sealed and define a private constructor so that only the class itself can define instances

2110677
inotifypropertychanged	icollectionview
in wpf you can bind not only to objects implementing inotifypropertychanged but also to dependency objects exposing dependency properties which are much more flexible than regular properties
there are also new interfaces for collections inotifycollectionchanged which allows collections to send notifications when items are added deleted or replaced icollectionview which defines how a collection is presented to the ui the wpf binding mechanism is also much more flexible than the windows forms bindings.

2110689
subclass	inherited
if you re intending to make dostuff synchronized and guarantee it to be for any given subclass then you re better off not making it virtual and using a protected virtual member to do the actual work
this also gives you the option of not lock ing in the current code meaning that dostuff simply calls internaldostuff with no other code but still being able to slip it in at a later date without having to touch your inherited code

2110790
inherited	properties
you may however add multiple time handlers to the buttons event click like when inheriting you should not click on the inherited buttons in designer that will add a new maybe the same action on the inherited button add a breackpoint in the twice executed action when hit consult the callstack visual studio window in order to see who calls your method twice.
edit not sure what happens but try the following replace with edit2 in order to analyze the calls to your method instantly do the following set a tracepoint in the installbutton_click method alt text edit the tracepoint properties in order to trace the callstack or also use just caller - only theprevious function alt text in the output window deactivate right click all messages but program output

2111479
jstl	taglib
if it does then you likely just need to install jstl first
just drop jstl-1.2.jar in webapp s web-inf lib and declare the taglib in top of jsp as per the jstl core tld if that still doesn t solve the problem then there s apparently means of a brand new request a redirect has occurred or you were using wrong parameter names

2112356
memcpy	malloc
these versions will implement a shallow copy much like what memcpy would do in your case the array contents would not be copied only the pointers
1 incidentally the same goes for malloc and free

2112757
inherited	properties
you can do so by using the inherited keyword as the value visibility inherited edit or as javascript
this is because the css properties visibility is inherited but does not affect the layout of the page

2113301
oncreate	onstart
so the problem is that askthetime might have already been created when the widget is pressed so the oncreate isn t called again
what you could do is try doing your logging in onstart or onresume instead of or in addition to oncreate inside your activity

2114233
int	double
for example if you have decimal 18 2 field with value 254.00 in it and you accidentaly read that into an int you will get 25400 not 254
make sure you either read those in as double or scale yourself later

2114387
implements	extends
let the transfer object implements a method that returns an object of the original third party class and you re done pseudocode you just have to make sure that the members are serialized correctly if you got any special member objects
alternatively if the third party class isn t final you could just extends it have that implements serializable and write your own writeobject and readobject methods

2114597
client-side	server-side
no it is not possible to do that directly with javascript on the client-side
sessions are handled on the server-side

2115161
folder	directory
if we do not stop this application restart process it can cause great problem as all the user will start loosing their session in the middle of nothing. here is a list of events when the asp.net application restarts in asp.net 2.0 adding modifying or deleting assemblies from the application s bin folder adding modifying or deleting localization resources from the app_globalresources or app_localresources folder adding modifying or deleting the application s global.asax file
adding modifying or deleting source code files in the app_code directory

2116517
lisp	scheme
then there are some who don t like commmon lisp too big too old not functional enough not object oriented enough too fast not fast enough ...
some don t like scheme too academic too small does not scale too functional not functional enough no modules the wrong modules not the right macros ...

2116541
filesystems	ntfs
suggesting that internally the sqlfilestream operates in the same manner as a bog-standard filestream class however perhaps the most telling details as to why this functionality is not available in prior versions of sql server that do not implement any type of filestream or direct-to-underlying-storage column type is from the filestream overview msdn article that states filestream integrates the sql server database engine with an ntfs filesystems by storing varbinary max binary large object blob data as files on the filesystems
transact-sql statements can insert update query search and back up filestream data. win32 filesystems interfaces provide streaming access to the data

2116541
filesystems	ntfs
this essentially says that using a sqlfilestream object will act almost identically to a standard filestream object except that sql server for transactional integrity purposes will act as a very lightweight gatekeeper or wrapper for your reading and writing of binary data to an underlying ntfs filesystems file
since no previous version of sql server has offered such functionality and direct integration with the underlying ntfs filesystems i d say that it would not be possible to implement a sqlfilestream against any version of sql server prior to sql server 2008

2117458
hash	md5
maybe if you give a little more detail as to what the hash codes will be used for we can see if collisions would cause problems or not
java s string hashcode will give you an int if you want a long you could take the least-significant 64 bits of the md5 sum for the string

2117723
superclass	subclassing
edit when i wrote above that subclassing inherited supertype using prototypical inherited i mean that all new instances of subclassing inherited from one particular instance of superclass not from the superclass type function itself
the difference is that when you do you are creating an instance of superclass

2117808
salt	md5
so if you re hashing passwords without a salt - shame on you
- using md5 - you might as well not be hashing them they re so easy to find

2117808
salt	md5
even if you re hashing with simple salt really
second off md5 is no longer secure as a cryptographic hash function indeed it is not even considered a cryptographic hash function anymore as the forked one points out

2117808
hash	md5
second off md5 is no longer secure as a cryptographic hash function indeed it is not even considered a cryptographic hash function anymore as the forked one points out
you can generate different messages that hash to the same value

2118107
git-rebase	undo
however this does not necessarily mean that git-rebase expects the result of this edit to be exactly one commit
indeed you can undo the commit or you can add other commits

2118259
hash	md5
also there are other structures which can be used for building a hash function
the current standard functions md5 sha-1 and the sha-2 family aka sha-224 sha-256 sha-384 and sha-512 are merkle-damgård functions but many of the would-be successors are not

2118607
gdal	ogr
currently ogr from gdal does not perform any recoding of character data during translation between vector formats
the team has prepared rfc 23.1 unicode support in ogr document which discusses support of recoding for ogr drivers

2118607
gdal	ogr
the rfc 23 was adopted and the core functionality was already released in gdal 1.6.0
however most of ogr drivers have not been updated including shapefile driver

2118831
inherited	properties
this function makes use of several other functions defined in the book so i rewrote it in a somewhat simpler form below in simple english if you call new constructor where constructor is a function the operator creates a new object with a link to inherited properties from the constructor applies the constructor function to it and returns either the value returned by the constructor or the new object in case the constructor returned something else which is not an object
at any time before or after creating new instances using a custom constructor you may modify the prototype object on the constructor function through the hidden link added to all objects created using this constructor see cheap trick in createnew the properties of the prototype object can be accessed on all these instances unless overridden by properties defined on the objects directly

2118831
inherited	properties
i can now create custom instances second i want instances created with customarray to inherited array properties third i want all instances created with customarray to have the empty method finally i can rewrite the whole example in a more concise way i can now create a custom array set a couple of values and empty it the issue is the above code does not work as expected
because unlike in regular arrays setting values in our custom array does not automagically increase the length properties of the array

2120198
folder	directory
believe it or not about once a month a user reports start-up failure the user has unzipped eclipse without selecting the use folder names option
make sure that the result of unzipping is an install tree with an eclipse directory at its root

2120527
int	chars
in c single quotes are used to denote single literal chars constants and the resulting type of such constants is int
so a is ok a1 is not because that s two chars

2120637
config	ini
this is not answering your question but in my opinion a better way to deal with config is actually to use a real config file like an ini or xml file
you could use the zend config class to read and write such files and this class can even deal with a plain php array as config

2120846
sorting	grouping	filtering	grouping
next i apply any sorting and filtering to the parent array perhaps by using an arraycollection wrapper and iterate through the parent copying the visible ones and their children if the parent is marked expanded to a display array
my grid them uses the display array as a simple not grouping dataprovider

2121459
atomic	interlocked
it doesn t mean arithmetic is atomic
the interlocked operations also act as memory barriers so yes interlocked.compareexchange will see the updated value

2122237
maven	pom.xml	m2e	pom.xml
look for something like that in your settings.xml or in global settings used by m2e windows preferences maven installations or in a project profile if you can t find anything like that then a workaround would be to install commons-compress manually
i m not 100 sure about the last error message but the two first one are definitely related you declared a dependency to the pom.xml so the .classpath is updated to point on it in your local repository but the file is can t be find in it and eclipse sts complains about this

2123560
hide	show
you should probably move all of the code following the ajax call in the open handler into the ajax callback along with the code to hide the txtemail element
i believe that the ajax call hasn t completed by the time the show method is invoked and thus the element doesn t exist at the time that you are going to hide it

2123649
nunit	mstest
normally with nunit i d use a generic or parametrised fixture but i m not sure whether mstest has similar capabilities
in light of this here s how i d do this with nunit in a form that should be reproducible using any unit test framework via the template method pattern

2123696
hide	show
however it doesn t hide the background completely once the vertical scrollbar appears and the grid height is not a divisble by the row height
add a new class to your project and paste the code show below

2124698
disk	ram
plus what most programmer s don t think about yes disk space it dirt cheap
but that wasted space is also relevant in your sql server ram memory and your database cache - and that space is not dirt cheap

2124973
implements	extends
a single abstract class is subclassed by similar classes that have a lot in common the implements parts of the abstract class but also have some differences the abstract methods
not always a class can extends only one class a class can implement more than one interface sun docs make a more detailed comparison abstract classes versus interfaces unlike interfaces abstract classes can contain fields that are not static and final and they can contain implements methods

2125022
chown	chmod
this is because a your attempted chmod chown may not work and b your application should respect the user privileges with which it is run - if these are not sufficient you should inform the user via whatever mechanism you do this
i would go with eilon s answer for the most part but would add the following caveat - i would not try to chown chmod a file unless you really need to if the purpose of your program is managing file permissions or acting as an installer of some sort

2125308
integer	unsigned
the prototype means that the function takes one integer arg and one arg which is a pointer to a size_t type
size_t is a type defined in a header file usually to be an unsigned int but the reason for not just using unsigned int x is to give compiler writers flexibility to use something else

2125429
strcpy	malloc
strcpy name fortran
we called malloc to allocate a memory block for 20 bytes no it is not 21 the reason i added 1 on to the size is for the 0 nul terminating character

2125633
int	chars
two and this is something weird i ve tried out once if and only if your identifier strings fit in 4 chars as in all your examples and they are ansi strings not unicode strings you can map strings to int directly
a 32-bit integer is equivalent in size to a 4-byte string so you can do any string identifier that s shorter than 4 chars would have to be padded with spaces and the strings are case-sensitive chil and chil yield different values

2125649
many-to-many	one-to-many
yes you cannot form a third-normal-form many-to-many relationship between two tables with just those two tables
you can form a one-to-many in one of the two directions but in order to get a true many-to-many you need something like item id primary key description category id primary key description itemcategory itemid foreign key references item id categoryid foreign key references category id you do not need a category in the item table unless you have some privileged category for an item which doesn t seem to be the case here

2126025
jobs	cron
unfortunately that s probably not an option you d have if this is on a managed host that doesn t give you the ability to set up cron jobs
i ve done this before with a cron job that went in and deleted session files older than x for some reason php s automatic cleanup wasn t doing the job

2126324
inline	inlining
in case anyone else is wondering what the actual .net implementation looks like here is the .net 4 code that attribute indicates the method will also be inline in ngen that is native images
as others have said isnullorempty is superior to the manual checks for purposes of maintainability and isn t likely to suffer in performance thanks to the jit compiler s runtime decisions about inlining see eric gunnerson s comments

2126370
textarea	textbox
if you want multiline text input you should be using textarea not input textbox
textbox are only a single line of text so no newlines

2126444
int	chars
unsigned int is of size 4
sizeof unsigned 4 it can hold 4 chars each of which is a byte in c not in java c# etc.

2126494
cpu	affinity
for example say you wanted to make sure that an application is never using more than 50 of the computing power of a dual-core machine i m not saying it s a good thing to do i m just giving an example then there s a very easy way to do it you could set the cpu affinity of your program to only one of the two cores
note that i don t recommend to do it in your case all i m saying here is for the sake of completeness that it exists it has valid uses and there s a reason why both linux and windows developers have written apis and end-user commands allowing to set the cpu affinity on a per-process basis these functionalities are fully available both to programmers and to end-users

2128669
int	double
value types such as int etc live on the stack
reference types live on the managed heap however if a reference type has for example has an instance variable of type double it will live along with its object on the heap no this is not correct

2128919
cpython	ironpython
one thing i know is that django has no official support for ironpython - just cpython and jython
in addition pil - which provides django s support for image fields - does not natively support ironpython though the ironclad project could help with that

2130251
submit	submission
you can enter a comment in the textbox and click submit
it doesn t submit the whole page like a traditional html form submission would which translates into usually a post but sometimes a get http request

2130251
post	get
it doesn t submit the whole page like a traditional html form submission would which translates into usually a post but sometimes a get http request
instead the browser will send probably a post request via xhr to the server and be notified of the response hence asynchronous

2130760
post	put
update i ve expanded this answer in a blog post called adding columns and default data to existing models
seed data shouldn t be put in a migration

2131333
wsimport	jaxws-maven-plugin
creating a web service client application always starts with an existing wsdl file unlike developing a web service provider and even if this is not the only way i d suggest to use the wsimport tool see 5 techniques for creating java web services from wsdl for other options but i won t cover them
so in your client project add the following snippet to your pom.xml the jaxws-maven-plugin wsimport mojo is bound by default to the generate-sources life cycle phase so running any phase posterior to generate-sources will trigger the jaxws wsimport goal

2132218
kubuntu	gnome
feedback on success it seems that in kubuntu any fonts not explicitly specified in eclipse s preferences come from the system
eclipse is a gnome app so its fonts among other stuff are controlled by system settings | appearance | gtk+ appearance ...and there i was able to fiddle the fonts to my satisfaction

2133126
children	parent
example for a parent object with a collection of children the parent can have a addchild method that ensure the coherence of the bi-directional relationship get the previous parent of the child
if not null remove the child from that old parent

2133429
client-side	server-side
the client-side here is generated based on the dc to also include databinding-helpful aspects like inpc and observablecollections that s it no magic
eg if there were some calculated properties on your server-side object that logic will not be present on the client

2133562
inline	inlining
from the compiler s point of view the added variables from the inline procedure may consume additional registers and in an area where register pressure is already high this may force spilling which causes additional ram accesses. languages with jit compilers and runtime class loading have other tradeoffs since the virtual methods aren t known statically yet the jit can collect runtime profiling information such as method call frequency design implementation and evaluation of optimizations in a just-in-time compiler for java talks about method inlining of static methods and dynamically loaded classes and its improvements on performance
practicing judo java under dynamic optimizations claims that their inlining policy is based on the code size and profiling information

2133562
inline	inlining
to avoid code explosion we do not inline a method with a bytecode size of more than 25 bytes
to avoid inlining along a deep call chain inlining stops when the accumulated inlined bytecode size along the call chain exceeds 40 bytes. although they have runtime profiling information method call frequency they are still careful to avoid inlining large functions or chains of functions to prevent bloat

2134494
min	max
aggregate functions like min max aren t supported in indexed views
you have to do the min max in the query surrounding the view

2134494
min	max
you have to do the min max in the query surrounding the view
there s a full definition on what is and isn t allowed within an indexed view here sql 2005 . quote the avg max min stdev stdevp var or varp aggregate functions

2134494
aggregate-functions	sum
there s a full definition on what is and isn t allowed within an indexed view here sql 2005 . quote the avg max min stdev stdevp var or varp aggregate-functions
if avg expression is specified in queries referencing the indexed view the optimizer can frequently calculate the needed result if the view select list contains sum expression and count_big expression

2134843
inherited	subclassing
alex s on-point diagnosis of the problem notwithstanding i would strongly argue that you should not multiply inherited from dict in this case or in general for that matter. while it may seem convenient to subclassing from it and automatically inherited all the dict behaviour dicts and builtin types in general are often subject to shortcuts internally
for example the get method won t call your modified __getitem__ even when it does get the item and there are numerous such cases. additionally multiple inherited involving builtin types requires that the in-memory layout of instances of all the types is compatible

2134888
getter	setter
getter are needed occasionally but shouldn t be added unless seen to be absolutely unavoidable
setter should be avoided at all costs

2135129
int	double
the return type of readnumber or more accurately the type of k variable is probably not an int
when the compiler wants to infer the type of the mt it fails since k which is specified as the loop bound has one type probably something like double and the loop step implicitly the int constant 1 has the type int

2135224
waitpid	fork
don t forget a call to waitpid end of obvious question mode
i m assuming a bit here but you re not doing anything with the pid returned by the fork call

2135261
bazaar	rcs	bazaar	cvs
since you describe the problem as emacs-specific it might be something wrong with the emacs mode you are using for driving bazaar
generally vc does not do what you would expect because it s designed for centralized version control systems such as rcs sccs cvs and subversion

2135302
free	malloc	free	realloc
then the call is equivalent to free malloc 0
in this case malloc 0 and realloc malloc 0 0 are not equivalent

2135302
realloc	malloc
in this case malloc 0 and realloc malloc 0 0 are not equivalent
note that there is an interesting case here in the second case when malloc 0 returns non- null on success it may still return null to indicate failure

2135302
realloc	malloc
this will result in a call like realloc null 0 which would be equivalent to malloc 0 which may or may not return null
i am not sure if the omission in c99 is an oversight or if it means that in c99 realloc ptr 0 for non- null ptr is not equivalent to free ptr

2135302
free	realloc
i am not sure if the omission in c99 is an oversight or if it means that in c99 realloc ptr 0 for non- null ptr is not equivalent to free ptr
i just tried this with and the above is equivalent to free ptr

2135302
free	malloc	free	realloc	calloc	malloc
also the return value from malloc on the lhs hasn t been free d yet so any other malloc calloc or realloc may not return that value
this means that if you wrote your condition as you won t see possible on the output unless both malloc and realloc fail and return null

2135947
post	get
note that the code you post is not valid java code
the bytecode you de-compiled to get this was most likely obfuscated by some obfuscator that also obfuscates string constants the only obfuscater i use occasionally is zkm and that does something similar

2136235
inherited	base-class
first deriving from the .net collection classes is generally ill-advised because they don t offer virtual methods for calls not inherited from object
this can result in bugs when passing your derived collection in via a base-class reference somewhere

2136302
inherited	subclassing
edit after comment well there is a own section for this in the documentation class inherited and model managers aren t quite a perfect match for each other
managers are often specific to the classes they are defined on and inheriting them in subclassing isn t necessarily a good idea

2136350
switching	screens
bit 8 is found in 3d4h index 7 bit 4. 3dah r input status #1 register bit 0 either vertical or horizontal retrace active if set 1 light pen has triggered if set 2 light pen switching is open if set 3 vertical retrace in progress if set 4-5 shows two of the 6 color outputs depending on 3c0h index 12h. attr bit 4-5 out bit 4 out bit 5 0 blue red 1 i blue green 2 i red i green 3dah w feature control register bit 0 output to pin 21 of the feature connector. 1 output to pin 20 of the feature connector.
hmmm..dunno if this is a worthy answer if i recall you need to use inport inportb outport outportb to the ports to control the ega registers this was taken from the excellent faqsysw a vast collection of materials ranging from graphics demo maths fractals to compressions the original archive was found here and here . 3c0h attribute controller address register bit 0-4 address of data register to write to port 3c0h. 5 if set screens output is enabled and the palette can not be modified if clear screens output is disabled and the palette can be modified. port 3c0h is special in that it is both address and data-write register. an internal flip-flop remembers whether it is currently acting as address or data register

2136650
setinterval	settimeout
setinterval will call the function at your specified interval
use setinterval not settimeout

2137078
uiview	uiwindow
each of these also has such an array and can contain uiview
i assume you mean not full screen generally the topmost view is a uiwindow and to this you add any uiview subclass you like such as uislider

2137078
uiview	uiwindow	uiview	subviews
i assume you mean not full screen generally the topmost view is a uiwindow and to this you add any uiview subclass you like such as uislider
your uiview has a subviews uitabview i don t know specifically but i would guess it has two subviews one of which is visible at a time and one of these is the uitableview

2137515
free	malloc
so you re either still hanging onto a pointer that s been free most likely and using it or you re just trashing random memory
the error isn t actually happening when you call malloc

2137659
free	strdup
since you re doing strdup you should free the values using free
i am not sure if visual_mem_free calls free

2138037
yacc	bison
just need to wrapper to convert the real token to yacc bison token eg via yylex
instead of doing you just need to include the file with the token type in the declaration part #include mytoken_enum.h ... token tokentype1 token tokentype2 token tokentype3 ... edit this can not be done as you see from the numbers above bison just numbers the tokens sequentially and it is used shifted in parser lookup tables as indices for speed simply

2138094
maven	pom.xml
downloading a pom.xml is really a central concept in maven to support transitive dependencies actually a dependency isn t just a jar see 3.5.5
maven s dependency management for nice details on that so i don t know if you can prevent it

2138221
accessor	properties
previously they were in with accessor implementations class-method +load +initialize +sharedfoo others initializer dealloc finalize custom accessor implementations protocol conformance methods grouped by protocol usually with #pragma mark directives notification handler methods usually declared in a class extension up at the top other methods usually declared in a class extension up at the top within the dealloc method don t use accessor messages implicit properties accesses or explicit
any impure custom accessor may not be safe to call on a partially-deallocated object

2138239
width	margin
as you have noticed if the screen is smaller than your content width it doesn t appear to be centered
this is because there is no space for a margin on the left or right of the page and it would be inconsistent to start the browser scrollbar in the middle of the page

2138477
hash	salt
we then save both the hash and the salt as separate fields within the users table
in this scenario not only would a hacker need to guess the password they d have to guess the salt as well. adding salt to the clear text improves security now if a hacker tries a dictionary attack he must hash his 100 000 entries with the salt of every user row

2138563
cpu	affinity
common problems in this general area are process migration in multi-cpu multi-core systems rdtsc not consistent across cores in multi-cpu multi-core systems other processes taking cpu time also interrupts i o screen activity etc automatic cpu clock frequency scaling vm page faults etc solutions if you re running a single threaded process on a multi-cpu multi-core systems then use cpu affinity to lock the process to a specific core
use taskset from the command line or call sched_setaffinity from within you code. make sure you have no other processes taking cpu time disable screen savers or other desktop animations and make sure there are no screen updates while your code is running

2138588
hash	salt
if you must convert a hash to its string representation you can use convert.tobase64string and convert.frombase64string to convert it back
you should note that you cannot use the equality operator on byte arrays it checks references and so you should simply loop through both arrays checking each byte thus always use a new salt per password

2141319
ssl	https
my task is to make it secure using https ssl or tsl
if it s just about one-way ssl then this question doesn t have much to do with web services actually

2141373
realloc	memset
realloc returns a pointer to the resized memory it doesn t necessarily resize it in-place
so you should do if you really want to know what the memset call should be you need to set to zero the memory starting at colors+colorcount and set i+1-colorcount members to zero but as i said above all bytes zero is not guaranteed to be a null pointer so your memset is useless anyway

2141379
force.com	salesforce
force.com fails to deliver on one of the key cloud promises scalability
it is a very resource-constrained environment and developing even crm products on it can be a trial if your customer s model of their business is not in line with salesforce s

2141456
jlist	jlabel
you could just override tostring and display them in a jlist
btw this will not solve your problem but javadoc for equals says note that it is generally necessary to override the hashcode method whenever this method is overridden if a card extends a jlabel and you create an instance for every card you have you should not have to override equals at all

2142731
hide	show
to not grasp the idea of different complexity classes big-o by itself really doesn t cut it will not spell the death of the computer scientist but it will hide a considerable portion of the field from his or her view
yes usually the halting problem is show as the first but they never get it the first time around

2142754
post	get
for a request that has a real effect you have to check that it s submitted by the post method
but the way to do that is to check explicitly not rely on being empty for a get

2143045
int	chars
int chars and other ordinal types do not have method tables so there s no way to add methods or override them which is really the heart of inheritance
int is an ordinal type not a class

2143252
stdout	stderr
svn command line errors go to stderr not stdout which is why you aren t able to see them
what you want to do is redirect stderr to stdout and then to determine the cause of the error

2143252
stdout	stderr
what you want to do is redirect stderr to stdout and then to determine the cause of the error
sample output this is not ideal because it mixes stderr with stdout when it would otherwise be unnecessary but i don t know of another way to get the desired output in this case

2143502
int	double
casting a double to an int does not round it ll discard the fraction part
int 99.99999 will be 99

2144188
put	get
if so latex takes the contents of square brackets as the argument if not the next token is put back into the input stream and the default empty argument is used instead
so to get your idea to work you have to use square brackets to delimit the optional argument when present you should have better luck with this notation

2144878
dojo	webix
the library was lean 128kb gzip+minified for all 55 widgets as of 2015 faster than extjs dojo and others and the design is pleasant-looking
the current version of webix v6 as of nov 2018 got heavier 400 - 676kb minified but not gzipped

2145325
int	chars
also the correct constructor is bufferedimage int width int height int imagetype you inverted width and height
if i am not mistaken you draw chars at x 0 y 0 where x y are the baseline of the first chars ... in this graphics context s coordinate system

2145442
jobs	cron
you will avoid server overload that way. if you can t create cron jobs on your server i suggest you switch your hosting provider otherwise the website you linked is your only viable alternative but you are depending on some third party this way which isn t really cool
use a php mailer class such as phpmailer or swiftmailer you can send mails directly trough smtp that way which will be much faster. and yes sending large quantities of emails is best done via cron so you send x emails every minute

2145941
identifier	ambiguous
using a verbatim identifier allows the exact intent to be specified in such rare cases
the attribute is not ambiguous although it would be if there was an attribute class named xattributeattribute

2146219
persistent	transient
i think this is the wrong approach for data whose lifespan is not expected to be persistent .
transient data if data is useful only for one request then it is typically stored in the httprequest fine

2146472
post	get
see the post redirect get page on wikipedia about this
if you are submitting a for with search parameters you are trying to get some data not modify some

2146530
public	protected
signals cannot be public or private
qt signals are protected class methods

2146764
post	get	put	get
this allows user agents to represent other methods such as post put and delete in a special way so that the user is made aware of the fact that a possibly unsafe action is being requested
naturally it is not possible to ensure that the server does not generate side-effects as a result of performing a get request

2146921
ssl	https
because ssl operates below http and has no knowledge of higher-level protocols ssl servers can only strictly present one certificate for a particular ip port combination
this means that in most cases it is not feasible to use name-based virtual hosting with https

2147601
keystore	jks
in java there is a keystore class obtained with a given type one of them being pkcs12
you may then find in the jca documentation in key management the following as of jdk 6 standards for storing trusted certificates in pkcs12 have not been established yet and thus jks or jceks should be used for trusted certificates

2148492
vim	emacs
vim may not be
you may want to try both vi and emacs

2148517
persistent	transient
you are also right to note that the default json marshaller only renders persistent fields
when rendering my domain objects i ve found it useful to create json object marshallers so that unwanted properties are not rendered but it would also solve your transient issue too

2148808
msg	eml
the code is based on mail msg tutorial
loading an eml file correctly is not as easy as it looks

2148817
folder	directory
as long as you choose a folder which is not a subfolder of programs you should be ok
when you compile a pas file the compiler will put a dcu file with the same name in the same directory

2148932
lisp	smalltalk
try the common lisp object system clos
it is not pure oop like smalltalk but the type hierarchy in lisp is at least complete which is more than can be said for java and most other languages even oo languages don t have generic methods multidispatch method combinations esp before after and around

2148965
msg	eml
common sources of eml files include msg saved from outlook express or thunderbird msg downloaded from imap or pop3 servers
loading an eml file correctly is not as easy as it looks

2149759
websphere	ibm
now to use ibm process server you ll need a license you ll need an app server to deploy it at random websphere some ibm machines maybe some expensive connectors some licenses for the modeling tools etc
so i m not surprised that ibm makes noise about it even if don t really have the same feeling selling such a solution must be a good deal for them not even mentioning the consulting they will add to the bill

2150027
xsl-fo	xslt
but as we have in several scenarios if you already have an application that works with xml structured documents and information and have a requirement to generate pdf files then xsl-fo is a very good way to achieve this
in that case you probably have already some developers with xml and xslt knowledge for whom it is not a big deal to set up templates that generate the xsl-fo structure that can be parsed by a generator

2150365
cpu	processors
if for example the processors has registers capable of holding extended-precision floating-point numbers and doing arithmetic with extended-precision does not take any more cpu time than doing arithmetic with double-precision a compiler is likely to generate code using extended-precision
on such a processors you might not get the same results as you would on another processors

2150435
children	parent
if you now select only the last children that are also not the first childen of their parent element you ll get only the last children that are not the only children of their parent element
try this selector td last-child not first-child the explanation in you case the last child is also the first child as it s the only child of the parent element

2150837
ant	maven
nearly all examples have an ant build.xml file as well and there is a readme.txt file telling you how to run the examples
and if are not into learning how to maven you could consider james strachans newest tool called mop which is a command line launcher to run java stuff

2150888
ubuntu	linux
copy this code my solr startup script into that file then run chkconfig --add solr or on ubuntu update-rc.d solr defaults .
or if your linux distribution doesn t have chkconfig or update-rc.d link etc init.d solr to etc rc3.d s99solr and etc rc5.d s99solr and etc rc3.d k01solr and etc rc5.d k01solr ln -s etc init.d solr etc rc3.d s99solr ln -s etc init.d solr etc rc5.d s99solr ln -s etc init.d solr etc rc3.d k01solr ln -s etc init.d solr etc rc5.d k01solr now on reboot solr will startup in run levels 3 and 5 console with network full gui

2150964
hash	md5
skein however is fast enough you do not really need the hash function to be much faster than the harddisk although faster code may free some cpu for other threads to run but then again a 2.4 ghz pc often has several cores
personally i would suggest using an established standard sha-256 or sha-512 if you want to be conservative -- but for some tasks md5 and even md4 are good enough and md4 is really fast and its compact code uses very little l1 cache

2151030
prepare	execute
given they are all similar you might want to use prepare statements
ado does not support multiple statements to be execute in a single operation you will need to execute them sequentially one after the other

2151321
int	chars
41 this implies that unsigned arithmetic does not overflow because a result that cannot be represented by the resulting unsigned int type is reduced modulo the number that is one greater than the largest value that can be represented by the resulting unsigned int type
basically second passing d in the format string of printf to print unsigned chars variable

2151322
implements	modifiers
by the way you are not correctly implements the interface
if you want to use explicit interface implementation you cannot specify an access modifiers

2151335
int	chars
the result of the assignment should be predictable 3.9.1 4 unsigned int declared unsigned shall obey the laws of arithmetic modulo 2 n where n is the number of bits in the value representation of that particular size of integer.17 17 this implies that unsigned arithmetic does not overflow because a result that cannot be represented by the resulting unsigned int type is reduced modulo the number that is one greater than the largest value that can be represented by the resulting unsigned int type
in addition sizeof chars is defined as 1 and sizeof unsigned chars sizeof chars so you should see the same result regardless of implementation assuming you don t have bytes with funny sizes other than 8

2152230
udp	tcp
remember udp is datagram oriented all operations are on those packets not on bytes.
a different scenario would be faced if you used tcp sockets..

2153138
executable	upx
delphi 2010 made the default executable about 30 larger probably because of rtti included in the rtl vcl units so you can use an older version of delphi for smaller exe-size
as others have mentioned upx is a great tool too the false positives by virusscanners are not that frequent in my experience

2153575
stdout	fflush
by default stdout is line buffered on most systems so your prompt may not appear before your call to scanf
to make sure your prompt shows do fflush stdout

2153707
hash	md5
or you have to use md5 library not tested to create the md5 hash out of any password
vbulletin needs md5 of the password not the actual password

2154165
factors	matrix
first of all the complexity does not give the factors
some linear or subquadratic algorithms are simply not useful because they are eating so much time and resources that they are not adequate for the problem on hand coppersmith-winograd matrix multiplication . then your computation may have all kludges you can only detect by experiment

2154262
folder	directory
then i have an exe file which is a demo to show how to link to my dll file this exe file doesn t have to be in the same folder as my dll file as long as the dll file can be found in the path i m assuming that the end user may or may not put it in the same folder
then when running the exe file the current directory is not the one containing python25.dll and that s why the search order is used and some other python25.dll can be found before mine

2154396
subclass	inherited
the advantage is already described in the very same sun tutorial you linked to a final method cannot be overridden in a subclass
this is discussed in the lesson on interfaces and inherited

2154778
persistent	transient
consider this short example when this class is fed to the jpa it persistent the gender and id but doesn t try to persistent the helper boolean methods - without transient the underlying system would complain that the entity class person is missing setmale and setfemale methods and thus wouldn t persistent person at all
as others have said transient is used to mark fields which shouldn t be persisted

2155358
put	get
if you want something documented and therefore more reliable you can always put your string value as a resource and refer to it
putting an escaped space in front of the number seems to work the escaped space doesn t appear in the value returned by get

2155406
gtk	gdk	pygtk	gdk
if your version of gtk pygtk is recent enough key events have a attribute
it s not documented in the pygtk reference but it s in the gdk api documentation and is exposed through pygtk

2155798
mouse	keyboard
the more i used the keyboard movement in vim the less i wanted to use the mouse
it doesn t help that extended periods of time where i m constantly moving from keyboard to mouse can take a toll on my wrist

2155798
mouse	keyboard
it doesn t help that extended periods of time where i m constantly moving from keyboard to mouse can take a toll on my wrist
if you want to force doing things the vim way unplug your mouse for a while

2155861
post	get
personally i d post a message on the dev mailing list
now if this isn t really clear or if you don t get a satisfying answer it s always possible to write a custom application to consume messages and forward them to a different broker and it is not that complicated

2155896
mouse	keyboard
the mouse seems fast but in reality it isn t precise so you lose time in addition to the constant back and forth with the keyboard
vim has a long list of moving commands see help usr_03 which when mastered are faster than the mouse in most situations

2156046
uiview	subviews
edit with thanks to cocoafan this situation is muddled up by the fact that nsview and uiview handle things differently
for nsview desktop mac development only you can simply use the following for uiview ios development only you can safely use makeobjectsperformselector because the subviews property will return a copy of the array of subviews thank you to tommy for pointing out that makeobjectsperformselector appears to modify the subviews array while it is being enumerated which it does for nsview but not for uiview

2156344
client-side	server-side
while you can place controls on the page that will emit javascript control validation and there are a variety of ways in which javascript is employed to simplify webforms development asp.net it isn t really about client-side programming in the same way that jquery is
honestly i wouldn t want asp.net to wrap jquery as it would just lead to impedence mismatches between how you handle client and server-side processing

2156814
width	height
with css you could also specify just the maximum width and maximum height
just specify one dimension either the width or the height but not both and it will keep the ratio

2156899
inline	inlining
i wouldn t rule it out though as compiler optimization has gotten pretty advanced. one way to tell that this code doesn t quite do what we want is is still legal and clearly this is not getting inline
to get full inlining we need to template by value so the function is fully available in the template

2156963
public	protected
1a protected inheritance means the child can access everything it could in public inheritance but others using that object can only see the public interface to the child anything in it s parent is hidden
1b private inheritance results in all public functions of a class being inherited as private functions - meaning they can not be called from the child or accessed from a client of your object

2157486
cruisecontrol	teamcity
in addition you cannot lose by looking at cruisecontrol which is free
teamcity from jetbrains is also a great option

2157842
hash	md5
similarly you could make a query string something like u usera time 1347 date 01282001 and then run it through a hash of some sort
when it comes back in unhash it so you couldn t use md5 check the time stamp and see how long it has been since that timestamp was created

2158007
inherited	properties
you should not inherited from person or use composition to have person on personviewmodel
instead you should add the properties that you need to the personviewmodel and map between them

2158015
rank	max
alternately you could not use max and use order by rank limit 1
mysql doesn t have any analytic ranking functionality but you can use a variable to artificially create a rank value in order to see what rank is associated with udid 0000 use need the max for if the user has multiple high score values

2158221
post	get
that way if it s the blogger he won t get emails on his own post but everyone else will
if it s not the blogger he ll get the email because his user id didn t match that of the commenter

2159001
implements	sealed
edit you cannot derive from a type nested within itself but you can implements an interface declared nested in a base type
as long as the nested type is visible in your scope and not sealed then yes

2159072
put	get
jquery will not put the value into the created element s generated html
both .attr value blah and .val get the current value of what s been entered or changed in the text input and allow you to see that value when you look at the input on the page or submit it to the server

2159489
int	chars
mrk is declared as a pointer to an int but you are not dereferencing it
replace with chars assess int mrk in the definition of assess similarly you declared prototyped assess as replace with chars assess int mrk next is not legal syntax

2159502
int	chars
passing pointers for int isn t a speedup since you end up passing a pointer that is the same size as an int anyway
your function prototype is void and the implementation is chars as a return type

2159549
int	chars
have a look at the fixed version prototype assess was using a pointer to int but it was not needed as you were calling the function with a parameter as being pass-by-value not pass-by-reference
the function was of the wrong return type in your prototype you had void yet coded the function to return a chars that explains the error message your compiler notified about

2159549
int	chars
lastly but not least you returned a error again a string type i made that to be n to represent n ot good #include stdio.h #include string.h protoype chars assess int mrk
main method start point of program void main int mark

2160078
submit	submission
see here the second answer hehe the accepted one actually uses multiple forms and here this one is actually using some funky stuff that might be a bit of an overkill and not entirely appropriate when generating an unknown number of submit buttons but insteresting nonetheless
from the snippet you ve posted i m going to presume that you don t care about actually submission any form data to your action - just invoking the correct action with maybe some data that can be specified directly in the action url like an id index if that is the case then you don t even need a submit button for this

2160597
versioning	upgrade
the rc versioning is not officially supported by microsoft so if you go that way you will have to rely on the community which btw is great
the other risk is that some features might change in the rtm and if you d like to upgrade you may need to retest the whole application

2161072
inherited	subclassing
there is no polymorphism here only inherited of the contents of a name space
static methods and all fields do not have polymorphic dispatch in java so can only be hidden by subclassing not overridden

2161167
public	protected
so in test you can do this because the variables were declared using var making them implicitly public
if you declare them with private or protected like so you will not be able to access the variables from another object

2161693
disk	ram
you will need very fast disk to support a 40gb database with 4gb of ram multiple striped drives would be a bare minimum
your machine is quite low spec however as you ve not even mentioned what disk you re using that is most likely the problem

2162832
mouse	keyboard
you can check the cpu usage to find out when the computer is idle but it s not necessarily a good idea or you can listen for mouse keyboard activity
to check cpu usage in c# use the following code to check for keyboard or mouse activity you ll need to use a keyboard mouse hook

2163027
popupwindow	pop-up	popupwindow	dialog
there s also a popupwindow dom event not documented as far as i can see
like we see while browsing www.rediffmail.com is a poor definition so i m going to assume you re talking about regular pop-up windows with title bar etc not a javascript-implemented in-tab dialog and not new pages that open in new tabs

2163381
client-side	server-side
the cachingallowed attribute actually configures the server-side caching not the client-side caching as you seem to expect
client-side caching is to be done with appropriate response headers

2163622
mouse	keyboard
you can use getkeystate to find out whether a key or mouse button was pressed
do not use getasynckeystate because that api will tell you the current state of the keyboard mouse buttons which may have changed when you handle the lbn_selchange message

2164465
jboss	geronimo	glassfish	geronimo
actually why not just replacing your servlet container with a full java ee server if you need ejbs i don t get it something like jboss or glassfish
if yes then maybe have a look at openejb the ejb container implementation for geronimo

2164883
firefox	safari
i m trying to do something similar and i just discovered a trick that works with firefox
if you combine it with the trick for ie you can have one that works on both main browsers i m not sure if it works in safari and i know it doesn t work in chrome in order for this to work you also need to have a hidden link somewhere on the page like this it s a bit hacky but it works

2165291
mouse	keyboard
problem is that by default keyboard mouse messages are routed only to the window currently in focus and typically in games you want to be able to switch focus to a hi-score view enemies on radar view or whatever and still maintain interactivity
the easy solution would be for every module which requires keyboard mouse input to query for it directly and not rely on message forwarding - hence directinput

2165677
allocator	stl
on the other side if the caller does already have a c-string no temporary or unneeded std string needs to be constructed which can be costly for longer strings it s a heap allocator
also i once used it to resolve the following case my interface took std string s but had to be implemented in an external module thus the stl binary versions of both the module and the caller module had to match exactly or it would have crashed not really good for a portable library

2166097
width	height
they do however impact positioning of siblings within the container depending on whether those sibling are inline or block level elements and whether they have width or not
in order to make the height of the floats impact the height of the container you must have an element after them that clears them

2166350
put	get
ok so most of the dwm stuff is handled by a dll called dwmapi.dll it is all in c++ com because that is how microsoft writes it s apis you may have noticed that to call the methods in the api you have to use some unmarshalled boolean types etc this is because it has to reach unmanaged code some of the operations that need to take place are too dangerous for .net to watch over without interfering you may also notice that all the return types aren t actually returns you put in vars as out types so the code can modify them in memory and then that information can be read back into your managed .net code
as far as a way to get similar effects in windows xp the only way i can think of is using windows blinds and then making a translucent wpf form with a gradient background with a glass like effect it would be quite easy to do but the window will look out of place in vista and xp and i don t think that it is such a good idea

2166940
cpu	processors
if you have only 2 cores cpu processors hyperthreads you know what i mean then openmp cannot give such a tremendous increase in performance but will help
the maximum gain you can have is divide your time by the number of processors so it will still take 100 - 150 ms per frame

2167139
allocator	stl
if this option does not fill well alternative is to could be to define dedicated allocator
here is a good paper about it creating stl containers in shared memory there is also excellent ion gaztañaga s boost.interprocess library with shared_memory_object and related features

2167218
maven	pom.xml
with maven things are relative to the directory containing the pom.xml which is represented by the property and is called the base directory
there are however some situations where you could have to specify a relative path if a pom.xml is not directly above a given module using a element see this example if modules are not nested if you use a flat layout using a relative path in the various elements like in this example

2168000
gtk	cairo
if you re not on linux unix you may need a diferent gtk library since gtk-x11-2.0 is specific to the x window system
just successfully compiled your code after doing the following add the following two includes and compile with gcc pkg-config --cflags --libs gtk+-2.0 test.c -o test the pkg-config gives the following output -i usr include gtk-2.0 -i usr lib gtk-2.0 include -i usr include atk-1.0 -i usr include cairo -i usr include pango-1.0 -i usr include glib-2.0 -i usr lib glib-2.0 include -i usr include pixman-1 -i usr include freetype2 -i usr include libpng12 -lgtk-x11-2.0 -lgdk-x11-2.0 -latk-1.0 -lgio-2.0 -lpangoft2-1.0 -lgdk_pixbuf-2.0 -lpangocairo-1.0 -lcairo -lpango-1.0 -lfreetype -lfontconfig -lgobject-2.0 -lgmodule-2.0 -lglib-2.0 so you need to link with the following libraries gtk-x11-2.0 gdk-x11-2.0 atk-1.0 gio-2.0 pangoft2-1.0 gdk_pixbuf-2.0 pangocairo-1.0 cairo pango-1.0 freetype fontconfig gobject-2.0 gmodule-2.0 glib-2.0 you may be able to leave out a few if you want to try just start with gdk_pixbuf-2.0 and see if you still get any undefined references when you link

2168223
pascal	delphi
the next code does not produce wrong additional zero since all that staff is just a legacy in delphi i think it must work in turbo pascal
i have tested the problem on delphi 2009 console applications

2168539
free	malloc
although most of you indicate that you shouldn t write your own memory manager it could still be useful if you have a specific requirement or situation in which you are sure you can write a faster version you want to write you own memory-overwrite logic to help in debugging you want to keep track of the places where memory is leaked if you want to write your own memory manager it s important to split it in the following 4 parts a part that intercepts the calls to malloc free c and new delete c++
this is quite easy for new delete just global new and delete operators but also for malloc free this is possible overwrite the functions of the crt redefine calls to malloc free ... a part that represents the entry point of your memory manager and which is called by the interceptor part a part that implements the actual memory manager

2169107
printf	strcpy	printf	strncpy
vfprintf vsprintf printf just ms do not support c99 use printf family
strncpy is perfectly safe if you read the manual strcpy strcat use strncpy and strncat and read specifications

2169107
strcpy	strncpy
strncpy is perfectly safe if you read the manual strcpy strcat use strncpy and strncat and read specifications
strncpy may be not null terminated so.

2169619
passenger	thin
it s fast faster than passenger doesn t use much memory less than passenger and isn t too hard to set up and maintain
i m a big fan of thin

2170106
hide	show
if not then hide it
if you are doing it with jquery do this in your document.ready i am assuming here that it is originally show and you are hiding it when the page loads

2170130
post	put
a post request generated via a form submission or a ajax request expects the result that data is changed on the server
similarly the two rails faked versions of put and delete also are not actions you could simply navigate to using a browser

2170377
openmpi	mpich
i read your post again you will use openmpi you still have to supply machines file to mpiexec command but you do not have to mess with mpdboot
couple things you need to tell mpi where to launch processes assuming you are using mpich look at mpiexec help section and find machine file or equivalent description

2170399
math.h	sqrt
define update in response to your comment sqrt is defined in math.h
round does not exist in math.h for the windows libraries

2171541
heapsort	in-place
in these cases algorithms like heapsort usually offer comparable speed and are far less complex
additionally unlike the standard merge sort in-place merge sort is not a stable sort

2171586
subclass	abstract-class
a subclass of httpservlet doesn t have to implement methods in order to make its own functionality work
one cannot instantiate abstract-class so you have to subclass them in order to use it

2171586
subclass	abstract-class
one cannot instantiate abstract-class so you have to subclass them in order to use it
in the subclass you can still implement your own methods or override parent methods

2171878
abstract-class	superclass	superclass	subclassing
having a common superclass makes it slightly easier because you can have the new object add its own class to a global class collection if not already present in the superclass constructor but unfortunately this will not work for abstract-class because no instances are ever created
keeping track of superclass subclassing relations for a known subset of classes is easy enough

2171878
superclass	subclassing
keeping track of superclass subclassing relations for a known subset of classes is easy enough
but this can miss intermediate classes that are added later if you have these classes and add a and c to the tree and asked it for the superclass of c it would give you a and if you later added b it would replace a as the superclass of c but not until the wrong styler had been returned for some instances of c

2172461
operands	scalar
that is if the left operands is true the right operands is not even evaluated
scalar or list context propagates down to the right operands if it is evaluated

2172475
versioning	upgrade
for the last part if the customer has a higher versioning of the .net framework then your application will work just fine
quick clarification if you upgrade to vs2008 you cannot target any of the 1.x frameworks

2172872
post	get
tags cannot be used to create http post
this attack is simply an http get request made to any url

2172876
vb6	vba
i have no personal experience doing this although i have used vba vb6 and have written vb6 dlls that are add-ins for other 3rd party software although not office
the easiest way would be to convert your vba code to a vb6 com add-in

2172876
vb6	vba
the easiest way would be to convert your vba code to a vb6 com add-in
then you shouldn t have to change the guts of your code since vba is 99 identical to vb6 and you can code against the same office object model

2172967
post	get	put	get
this allows user agents to represent other methods such as post put and delete in a special way so that the user is made aware of the fact that a possibly unsafe action is being requested
naturally it is not possible to ensure that the server does not generate side-effects as a result of performing a get request

2173286
super	self
here is actual example where super dealloc must be last otherwise the call to removefromrunloop will cause crash
i m not sure what happens inside nsoutputstream s removefromrunloop but it seems to access self in this case

2173420
typedef	struct
sockaddr is a struct not just a typedef for a character array
you need to pass getpeername the address to an actual sockaddr struct and then build the string from the sa_data field of that struct--and that s assuming that sa_data is actually a string for your address type which the documentation doesn t suggest you can actually count on

2173460
free	malloc	free	realloc
in the above line this means that variable is null and we ve lost access to the memory it pointed to but that memory hasn t been free
the correct idiom is this the reason you should use the second one is because with realloc failure is bad but is quite recoverable in many situations unlike malloc where failure usually means stop everything and die. this is a more contentious issue but it is questionable whether or not you should cast the return value of malloc and realloc like you do

2173460
int	double
if say we forgot to and we called malloc the version without a cast would cause a compiler error implicit casts from int to aren t allowed while the version with the cast would wrongly tell the compiler i know this sounds crazy but cast it anyway. most compilers will give you a warning for implicit or incompatable declarations of built-in functions like malloc but the cast does make it harder to find
say you have some data later you discover that you need more precision on your data and have to make this a double array

2173615
division	modulo
i added a gltranslatef method right before entering the loop first i was unsuccessfully trying to translate the scene using a brute cameraposx tile_height division didn t work
we have to translate the offset by which the tile extends beyond the screen not the total cameraposx offset so we re using the modulo instead of division

2173869
profiling	benchmarking
iow in the end if you truly care about performance you must carefully benchmarking and separately profiling your actual program s not just toy micro-benchmarks in the general case
when essentially unlimited memory is available which will invariably be the case in tiny benchmarking although often not in real-world problems

nsurl	nsstring
you do not need to create an nsurl from it since it already is one and trying to treat it as a string in any way will cause an exception
you may be about to object to my claim on the grounds of this previous line your objection would be that the declaration clearly says that first is a pointer to an nsstring so i must be wrong

2175324
cpu	processors
you can only additional cpu power by dividing your tasks into chunks that can be worked on by separate threads which will then be run on the idle cores
if your program it the only program that has something to do not wait for io its thread will always be assigned to a processors core

2175382
postgresql	informix
pluses there is pl python so you can use python from postgresql you can create standalone programs using python db api there is doc about database programming and postgresql in details you can use jython if you like jvm environment especially jdbc driver examples of usage converting pdf ms word and oopenoffice documents saved in blobs to text to index it importing data from various sources not only cvs
python is really strong at converting text data testing drivers while some our apps are native and use odbc or jdbc drivers and jython can work with both drivers for odbc there is jdbc-odbc bridge on my other posts on so you can see i use python jython with other databases as oracle and informix

2175390
inherited	properties
generally inherited is chosen over composition there for 2 reasons the object is effectively uncopyable even if polymorphism may not be that useful inherited leads to ebo or empty base optimization while an attribute will be addressable and thus will occupy memory in each instance of the class even if it does not actually need it the compiler has the possibility not to add this overhead for a base class
you could alternatively declare the operators private and not define them in your own class but the code would be less self-documenting and you would not be able to automatically search for those class that have this properties then unless you have a full-blown parser

2175552
hide	show
drupal does not allow for dynamic menu items but it can hide certain menu items if the user is not allowed to go there
referring to your example if you create both the links and use the permission system to restrict the creation of those node types to certain roles drupal will only show the menu items if the user has the required role

2175585
folder	directory
it s always going to be quicker to check in a database than to check if a file exists though so if speed is the primary concern use a hierarchical folder structure and keep all the filenames in a database
if you re going to be producing a lot of these images it doesn t seem very scalable to keep them all in one flat directory

2175772
children	parent
nth-child scans the children of the parent no matter what their styling is
the counting in nth-child is relative to the parent element not the previous selector

2176431
inline	inlining
in my experience bloat hasn t been a problem header only libraries give compilers greater ability to inline but they do not force compilers to inline - many compilers treat the inline keyword as nothing more than a command to ignore multiple identical definitions
compilers usually have options to optimize to control the amount of inlining

2176581
post	get
a post cannot be bookmarked
attempting to bookmark a post will just result in a get operation on the url. there s a very good reason for this get requests are supposed to be idempotent - that is making the same get request numerous times should result in the same response

2176581
post	get
attempting to bookmark a post will just result in a get operation on the url. there s a very good reason for this get requests are supposed to be idempotent - that is making the same get request numerous times should result in the same response
post requests on the other hand are not

2176673
punctuation	words
the example uses standardanalyzer which removes punctuation and breaks words according to white space and some other more elaborate rules
it does not however break words into characters

2176706
comparator	comparable
and then since item is itself comparable you don t need an external comparator unless you want one
assuming that you re using this comparator to sort a treemap then this isn t going to work

2177059
firefox	safari
the ideal would be to be able to get the pasted content via the paste event which is possible in recent browsers but not in some older browsers in particular firefox 22
when you need to support older browsers what you can do is quite involved and a bit of a hack that will work in firefox 2+ ie 5.5+ and webkit browsers such as safari or chrome

2177226
post	get
you d probably have something like a collection of post documents each of which would have its own author and collection of comments embedded right in
of course that s probably not the only way you could do it and it is somewhat a compromise now querying for a single post is fast - you only do one operation and get everything back but you have no way of maintaining the relationship between authors and posts since it all becomes part of the post document

2178048
apache	nginx
if the problem does not persist apache is either doing something weird or wsgi django isn t getting all the information it needs to determine the port number. make sure that the wsgi script and the django app can both see the port number in the environment
if the location header has a port in it nginx is stripping it off for some reason

2178101
int	chars	int	double	nsinteger	double
it is possible to create a nsnumber object from a signed or unsigned chars short int int long int long long int float double or bool. among the two nsnumber can only be used in collections such as nsarray where an object is required but nsinteger cannot be used there directly
if you declare your integer as an nsinteger or a c-style primitive int then what you say is true

2178251
hash	salt
but password verifiers need to be able to recompute the same hash from the password hence they must have access to the salt
since the salt must be accessible to verifiers but needs not be secret it is customary to store the salt value along with the hash value

2178251
hash	salt	hash	md5	salt	md5
since the salt must be accessible to verifiers but needs not be secret it is customary to store the salt value along with the hash value
for instance on a linux system i may use this command openssl passwd -1 -salt zap blah this computes a hashed password with the hash function md5 suitable for usage in the etc password or etc shadow file for the password blah and the salt zap here i choose the salt explicitly but under practical conditions it should be selected randomly

2178324
vb.net	vb6
yes the vb.net data types are not compatible with the vb6 ones
a vb6 integer is now a short aka int16

2179198
put	get
once the developer can t get his change to prod any other way devs should not have prod rights there is no incentive to not put the change in source control
we don t use that we simply script every thing and put it in source control like any other file and all deployments to prod are only through scripts pulled down from source control

2179742
boost	stl
there is an extension to the boost range library called rangeex which contains range wrappers for all stl algorithms plus some new ones
it has recently been accepted into boost and so it s not yet in the current official release 1.41

2179866
datalist	checkboxlist
you may need to custom-bind a repeater or datalist with a checkbox control in the itemtemplate in order to achieve the functionality you re looking for
checkboxlist s templatecontrol property does not actually allow you to modify the template of the checkboxlist

2179866
inherited	properties
this is a properties inherited all the way from system.web.ui.control and it means the templated control that the checkboxlist lives in or put another way the .aspx page .ascx user control or master page that the control lives on
if the control is included as part of a composite control i honestly don t know without experimenting if the templatecontrol properties would return null or keep going up the control chain until it found a page or usercontrol. the checkboxlist control does not offer the kind of template modification you are looking to do

2180277
post	get
however my experience is that when onsubmit is not being called it s usually because the request is showing up as a get rather than a post
by default the controller determines whether a request is a form submission by looking for a post

2180956
radix	square-root
imo this is not excessive memory consumption so we should be able to do this without radix sorting
an o n algorithm could look like this this is not tested not very optimized and a proper integer square-root would be better. however the compiler should inline all the bit-accessing functions - so they ll be ok

2181537
free	malloc
if they are statically assigned to constants then don t free them that way and all that s needed is free primary
freeing something which was not malloc d will give the heap manager a heart seizure

2181727
cvs	svn
subversion does not have real tags the way cvs does
however you can tag using svn copy which really makes a branch

2182112
free	malloc
yes -- free takes a pointer to void so when you call it the pointer is implicitly cast to a pointer to void in any case
the rest of your code isn t quite so safe you should not cast the return from malloc in c

2182648
rss	feed
an rss xml document in itself does not contain any logic
you need to generate the appropriate feed for the parameters with some server side logic like a php script or the like

2183030
chown	chmod
this can be changed by sudo chown -r dylan dylan .gnupg and then as dylan chmod 600 .gnupg gpg.conf chmod 700 .gnupg to check the result ls -l .gnupg ls -ld .gnupg the letters to the left after writing ls means r read access 4 w write access 2 x execute acess 1 so the 6 4 + 2 - read and write access and the 7 4 + 2 + 1 - read write and execute access to be able to entering a directory you will need the execute access
if you want to create a directory where it is only possible to traverse but not list the files you can do chmod 100 the_directory

2183250
.htaccess	httpd.conf
for example if you want to have php files ending with .html or .htm most people will tell you to create an .htaccess and put in it the line addtype application x-httpd-php .html .htm if you re a developer and this is annoying you you may want to edit the file and change the line allowoverride none to allowoverride all this will allow your local .htaccess files to override various global defaults that they couldn t before
to clarify neoryder s post edit etc apache2 httpd.conf find the line #loadmodule php5_module libexec apache2 libphp5.so and remove the hash sign from the beginning to enable php in your web server

2184340
clang	llvm
i would expect it to be available soon with a new release of the iphone sdk given the rapid pace of improvement with the llvm compiler and clang parser
as i respond here to this question llvm is not yet ready to compile applications targeted at the iphone for any version of the sdk

2184746
content-length	content-type
section 4.4 describes how to determine the length of a message-body if a content-length is not given
note that the meaning of this field is significantly different from the corresponding definition in mime where it is an optional field used within the message external-body content-type

2185015
post	get
use application x-www-form-urlencoded instead and set your json to a request parameter that you can then access using also as i mentioned in my comment you can remove the following line post requests aren t cached and it s generally bad practice to use get parameters with post requests
from what i can tell your application cannot accept application json as a post data format

2185182
post	get
you can perfectly program software to bookmark a post request but it is not done so due to sensitive reasons
the special thing here however is that a get request is idempotent

2185523
put	get
if you don t override the tostring method you end up calling object.tostring whose implementation looks something like this the method doesn t simply put quotation marks around the object it is called on
in order to accomplish that result it must reflectively get the runtime type information and call tostring on that which in turn looks something like this anytime you go through reflection for something there is a bit of a performance penalty but in this case probably not one large enough to really matter - unless you are doing it inside of a very tight very large loop

2185601
icu	gettext
plural forms not so easy to use icu included some support only in 4.x release
gettext widely used has great tools has great plural forms support very popular in translators community.

2186125
crypt	salt	crypt	md5
for a simple test on your system you could try something like which on my system gives other ix variants support similar - crypt 3 since at least solaris 10 . however it s a non-standard extension - posix does not define it
in glibc2 any modern linux distribution the password encryption function can use md5 sha-xxx provoked by a magic salt prefix which then treats as significant all the input characters see man 3 crypt

2186311
realloc	strtok
please check to make sure args is not getting clobbered by the realloc call
see here on so regarding realloc edit also the loop looks funny.... you called strtok like this binary strtok command

2186433
getter	setter
the project lombok defines annotations for generating getter setter and more
so for example will generate getter for name not setter since it is final and getter setter for age

2187462
gdi	direct2d
however it does use the gdi for font rasterization not hardware accelerated and there is a significant performance hit try it its actually very noticable
as of directx 11 though fonts will be rendered with direct2d and be hardware accelerated

2187874
glut	glfw
never since i discovered glfw have i had a need to switch back to glut
note that glfw is not thread-safe in the sense that it is unsafe to call glfw functions from different threads faq entry

2188149
accessor	properties
the problem is that you are not using your properties accessor when setting the timers
instead of you should have the syntax will call your accessor method and thereby automatically retain the object that you send to it since your properties is set up as retain

2188149
accessor	properties
instead of you should have the syntax will call your accessor method and thereby automatically retain the object that you send to it since your properties is set up as retain
simply calling does not use the properties accessor

2188149
accessor	ivar
simply calling does not use the properties accessor
you are simply changing the value of your ivar directly

2188556
hash	salt
consider the following the resulting hash is now b58ad809eece17322de5024d79299f8a but alice s password is still secret
now if mallory gets her hands on the salt hash chances are she will not find the answer in her dictionary

2188556
hash	salt
if you cannot use an existing column incorporate your salt in the same column than your hash
for example use the first 32 characters for your 128-bits salt and then the last 40 for your 160-bits hash

2188681
ssl	ntlm
it depends time to resolve the dns name to ip time to open the tcp socket or the net pipe on top of other tcp soket 3 ip packets usually time to hanshake the ssl tls if encryption is required 5 roundtrips plus time to bootstrap the master key exchange if the ssl tls key info is not reused ie
one rsa private key access which is very expensive time to authenticate sql password for sql auth 2 roundtrips i believe time to authenticate ntlm kerberos for integrated auth 1 roundrip to negotiate spnego 5-6 roundtrips if kerb ticket is missing 1 roundtip if the ticket is present 4-5 roundtrip if ntlm is chosen time to authorize the login lookup metdata evaluate permissions against login token possible time to run any login triggers time to initiate the connection 1 roundtrip with the inital set session stuff batch some more esoteric times time to open auto-close databases if specified in request may include a recovery usualy doesn t time to attach database if atachdbfile is used and db is not already attached time to start a user instance for sql 2005 ranu

2188765
g++	gcc
you should also use not the old iostream.h use g++ to compile c++ programs it ll link in the standard c++ library
gcc will not

2188911
hash	salt
if you were to hash the username + password together to guarantee a unique hash you wouldn t be able to change the username without creating a new user and requiring them to set a new password
as an example of having a unique salt per user and storing it alongside the password hash i ll point out etc shadow on your typical linux system

2189414
postgresql	mysql
there is a clever solution here with cte s and rank over date_added in postgresql 8.4 but because you re using mysql the only thing i can think of of involves a very computationally complex query -- select the top date for each site_id select distinct id from site_text group by site_id date_added order by site_id date_added union -- select the top date for each site_id select distinct id from site_text group by site_id date_added -- excluding the top date. where id not in select distinct id from site_text group by site_id date_added order by site_id date_added order by site_id date_added
moral of the story use postgresql

2189997
accessor	properties
when you synthesize a properties the compiler only creates any absent accessor methods
there is no direct interaction with the dealloc method properties are not automatically released for you. declared properties do however provide a useful way to cross-check the implementation of your dealloc method you can look for all the properties declarations in your header file and make sure that object properties not marked assign are released and those marked assign are not released

2190084
post	get
as mentioned in previous post the type of request your making is dependent on the type of action to take
get the state of the system should not be changed as kyle wrote idempotent

2190205
children	parent
edit since you can t create a parent unless it has 2 children in that case instead of do does that make sense
first thing if you want the children to be saved without the parent id then there is no point in doing this the whole purpose of is to attach the parent id to the child object which you are not doing here because the parent doesn t exist yet

2190205
children	parent
first thing if you want the children to be saved without the parent id then there is no point in doing this the whole purpose of is to attach the parent id to the child object which you are not doing here because the parent doesn t exist yet
the other thing is if you just want to make sure that the parent has a child object and if you are creating child and parent together then you can use transaction block around the parent and child creation which will make sure that the parent has child like so within the transaction if at any stage code fails then it will rollback the whole db transaction i.e you will either have one parent with 2 children or nothing if that s the end state you are looking for

2190405
multibyte	setlocale
note that msvc docs explicitly indicates that the locale cannot be set to utf-7 or utf8 for the multibyte character sets the set of available languages country region codes and code pages includes all those supported by the win32 nls api except code pages that require more than two bytes per character such as utf-7 and utf-8
if you provide a code page like utf-7 or utf-8 setlocale will fail returning null

2191261
versioning	upgrade
that wouldn t require in-app purchase but another versioning of your app up on the appstore
which defeats the point of being able to use in-app purchase to upgrade an existing lite versioning to the full-blown one

2191447
jar	war
new in v0.9.7 quick-start guide there is also a info in the jython-wiki not jump related in brief jar file run where file is the name of the python script file and main is the application s main method entry point war file run the various options available for jump can be shown by outputting help usage information run jump --help
have you tried jump jump homepage features distributing jython applications into a single independent jar file

2191588
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
you could use a framework such as prototype or jquery that give you an each method to use on the arrays but internally it would likely just use a for-loop anyway so there s not really much point to it
alternatively if this is because you are using the for-loop all over the place and want to have reusable code instead why not attach a buildurl method to your urls object which loops internally and returns your url arrays or modify geturl so it looks at the .value property of the argument rather than expecting each element of to be a string then pass in to geturl eg geturl urls

2192256
children	parent
say you have a parent and that parent has a collection of children
hibernate now can lazy-load the children which means that it does not actually load all the children when loading the parent

2192386
int	chars
that is your bug your variables were of type unsigned chars which is 1 byte however you entered 12 which is 4 bytes a unsigned int that caused an overflow implementation defined by the compiler runtime and that would explain it overwriting the next variable in memory
you used the u specifier for printf which is an unsigned int for a unsigned chars variable that is incorrect and does not match up

2192386
int	chars
you used the u specifier for printf which is an unsigned int for a unsigned chars variable that is incorrect and does not match up
that explains as you have discovered yourself that using an unsigned int or int works as there was sufficient room to hold the values on input

2193351
int	double
d means decimal int
you are using double s not int s

2193672
qprogressbar	qwidget
the qwidget class and all of its subclasses including qprogressbar are not reentrant and can not be used outside of the main thread
refer to the following documentation you are getting errors because you are trying to update the qprogressbar from outside of the main thread

2194724
puts	gets
if you ve explicitly set the length of the string to 2 you re not leaving room for a nul terminator which is what puts uses to find the end of the string
since you don t have one it ll continue printing out the contents of memory following the string you defined until it gets to a byte in memory that happens to contain a 0

2195006
affinity	processors
unless a thread has a processors affinity mask the scheduler will move it from processors to processors in order to give it execution time
since moving a thread between processors costs performance it will try not to move it but giving it a processors to execute on has priority over not moving it

2195195
range	max	range	min
you need to find out what the operating range for the mouse is and what values can come out of it and that will give you your min and max values
if i m understanding the question correctly this isn t super difficult to do but you need to know the possible range of your input values before you can determine the normalized output values

2195406
accessor	properties
what you are doing is the following you declare a private string field called sqlconnection and you initialize it to contain a value from the config file ...then you have set up a properties to expose the field private properties connectionstring as string get return sqlconnection end get set byval value as string end set end properties noticable here is that you do not do anything in the set accessor
if the properties is to be readonly

2195870
solaris	aix
when copying native libs and headers you probably want tar -h to turn symlinks into actual files also watch that on solaris some requisite crt object files are buried in a cc directory not under usr lib
this is a very old question but missing some useful info -- i ve personally done this for solaris sparc x86 aix hp-ux and linux x86 x64 . getting c++ cross-compiled is much harder than straight c

2196169
traceroute	packets
traceroute and ping are both icmp-based protocols and cannot be created controlled from flash or javascript
they also both require raw access to build custom packets and this definitely cannot be done browser-side

2196210
vb.net	vb6
first even if you migrate from vb6 to vb.net there are several language specific features in vb.net that will not translate directly to c#
so even if you re using a vb.net to c# converter you ll have to handle these special cases or find a tool that handles them for you

2196500
rar	zip
zip with -e option and rar with -p
if python is not a must and you can use system utilities tools like zip or rar provides password encrypted compression

2196516
inherited	subclassing
inserter extractor functions may not work if your stream doesn t inherited correctly
these inserter declarations are perfectly fine therefore if you want iostream behavior you need to implement a subclassing of basic_streambuf and attach it to a basic_iostream

2196788
children	parent
with eq n only the selector attached to the pseudo-class is counted not limited to children of any other element and the nth one is selected
in simpler words eq 2 will select the third element in the while result set while nth-child 3 will select the 3 child of its parent

2197303
innodb	myisam
of note as of mysql 5.1.38 the innodb plugin is included in mysql as of mysql 5.1.43 the innodb plugin is not only included but is the default engine for mysql
on my server with your configuration my base performance is as follows innodb 5.71s myisam 2.50s this is not bad in my book but it can use some tweaking

2197303
innodb	myisam
on my server with your configuration my base performance is as follows innodb 5.71s myisam 2.50s this is not bad in my book but it can use some tweaking
your innodb performance can be improved on several fronts increase innodb_buffer_pool_size this is the single most important innodb configuration variable

2197341
inherited	subclassing
some disadvantages of this pattern are the factory methods are static so cannot be inherited in subclassing
a parent constructor is easily accessible to subclassing

2197708
post	get
the openid spec doesn t allow for the rp to mandate a post instead of a get
in fact get is generally considered preferable to post since it s faster and doesn t tend to pop up warning dialogs to the user if the op is an https endpoint and the rp is an http endpoint

2197949
post	get
this may not fully answer your post but when you want to have a very specific validation routine its often handy to simply override the validate function
this allows you to for example not bother checking the validity of the password length if you know that they left it completely blank so that they don t get a message that they left it blank and that it was not 6 characters in length

2198020
int	double
why isn t it public int update int serial datetime
if you can t change the parameters but the arguments should be of type datetime or null double or null and short or null then you can just cast them to their nullable equivalents

2198161
packets	multicast
why not make them use multicast to broadcast a hello packets every so often
this is assuming of course that multicast is available in your scenario and your not talking across routing domains

2198161
packets	multicast
simply use the hello packets contents such as ipv4 unicast address to ensure you know what you should be talking to
of course you don t need to use multicast you can just send a broadcast to 255.255.255.255 which is not a complex task and then listen for these messages

2198243
required	placeholder
it will not work as the first redirection parameter the redirection required a filename and the at the end
you re effectively trying to redirect stderr but there is no placeholder to store the stderr messages hence it failed

2198277
free	malloc
first when you dynamically allocate an object the object and a pointer to it is valid until you free it
if it is an automatic variable not dynamically allocated by new malloc etc. and not declared static the variable goes out of scope as soon as the object s scope ends usually that s the at the same level as the one in which the object was defined

2198601
post	get
note that all regexes in this post should have the verbose and dotall flags set s and x in some languages re.dotall and re.verbose in python
to get pairs of selectors rules this will not work in the rare case of having a quoted curly bracket in an attribute selector or in a rule

2199036
content-length	content-type
set http header values like content-length content-type and user-agent
do not forget to set content-length value as it is a mandatory

2199485
cdr	cons
3 usually it is a good idea to avoid improper lists where the cdr of some cell is not a cons or nil
nth returns the car of the nth 0 1 2 ... cons cell

2199653
children	parent
making the parent relative makes all children who are not fixed position themselves relative to the parent
for the child divs to base their positioning relative to the parent div the parent div must have positioning set to something other than static which it is by default

2199840
sharpmap	proj
sharpmap is a well known and used opensource collection of spatial libraries for .net commercial libraries from esri would be the most widely used
if you don t want to create indexes in the database then you will be stuck using shapefiles update i ve not used nts or jts but there is also a c++ implementation of jts at which has an active user community and i ve used on a couple of proj

2200761
qobject	qlist
when a qwidget or any qobject is destroyed it will remove itself from its parent s to-delete list so you can delete it yourself and not worry about double deletes
qlist is just like std list

2201829
haskell	ocaml
we use haskell ocaml and now f# so for us it has nothing to do with lack of c-like syntax
rather we skip erlang because it s dynamically typed we re fans of haskell s type system doesn t provide a real string type i understand why but it s annoying that this hasn t been corrected at the language level yet tends to have poor incomplete or unmaintained database drivers it isn t batteries included and doesn t appear to have a community working on correcting this

2202472
gina	winlogon
afaik this cannot be done as the login authentication is done by the gina layer graphical interface and authentication you re effectively trying to replace that layer with your own which would not be feasible from the managed side of code
in short the only way to develop a replacement for the gina layer would have to be done from the c c++ side not for reasons of speed but because of the complexity involved in programming a new gina subsystem which would have to take into account of handling the authentication by interacting with winlogon setting up a desktop loading explorer as the shell doing it from .net would not be a viable way of doing it

2202472
gina	winlogon
in short the only way to develop a replacement for the gina layer would have to be done from the c c++ side not for reasons of speed but because of the complexity involved in programming a new gina subsystem which would have to take into account of handling the authentication by interacting with winlogon setting up a desktop loading explorer as the shell doing it from .net would not be a viable way of doing it
but nonetheless if you are interested in replacing gina with your own in pure c c++ way have a look here in the msdn magazine which published an article by keith brown about replacing gina with your own in the may 2005 issue

2202835
punctuation	words
as pointed out in the comments below this doesn t take punctuation into account but easily can edit for languages that don t support look-behind like javascript as long as you replace all the front-facing ones first you have two options i ve left the original solution above in case this is helpful to someone using a language that does support look-behind
you could replace all that preceed a words character with the left quote and all that follow a words character with a right quote

it s like for example if you re writing a regex to detect backslashes you have to escape the backslash in the regex by doubling it and if you re using a language without regex literals you have to put it in a string with correct escapes so it ends up as four backslashes in a row which looks completely wrong but it s right when you think about the interaction of different levels of escape mechanism by the way i originally tried to write out those backslashes but in order to get around stackoverflow s own escape mechanism i would have had to write eight backslashes in a row and it didn t feel safe to write that the above seems ok to me at the moment as an explanation of the spec and of the java implementation as demonstrated in the sample code
it s obviously not consistent with the php sample and i don t mean to imply that there s a bug - the php dom implementation sits on top of a mature c library with a lot of configuration options one or more of which might be tweakable to get behaviour that s consistent with the java sample

inherited	subclassing	metaclass	subclassing
the second question has already been well answered twice though __new__ is actually a staticmethod not a classmethod as erroneously claimed in a comment... the first question as somebody noted has nothing to do with metaclass you simply can t multiply inherited from any two classes a and b in this order where b is a subclassing of a
e.g. the mro guarantees that leftmost bases are visited before rightmost ones - but it also guarantees that among ancestors if x is a subclassing of y then x is visited before y

post	get
i am not sure how your app is set up but lets assume that each post is stored in the database with a unique id
your script would look something like this get the referrer using store that in the database using the original post id as the foreign key and a normalized version of the domain then when you want to show stats run a query like this you could then calculate percentages against the total number returned

2205647
qgraphicsitem	qwidget
if yes you can call void qgraphicsitem setenabled bool enabled and to activate the event later as the item doesn t receive events any more you have to pass by the scene because you can t receive directly event on the item
if your problem is not using graphicsview frameworks but other part of qt it s almost the same process you can call qwidget setenabled false like massimo said in order to reactive the widget just detect press event inside an object in your application to be able to call setenable true on your widget

ssl	https
here s a good tutorial on how to set up a self-signed certificate for iis enabling ssl on iis 7.0 using self-signed certificates do i need to make all my pages secured or only the login page
use https for everything not just the initial user login

rss	feed
in .net there are many ways to generate an rss feed one of them is to use wcf
an rss feed is generated when someone requests it and not when something is added modified

codeigniter	pyrocms
you are probably safe with studying bambooinvoice.org and myclientbase since they are very basic codeigniter applications
i wouldn t recommended reading pyrocms code yet

2206001
union	distinct
dbcc freeproccache dbcc dropcleanbuffers if you run with the union all first and then run the 2 selects separately afterwards the data will already be cached in memory making performance much better therefore giving the false impression that the subsequent approach is quicker when it may not be
if you used a union then that may well be slower as it has to apply a distinct but union all doesn t have to do that so it should be no different

2207165
inherited	subclassing
but i would suggest that bozho s idea is the better one - the fact that you need to do this indicates a bigger problem that probably shows inherited is not the right solution here
in the latest junit you can use the rule annotation on the subclassing to inspect the test name and intercept the test run to ignore the test dynamically

2207713
versioning	upgrade
you can have lite versioning of your applications but apple requires that they are fully functional applications that do not expire and are not simply advertisements for your for-pay app
once you figure out what type of features you want to offer in a lite version one thing you could do to offer an in-place upgrade for customers in to use the in-app purchase mechanism

2208061
put	get
run the process method then take it back out of the active list and put it into the available list
you can get away with not using active available lists and just using an active flag instead

2208375
post	put
option 3 put to some separated sub-resource is your best bet right now and it wouldn t necessarily be wrong to just use post on the main resource itself - although you could disagree with that depending on how pedantic you want to be about it
stick with 3 and use more granular sub-resources and if you really do have a need for patch-like behavior - use post

2208838
fcntl	fork
since the other sockets will continue to be serviced by the original process and should not be passed on to the new process the flag should be set on those using fcntl
after fork and execing the new process the original process can go ahead and close the listening socket without any interruption to the service since the new process is now listening on that socket

2209107
inherited	properties
i think that the common design guideline to favor composition over inherited is even more true for o r mappings in particular than it is for ood in general
i understand that the images you ve added are just examples to illustrate your question and that your real design may be more complicated but let s use it as an example the subtypes in the diagram application file etc. have only one properties which is not in the parent type

2209184
put	get
it s also consistent with how put was handled a few years back by the rails community so should be comprehensible by many c it s easy to replace when patch becomes more widely available d it s a pragmatic response to an awkward problem
it s ok to post emulating patch where not available before explaining this it s probably worth mentioning that there s nothing wrong with using post to do general updates see here in particular post only becomes an issue when it is used in a situation for which some other method is ideally suited retrieval of information that should be a representation of some resource get complete replacement of a representation put really we should be using patch to make small updates to complex resources but it isn t as widely available as we d like

2209430
folder	directory
you need to add the image to the resources folder in your application directory so that the image can be copied to your target copy bundle resources this folder contains all the resources your application is using
otherwise when the iphone simulator runs it will not find the image in order to add an image to the resources ctrl+click the folder and select add..- existing files then select your image and click add

2209850
move	drag
when the user begins to drag the original item isn t actually move it s just hidden
ui.helper is a separate object that the user drag around

2209874
int	chars
test1 and 2 are both using convert.tochar with an int constant
which will interpret the input as a unicode chars not an ansi chars so no conversion is being applied

2210302
inherited	subclassing
if you do that it d be easy to give each character a set of those type object instances instead of a single one giving you in effect multiple inherited
just because your characters are wizards and warriors that doesn t mean you have to create subclassing for them

2211301
rss	feed
here is an excerpt from its project page set role-based permission settings for blog taxonomy aggregator and main site s rss feed
this module does not disable rss feed altogether rss feed created through the views module and others not listed here do not have associated permissions

i wouldn t worry about the people running custom firmware since they are so many different firmwares and builds of each firmware and people who put custom firmware on their phone usually expect to fend for themselves
i only mention it in case you get some weird bugs you really can t replicate which might be caused by this

2212905
width	height
it s not the width that is the problem it s the height
if you don t have any content in the div the height becomes zero

2213744
ready	each
see the advanced cuda c presentation for details on this but only when you are ready
threads within a warp again half-warp on current gpus access shared memory together and if you re not careful you will have bank conflicts where the threads have to queue up behind each other to access the memories

2213993
width	height
you may not even need the width because as i said the width value should be relative to the view bounds
i used to do this by creating a collection objects array of size information dictionary nsnumber of row height etc. based on the collection objects that will be used for the table view

2214120
firefox	safari
if firefox has more properties then they will be mozilla s own extensions but generally the spec provides everything you could need
anyway the problem is that you need to reselect the range after altering it note that this will not work in early versions of safari prior to version 3 i think because its selection object does not support getrangeat

2214304
hash	md5
its worth noting that if for some reason you do want md5 hash of subsections of the file as you go along this is sometimes useful for doing interim checks on a large file being transferred over a low bandwidth connection then you can get them by cloning the digest object at any time like so this does not affect the actual digest object so you can continue to work with the overall md5 hash
its also worth noting that md5 is an outdated hash for cryptographic purposes such as verifying file authenticity from an untrusted source and should be replaced with something better in most circumstances such as sha-1

2214577
int	double
rectangle uses int coordinates
rectangle2d is an abstract class that doesn t care if you re using int double or float coordinates

2214577
int	double
rectangle2d is an abstract class that doesn t care if you re using int double or float coordinates
if you need the greater precision of double and float you ll have to go with rectangle2d

2214767
children	parent
but something to consider is that in hierarchical data structures like the uiview hierarchy it s generally good practice for children to not know too many of the details of their parent where possible
technically you can just do from within one of the child s instance methods and that will give you access to the foo property on the parent you may have to cast the superview though

2214980
free	malloc
it will not survive once the stack frame is closed but you also don t have to free any memory
bar is a reference to an nsrect structure that was most likely created on the heap using malloc

2215111
g++	gcc
also it was offered to me as an explanation that the x86 has very few registers and g++ was not good at allocating them
update for a more thorough comparison of microsoft and gnu compilers go to this c compiler benchmark . according to how i read these figures the difference between microsoft and gcc for 32 bit are on par with each other although gcc is tested with profile guided optimization pgo and microsoft isn t there s no pgo in vs express

2215348
subtraction	modulo	addition	modulo
in python though you will always get a positive number which is often more useful because it means you can do modulo addition and subtraction
if negative modulo were to give you a negative it would not work properly

2215655
inherited	subclassing
if you are inheriting from a real view customview is a subclassing of textview you should inherited all the right functionality for laying things out
if your customview is simply a subclassing of view there might be some things you need to override or call that you aren t

2216414
put	get
what i mean is than if you just put the actual logic in your class but then let anyone who calls your method do i guess what i m advocating is not even implementing the apm yourself but just recommending to people that call your method that they use the apm that s built into delegates
i think that s a good way to implement the apm but at the moment you d get an error with more than one asynchronous call per instance

2217346
uiview	subviews
thus no need for another uiview to encapsulate both and you re not putting it in the table which isn t supported unless you put it within a cell within the table view
the reason is because uitableview expects to be in charge of all of every one of its subviews for layout purposes

2217711
folder	dir
not recommended but working - manually extract the .war file as a .zip archive and place the extracted files in webapps webappname sometimes administrators configure tomcat so that war files are deployed outside the tomcat folder
even in that case after you have it deployed check the logs dir for any problems it should be accessible via

2218593
trie	tree
for variable-size keys like strings a trie might be a good idea
for a 2-3-4 tree it does not really matter

2218733
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
google-chrome
some modern browsers firefox safari and opera but not google-chrome support the special back forward cache i ll call it bfcache which is a term invented by mozilla involved when the user navigates back

2218766
exif	xmp
as it turns out the windows imaging component wic used by bitmapmetadata reads writes many different types of metadata blocks including tiff exif iptc and xmp
this explains why unfortunately their object model does not correspond very closely with the xmp serialization model

2219057
idictionary	icollection
edit hmm idictionary does not implement icollection which is a bit of a pain
this however works albeit a hack the above approach will work for instances of dictionary however if you are testing a method that returns idictionary it might fail if the implmentation changes

2219118
apache-poi	docx4j
apache-poi s support for word documents isn t very good
also unlike aspose.words docx4j is an open source library

2219207
union	distinct
you want to use the union operator | which behaves kind of like an and and kind of like an or depending on how you think about it
it will give you a distinct list of both sets of nodes and will return them in the document order that it finds them not all instance and then all result elements

2219495
children	parent
the event is bubbling up from the child to the parent where it is being caught you should catch the event on the children by adding a listener and making the propagation stop there
this code will stop the event from bubbling up to the parent handler question the mouse off event is fired by the parent when it should not

2219545
int	chars
note although each value usually represents a single 16-bit unit of utf-16 text the language does not place any restrictions or requirements on the values except that they be 16-bit unsigned int
string values are not implementation dependent according the ecma-262 3rd edition specification each chars represents a single 16-bit unit of utf-16 text 4.3.16 string value a string value is a member of the type string and is a finite ordered sequence of zero or more 16-bit unsigned integer values

2220335
post	put
just to give an example stack overflow itself uses the same database table called post for questions and answers
even though these two types of data are not identical the site creators considered them similar enough to put them into one table

2220748
tunnel	packets
the suggestion to use tunnel is valid but so is the warning
tcp doesn t send packets it is a continuous stream

2220814
pseudo-class	visited
to ensure correct style compatibility with older browsers it is recommended to define the a visited pseudo-class
you may need to add the a visited pseudo-class to in your css the a visited style should inherit from the a class but some older browsers like ie6 do not follow this rule source

2220974
width	margin
a block element will by default have some margin around it and will assume 100 width unless specified or floated
an inline element cannot have a width assigned

2220989
tunnel	packets
consider using pptp or similar tunnel protocol
you cannot pack several tcp packets into one ip packets - that is a restriction of specification as mentioned above

2220989
udp	tcp
what i can suggest you consider packing whatever you like into udp packet
i am not sure how easy is to initiate routing of unpacked tcp packages on remote side

2221847
postgresql	mysql
but that s shouldn t be a reason to use mysql over postgresql since you can still inject by using subqueries
the mysql client library seems to limit to one statement per call by default i encountered it with php

2222283
int	double
introduce an int value index which indicates the location of the next available unused so far pointer in this array
when a new object ufo ship or what have you gets created four things happen new memory is allocated for the object per se the address of this new memory is stored in the object pointer array at the location indicated by the index the index gets incremented the world only knows this object by way of the double indirection when an object gets destroyed two things happen the memory is freed the pointer in the array is set to null when accessing any objects the program does three things first dereference once the pointer-to-pointer check if this is null if so this indicate the object doesn t exist anymore the logic may decide to remove this reference from wherever it stored it as so to not try again but this is of course optional

2223322
for-loop	loops
exactly the same as for a for-loop
no a continue does not have the behavior of moving to the next item unless the part of the while block that moves to the next item is part of loops condition or occurs and is executed before the continue statement

2223874
postgresql	mysql
otherwise you re just exploiting that postgresql can prepare multiple statements and that isn t something negative
i believe mysql can probably do this too the only difference here is dbd mysql is claiming that c api issues preclude the use of the server-side prepares so they re relying on some other source as being authoritative for the server

while i applaud your upfront thinking about accessibility the tone of your post seems like you have your back up about their requirements

maven	pom.xml
make sure to select the swing application framework project maven archetype when the wizard asks you to select an archetype. to check does your project icon have a small m at the top left corner indicating it s a maven project
make sure that you ve created a new maven project in netbeans and not just a java desktop project these don t recognize the pom.xml

2224816
firefox	safari
i found a solution that works in ie and firefox at least on the current versions
on safari chrome the iframe is resized to 75 of its original size but the content within the iframe is not scaled at all

2224939
punctuation	words
you could use lookaheads lookbehinds to see if you are bounded by spaces but to check against punctuation could be difficult considering your smileys are made of punctuation
the reason your smiley example doesn t work with regex is the b refers to a words boundary

2225651
google-chrome	safari
it appears that google-chrome can handle more values at the moment but safari can t
see this post for a good explanation or have a look at mdc hmm it doesn t mention google-chrome

2226501
allocator	stl
it s a detailed article but the most important reasons were stl allocator are slow bloated and inefficient compilers aren t actually very good at inlining all those deep function calls stl allocator don t support explicit alignment the stl algorithms that come with gcc and msvc s stl aren t very performant because they re very platform-agnostic and thus miss a lot of microoptimizations that can make a big difference
some years ago our company made the decision not to use the stl at all instead implementing our own system of containers that are maximally performant easier to debug and more conservative of memory

2226602
int	double
for instance strings to int arrays. but this won t work with string and double as equivilant values are stored differently at a byte level
so a string binary 1 is not the same set of 1s and 0s as double binary and vice versa

2226729
nsobject	nsmanagedobject
various classes override this nsobject method so that the equal means either the same objects or objects with the same contents
you might want to read through this article nsmanagedobject has a method isequal which you are not allowed to override

2227092
allocator	stl
and all stl container have a template for the allocator
for exception stl doesn t throw many exceptions in generally the most common are out of memory in your case the system should reset so you can do reset in the allocator

2227109
profiling	debugging
which can be handy like when you re working with other developers fd doesn t have a profiling but this has not prompted me to stop using it
when i need some debugging and trace isn t enough i add the demonsters debugger class it s pretty powerful but you still can t step through your code. update - flash develop has had a profiling for a few versions now it s good for watching memory use but i still end up using monster debugger a lot

2227109

when i need some debugging and trace isn t enough i add the demonsters debugger class it s pretty powerful but you still can t step through your code. update - flash develop has had a profiling for a few versions now it s good for watching memory use but i still end up using monster debugger a lot
you can use debugging in flash develop as-well and step through your code

2228010
subclass	inherited
you shouldn t need to subclass the uibutton class
by design objective-c favors composition over inherited

2228046
int	chars
you can print all the chars that are digits according to character.isdigit ... using the following program character.isdigit ... takes an int so we loop trough all the positive int on my java version this returns 268 such digits the actual number of digits can vary from one java version to another depending on the actual version of unicode supported
note that isdigit ... doesn t take a chars but an int representing a unicode codepoint

2228361
range	max
but with n in this range i couldn t find proper solution
fitness quickly jumped to about 90 of max but in the end there were always two queens conflicting

2228380
post	get
have not tired it yet but if it does the job i will post that as well
to get over the problem of the aftercheck event not firing i found that i could get the node clicked on and then use that to call aftercheck that works but i then found aftercheck was called before the state of the checkbox had been changed so instead raised my own event and handled it appropriately

2229256
superclass	subclassing
if you need more than that you don t want superclass fields to be serialized override writeobject objectoutputstream and readobject objectinputstream as outlined here -
as others have made clear it s not possible for a subclassing of a serializable class to be non- serializable

2229659
post	get
well i couldn t find a way to use the link_post function to post to a fanpage so i decided to shape the stream.publish result in a way that it would look the same
i had to do a lot of dancing around the variables to get the same effect but it worked

2230116
hash	salt	hash	hmac
if you aren t running https then any mitm can see the salt you are sending as well as the javascript used to hash the original password so you have nothing gained
as for your concern about the possibility of hmac collisions between two salt that is probably very unlikely depending on your hash algorithm and how secure you keep your salt values

2230297
filesystems	ntfs
this may not be true for other filesystems drivers
ntfs is a journaled filesystems

2230297
filesystems	ntfs
it ll ensure consistency and integrity of the filesystems structures like a database does for its tables
while file.delete doesn t have any transactional code at the high level ntfs does maintain transactional integrity at the filesystem level

2230375
post	get
for whatever reason this does not trigger the but mentioned in the earlier post and rmagick will load successfully
to get around this i uninstalled the rmagick gem and the macports version of imagemagick and then reinstalled imagemagick with the installer here

2231020
installation	upgrade
i would not upgrade tangle with or otherwise modify the default installation of python if that s what you are asking
you are much better off installing an upgrade version of python in an alternate location using macports

2231285
int	chars	unsigned	short
you would have to read into an unsigned int u or unsigned short hu and then check that the result is with the range of an unsigned chars
no c89 c90 does not support hhu to read a string of digits into an unsigned chars

2231420
implements	extends
implements all this may seem to be a lot of work for the convenience logic and also a potential for several bugs issues however provided that the buffer s is are adequately sized and that the logic using these convenience methods understand the rules of the game this pattern supplies a simplistic automated heap management system which is a nice thing to have in c which unlike with java .net and other systems does not offer a built in gc-based heap management
so long as you understand this to be thread-unsafe and so long that your logic expect the values returned by the convenience methods to only be valid for the duration of a few calls to possibly various methods you can maybe extends this convenience in two unrelated and possibly complementary ways

2231855
comparator	comparable
so try or depending on whether you need to be able to compare instances of t in order to implement your comparator method
when appears it means you have an instance of comparable that can be compared to one unknown subtype of t not that it can be compared to any subtype of t

2232268
richfaces	icefaces
see the richfaces developer guide page for this tag 6.14.9
rich jquery available since 3.0.0 while icefaces doesn t integrate natively with jquery you can at least make jquery not clash with icefaces s own javascript framework prototype

2233155
put	get
as mentioned above iframes won t hold up loading of the page so you could put the ads in place right away if they are iframes and load them at the bottom if they are something else
of course this won t work if the slow part is before you know if you are going to get an iframe or not

2233249
int	chars
that seems to happen during an internal method system.web.crosssitescriptingvalidation.isdangerousstring string out int which looks like it decides this way look for or in the value
if it s not there or if it s the last chars in the value then the value is ok

2233311
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	mp3	ogg	mp3	wav
well firefox and opera do not support non-free codecs such as mp3 as with the opera 10.5 alpha firefox 3.5 and later supports only pcm wav and ogg vorbis for audio
i believe google-chrome and safari do support mp3 however

2233500
dateadd	strtotime
if you re certain that those are the only two date formats you ll possibly have as input then you can explode it on the forward slashes then if strlen returns 1 on the month or the dateadd a 0 as you re creating your yyyy-mm-dd string
however if you re not guaranteed that those are your only two input formats then i would use strtotime to convert it to epoch then use date to format it as you desire

2233577
int	boolean
what you re actually doing is adding an int to the list here which is definitely not a randomoccupant
arraylist s add method returns either boolean or void depending on the version that you re using so you can t assign to it

2233896
datamapper	activerecord
the datamapper pattern is not very popular in the php world in favour of activerecord and certainly much of that favour is attributed to the fawning of ruby on rails in the php framework community although there exists one notable project -- and it looks promising
outlet orm follows the datamapper pattern although i am not sure if it would be sufficient for your needs

2234477
public	protected
you cannot cast something to cloneable and call the clone method because cloneable doesn t have a public clone method and neither does object
if you try to cast to cloneable and call the clone method the compiler will say you are trying to call the protected clone method on object

2234749
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i was having this problem in safari and google-chrome mac and discovered that .scrolltop would work on but not firefox and ie however works the other way round
a simple browser detect fixes the issue the jquery browser value for google-chrome is safari so you only need to do a detect on that

2235231
hash	salt
it is not perfect as sha512 would be ideal for a fast hash but out of the options its the definite choice
as per any hashing technology be sure to salt the hash for added security

2235940
opera	firefox
one of those features is the text-overflow property which is now in css3 and has implementations in safari and opera
however firefox still does not support this feature

2235961
vb6	vba
vb6 vba - 147 chars i m not allowed to leave comments but it is possible to shorten the previous answer somewhat by not having option explicit
taking advantage of some of the more dangerous features of vb6 vba you can use the one below

2236348
min	max
subselects make it possible with a query like this in mysql 4.1 delete from some_table where primarykey not in select min primarykey from some_table group by some_column of course you can use max primarykey as well if you want to keep the newest record with the duplicate value instead of the oldest record with the duplicate value
to understand how this works look at the output of this query select some_column min primarykey from some_table group by some_column as you can see this query returns the primary key for the first record containing each value of some_column

2237009
crypt	salt
now the crypt function appears to be capable of taking a salt of any length less than or equal to its maximum and silently handling any inconsistencies in the base64 by discarding any data that doesn t make up another full byte
the crypt function will fail completely if you pass it characters in the salt that are not part of its base64 alphabet which just confirms this theory of its operation

2237009
crypt	salt
the crypt function will fail completely if you pass it characters in the salt that are not part of its base64 alphabet which just confirms this theory of its operation
take an imaginary salt 1234

2237274
xslt	schematron
the rules are comiled into xslt and can run in any environment that can invoke xslt transformations
the schematron differs in basic concept from other schema languages in that it not based on grammars but on finding tree patterns in the parsed document

2237627
serializable	deserialization
untested then serializable list instead
this isn t going to create a lot of overhead if foo is a reference type and you don t care about the fact that insertions deletions are now more expensive b c you re only using the to hold references to the data for serialization and deserialization purposes

2237879
lisp	scheme
i learned all of them to a diffeent degree and would advise starting with scheme a lisp dialect - simply because it is easiest to learn
haskell and f# are statically typed which is a big advantage for real-life projects but imho they have a little too much syntax and are not as easy to pick up as scheme

2237879
haskell	scheme
haskell and f# are statically typed which is a big advantage for real-life projects but imho they have a little too much syntax and are not as easy to pick up as scheme
there is a nice scheme implementation for .net - ironscheme

2239232
width	font-size
this won t tell us which font is currently active but can indicate whether or not one of the embedded fonts was loaded with font-face as they certainly won t have the same width as arial
if the two elements widths aren t equal we know that arial could not have loaded and so we will only adjust the font-size if the widths are equal

2239978
dictionary	map
unfortunately r doesn t have a good dictionary map type
the closest i ve found is using lists as a map from string-to-value

2240078
udp	tcp
yes udp just returns what data got transmitted in that one datagram
udp is not stream-oriented like tcp

2240730
inherited	properties
i don t know whether this is the root of your problem but ie6 has problems with display inherited
from smashing magazine differences in internet explorer 6 7 and 8 ie6 and ie7 do not support the value inherited except when applied to the direction and visibility properties

2240771
recvfrom	datagram
provided the buffer is large enough the standard berkeley sockets recv and recvfrom functions will never return a partial datagram
the datagram is not available to the application until the kernel has completely received and reassembled the datagram

2241021
pull	push
you make changes to your working repo push them to your public repo and pull from other developers public repos
don t forget the pull is not the dual of push

2241021
pull	push
don t forget the pull is not the dual of push
a pull also does a merge

2241473
many-to-many	one-to-many	many-to-one	one-to-many
recommendations it does not usually make sense to enable cascade on a many-to-one or many-to-many association
cascade is often useful for one-to-one and one-to-many associations

2241473
children	parent
mapping an association either a single valued association or a collection with cascade all marks the association as a parent child style relationship where save update delete of the parent results in save update delete of the child or children
a child which becomes unreferenced by its parent is not automatically deleted except in the case of a one-to-many association mapped with cascade delete-orphan

2241627
free	malloc
it is not a general memory manager or properly free store implementation such as malloc which might be what you are asking for
your application may require a different data structure to keep track of your free storage

2241783
folder	directory
checking out a copy of the parent directory to another location and replacing the .svn folder in the parent dir of the working copy allowed me to add and commit the new directory successfully after fixing the file permissions of course
the error directory blah .svn containing working copy admin area is missing occurred when i attempted to add the directory to the repository but did not have enough filesystem privileges to do so

2242555
post	put	post	get
if you want to prevent the user from easily being able to modify the mode value directly then the post body would be a better solution than the query string
get is intended for retrieval of a resource without making any modifications or incurring any side effects and post is intended for adding information to a resource but not creating a new resource that would be a put

2242764
width	height
- get the current computed width for the first element in the set of matched elements including padding but not border
- get the current computed height for the first element in the set of matched elements including padding and border

2243195
titlebar	window
here is a thread you might find interesting i am not sure if you will be allowed to remove the titlebar entirely though.
i don t think it s possible in silverlight 3 but in sl4 you should be able to customize the chrome of the window

2243726
post	get
even if it is a post request php can still access any get variables added on as a query string
based on your code i don t think you are telling the request what info should be included in the post section of the request which would explain why you are not seeing anything with

2243910
folder	directory
unfortunately a fair number of nix apps ported to windows don t respect that and i end up with .gem .ssh .virtualbox etc. folder cluttering up my home directory and not hidden by default as on nix
you can make it easy even for users that don t know much about the layout of the windows directory structure by having a menu item or similar that opens the configuration file in an editor for them

2244187
versioning	upgrade
do this by comparing your versioning of the files with the ones in rails23-app do not use config.time_zone utc unless your database datetime columns are in utc you want to keep your environment.rb file fairly small by breaking parts out into config initializers files
actionmailer base.server_settings has been renamed to actionmailer base.smtp_settings remove upgrade patch any plugins that your app has that may not be rails 2.3 compatible

2244962
profiling	debugging
red gate s memory profiling is an amazing tool for this
this may not help with your particular problem but snoop is a great tool for debugging wpf applications

2245172
accessor	properties
you are stepping on the properties generated accessor that maintain the retain count automatically
your are still not using the accessor consistently

2245172
accessor	properties
your are still not using the accessor consistently
this should be and this should be you need to track down all references to all your declared properties and affix self

2246242
sctp	tcp
you are relying on tcp s half-closed state which is not available in sctp
using tcp will send a packet with the fin bit set closing the sending side of the connection but still allowing new data in the receiving direction

2246628
profiling	debugging
a compiled list of possible sources of improvement are below general make use of a profiling to discover memory leaks and performance problems in your application
personally i suggest dottrace run your site in release mode not debugging mode when in production and also during performance profiling

2247364
next	except
close visual studio to make sure all changes are saved in the filesystem and to make sure it doesn t end up clobbering some of our next backstage edits
in plain old windows explorer or whatever delete the my shared data source.rds file from every project folder except data source s

2247645
maven	pom.xml	maven-antrun-plugin	pom.xml
that s weird and it sounds like a bug in the maven resources plugin because this property is correctly interpolated during the process-resources phase as i ll demonstrate in the workaround i m suggesting below based on the maven-antrun-plugin and the replace task
first add the following to your pom.xml then update your xml file into with these changes running mvn process-resources would produce the following result which proves the property is interpolated but not set during maven filtering of resources 1

2247817
try-catch	exception-handling
by giving you an array boundary exceeded error the debugger has actually proven that there s a potential unhandled exception-handling in your code which is why you placed the try-catch code there
it s not suppose to throw the exception-handling until the debugger has actually reached that point

2248920
hash	salt
more explanation is available at- recently i had a discussion whether password hash salt with random bits are more secure than the one salt with guessable or known salt
let s see if the system storing password is compromised as well as the system which stores the random salt the attacker will have access to hash as well as salt so whether the salt is random or not doesn t matter

2248920
hash	salt
let s see if the system storing password is compromised as well as the system which stores the random salt the attacker will have access to hash as well as salt so whether the salt is random or not doesn t matter
the attacker will can generate pre-computed rainbow tables to crack the hash

2249215
mousemove	keydown
for example and then your mousemove handler can see if it s pressed or not
you can use keydown and keyup to track if the space bar is pressed or not and look at that state in your mousemove event handler

2249476
pull	push
your problem isn t with git pull it s with git push
try setting up git to only push to the branch the current branch is tracking if applicable git config --global push.default tracking in the meantime you are able to push whenever you want but you ll get rejection notices for branches that wouldn t fast-forward on push

2250895
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
put your code that modifies the view in viewdidappear
the view is not yet visible when viewdidload and viewwillappear are called

2250978
udp	tcp
maybe you ll need to come up with a compact binary format for your messages and drop http in favor of a custom protocol - maybe even revert to udp the above points generally don t apply but they do if you need to provide a smooth experience over high latency low bandwidt flaky connections
at the very least make sure you re not setting up a new tcp connection for every request

2250982
getter	setter
if i m feeling lazy then i d probably go for agreed immutability auto-properties with exposed getter and private setter
you may not need to add any logic to a setter in the future but you may need to add logic to a getter

2251757
put	get
you can put any html styling elements in between the double quotes after the echo statements they will definitely not be ignored
look into your browser s view source page to see whether they get output or not

2252382
x86	64bit
our msbuild script runs from an x86 visual studio command prompt
it does not read the 64bit registry when using this syntax

2253007
pop-up	dialog
here is an excerpt from my sas.client.props ok after connecting the login pop-up will appear
type your admin user and password user pw are not required on the connection dialog in jconsole you may run the jconsole from ibm jdk or sun jdk

2253338
maven	pom.xml
as far as i know maven cannot go into your spring configuration files and determine if it needs additional optionally enabled libraries
although that certainly sounds like it would be a cool spring-maven plugin if it were possible to modify the pom.xml on the fly via plugin

2253602
codeigniter	cakephp
i totally enjoy codeigniter
it doesn t have the magic functions of cakephp rails but it automatically comes with a good mvc setup and a good basic library for forms activerecord implementation dealing with post data sanitization and other nice things that i just don t prefer to deal with every project

2253602
post	get

2254071
post	put	post	get
the information in this blog post proved invaluable to getting this to work
i am not sure about iis6 but i created a new website in iis7 i could not get things to work under a virtual directory but that is probably my lack of iis knowledge i put my .svc file in the root directory and in services everything started working great

2254590
udp	tcp
there are downsides - udp transmission is not reliable or guaranteed in the same way as tcp
you might consider udp for this

2254734
maven	pom.xml
maven is a dependency manager.
because not everybody uses cglib an aop proxy in spring can be a jdk dynamic proxy or a cglib proxy so cglib is marked as an optional dependency in the pom.xml of spring-aop and you have to add it explicitly if you want to use it

2254952
post	get
i ll not post the whole template here because a its quite large and b i m not sure where i stand on copyright
you can get the existing template fairly easily if you have blend you should be able to create copy with the tool

2255222
actionscript	mxml
in my experience there s not much of a difference whether you write a component in actionscript + mxml or solely in actionscript
personally if i m writing something that s layout heavy with a little logic i ll do it in mxml

2255270
inherited	properties
that s why your solution works - it doesn t affect datacontext which is inherited from window
also you can keep but set element where to search properties explicitly like this skipped irrelevant but my oppinion is that your variant from the answer looks more convenient to me setting data context to this is not very good practice

2255533
libs	buildpath
if you remove a libs path entry but not the jar file the libs entry will be re-added to the path automatically. from
there is a plug-in technique that may help you if you want a directory where new jars are automatically updated in your build path see this other post eclipse buildpath automatically taking all jars of a internal directory the reason it works like this for your jsp s is because that is how the dynamic web project was made to behave

2255572
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
first of all i wouldn t use for-in i d use a simple for-loop to iterate over the arrays
then you could store the index that matches the user name to compare it to the password arrays then in your password loops you d say that s the simple way around the problem

2256282
calloc	malloc
if you belong to the second camp which apparently you do then you prefer malloc over calloc
now there are two exceptions if you belong to the initialize everything camp you don t calloc but malloc because you are initializing floating-point numbers or pointers and you know that all bits zero doesn t necessarily mean 0 for them

2256403
int	chars
the primary areas of focus are a understanding how int numbers are stored as binary digits and b the basics of data structures where if a programming language does not provide the desired data structure itself you can use meta or collection structures such as struct in c class in c++ or record in pascal
in c you have data types chars short int long that can all be used to store integers of various sizes

2256583
put	get
so basically a framework is a collection of patterns put together
theoretically if you learn to follow the rules of a tried and true framework your app will not get out of control to the point where you find yourself fixing one bug and causing two

2256583
cairngorm	puremvc
in all honesty the only other one i ve given a good amount of time to is cairngorm
but i like puremvc because it feels right to me but also it s generally not dependent on so much on the built-in actionscript classes

2257400
pop-up	dialog
chromeless window just another kind of pop-up window that doesn t show the browser menu or toolbar
modal window the javascript alert method is an example of a modal dialog

2257456
rss	feed
i have a site doing just that with over 100 rss atom feed this is what i do i have a list of feed and a cron job that iterates over them about 5 feed a minute meaning i cycle through all feed every 20 minute or so
i lift the feed and try to insert each entry into the database using the url as a unique field if the url exists i do not insert

2257456
rss	feed
the entry date is my current system clock and is inserted by my application as date fields in rss cannot be trusted and in some cases can t even be parsed
for some feed and only experiece can tell you which i also search for duplicate titles some websites change the urls for their own reasons

2257704
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the following example works in google-chrome 4.0 firefox 3.5.7 safari 4.0.4 and ie 8 unfortunately as noted by balusc in a comment to one of the answers the above will not work in versions of firefox older than 3.5
since the population of users using old firefox versions seems to be below 6 as noted by t.j

2258600
skip-lists	tree
concurrentskiplistmap is a sorted map backed by a skip-lists a self-balancing tree-like structure with o log n performance
generally the bounds on cslm are tighter than treemap which is a self-balancing red-black tree impl so it will probably perform better with the side benefit of being thread-safe and concurrent which treemap is not

2259180
single-quotes	double-quotes
first single-quotes strings behave differently than double-quotes string
when using single-quotes strings escape sequences other than and are not interpreted and variable are not expended

2259180
single-quotes	double-quotes
when using single-quotes strings escape sequences other than and are not interpreted and variable are not expended
this can be fixed as such removing the quotes or changing them to double-quotes php documentation strings secondly your condition will never evaluate to true as hey is never equal to a single letter of the alphabet

2259414
maven	cargo
this is not really the maven jetty plugin is supposed to be used the plugin deploys the war of the current module what you want to do is not supported by default
section 4.13 of better builds with maven describes using cargo to deploy a war specified using maven coordinates yes cargo can do this in a clean way

2259649
equals	gethashcode
you haven t posted the code for your word class but my guess is that it doesn t implement equals with a value comparison so you get the default implementation of equals which just checks the object references
note that if you decide to implement your own version of equals you also need to correctly implement gethashcode

2259719
vmware	virtualbox
i am not 100 sure if you can actually hook into the vm unless there s an sdk that you can download to intercept it remember the vmware is simulating a separate machine but a logical one alright...the downloads are available here from vmware
i can only guess i use virtualbox myself that a virtual machine vmware virtualbox seizes control of the hooks for the keyboard i would imagine the host system would not see them...but it would be interesting to try out.

2260425
button	checkbox
for a checkbox and for a radio button to be a little more descriptive let s say you have the following form if i were to submit that form with an email value of test email.com but not check the checkbox i would have the following in _post however if i were to submit the same form with the same email address and check the checkbox i would have the following hope that helps
checkbox and radio buttons work a little differently than your standard inputs

2260425
button	checkbox
checkbox and radio button work a little differently than your standard inputs
if a checkbox is present on a form that doesn t necessarily mean that it will be available in the resulting post information

2260656
prepare	execute
prepare statements are meant to be used as a kind of statement template which is bound to values before it execute
to quote the javadoc this has two big advantages over your current usage of preparedstatement one preparedstatement can be used for multiple execute it prevents a possible sql injection attack the second one here is the biggie if for instance your variables first and last are collected in a user interface and not reformatted you run the risk of parts of sql being input for those values which then end up in your statements

2260876
folder	directory
there s no official home folder for your application
in blackberry you can basically read write just about anything anywhere well you might get a securityexception ioexception if you ll try do change some files . you can write to the sdcard internal memory using the paths described here . if you re worried about someone seeing and altering your data there s not much you can do except setting your files and directory as hidden using fileconnection.sethidden true but this is very lame since they can still be seen even from the native blackberry file browser if the user chooses to show hidden files from the menu

2261402
cakephp	qcodo
i had a look at cakephp but i found it its database interface not at the level of propel qcodo and doctrine but i think the you can use your own library
i usually want in a framework orm and object wrapping the real row in the database objuser- name jack mvc - most of the are mvc code generators qcodo is fantastic to code generate from the database front controller routing and url friendly qcodo does not have one clean template qcodo has objlabel- render

2261835
put	get
assuming you ve written your own security service or are using a security plugin like the spring security acegi plugin you would i am not aware of any plugin that allows access controls to be put on domain properties
you can create get set methods for the properties you want to control access to and put your security logic there

2261979
implements	extends
i d hesitate to call this a multiple inheritance issue because interfaces merely describe well interface--a set of methods an implements class must define--rather than any implementation
extends an interface with other interfaces doesn t really mean the subinterface inherits from the superinterface but rather that the subinterface is in essence a concatenation of the methods defined in the two

2262857
restrict	shared
the use of the mmap function is restrict by the qshrmemctl system value
when this system value is 0 the mmap function may not create a shared mapping having with prot_write capability

2262971
integer	unsigned
the the entire floating point value can be treated as a signed magnitude integer value for purposes of comparison not twos-compliment
since the exponent as stored is unsigned it is possible to use integer instructions to compare floating point values

2262980
put	get
put this code on top of your php script
you can get rid of magic quotes also in php if your web hosting provider doesn t allow you to disable it in php.ini file

2263393
uiviewcontroller	uiwindow
these also are usually not subclassed - logic goes in uiviewcontroller subclasses
in an iphone app you create one uiwindow instance at the launch of the app or the framework loads it from the xib depending on how you ve configured things

2264320
post	get
this returns new elements object with ref count 1 which you are responsible to deallocate since you ve just created a copy in this line you add the new created copy to post which looks like collection. all collections retain new values so you pass your new copy with ref count 1 and post increase the ref count to 2 by retaining it
on release post will send to each element release which will decrement ref count to 1 so elements does not get deallocated and you end up with memory leak

2264471
children	parent
the creator for hudson now jenkins kohsuke kawaguchi just published november 2013 kohsuke git-children-of given a commit find immediate children of that commit
as illustrated by this thread in a vcs based on history represented by a dag directed acyclic graph there is not one parent or one child

2264831
inherited	properties
here is what i came up with 1 you have a commandrelay behavior which you install at the root of each user control which should respond to commands 2 viewmodel serving the user control is inherited from the reactiveviewmodel 3 you do not bind controls to icommand properties but use routedcommand s instead and in xaml as a result on your viewmodel you can listen to the commands in a very rx way now you have the power of routed commands you are free to choose to handle the command on any or even multiple viewmodels in the hierarchy plus you have a single flow for all the commands which is nicier to rx than separate iobservable s
when i started to think of how to marry mvvm and rx the first thing i thought of was an observablecommand but then i thought that the standard mvvm way of binding controls to icommand s properties is not very rx ish it breaks the event flow into fairly static couplings

2266868
comparator	comparable
if it is the latter odds are every future sorting use case would require a comparator at which point the implementation of comparable may slow down users of the class not speed them up
i would say that an object should implement comparable if that is the clear natural way to sort the class and anyone would need to sort the class would generally want to do it that way

2267841
post	get
some information from the server while post should be used to send some information to the server
after that a couple of things that can be noted using get your users can use the back button in their browser and they can bookmark pages there is a limit in the size of the parameters you can pass as get 2kb for some versions of internet explorer if i m not mistaken

2267841
post	get
the limit is much more for post and generally depends on the server s configuration
anyway i don t think we could live without get think of how many urls you are using with parameters in the query string every day -- without get all those wouldn t work

2267844
post	get
post can move large data while get cannot
but generally it s not about a shortcomming of get rather a convention if you want your website webapp to be behaving nicely

2267980
accessor	properties
this is why you should use properties or explicit accessor
if you had this you would not and should not ever have to miss around with the retention of a properties

2268756
integer	fractions
it s not that different from just converting an integer
for single precision once you get the exponent and fractions the value note 1 of the number is then frac 2 23 + 1 2 exp or frac 2 exp - 23 + 2 exp

2268850
for-loop	loops
the statement dt1.columns.count is evaluated at the very beginning of the for-loop
it does not get re-evaluated each time loops runs

2269313
haskell	ocaml
secondly the haskell ffi is more powerful that is it does more with less code than ocaml s and more libraries are avaliable via hackage so i don t think foreign interfaces will be a deciding factor
the only problem i can see is that ocaml doesn t really support multicore parallelism while ghc has excellent support and performance

2270284
setinterval	settimeout
after sending the email or tapping cancel the timer is left paused and the settimeout setinterval functions will not fire
this will break any thing that relies on settimeout setinterval such as jquery animations and any async ajax calls since jquery uses setinterval to poll until the request returns i ve hit this problem myself

2270366
kde	gnome
that is for kde i do not know how it would be done under gnome.
you may also be able to do this independantly of either gnome kde by using dbus although i cannot say 100 confidently on that either.

2270366
kde	gnome
you may also be able to do this independantly of either gnome kde by using dbus although i cannot say 100 confidently on that either.
just be aware that for a truly cross-platform job you have to take into account of the different gui s such as under linux x is the main window manager interface and either gnome kde sits on top of it..i am not singling out other gui s such as fluxbox windowmaker to name but a few and that there will be a lot of platform dependant code and also in conjunction you will be dealing with windows clipboard as well..all in all a big integrated code.

maybe that might be better as i would imagine gnome kde etc are using the x s api to do the clipboard work...if that is confirmed then the work would be cut out and be independant of the major gui interfaces... i hope that would be the case as it would make life easier for your project

2270405
mvp	presenter
while there are pre-tailored mvp frameworks for winforms mvc# comes to mind if you re not developing large-scale apps then you may want to start gently and implement some of the concepts using your own code
jeremy miller s excellent build your own cab series of articles is a great resource here as you can take some of the first few ideas out of there and get some separation of concerns between your forms presentation and business logic presenter and service classes

2270833
folder	directory
unix-servers are case-sensitive - they distinguish between upper-case and lowercase letters in file names and folder names
so if you move your website from a windows to a unix-server when you change web host for instance you risk getting a certain amount of page not found -errors 404 errors because directory and other websites linking to yours sometimes get the cases wrong typically writing the first letter of folder names in upper-case etc.

2271118
maven	pom.xml
note that maven 3 talked about introducing the mixin concept which will allow you to fragment your pom.xml into several files but it looks like that is not happening now until maven 4
if you are using maven 2 you can simply create several parent levels

2271621
free	malloc
the only issue that grouping like-aligned types might have is to reduce use of the stack but compilers are free to reorder the layout of variables on the stack anyway or even reuse locations for different local variables at different times or to keep locals in registers and not ever have them on the stack so you re generally not buying anything for an optimized compile
if you re going to be type punning items on the stack you ll need to use the same methods for alignment safety that you d use for data off the stack - maybe more since memory allocated by malloc or new is guaranteed to be appropriately aligned for any type - that guarantee is not made for storage allocated to automatic variables

2271621
int	chars
such as by accessing the bytes in a chars array as an int by casting a to an since the alignment requirement of the might be different from an int the above access of data through an might not be alignment safe
however since malloc is specifed to return pointers suitably aligned for any type the following should not have any alignment problems however note that sizeof int might not be 4 and int types might be little- or big-endian so there are still portability issues with the above code - just not alignment issues

2271622
profiling	debugging	ready	each
6 when you re ready just click run for a lot more info on sql profiling see msdn if this is something you want to keep an audit table then you ll need to insert records into your own audit table yourself
if this is not something you want to leave in permanently it s just for debugging performance analysis purposes then your best bet is to use sql profiling and monitor the sp stmtcompleted event which will record the stats for each statement within a sproc

2272341
bazaar	git
i would recommend using git bazaar or another vcs which doesn t require you to tell it when you move sources around
i know git best so i ll say regarding it that you don t need to tell it when you ve moved files and you don t need to maintain vcs-specific directories in each of your own directory

2273074
gprof	shark
instrumented profiling such as gprof is not particularly useful unless you really just want to know about call graphs and the number of times that functions are called
much more useful for performance analysis is a sampling profiler and for this apple s shark tool part of chud is one of the best

2273448
boost	allocator
if your compiler doesn t support std tr1 alignment_of you can use boost alignment_of instead
the standard containers use allocator to seperate allocator deallocation from construction destruction

2273927
return-value-optimization	nrvo
this comes in two forms name return-value-optimization nrvo and anonymous return-value-optimization usually just return-value-optimization
from what you re saying your compiler implements return-value-optimization but not nrvo -- which means it s probably a somewhat older compiler

2274084
post	put	post	get
if you re doing a post request you can check for this in the page_load using if page.ispostback. remember that typically you ll only be sending the data for part of a page not the whole page itself so you won t need the or tags
when i ve seen this done in asp.net websites before separate pages have been used for the ajax calls index.aspx normal site index-ajax.aspx ajaxified page component. you don t have to use page.ispostback most ajax requests are just get s so if you put in your page_load response.write hello world

2274236
integer	unsigned
based upon your comments you want an unsigned int although you say unsigned integer so maybe you want an integral value not necessarily an unsigned int
in c for unsigned integral type the value -1 when converted to that type is guaranteed to be largest value of that type assign the values size_max uint_max and ulong_max to the variables respectively

2274382
onresume	onpause
but keep the following in mind i would strongly advise you to set up the first timer event in the activity s onresume method and not in its oncreate method
also remove cancel your handler in onpause

cpu	processors
for better or worse on a cpu whose clock rate varies which started on laptops but is now common almost everywhere the relationship between the clock count and wall time varies right along with the clock speed
if memory serves if you force windows to install with the assumption that there are multiple physical processors not just multiple cores you ll get a kernel in which queryperformancecounter will read the motherboard s 1.024 mhz clock instead

2275042
mtu	icmp
tcp will try to not send packets that gets fragmented but slice the data up in segments fitting the mtu
the icmp reply should contain all the data

2275221
put	get
if i understand correctly concurrent get s can block each other and concurrent put s can block each other modulo your use of the block parameter but that gets and puts do not mutually block
my reading of the source code is that get obtains a read lock which is independent of of the lock called _notempty acquired by put

2275309
delphi	oxygene
it is unicode and works before d2009 it s memory is managed in ole32.dll so no dependency on either delphi s memory manager or the clr gc
you do not have to directly deal with pointers in oxygene you could write it like so marshalas tells the clr how to marshal strings back and forth

2275563
post	get
calling post too often or having the posted delegate doing too much hard work can seriously affect the ui thread
to the point that it doesn t get around its regular duties anymore

2275965
awt	swing
although awt is supposed to be thread-safe it isn t really
so i suggest like swing do all the gui manipulation on the awt event dispatch thread edt

2276822
gdal	arcgis
gdal is included in arcgis to work with some raster data formats
they do not use the gdal utilities to do any geoprocessing

2276913
min	max
if you need the highest change the first query to order by id desc and the second query to use max instead of min
the most flexible way to write this which doesn t require a correlated subquery is to use row_number sql server 2005+ only note that row_number isn t always the most efficient if you can use min max instead just the easiest to write

2277303
ecj	javac
eclipse has its own built-in compiler called ecj which is probably the reason you could get away with not having the jdk installed to use it
it does not use javac

2277708
rvm	bundler
my other question is whether you re using rvm or not
gem install tzinfo builder memcache-client rack rack-test rack-mount erubis mail text-format thor bundler i18n gem install rails --pre if it still doesn t work make sure you drop the rack-mount gem

2278257
int	chars
just use int array as a buffer to read and then copy to byte array
you are reading unsigned int into chars address this may not be very portable or safe

2278321
sudo	passwd
you can t invoke sudo this way
it reads it s passwd directly from the keyboard via dev tty not from stdin

2278810
many-to-many	one-to-many
in relational databases you cannot express a many-to-many relationship using only the two tables involved
you must break up the many-to-many into 2 one-to-many relationships using what is called a link table

2278902
inherited	properties
unlike a fluent interface this works fine without inherited methods giving back the base class and messing up the chain
when you inherit a properties the caller really shouldn t care whether firstname was first implemented in person or customer or object

2279263
accessor	properties
there is properties declaration syntax to work around that letting you name the properties name and your instance variable mname and map one to the other. the second example directly accesses the instance variable no accessor message
which isn t a properties and is not sythenize d

2279263
accessor	superclass	accessor	properties
and it doesn t matter whether you synthesize the accessor hand-wave them to a superclass with dynamic or define them yourself
that s how the object will respond to the accessor message but the accessor message the compiler generates will be no different since a properties access could just as easily come from outside the class as from inside it

2279263
accessor	ivar
that s how the object will respond to the accessor message but the accessor message the compiler generates will be no different since a properties access could just as easily come from outside the class as from inside it
say it the ivar wasn t an iboutlet that doesn t matter

2279596
ant	maven
added publishing from within ant
creating a local ivy repository is straight forward maven is not required

2280574
serializable	deserialization
this attribute affects only deserialization and prevents the runtime from throwing an exception if a member is missing from the serializable stream
a member can also be marked with the nonserialized attribute to indicate that it should not be serializable

2281036
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to the latest versioning of the svn client
the versioning you have installed doesn t have the --keep-local option yet

2281039
int	double
so when calling sqrt 1.0 n the compiler consider you try to call test.sqrt int with a double swhich is obviously not possible
that s quite normal. by writing this code you didn t overload the math.sqrt method in any way you simply defined a test.sqrt int as an argument

2281107
width	text-align
this only works if the block element in question has a known width either fixed or relative else it cannot figure where to start and end
the text-align center

2281215
post	get
should get you started and in your target_controller raise postnotfound unless post edit note for rails 3 for a longer explanation on why actioncontroller routingerror doesn t work for rails 3 rails 3.0 exception handling
rails ticket 4444 if your application relies on engines that extend your app with their own routes things will break because those routes will never get fired

2281450
put	get
i would not put constraints like these in the save method it s too late
raising an exception there doesn t help the user who entered the data in the wrong way because it will end up as a 500 and the user won t get the form with errors back etc

2281671
inherited	properties
the in operator will check on all the properties reachable up in the prototype chain as you can see hasownproperty returns false and the in operator returns true when checking the tostring method this method is defined up in the prototype chain because obj inherited form object.prototype
i generally use the typeof operator it will return undefined either if the properties doesn t exist or its value is undefined

2281782
innodb	myisam
if you need transactions you should switch to the innodb table type
mysql doesn t support transactions on the myisam table type which is unfortunately the default table type

2282144
implements	extends
the documentation explains which interfaces to implements and which classes to look at
this doesn t seem possible out of the box but it should be by writing your own parser for the access log sampler or by extends it

2283530
put	get
if you want to get fancy with it you could even write an xml file with image information and put it on the server then parse the xml when you load the images to supply meta data such as file names who uploaded the file etc
not familiar with getty but if you put your images in directories on your sever you can use php to get a directory listing and then loop through that listing to display the images

2283670
rational-numbers	floating-point	rational-numbers	fractions
-p therefore absent a decimal floating point or rational-numbers type outputting it as a string is the only way to get it trimmed to exactly the precision required for display
it returns a string because 0.1 and powers thereof which are used to display decimal fractions are not representable at least not with full accuracy in binary floating-point systems

2283732
for-loop	arrays
i suspect you are corrupting your strings in the for-loop
you could try to rewrite it as in voltagefordisplayandanalyze.cpp while still not clean and concise the code in the for-loop is quite redundant and we could have used std vector instead of c arrays this code now is guaranteed to assign correct data to

2284335
put	get
i have not seen this subdir construct in a webservice hosted within sharepoint yet disclaimer my knowledge is limited to 2 or 3 working implementations of a custom webservices within sharepoint normally you d put the asmx straight into the isapi folder of the 12 hive
this will map onto _vti_bin. put the assembly if any in the gac or in the website bin but i d suggest using the gac until you get the basics up and running do stuff for discovery if you really need to but for testing this shouldn t be necessary it might not be related at all but i d still try to get things working from the _vti_bin first then try and mess with subfolders

2285343
pow	math.h	cos	math.h	sin	math.h
in the c language the standard c library includes common math functions not included in the language itself pow sin and cos for power sine and cosine respectively
the headers of which are included in math.h

2285452
swt	swing
swing swt works on ubuntu but not nearly as well as on windows that s at least my experience
the main reason to choose swt is if you want to build your application on the eclipse rcp framework where you get a dockable views editors plugin mechanism automatic updates user roles

2285604
post	put
it was not originally intended to be another way to write the data access layer although many post and implement it as such
for small apps it depends on how much effort you want to put in

2286542
stdio	fflush
some implementations of stdio use full-buffer buffering as opposed to line-buffering when not writing to a terminal
once you fix the previous error and get the process to close that will fflush stdout

2287637
persistent	transient
the base class has overriden equals gethashcode methods etc... in my implementation of the equals method in the base class i check whether the entity is transient not yet persistent
an entity is transient when the id that has been assigned to it is still the default value

2287874
post	put
if this is not what you want you need to post more information
if i were to guess you want to have a char array or a char pointer with enough memory and then put your query string in it the above assumes that your have a string in and that you want the string value in your sql query

2288489
postgresql	mysql
what is called a database in mysql is sort of a schema in postgresql
imho it doesn t make sense to create a postgresql-engine in mysql if you want to use postgresql

2288951
serializable	deserialization
any class that can be serializable implements serializable should declare that uid and it must be changed whenever anything changes that affects the serializable additional fields removed fields change of field order ...
the field s value is checked during deserialization and if the value of the serializable object does not equal the value of the class in the current vm an exception is thrown

2289343
put	get
that put the center of rotation some number of negative units in front of the camera which meant that the center of rotation was behind the camera
that meant that the point of view traveled around a sphere some distance away from the image and so couldn t get around the image but could point away from it

2289979
subclass	inherited
you have to define an abstract method b in the base class test which makes this class abstract so you cannot have instances of it to call this method otherwise the function b is not defined in this class only in it s subclass of which the base class knows nothing and should not have to know anything
read up on inherited

2290239
valgrind	memcheck
i assume you re using valgrind memcheck tool which is what it is famous for
since you are using valgrind already you might also try running your program through formerly exp-ptrcheck which is an experimental tool that is designed to catch certain types of errors that memcheck will miss including access checks for stack and global arrays and use of pointers that happen to point to a valid object but not the object that was intended

2290240
pop-up	dialog
i ve set qdialog 2 s flag to qt pop-up as well which doesn t seem to close down qdialog 1 anymore
qdialog 1 is set to qt pop-up qdialog 2 was set to qt dialog by default

2290421
submit	submission
the event handler can check if the submit is allowable yet and abort if not
here s some docs note that if javascript on the page calls .click on one of the form submission buttons the form will be submitted without calling your .submit handler

2290573
concave	convex
this seems a specific case of the concave hull problem
many algorithms do exist to solve the opposite convex hull problems jarvis march wikipedia o n 2 graham scan wikipedia o nlogn these are simplest ones there are at least 3 more but they just optimize performance that is not one of your primary goals

2290578
versioning	upgrade
try the full versioning -
if this doesn t work - upgrade the jdbc driver

2290742
for-loop	arrays
if we take a look at jquery function itself it has a for-loop to iterate over an object that has a length property falsely believing it s an arrays
document.stylesheets does have length property but it s obviously not an arrays

2290818
intersect	contains
insert into mystagingtable select col1 col2 col3 from myrealtable rt where not exists select rt.col1 rt.col2 rt.col3 intersect select col1 col2 col3 from mystagingtable this will handle all duplicates including null note that is will insert the duplicates from the real table is any
say if the real table contains 1 1 1 1 1 1 and the staging table contains 2 2 2 both records with 1 1 1 will be inserted

2291509
public	protected
it is not public because it shouldn t be invoked by anyone other than the jvm
however it must be protected so that it can be overridden by subclasses who need to define behavior for it

2292104
lambda	first-class-functions
python s general philosophy is unrelated to lambda calculus it doesn t encourage this way of thinking at all so it s not a functional language
it s a turing machine with first-class-functions

2292994
qtimer	qobject
but in your code qobject connect qtimer signal timeout qtimer slot recivetime
qtimer is a class name and not a object of this class

2293042
puts	gets
third postrunnable does not take effect immediately but rather puts things on a message queue for the main application thread to process when it gets a chance
if it gets tied up -- say handling touch events -- it may well skip over some seemingly redundant imageview redraws or have them go by so fast they appear to not happen

2294219
client-side	server-side
i would encourage you to consider it for if you decide to tackle client-side validation
important client-side validation is not a substitution for server-side validation

2294322
memcached	apc
if and only if you have a web application which has to live on different webservers loadbalancing you have to use memcached for distributed caching
if not just stick to apc and its cache

2294707
submit	submission
to prevent that put a handler on the form s submit event that prevents stops it the event is not fired when you submit the form programmatically so it won t prevent your link sending it
usually this means that both your link and the browser s default mechanism are submission the form

2296040
qprogressbar	qwidget
since you are not using the layout you will have to manually manage the position of the qprogressbar
you can add the progress bar as child of your qwidget without adding it in the layout

2296111
nunit	mstest
also you can try to convince your company to buy you a copy of resharper preferred or testdriven.net - so you can easily run nunit tests from visual studio
i am not sure how to run unit tests without visual studio but i had moved to nunit from mstests and its reasonably easy - as long as you don t use the test context from mstest can t remember the real name all you have to do is to rename the tags testclass - testfixture etc there is always 1-1 mapping and change the usings

2296111
nunit	mstest
i am not sure how to run unit tests without visual studio but i had moved to nunit from mstests and its reasonably easy - as long as you don t use the test context from mstest can t remember the real name all you have to do is to rename the tags testclass - testfixture etc there is always 1-1 mapping and change the usings
running nunit tests on the build machine is trivial

2296471
hash	md5
in fact there doesn t seem to be any reason at all to use a hash - just generate a sufficiently long random value
as per my comment on ykaganovich s answer sha1 is surprisingly slightly faster than md5

2296471
hash	md5	salt	md5
from your description of the problem you are not trying to create a secure hash - merely hide the file in a large namespace - in which case use of a salt rainbow tables are irrelevant - the only consideration is the likelihood of a false collision where 2 different files give the same hash
the probability of this happening with md5 is very very remote

2296531
post	get
the http standard defines different semantics for get post operations sec 9.1.1 in particular you can do information retrieval using data coming from a get request but you shouldn t do anything which involves some notion of state change
one reason for this is that the user agent may prefetch pages and doing get requests without the user actually having clicked on a link

2297458
padding	overlapping
if background color is not an issue you can use padding instead of margin
that s because overlapping vertical margins are collapsed

2298799
post	get
there s a lot of information out there how post works
notice that the form uses the post method not get

2299778
perforce	svn
not free perforce is okay but whatever you do don t use visual sourcesafe and risk your entire repository getting corrupted at some point in time and not realizing it until much later
short answer is svn

2299813
disk	ram
the other interesting metric here is privatedirty which is basically the amount of ram inside the process that can not be paged to disk it is not backed by the same data on disk and is not shared with any other processes
another way to look at this is the ram that will become available to the system when that process goes away and probably quickly subsumed into caches and other uses of it

2299843
puts	gets
what happens is that the system call calls wait_event or wait_event_timeout or some other wait function which adds the task to a list of tasks waiting for something then puts the task to sleep which changes its state and calls schedule to relinquish the current cpu
after this the task cannot be run again until it gets woken up typically by another task kernel task etc or interrupt handler calling a wake function which will wake up the task s sleeping waiting for that particular event which means the scheduler will soon schedule them again

2300769
punctuation	words
s + b | .join re.split r w+ needle re.i splitting on w+ removes all punctuation as well as whitespace so there s no need to escape anything
my results seem to match the ones you wanted except the parentheses in video are not highlighted only the words video is

2300809
put	get
talk to your boss and see if s he can help put people in their place
try and get the other team members overloaded with work that they should be doing so that they re not doing the work you should be doing if people want to discuss stuff about which they have no clue and you want to make the discussion productive explain to them that the fundamentals that make the decision obvious are well documented and identify where preferably text books or standards documents

2300995
eventlet	gevent
this is doable in eventlet but it s not very straightforward here
i recommend using gevent where all you have to do is from gevent import monkey

2301056
punctuation	words
note this will return punctuation attached to the last words which may or may not be desired
it d be simple enough to replace any punctuation characters at the tail of the string in php but if you want to stay completely within sql i think you can use trim

2301329
implements	extends
the following query would return all persistent objects from java.lang.object o the interface named might be implements by various persistent classes but because the interface is not mapped and thus unknown you need to use the fully qualified name in your hql query this will return instances of all persistent classes that implements your transaction interface
indeed according to the hibernate documentation on polymorphic queries hibernate queries can name any java class or interface in the from clause. the query will return instances of all persistent classes that extends that class or implements the interface

2301637
udp	tcp
but when you use udp connection you may recieve datagram and you will be informed about senders ip and port but in common case you cannot respond on it
when you talk with client via tcp connection you maintain tcp session

2301782
x86	64bit
likewise if the main assembly is set to x64 it will only run on 64bit operating system and any attempt at loading an assembly set to x86 will fail
a msil main executable assembly will run as 32-bit on a 32-bit operating system like if it was set to x86 with the above failure point and as 64bit on a 64bit operating system like if it was set to x64 with the above failure point. obviously typically you want to go with the msil setting if you re not calling assemblies that are flagged as something specific and as long as you re not doing p invoke that isn t portable across 32-bit and 64bit i have no idea if this works if p invoke to win-api functions will map to a correctly bitsized dll or not. since references are pointers and pointers are stored as a native x-bit address on the two platforms depending on the amount of references you have you might have a case against just going with msil

2301797
post	get
also it may helps secure http post in android https connection android other way is using http request headers for transfering data but is not an elegant not good solution and unsuitable in most cases
if you don t want to see the parameters in the query string use the post request instead get request

2302020
x86	64bit
first off setting platform target to x86 on your .exe project is a very useful when you are debugging your project on a 64bit version of windows
the vs2005 8 debugger doesn t support edit + continue on 64bit code

2302020
x86	64bit
choosing x86 in your release build is something you should do if you program has a dependency on a component that only works in 32-bit code
that s not uncommon there are tons of com components out there that never have and never will be ported to 64bit unmanaged code

2302260
vmware	virtualbox
also there are tons of features in vmware such as ace to lockdown virtual machines that just don t exist in virtualbox
i found that ubuntu 3d graphics work out of the box in virtualbox 3 where vmware 7 doesn t support out of the box at least

2302260
vmware	esx	vmware	virtualbox
vbox doesn t support multiple monitor spanning if you have a 3-monitor setup as transparently as vmware
because of compatibility with vmware infrastructure esx i would prefer vmware for headless server operations and virtualbox for anything that requires user interaction photoshop gui etc

2302655
pull	push
if you aren t sure that you will have some of the attributes then you can use a stylesheet that is more of a pull and specifically ask for certain attributes in a specific order if the attribute does not exist then is selects nothing for the value and leaves the empty spot between the commas
the previous version of the stylesheet relied on the structure of the xml document to drive a lot of the output often referred to as the push method

2303425
accessor	properties
don t bother using accessor until they re necessary
converting a simple attribute to a properties is quick and easy and doesn t need modification of client code

2303985
prepare	execute
which means that if you want to see an sql query you have to use well sql queries and not prepare statements
using prepare statements when you prepare the statement it is sent to the mysql server when you bind the variables + execute the statement only the variables are sent to the mysql server and the statement + bound variables are execute on the mysql server -- without it re-doing the preparation each time the statement is execute which is why prepare statements can be good for performance when the same statement is execute several times there is no building of an sql query on the php side so there is no way to actually get that query

2304794
oncreate	ondestroy	oncreate	onstart	onstart	ondestroy
also these pairs oncreate ondestroy onstart onstop onpause onresume are intended to be the proper pairs for acquiring and then releasing resources such as binding to service s registering receivers etc to ensure that they are correctly acquired prior to being needed and released and not leaked when no longer needed
i would generally recommend doing this in either oncreate ondestroy or onstart onstop depending on the semantics that you want if your activity wants to be interacting with the service the entire time it is running for example maybe it can retrieve some data from a network for you and will return the data when ready and you want to allow this to happen while in the background so if the user returns you will have the data ready then oncreate ondestroy is probably appropriate

2305332
maven	pom.xml	ant	pom.xml
and i find it less light because ant scripts grow ugly and unpredictable and become hard to manage while maven scripts stay simple because of the rich functionality provided with the tool
i d again recommend maven2 - it is very feature rich through the use of plugins but it can also be very light depending on what that means it doesn t need hard installation just unzip directory + add the path to it to the environment variables depending on os it doesn t require configuration - just copy-paste a simple pom.xml file and your build is ready

2305354
min	max
once you have the min max tables keep them around
you want to go back to the disk as little as possible and many of the reasons for wanting to repaint your window will not require you to rescan your min max tables

2305908
free	malloc
it does not promise to overwrite the data that was stored in the memory you free or to prevent the debugger from reading the unallocated memory
freeing memory means that accessing it from the program thereafter is undefined behavior and the memory is available for re-use next time you call malloc

2306209
client-side	server-side
your javascript code is running client-side and so it s subject to the same origin policy
your asp code is running server-side and so it isn t

2306211
google-chrome	firefox
if you don t google-chrome treats it as an empty element and does not render it
whereas firefox does

2306275
swt	swing
heavy components native awt hide swing components not a problem most of the time as as use of heavy components is rather rare pros swt uses native elements when possible so always native behavior supported by eclipse gui editor vep vep also supports swing and awt large number of examples online has an integrated awt swt bridge to allow use of awt and swing components cons swt requires native libraries for each supported system may not support every behavior on all systems because of native resources used hint options managing native resources while native components will often be disposed with their parent other resources such as fonts have to be manually released or registered as dispose listener to a component for automatic release
pros swing part of java library no need for additional native libraries works the same way on all platforms integrated gui editor in netbeans and eclipse good online tutorials by sun oracle supported by official java extensions like java opengl cons swing native look and feel may behave different from the real native system

2306457
sorting	filtering
this doesn t implement custom sorting yet but that s an easy addition. the callback method then runs the query to get the counts
if no filtering is being used we get the count for all rows

2307380
factors	mean
but what exactly is o log n what it means precisely is as n tends towards infinity the time tends towards where a is a constant scaling factors
or actually it doesn t quite mean that

2309367
hide	show
try to come with a different approach check if mouse if over bitmap and hence do not hide it
problem is you are hiding and showing bitmap on mouseover so when you move mouseover bitmap mouse goes off panel onpanelmouseleave is called and you hide bitmap which means now mouse if over panel onpanelmouseover is called and in that event you again show bitmap and that means now mouse if over bitmap again and out of panel and hence you are stuck in a hide show circle

2309384
for-loop	loops
you shouldn t be incrementing head after in the for-loop
printlist will return null every time since loops wont stop until head is null

2310226
stdout	fflush
fflush stdout
it might just be that stdout isn t getting fflush - often stdout is linebuffered when connected to a console

2310241
stdout	fflush
try adding fflush stdout after the printf
it s possible that it s just stdout not getting fflush after the printf

2310282
ireport	subreports
try using ireport if you are not
when viewing a report within ireport you can select the properties of the subreports within the main report

2310396
post	get
if you have junit 4.7+ i recommend looking into the new feature called rules which are explained in this blog post
they might not be exactly what you want but they are probably the best you get with junit

2310912
required	placeholder
define a class like roundy-corner and use the jquery corner plugin like so you will need the jquery roundy corner plugin i like to use javascript here because it doesn t required any additional markup in the source document
the script will insert placeholder elements as needed

2311518
ant	maven
if you are looking for something that is light in terms of the tools itself being lightweight ant may be a better option
it doesn t have the conventions built in like maven

2312060
ada	pascal
later pascal-esque languages c modula-2 ada etc. had their standards written to accept the odd extra semicolon without behaving like you d just peed in the cake mix
i m not an expert on the commas but i know that standard pascal was very persnickity about semi-colons being statement separators not terminators

2312258
margin	height
your .hint div has a 1em top margin to push it down below the line of text however in your second instance your .popup div doesn t contain anything as absolutely positioned elements take up no space
an inline-block div with no content has no height or width and sits on the baseline of a line of text

2313486
button	checkbox
also if you want to group radio button together so only one of the group can be selected place them in a group box.
unless i m not understanding your question - it should be as simple as modifying your code to include a checkbox such as for nonprofit then when you process then checked if nonprofit is true instead of checking for y n radiobuttons are basically the same as checkbox

2313549
serializable	deserialization
once all custom code has finished it will deserialize all automatically serializable objects like your myclasswithnvc class in the sample
if you let myclasswithnvc inherit from iserializable then it runs your custom deserialization code and myclass.nvc is not null in the wrapper deserializer method

2315153
int	chars
here s a summary adjusted to 32 bit int you use modulo arithmetic to prevent your int from overflowing after each operation
initially set c text stackoverflow m length of the n-grams d size of your alphabet 256 q a large prime so that d+1 q doesn t overflow 8355967 might be a good choice dm d m-1 mod q first calculate the hash value of the first n-gram and for every following n-gram the reason why you have to add d q before subtracting the oldest chars is because you might run into negative values due to small values caused by the previous modulo operation

2315226
post	get
i m going to point something out to you that you missed in your post
simply knowing c c++ c# isn t going to get you a career in game development

next	except
a block except lambdas doesn t support return but you can skip to the next statement using next which in a rake task has the same effect of using return in a method
task foo do puts printed next puts never printed end or you can move the code in a method and use return in the method

2316530
post	get
check out the addhistorypoint method for adding data to the history hash and check this blog post for example usage
the reason you get a hashed response when is because the history state hash table is empty but not null

2316935
firefox	safari
i had the same problem and found that whilst i couldn t inspect hover objects in firefox with firebug safari s web inspector would freeze the current state and allow inspection
to activate safari s web inspector just enter the following line into the terminal and restart safari defaults write com.apple.safari webkitdeveloperextras -bool true activate the hover element in the browser then right click and select inspect element

2317989
n-gram	words
an n-gram index used by lucene produces better results for longer words
the approach to produce candidates up to a given edit distance will probably work good enough for words found in normal text but will not work good enough for names addresses and scientific texts

2318369
inherited	properties
answering title question this is the current css 2.1 spec accepted values include static relative absolute fixed and inherited
i m not sure about css 3 it s still work in progress but they don t seem to mention static whatever i wouldn t really care yet answering body question the default is static so you d be changing the properties for every single item in the page

2319329
cpu	processors
as the relative speed of cpu cache and main ram is not that far off the relative speed of ram and tape as the time the merge sort was discovered maybe we should start using merge sorts again
a merge sort based on the size of the processors cache with the blocks being divided between the processors comes to mind

2319828
superclass	subclassing
it is worth noting that the java compiler will automatically put in a no-arg constructor call to the superclass if you do not explicitly invoke a superclass constructor
read about the super keyword scroll down the subclassing constructors

2319836
free	malloc
for free it is the case the standard free takes a void for malloc it isn t the standard malloc takes a size_t you are passing an int and size_t can t be a typedef for int -- size_t is unsigned
if you call free with a type other than void it should instantiate your template

2319853
hide	show
as long as you re keeping them within logical groups you can just move swap show hide the group s container like nsbox or an nsview
if you have a lot of logical groups which aren t always show every session you can separate them out into their own xibs and only load them when they re needed to save launch time and memory

2320072
portrait	landscape
when that is all said and done in portrait orientation android will use main.xml found in res layout and in landscape main.xml found in res layout-land
assuming you do not have a separate xml file dedicated to landscape format you might need to create one and specify the landscape-layout look

2320556
google-chrome	firefox
watin does exactly that and i believe they recently added google-chrome support update 6 22 2011 currrently watin only works on firefox 2 and 3 not in firefiox 4 and almost certainly not in firefox 5 which was released today
also the time of this answer google-chrome support was supposedly being added but it looks like that never got fully baked and now is not listed as a suported platform on their home page

2320685
processors	hyperthreading
if you have an i7 or similar processors the os will see this as having 8 cores when in reality it has 4 cores with 2 hyperthreads core
for most operations hyperthreading does not really provide the same scalability as a second core even though the os sees it this way

2320841
kerberos	ntlm
this negotiation attempts to use kerberos but if that doesn t work it ll fall back and use the older ntlm protocol
kerberos is a great choice if you re in a domain environment

2320952
inherited	subclassing
for instance if you wanted a inheritedrequest class which inherited from request to be able to be used in your getobjects method
the serviceknowntype attribute is designed to provide knowledge about subclassing not directly referenced

2321916
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
it pushes uiviewcontroller not views
so when something happens in your second tab where the uinavigationcontroller lives you will push a uiviewcontroller onto the stack

2322091
swt	swing
also pivot swt etc
pro swing the biggest advantage of swing imho is that you do not need to ship the libraries with you application which avoids dozen of mb

2322229
inherited	properties
it looks like the view controller you are pushing from does not inherited from ttviewcontroller
you may also need to set the navigationbartintcolor properties back to your original color after the view has been popped off the stack

2323064
valgrind	memcheck
edit i was right about valgrind but there is some hope unfortunately memcheck doesn t do bounds checking on static or stack arrays
we d like to but it s just not possible to do in a reasonable way that fits with how memcheck works

2323582
implements	extends
as a rule of thumb a list implementation should implements this interface if for typical instances of the class this loop runs faster than this loop as of java se 6 the implements classes are arraylist attributelist copyonwritearraylist rolelist roleunresolvedlist stack vector
get n for linked lists is not a constant operation for classes that extends abstractsequentiallist

2324076
postgresql	mysql
i don t know postgresql at all but there must be some significant misconfiguration in steven s example to not show similar results
given postgresql s reputation for doing things better than mysql or at least as good as i daresay that postgresql would demonstrate similar performance if properly used

2324328
equals	gethashcode
i d change your equals method to something like the following which isn t a major change - i think it takes care of the above mentioned bug and changes a couple other things that are strictly style-related so may not have any interest to you
also note that i haven t actually compiled and test my equals method so there s a nearly 100 chance that there s a bug or at least a syntax error note that strictly speaking the original gethashcode method isn t bugged even though it has the same flaw because even if you don t properly mix in the last element when the bit-length is a multiple of 32 equal object would still return the same hashcode

2324542
client-side	server-side
you cannot affect client-side print settings with a server-side language not even vb.net
the web server and the browser run in different machines and neither html nor client-side javascript define such features

2325449
g++	gcc
edit the following code compiles correctly with g++ 3.3.6
i am not able to test it on gcc 3.3.3 and suse linux at the moment

2325783
phpunit	simpletest
which also means it s harder to install configure selenium allows you to test rich dynamic javascript-based applications much better that only fetching and parsing html if you are testing a php application phpunit is generally considered much better it s activelly maintained and developped at least that simpletest
and phpunit has support for selenium tests i would recommend a combinaison of both if you can test html-related stuff with simpletest or zend_test if using zend framework it ll be faster those tests will not depend on a browser test dynamic pages with selenium use the best of both tools

2326559
post	get
this forum post has a potential solution to your problem sometimes intellisense doesn t show up in aspx ascx master files if there is a compilation error in the application
if you try running the site and you get a compilation error from asp.net try fixing it and then see if it works

2326851
superclass	subclassing
the exception is explicitly thrown by an implementation - this is the recommended way to prevent clonability in a subclassing when the superclass is cloneable
the latter case cannot occur in your class as you re directly calling the superclass method in the try block even if invoked from a subclassing calling super.clone and the former should not since your class clearly should implement cloneable

2327287
post	put
you can read more about perl command-line invokation at perldoc perlrun and making modules at p erldoc perlmod as well as many post here on stack overflow
eval is evil unless you really know what you re doing think of it as an unshielded thermonuclear nuke -- sure you could handle one if you had to and it might even save the world but you d be better off leaving it as a last resort and let the nuclear physicists deal with it. you could put your all_objects.pl code into a module and then use the module on the command line put this into allobjects.pm now on the command line however it s not really clear what you are trying to achieve with the overall design

2327835
subclass	inherited
according to the structure of your users and specialusers tables you have a table per subclass hierarchy and it is perfectly possible to map this kind of hierarchy with hibernate
first make sure that specialuser inherited from user at the object model level this is an inherited relationship not a self-reference

2328027
folder	directory
to prevent this either delete individual files not folder or use the stateserver to maintain your sessions
deleting a folder in your virtual directory may cause your application to re-start thus loosing all session data

2328239
postgresql	mysql
the query you use was often used as a replacement for a left join for the engines that lacked it most notably postgresql before 7.2 this approach has some serious drawbacks it may fail if table2.id is not unique some engines will not be able to use anything else than nested loops for this query if you need to select more than one column you will need to write the subquery several times if your engine supports left join use the left join
in mysql however there are some cases when an aggregate function in a select-level subquery can be more efficient than that in a left join with a group by

2328284
nexus	artifactory
i m not familiar with nexus but artifactory installation is dead simple - just unzip and you re good to go since it comes with an embedded jetty
repository managers employ more sophisticated caching than the maven core itself at least with artifactory you can restrict which maven repositories are queried for which group ids

2329350
free	malloc
specifically answering your question the delete operator invokes the destructor where free does not
hence the reason you don t want to mix malloc free with new delete

2329726
pbkdf2	md5	scrypt	md5
use scrypt bcrypt or pbkdf2
md5 was found to be weak back in 1996 and should not be used anymore for cryptographic purposes

2329726
hash	salt
using a good hash function is not enough to secure your passwords
you should hash the passwords together with salt that are long and cryptographically random

2329735
inherited	properties
since csmapannotation does not inherited from mkannotationview and you have not implemented the selected properties it will not work
remember that the mkannotationview has the selected properties not the mkannotation

2329839
kerberos	ldap
in addition ldap makes for a good way of abstracting authentication over lots of different means active directory kerberos even normal sql-based authentication
ldap is certainly not a dead technology

2329964
post	get
i couldn t find a decent enum for the types so i dug the magic number 4 out of a forum post for string and it works.
for casual browsers this was tricky because customdocumentproperties is dynamic so i get no intellisense

2330208
folder	directory
the nhibernate assemblies were not being properly propogated to my application s runtime directory because i was using the standard vs2008 folder structure bin debug etc
the first part of the fix was to create a single directory where all the assemblies are built and run

2330422
qthread	qapplication
in this case you would probably want to have your qthread hold and use the qudpsocket and the main thread would not ever touch it ideally the main thread shouldn t even be holding a pointer to the qudpsocket just to be sure you never forget and accidentally call a method on it from the wrong thread
when your qthread reads some udp data it can do any initial processing on it then pass the data to the main thread via qapplication postevent or via a queued signal slot connection

2330484
getter	setter
you can find where the element is being accessed with getter setter
however the setter method doesn t seem to work with chrome.

2330644
cassini	iis
i think that this is not cassini s doing this is asp.net using .net shadow copy to prevent locking your dlls
so using iis should not change anything

2330653
public	protected
however if the method is not should not be part of a public api and it is not called by other types internal to the assembly do not test it directly
it should be protected or private and it should only be tested indirectly by unit testing your public api

2330668
hash	md5
but you shouldn t be using a single round of any general purpose hash function no matter how cryptographically secure it is either
not md5 not sha-1 not sha-2 not sha-3

2330751
for-loop	loops
if by query you meant your for-loop start loops at
as of right now your for-loop structure checks if which evaluates to false so it doesn t run the code inside of loops

2331878
serializable	deserialization
as for serializable deserialization i doubt it is possible to get original object
i don t know what type of serializable powershell uses but if you consider simple xml serializable then you can realize that you can serialize only properties and nothing else. you can t serialize bodys of its methods. you can t serialize all it s event s subscribers or maybe in some cases it would be possible but i m not such a .net expert . and because the type as in my example may not be available the assembly is present only on the remote computer all the type information would need to be transmitted

2332565
range	min
strategy first i map every number in the whole range to the sets it is in
then i fold seeding with the first result as min min setsminisin and every step of the way if the set does not change i just widen the range else if the set does change i make a new element

2332780
hide	show
this will revert back to the show at first then hide behavior
it does not show because even if you uninstall your application the display setting is saved under the pasticonsstream registry entry

2332880
dwoo	smarty
while you are not a fan of smarty you might be interested in trying dwoo
they are both very similar but dwoo has the advantage of not sucking major donkey balls which is smarty s main downfall

2332880
dwoo	smarty
they are both very similar but dwoo has the advantage of not sucking major donkey balls which is smarty s main downfall
i have written an extension for the codeigniter parser library to get it to use dwoo which integrates perfectly with my template library

2333143
versioning	upgrade
as the later one is an upgrade versioning you will only need to learn new features introduced with it like modelmetadataprovider class model validator providers and others all the rest is same
for instance if you are using .net framework 4.0 later on when versioning 4.5 or 5.0 comes in you are not going to migrate

2333207
uiview	subviews
the correct way is to make a uiview that contains both the background image and the text view
uiimageview by default has userinteractionenabled set to no so scrolling or any interaction wouldn t work by default as a subviews of uiimageview

2333981
free	realloc
keep in mind that realloc doesn t have to return a new pointer it may give you the same pointer if for example there was enough free space after the block to satisfy the new size or if you re reducing the size
it can also return null if it can t expand the block you should watch out for that as well especially since will result in a memory leak when it returns null it doesn t free the old block

2333981
free	calloc
it can also return null if it can t expand the block you should watch out for that as well especially since will result in a memory leak when it returns null it doesn t free the old block
a few other things you rarely need to use calloc especially in this case since you re copying over the memory anyway

2335203
getter	setter
class person scala.reflect.beanproperty var age int this will result in the following methods being created if you instead use the beanproperty for a val instead of a var the setter won t be created only the getter
one other caveat the setter method cannot be called from inside scala

2335270
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
if google-chrome does not recognize the url scheme it defaults to a search
this is what i see in safari alt text and in firefox alt text i believe the reason why google-chrome defaults to search is that there are special google searches that use the colon

2335270
firefox	safari
e.g define dictionary filetype pdf google chromium this is one of the annoyances i have with firefox i have to jump to the search box rather than the address bar to execute these types of searches
since chrome does not have a separate search box like firefox ie and safari have this functionality is required

2335358
tabs	tabpanel
not sure i can put this into words easily but here it goes... if you have a fixed number of tabs and you know the possible values ahead of time consider passing a parameter to the reusable template via ui param
example template with the tabpanel then in the resusabledatatable template the value of datamodel will then be passed into tabcontain.xhtml as a parameter and replaced anywhere there is a # datamodel

2335441
folder	directory
you have to look at your repository s folder not the program folder
the directory structure is per repository

2335628
oncreate	onstart
the method will call the oncreate method of the service if service is not already created
else onstart method will be called

2336546
gif	png
so basically here is a way to decide the image format gif if needs animation or transparency that works on ie6 note png transparency works after ie6 jpeg if the image is a photograph
png if straight lines as in a comic or other drawing or if a wide color range is needed with transparency and ie6 is not a factor and as commented if you are unsure of what would qualify try each format with different compression ratios and weigh the quality and size of the picture and choose which one you think is best

2336552
gif	png
png has a wider color pallete than gif and gif is properitary while png is not
gif can do animations what normal-png cannot

2336574
gif	png
the main difference is gif is patented and a bit more widely supported
png is an open specification and alpha transparency is not supported in ie6

2336575
gif	png
gif is limited to 256 colors and do not support real transparency
you should use png instead of gif because it offers better compression and features

2336582
tiff	png
digital photographers use image file formats capable of reproducing a greater range of colors such as tiff raw or the lossy jpeg which is more suitable for compressing photographs
the png format is a popular alternative to gif images since it uses better compression techniques and does not have a limit of 256 colors but pngs do not support animations

2336738
ssl	https
https certificates can be obtained for free using let s encrypt or start ssl there is no legitimate reason not to support https
https vital because it does lot more than just encrypt passwords

2337472
hide	show
let the sections hide themselves like they were designed to
sections are not really meant to be show if there are no rows in them

2337686
bash	subshell
i would normally write or even more likely note that the version with a pipe will not necessarily be suitable in bash
the bourne shell would run the while loop in the current shell but bash runs it in a subshell at least by default

2337999
free	malloc
in your example you re actually calling free 0 since free accepts a pointer as an argument
you re essentially telling the runtime to free the memory at address 0 which has not been previously allocated by malloc

2338285
jstl	taglib
that s indeed jstl
it s however not builtin but all you need to do is to just drop jstl-1.2.jar in the web-inf lib and declare one of its taglib in top of the jsp page as per the tld documentation jstl core this way you can use the in the link listed tags

2338285
jstl	taglib
jstl also has xml and sql taglib but they are intented for quick prototyping only and shouldn t be used in real production
then there is the format fmt taglib which is great for internationalization and localization i18n and l10n

2338743
initializer	class-method
the + allows you to call it on the class itself without initializer it first ideal for quick access to code that doesn t need to depend on any context
i sometimes have a utility class that i define only class-method on for this

2338917
google-chrome	firefox
doesn t seem to be a problem for me in google-chrome 5
edit ah i got it in firefox

2339243
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
my xib has - file s owner descriptivenamenavviewcontroller - first responder - view uiview - navigation controller uinavigationcontroller - navigation bar uinavigationbar note that there isn t anything in the view
see viewdidload below for where the uinavigationcontroller gets attached to the uiview

2339291
onclick	onfocus
i guess safari doesn t like onclick event on select elements
replacing the onclick event with onfocus solved the problem

2339575
int	boolean
the type parameter is normally one of the migrations native types which is one of the following primary_key string text int float decimal datetime timestamp time date binary boolean
just like you cannot use int you must declare int to answer the second part of your question yes

2340089
int	double
section 12.5 of ecma-334 the c# language specifcation states reads and writes of the following data types shall be atomic bool chars byte sbyte short ushort uint int float and reference types
to that end you shouldn t see any corruption due to reads and writes of a float assuming you don t mean double here that is not guaranteed to be an atomic write

2340109
condor	checkpoint
i was favoring sge because i was more familiar with that environment but condor won finally because the customer infrastructure is windows oriented and the sge solution requires a unix or linux machine for the central manager + installing ms services for unix on the computation hosts support and installation process of condor on windows was much simpler
however you cannot use the most interesting features of condor on windows checkpoint is not available nor the condor specific ios

2340166
firefox	safari
here are my findings when using or for submitting the form same result firefox win - when tabbing the focus does hit the button firefox mac - when tabbing the focus is not hitting the button
safari mac - when tabbing the focus is not hitting the button

2341063
maven	m2e
where i could write eclipse eclipse and it started building eclipse project you could open a shell inside eclipse cd into the right directory and run the maven console from there
but when using m2e see next point you re not supposed to run eclipse eclipse

2341063
maven	m2e
sts bundles m2e which comes with an embedded version of maven so it doesn t unpack maven
but you can configure m2e to use an external version

2341310
ssl	https
export compliance specialist that sending information over https is forcing the data to go through a secure channel from ssl therefore it falls under the u.s
government requirement for a ccats review and approval. note that it doesn t matter that apple has already done this for their ssl implementation but for the government if you use encryption that is the same to them as you would ve coded it yourself

2341396
ubuntu	debian
i also verified that on my local ubuntu machine and which gave me some more output in the not working case than the debian machine
when it was not working under ubuntu i got something like this . eclipse . 26981 glib-gobject-warning invalid null pointer instance . 26981 glib-gobject-critical g_signal_connect_data assertion g_type_check_instance instance failed . 26981 gtk-critical gtk_settings_get_for_screen assertion gdk_is_screen screen failed . 26981 glib-gobject-critical g_object_get assertion g_is_object object failed . 26981 glib-gobject-warning value true of type gboolean is invalid or out of range for property visible of type gboolean . 26981 gtk-critical gtk_settings_get_for_screen assertion gdk_is_screen screen failed . 26981 glib-gobject-critical g_object_get assertion g_is_object object failed . 26981 gtk-warning screen for gtkwindow not set

2341732
free	malloc
the conclusion is that there is no way you can really guarantee that a free memory content of the stack will not change between two function calls
the solution is to use malloc because malloc does not allocate memory on the stack but on the heap

2341867
int	chars
that s why you have to use int instead of int
you cannot use primitive type such as int float chars etc. as a generic type - collections in java are generic

2342847
qnetworkrequest	qnetworkreply
to the qnetworkrequest and the data returns what look compressed because its 20 smaller and unusable
it appears that the qnetworkmanager and the qnetworkreply are not intelligent as far as decompression is concerned

2344388
ssl	https
the player supports digest authentication but not ssl client authentication using client certificates
this pretty much nails how to handle encrypted streaming also the app should connect to the https domain before running the movie so that it can pass its credentials and these credentials can be cached for mpmovieplayer

2344817
inherited	properties
note aside some containers for instance implement non-generic icollection but not so they inherited the count properties only from from icollection .
from retrieving the value of this properties is an o 1 operation

2345181
maven	cobertura
so you should wave in your aspects statically that would also improve application start time at the compile time using maven s aspectj plugin and not at the load time and then run static analysis tools on the result bytecode
both findbugs and cobertura do not work on the source level but on the bytecode level

2345237
multiplying	add
whenever an input comes in multiplying the variable s current value by 16 and add the incoming digit
since you have a 4x4 keypad you will have to treat incoming keystrokes as hexidecimal digits not decimal digits the other suggestions that multiplying by 10 will limit you to only using 10 out of your 16 available buttons

2346216
implements	extends
normally of course interfaces aren t empty so there s a specific maybe small cost in implements one and or the other different multiple methods will need to get implements
if say ifirst has a method foo and isecond has a method bar it makes perfect sense to extends both into an iboth even if that doesn t add further needed methods -- it allows a method to clearly express that it needs an argument that has both methods foo and bar

2346466
vmware	virtualbox
the .vmdk files are vmware images - you should be able to load them fine using the vmware tool virtualbox supports these too but the converse is not true
.vdi is a virtualbox supported format but not supported by vmware

2346512
solaris	aix
i would probably not bother on solaris
similar limits apply on linux and aix

2347550
put	get
now since i do not know what your exact results are i played with your grammer and made some slight modifications and reorganized moving what i thought were parser rules to the top with keep all lexer rules at the bottom and put in some actions that i think will show you what you need
also there could be several different ways to accomplish this and i don t think my solution is perfect for any of your possible wanted results but here is a grammer i was able to get working in antlrworks i think the end result is this grammer will show you how to accomplish what you are trying to do and will require modification no matter what that end result is

2348006
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
it should be called on the displayed view controller itself not the navigation controller like this on the other hand if you want to display a toolbar at the top under the navigation bar you should use a uiviewcontroller that has a uitoolbar and a uitableview as its subviews instead of a uitableviewcontroller
the toolbar included in uinavigationcontroller is as you observed displayed at the bottom above the tab bar

2348040
off-by-one	equivalent
if you notice off-by-one it s probably because your uvs your vertex positions or your projection matrix viewport pair are not aligned to where they ought to be
to simplify i ll just talk about 1d and be assuming you use a projection and a viewport that map x y coordinates to the equivalent pixel location a glortho 0 width 0 height zmin zmax and a glviewport 0 width 0 height

2348173
iasyncresult	idisposable
in fact waithandle implements the idisposable interface so the class implementing iasyncresult should itself implement idisposable
this is all to say that hundreds of iasyncresult instances lying around is not a memory issue - it s a resources issue

2349257
width	height
i m not familiar with freetype but from the picture it looks like the width of the characters is not directly related to the size of the buffers ie
glyph- buffer does not point to an array of glyph- width glyth- height bytes

2349257
width	height
glyph- buffer does not point to an array of glyph- width glyth- height bytes
as a guess i d say that all the chars have a single width in memory as opposed to the size they use on screen probably the biggest of all the widths of the glyphs but you load them with a per-char width instead of the correct one

2349945
post	get
the classic way to avoid such issues is to use locking but my favorite way is quite different make sure any such resource is accessed by only one dedicated thread and use a queue.queue instance intrinsically threadsafe to have other threads post work-request to the dedicated thread so instead of writing to reconfile directly each other thread would make a list of lines to be written contiguously then .put the list on the queue where the recon file writing worker thread is waiting via .get
when you need to get results back from such actions not the case here the requesting thread would place its own personal queue on which to return results as part of the work request packet it puts to the worker thread s queue

2350480
serializable	deserialization
it is not considered when the xmlserializer builds its serializable assembly
therefore xmlignore-d properties are not populated during deserialization and will be left with their default value

2350507
post	get
since your comments are just embedded documents they do not exist without the post object so there s no way to query them separately this is actually a future feature of mongodb
however you could easily add a convenience method to help you out this method would get you all of the comments that have been updated in the last three days but they would not entirely be in order

2351231
stateless	stateful
when the app server fetches a stateless session bean out of the object pool it knows that it can be used to satisfy any request because it s not associated with a particular user
a stateful session bean has to be doled out to the user that got it in the first place because their shopping cart info should be known only to them

2351237
stdout	stderr
when bash start executing sox -d -t wav - | lame - test.mp3 because of the pipe character bash will fork two processes to execute each command and then connects stdout from the first process with stdin to the second one
bash will not do anything specific with stderr of either process so the screen output you see from sox input file .

2351359
hash	md5
this will give you a distribution of hash codes that s indistinguishable from random
if performance isn t important simply take a secure hash such as md5 or sha1 and truncate its output to 32 bits

2351487
stateless	stateful
in other words although stateless beans may have instance variables these fields are not specific to one client so don t rely on them between remote calls
in contrast stateful session beans sfsb are dedicated to one client for their entire life there is no swapping or pooling of instances it may be evicted from memory after passivation to save resources but that s another story and maintain conversational state

2351641
post	get
the 303 signifies see other resource to prevent post data from posting again to the next url after that you can just exit
i see two immediate solutions to your problem get another host that doesn t do that sort of stuff instead of letting the script manage the download let apache do it just redirect to the actual file after updating your counters and such

2351783
mouse	keyboard
note that you can also suppress the event for some mouse events and have it generated for others when a keyboard context menu button is pressed on windows a right-click event with default position is sent first and if this event is not processed the context menu event is sent
so if you process mouse events and you find your context menu event handler is not being called you could call wxevent skip for mouse right-down events

2352357
client-side	server-side
i would recommending learning the distinction between server-side tags and client-side tags because while similar in syntax they can have very different results for example self-closing script tags in browsers typically don t work when using third-party libraries
either way is acceptable and it doesn t affect browser output because the asp scriptmanager tag is processed on the server-side

2352742
hebrew	cjk
your code had it worked as you imagined it might would have printed not only the the roman characters but also greek arabic hebrew cyrillic used in russian etc armenian half a dozen or so different but related character sets used in india many i ve left out about 11 thousand hangul syllables used in korean and a bunch of gibberish for code points that aren t used and depending on which shell you were running it in may have crashed when it got to 0xd800 the first surrogate
a little less ambition will give you hiragana katakana and a few cjk unified ideographs

2353374
ilist	icollection
first does not implement ilist either probably for the same reasons
implements some parts of icollection just aren t necessary but changing an interface after it s out in the wild is breaking at best

2353729
post	get
add a custom route that overrides get post which points to your desired controller
i m not positive about what the error might be but you should get firebug and check what the http response code coming back is

2354165
hide	show
why not just simplify things and just hide the label by default and include it on all the cells
when you tap the cell then instead of adding a view - just show the one that is there but hidden

2354248
udp	tcp
udp isn t considered for game servers as much mainly out of the scenario above and real time combat systems such as first person shooters where a message can be dropped and the new message to come will invalidate the dropped message anyways
world of warcraft can get away with using tcp since they don t have to be as precise with timing and likely have some good logic that makes it more difficult for you to tell the difference anyways

2354248
udp	tcp
here s a list of things tcp ip can now do that you d loose by going udp - in order arrival to you re program - retransmission now with fast retransmit selective acknowledgement and other features - maximum segment size - path mtu discovery - black hole detection extension of path mtu - congestion avoidance because of this i d highly recommend sticking with tcp ip if it suits you re needs
also not to nit pick but you re comment about the internet running on tcp ip is wrong there are in fact dozens of internet routeable protocols check them out here

2355986
post	get
when you have a checkbox and you tick it you get a key value pair returned in the post to the server
when the checkbox is not checked it actually doesn t come back in the post you can check this using firebug or by print_r _post this could be causing your problem

2357289
int	chars
the chars are already numbers binary - in c a chars is an int type
what might be confusing you is that the string literal 377 242 242 has 3 chars not 12

2357501
cpu	processors
thread pools are fine and you can use a task queue to do simple load-balancing but if there s no spare cpu cycles in the current application this would be a waste of time
if you don t have a multi-core processors multiple machines and or the thread processes are not i o bound multithreading will not help

2357592
accessor	properties
properties are not handled automatically. the closest that comes to being true is that synthesized accessor handle their memory management responsibilities properly
but that is just those accessor

2357675
accessor	properties
it might also help to see how the synthesize directive creates the accessor
when you declare a retained properties and ask the compiler to synthesize them you get something like this this isn t exactly the thing but it s close enough

2358534
pushviewcontroller	ttthumbsviewcontroller
while solving this issue i hit a few different problems a i m loading my controller object with loadnibnamed before adding it with nav pushviewcontroller
viewdidload is not sent to the added object unless it s a subclass of tableviewcontroller tableviewcontroller sends viewdidload after instantiating the tableview b my xib file had a view as a children of the ttthumbsviewcontroller subclass

2358574
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome
opera 7.10 will not understand document.cookie so it is not reliable. try using this one instead it is compatible with most browsers and the ones which will not work with it are not used anymore
i have tested it with internet explorer 8.0 firefox 3.6 google-chrome 4.0 opera 10.10 both within html and xhtml

2358610
inherited	properties
composition is almost always better than inherited
great article on this base controller should have common methods properties for example mine have some properties of getting the current user and a generic method for calling external services but not specific things from inheriting controllers

2359201
accessor	properties
you are probably thinking about this fxcop warning that you get when throwing notimplementedexception from special methods such as a properties getter event accessor equals gethashcode dispose etcetera ca1065 microsoft.design someclass.someproperty.get creates an exception of type notimplementedexception an exception type that should not be raised in a properties
if this exception instance might be raised use a different exception type convert this properties into a method or change this properties s logic so that it no longer raises an exception

2359548
sharepoint	spsite
you still need to carefully dispose of spsite and spweb instances in sharepoint 2010
the last i checked spdisposecheck had not been updated for sharepoint 2010

2359728
range	max
so your statement is equivalent to now an important property of unsigned integral types in c and c++ is that their values are always in the range 0 max where max for unsigned int is uint_max it s defined in limits.h
if you assign a value that s not in that range it is converted to that range

2360236
strlen	strcpy
incidently you want to add 1 to strlen name not subtract 1
or if you want name stored in your record without a terminating null then you need to use memcpy to copy the string into your record not strcpy

2360509
lxml	celementtree
object models such as lxml s objectify or amara might be more natural for python developers when speed is not a consideration
celementtree is faster when only parsing is required

2360927
subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication
it s not random its pseudorandom from this lagged fibonacci generators have a maximum period of 2 k - 1 2 m-1 if addition or subtraction is used and 2 k-1 if exclusive-or operations are used to combine the previous values
if on the other hand multiplication is used the maximum period is 2 k - 1 2 m-3 or 1 4 of period of the additive case

2361329
maven	pom.xml
basically all maven is telling you is that certain dependencies in your project are not available in the central maven repository
the default is to look in your local .m2 folder local repository and then any configured repositories in your pom.xml and then the central maven repository

2361547
oncreate	findviewbyid	setcontentview	findviewbyid
this is probably the case because this does not refer to the activity or you re not assigning the view to the activity in oncreate you have to call setcontentview in oncreate
well seems that findviewbyid returns null

2361922
free	realloc
a simple rule is that for every malloc or calloc there should be a free
realloc changes this a bit but you shouldn t need to worry about it right now

2362362
children	parent
namespace declarations are inherited by children so age is in the same namespace this can work well and be quite compact
however it doesn t work for attributes and can get messy if lots of sibling nodes need to change namespace from their common parent

2362600
udp	tcp
udp should not be used for bulk data transfer file transfers since you would have to build in all the functionality arleady in tcp to make it work right
udp should be used for real time data where speed of delivery is most important and some data loss is not an issue such as real time sensor data live multimedia streams real time stock quotes etc

2362658
children	parent
not everyone has children
some parent will not have parent in this database

2362672
maven	pom.xml
and indeed if you run mvn help effective-pom you ll see at least the following it has the absolute url where the maven repo is for the project but maven is still trying to download from the general maven repo maven will try to find dependencies in all repositories declared including in the central one which is there by default as we saw
but according to the trace you are showing you only have one repository defined the central repository or maven would print something like this reason unable to download the artifact from any repository url.project project pom.xml x.x from the specified remote repositories central another-repository so basically maven is unable to find the url.project project pom.xml x.x because it is not available in central

2362943
error-handling	exception-handling
i generally like using exception-handling in that kind of situation it allows me to have all error-handling code at one place
for instance i d use something a bit like this with that all error-handling code is in the catch block -- and not scatterred accros my whole application

2362943
error-handling	exception-handling
for instance i d use something a bit like this with that all error-handling code is in the catch block -- and not scatterred accros my whole application
note though that many php functions don t throw exception-handling and only raise a warning or an error.

2363277
cpu	processors
as a side effect of that you re also making sure the while loop isn t consuming any cpu doing nothing
if you re making a very simple game and do all your rendering and calculation in the main loop you need to control how fast the while loop is running or else the game will run at wildly different speeds on different processors

2363712
many-to-many	one-to-many	many-to-one	one-to-many
it does not usually make sense to enable cascade on a many-to-one or many-to-many association
cascade is often useful for one-to-one and one-to-many associations

2364018
viewmodel	caliburn
the module is responsible for instantiating any views necessary at the start and contributing back to the shell during initialize and that s typically it so when you attack this problem you ll want to focus on your views viewmodel and not the module classes
options off the top of my head adopt a complimentary framework like caliburn that has support for application events like this as well as some mdi events like viewclosing that kind of thing

2364352
cpu	processors
i recommend downloading the intel cpu documentation and skimming through the instruction reference
if you don t want to be overwhelmed start reading from an older x86 processors say 486 or older that documentation isn t exactly friendly but it is quite useful to have on hand

2365656
http-headers	content-type
if you want to use something like this then temp.php should actually send http-headers for some image content-type and send the actual content of the image . and not any html code this is because the browser expects that the url pointed to by the src attribute of the tag actually corresponds to a valid image -- and not some html text
for instance temp.php could contain something like this as a couple of sidenotes you must send the right content-type http header

2365928
allocator	stl
more tasteful would be to initialise a stack with a reserved vector at the cost of an extra allocator
and don t try to use this class polymorphically - stl containers aren t designed for that

2366350
mspec	nspec
using bdd style tests reads a lot better for me and mspec is a nice light framework to use
here some other popular frameworks nbehave nspec another nspec not related to the above nspec edit i ve started using storyq in the past month or so and have found it to be really good

2366670
udp	tcp
many audio video protocols are built on top of udp since missed re-ordered packets once in a while are not critical
in short your server is probably only listening on tcp port and not on udp

2366781
implements	extends
also since you can implements many interfaces but extends only one class you can only provide your own superclass if you implements runnable
if you extends thread you can not have any other superclass

2367035
maven	pom.xml
while it is possible to add an external maven install and thus to use the same version for the build inside eclipse and on the command line there might be differences for dependency resolution as mentioned in the note shown below alt text so if the versions differ one can imagine to have slight differences in the behavior but i d be extremely surprised to be honest
the problem here is that it s not possible to reproduce your problem as you didn t post your pom.xml or at least the relevant parts the culprit dependency and the repository it comes from

2367471
union	distinct
union means union distinct and this is relatively slow as it will check for duplicates even though there will not be any
you want union all i would imagine that after this change there is not much difference in performance between the three queries

2367759
nunit	mstest
you can t run mstest on computer without vs on it not 100 sure about 2010 but with 2008 it is so not sure sorry yes you can from visual studio my recommendation is following if nunit satisfies you - use it forget about mstest
list item speed is same but mstest may be a bit slower because it creates folder for test run every time msbuid and cc.net is big pain

2367869
uninstall	upgrade
the idea behind not removing user data during uninstall is a rather controversial topic with some rather interesting history.
i remember old versions of office used to save documents underneath the installation directory the number complaints we used to receive when after an upgrade users would delete the old office folder and lose their documents was enormous

2368310
mp3	speex	wma	speex
general-purpose compression schemes such as wma or mp3 are likely to cause more delay and they also may not be able to operate well at very low bitrates
speex is free open-source codec designed for encoding speech in realtime solutions that need low latency

2368333
opengl-es	glreadpixels
the standard approach of using -renderincontext to generate a uiimage from a calayer does not work for opengl-es content
see this answer to this question for how to use glreadpixels to extract the image from opengl-es within a caeagllayer into a uiimage that you can store in the photos library using uiimagewritetosavedphotosalbum

2369259
ienumerable	icollection
every icollection is guaranteed to be ienumerable so icollection derives from ienumerable
if it was legal or made sense to be a collection but not be enumerable then implementers of icollection wouldn t have to implement ienumerable also

2369413
htmlpurifier	tidy
for shared hosts not offering tidy you could use htmlpurifier as a standalone alternative
it s also somewhat more feature-rich than tidy html purifier is a standards-compliant html filter library written in php

2370392
int	boolean
such an int is essentially an abstract data type and can be backed up by say a 64-bit physical memory word on a 64-bit machine
the same goes for nonprimitive types the java language specification says nothing about how class fields should be aligned in physical memory or that an array of boolean couldn t be implemented as a compact bitvector inside the jvm

2370393
put	get
aside from the fact that a regex probably isn t what you want to do this with you want to put the bit you want in groups using parentheses
if you want everything up to the closing tag then you want something like this if you just want the bit use from you get if you want to get the foobar from above use to get note that it is not in general possible to match opening and closing tags note that is opened and closes in the example above

2370803
toolbar	docking
in the past this was not with the feature pack docking framework if you wanted to dock on startup to a specific side you had to set the side where you wanted the toolbar to be docked as the only one allowed on the right create the toolbar dock it there was a setdocked or something like that and then modify the allowed dock sides to the directions you wanted to allow
i m not sure if that behavior persists in the current version but i think it does as that was something build on low level docking toolbar functionality which the feature pack stuff just builds on

2371702
int	double
asking for the ceiling on a double that has a value greater than int32.maxvalue or even int64.maxvalue would not be possible if it returned an int
because a double has a much bigger maximum value than an int supports

2371733
maven	pom.xml
maven s dependency management a dependency in maven isn t just a jar file
it s a pom.xml file that in turn may declare dependencies on other artifacts

2371733
maven	pom.xml
so when maven downloads a jar dependency it doesn t only download a jar but also the pom.xml file
here maven tries to download them but they don t exist only the jar files exist

2372078
int	boolean
array is different in that it will perform some tricks on int keys and dictionary is different in that it doesn t convert keys to strings but uses any object value as key
please note that number and boolean are both converted to string

2372712
vsto	add-in
assuming that you are referring to an add-in created using vsto
when you create an add-in for office 2007 the referenced interop assemblies will be the ones associated with office 2007 and this is the main reason for your add-in not to work on office 2003

2372864
filtering	grouping
to get the behaviour you want you will need to write a custom authorisation filtering as suggested in a previous answer
as you are prefixing your domain user and domain grouping strings with the character you do not need to double escape the backslash

2373387
post	get
good solutions have already been posted but i thought i d post an explanation on how your query can be simplified step-by-step the outermost subquery is redundant the outermost part of the subquery the bit is redundant as you are already returning a list of ids
this leaves us with the use of commentnumber is redundant there isn t any need to use commentnumber to get the most recent comment as the posts are already ordered by timestamp

2375013
range	max	range	min
without knowing the range of values there isn t much you can do to come up with a meaningful function mapping an arbitrary range of positive integers to a heat-map type range of colors
i think you re going to have to run through your data at least once to get the min max or know them ahead of time

2375395
realloc	malloc	free	malloc
if you dynamically link with the crt you can redefine malloc realloc and free like this #define malloc s mymalloc s #define realloc p s myrealloc p s #define free p myfree p the implementations of mymalloc myrealloc and myfree can then simply use malloc realloc and free be sure not to use the #define in the source file that implements mymalloc ... or you could use the native windows functions
if you statically link with the crt you can overrule the implementation of malloc realloc free in fact all functions that appear in malloc.c realloc c free.c and or dbgheap.c in the crt

2375539
java.util.date	simpledateformat
jodatime s datetimeformat to rescue time and timezone difference in tostring is just because i m at gmt-4 and didn t set locale explicitly if you want to end up with java.util.date just use datetime#todate wait for jdk7 jsr-310 jsr-310 the referrence implementation is called threeten hopefully it will make it into java 8 if you want a better formatter in the standard java se api
the current simpledateformat indeed doesn t eat the colon in the timezone notation

2375595
actionscript	haxe
not only that but it improves upon actionscript 3.0 by adding things like generics inlining and directives
best thing on offer at the moment is haxe

2376021
variance	kurtosis
your goal apparently is to determine whether the data could plausibly have come from any normal distribution not one with a pre-specified mean and variance
probably the best way to do this is with d agostino test which is based on measuring the skewness and kurtosis of the distribution and comparing these to what s expected under normality

2376542
folder	directory
use path.combine to construct a path to a file inside the appdata folder of course this is just an example - in reality you should probably be using a sub-folder inside appdata specific to your application
looking at your comment you say this is your code application.userappdatapath is a directory not a file

2377486
awt	swing
which are not available in awt
also swing is meant to be portable while awt in theory will match more of the system s look and feel

2378331
int	chars
the type of 1 is int in c not chars so you are reading bytes in each fread
if sizeof int is greater than 1 on most modern computers it is then you are reading past the storage for buffer

2378913
datamodel	relational-model
sql is a long way from a truly relational datamodel or language even though it would not have come into being without codd s ideas to inspire it
relational-model s creator was naturally disappointed that sql rather than relational became the database standard

2378929
children	parent
many-to-many with a join table parent contains a collection of children the children may be linked from several parent
criteria querying that last query may or may not be more efficiently done by using just lazy-loading the whole children collection on first access and then indexing into it on subsequent pages

2380448
inherited	properties
you are using somewhere maybe in this pom or maybe in a parent pom if the version is inherited but this properties is not resolved
you need to define something like this note that i don t really see the point of using such a properties there is a built in properties that refers to the version of the project that you can use in dependencies for example

2381490
prepare	execute
when using prepare statements you should not do like you are doing
you should one and only one time prepare the statement using placeholders for the data for each line bind the values and execute the statement you should not prepare the statement for each line inject your data into the sql query instead of using placeholders

2381547
int	double
as an int must hold a specific numerical value an error must be thrown on division by zero when dealing with them
the result of division by zero is mathematically speaking undefined which can be expressed with a float double as nan - not a number it isn t however wrong in any fundamental sense

2381848
post	get
post requests are a bit more complex to do but they can carry much bigger payloads and can be configured on the server side
the best way to solve the root cause is to not make it a get but a post request

2381920
uninstall	upgrade
i was able to upgrade eclipse classic galileo from sr1 to sr2 using the following command java -jar plugins org.eclipse.equinox.launcher_1.0.201.r35x_v20090715.jar -application org.eclipse.equinox.p2.director -installiu org.eclipse.sdk.ide -uninstalliu org.eclipse.sdk.ide -artifactrepository -metadatarepository -profile sdkprofile -flavor tooling -destination c eclipse -p2.os win32 -p2.ws win32 -p2.arch x86 the director doesn t do updates currently but doing both uninstall and install is equivalent
see bug 279659 the install uninstall value org.eclipse.sdk.ide will depend on what exactly you have installed

2382612
filtering	grouping
it doesn t look like there s a way to filtering by category right now
however in the unit test sessions view the tests can be grouping by categories and then you could select only the categories you wanted to run

2382662
getter	setter
there are methods named getx but that does not mean it is a getter in the conventional sense
so i think he has a point and it is this every time you press choose generate getters setter in eclipse or your ide of choice you should take a step back and wonder what you are doing

2382665
int	chars
if the platform has 32 bit int and 8 bit chars but is little endian and or doesn t support unicode and if the serial number can vary in length then the below may be useful though it s a little workmanlike
if the serial number fits into 32 bits and the platform is big endian and supports unicode 32 bit int and the standard c libraries then this is pretty straightforward as other answers have shown

2382923
kerberos	ldap
all information is visible via kerberos authenticated messaging - if you join a unix server to the domain via samba then the samba tools have full visibility
if communicating via ldaps the directory may provide more information not verified however but under straight ldap none of the foreign directory samaccountnames are accessible

2383944
accessor	properties
accessor properties like readonly copy retain assign and nonatomic are automatically added and should not occur in the manual part of the documentation
all i can say is that the core plot framework annotates properties declarations in the implementation using a format like and it seems to produce clean documentation using doxygen

2384104
actualheight	actualwidth	actualheight	rowdefinition
wpf does not calculate the actualheight of elements until they are measured which it does as part of the display pass
from the rowdefinition.actualheight docs when you add or remove rows or columns the actualwidth for all columndefinition elements and the actualheight of all rowdefinition elements becomes zero until measure is called

2384356
min	median
expanding on duffymo s post you could do something like with salesstats as select sales ntile 100 over order by sales as ntilenum from tbl_sales select avg sales max sales min sales from salesstats where ntilenum between 5 and 95 this will exclude the lowest 5 and highest 95
if you have numbers that vary wildly you may find that the average isn t a quality summary statistic and should consider using median

2385126
comparator	comparable
in conjunction with a simple mru cache you could keep some number of keys in memory using another hashmap which is keyed on the same keys but which uses a custom comparator which compares just the offset and length values not the file data
you could use java s hash map and write a filekey class that takes a randomaccessfile offset and length precomputes the hash at construction and which implements comparable by reading the data from the file just for the compare

2385623
octal	decimal
octal values go to 0 to 7 your code seems to prove that certain javascript engine convert 8 and 9 to invalid characters and just ignore them
yu shouldn t prefix by 0 your numbers if you don t want to use the octal like using the normal decimal numbers

2387525
public	protected
herb sutter recommends making them either public and virtual most common case or protected and non-virtual depending on what you want to do with them
the compiler-generated destructor is public and non-virtual so you ll have to write your own even if it doesn t have any code in it

2387551
jruby	mri	mri	rubinius
so if you use ffi you won t have to write a single line of c and your library will automatically work on mri yarv jruby and rubinius and in the future also on ironruby macruby and maglev
in the past the go-to method for binding ruby to c or c to ruby it doesn t really matter was writing an mri c extension by hand

2387704
post	get
i would gladly post an answer to cover all your needs if i was on the clock
not answering the question directly but here are some sources to get you there railscasts nested model form part 1 railscasts nested model form part 2 railscasts complex forms part 3 on a personal note

2387733
int	double
catch int this is valid according to the interface for a
in particular we do not expect a double to be thrown

2387818
post	get
i ve used the instructions in that blog post and found them while on the right track to severely complicate the issue by unnecessarily extending sqliteopenhelper
i ve had much better luck doing the following create a utility class that creates the static db by copying it into the correct directory from assets but doesn t get itself so hung up on following the sqliteopenhelper format

2388170
x86	64bit
the x64 jit compiler does a completely different job doing that compared to the x86 compiler the latter always seems to use the variable in a few spot checks i did
so you re not likely to be ahead unless you run on a 64bit version of windows

2388569
int	boolean
the equivalent code to this c code in c# would be notice that c# does not allow boolean logic operators to be used on int
if you want to convert int to boolean you ll have to write code to do that as i have here

2389024
ant	maven
first refactor the existing ant build to align it on maven conventions make things modular if your existing build is a big monolithic build producing several artifacts from a single source tree break it down into separate modules one for each artifact
update directory structure maven comes with a standard directory layout and while it is possible to customize this layout to configure plugins for another layout this is not really recommended and is more a source of troubles than benefits

2389238
gtk	cairo
if you report is mostly text i d render to the cairo context with pango yet part of the gtk stack
cairo is the way surely it is not inefficient.

2389390
illegalargumentexception	unchecked-exception
the normal way is to throw an illegalargumentexception or nullpointerexception or any other that suits your needs . in api calls leave the checked excpetions for validations you promise to the caller of the api expected exceptional conditions requested file doesn t exist write failed etc besides the above recoverability is also important for deciding for a checked or unchecked-exception
take the unchecked-exception

2389915
multibyte	substr
maybe you mean safe for multibyte character encoding like utf-8
because substr and strlen are not safe for multibyte encodings

2389920
multiplying	add
if it isn t null you get the length of the string + 1 for terminating char and you multiplying that by sizeof char for this example 3 you do that for each node and store that size then move to next node 4 you take the sum of all of these char in this case for each node and accumulate for the entire list
5 once you have that simply add this sum that will give you the size of all nodes

2390546
put	get
your getter can alloc init an object and put it in the variable if it is uninitialized before returning it
if the static variable holds an instance an nsstring instance in your example you need to make sure it doesn t get alloc initialized more than once

2390601
nunit	mstest
nunit contains a testcase attribute that allows implementing parametrized tests
this does not exist out of the box in mstest - it can be done via extensibility though

nunit	mstest
nunit ships with an assert.throws api to allow testing an exception on a specific line of code instead of the whole method
a similar feature exists for mstest implemented by the same person who did it for nunit but does not ship with mstest

well when i go there in firefox i get an error saying no posts match my query which make me wonder if your server isn t set up right

uiview	subviews
in this i have the method i also added the views i wanted to auto-rotate as subviews to this root uiviewcontoller s uiview
these subviews also have view controllers but do not override shouldautorotatetointerfaceorientation

2391288
listboxitem	textbox
what you have won t work because silverlight wraps each item -- each instance of the datatemplate -- in a listboxitem and the grid.column and grid.row attached properties need to be applied to that listboxitem not to the textbox that becomes the content of that listboxitem
the good news is that you can set attributes on the implicit listboxitem using listbox.itemcontainerstyle

2391590
folder	directory
if your files are not yet under scm control one thing you can do is just delete them all from the xcode project rearrange them on disk however you want then drag all the folder and files back in making sure to not make copies to create groups and to set the reference style to relative to enclosing group
if you want your groups structure in xcode to mirror your directory structure in the file system which is also the folder structure in the finder you have to take the following steps when adding files that you want to go into groups subdirectories create the folder in the finder or the directory from the command line drag that folder into your xcode project

2391864
post	put	put	get
create post read get update put delete delete most web browsers do not support the put and delete actions so you can only use post actions for sending data
rails fakes put and delete by passing in a hidden parameter named _method that the framework picks up and routes it depending on that value

2392049
chunked	transfer-encoding
update googling for the error message i also find this the chunky-parser error message occurs when curl expects a chunked http response body and then doesn t get one
your reply sends the transfer-encoding chunked header so curl expects to see a body chunked according to rfc2616 and it doesn t get one

2392049
chunked	transfer-encoding
your reply sends the transfer-encoding chunked header so curl expects to see a body chunked according to rfc2616 and it doesn t get one
obviously a redirect shouldn t have a response body or even the transfer-encoding header to begin with

2392191
min	max
you either get the min max buttons or the help button
these are standard windows ui guidelines the help button should only appear on dialogs and dialogs shouldn t have min max buttons

2392343
factors	matrix
you can see in help to apply why apply and as.factor doesn t work in all cases the result is coerced by as.vector to one of the basic vector types before the dimensions are set so that for example factors results will be coerced to a character array
why sapply and as.factor doesn t work you can see in help to sapply value ... an atomic vector or matrix or list of the same length as x ... if simplification occurs the output type is determined from the highest type of the return values in the hierarchy null raw logical integer real complex character list expression after coercion of pairlists to lists

2392570
margin	text-align
text-align center will center the contents of the container while margin auto will center the container itself
you should be careful with margin auto because it is not supported in ie6

2392756
profiling	debugging
you can use the profiling from flashbuilder not free to see where things can be improved
you can optimise at the bytecode level without touching your source using tdsi for example still in development and more optimisation will come if you want to see what s going under the hood and understand more the compiled code look at the tamarin source code adobe vm use in the flash player and learn the abc bytecode or write multiple function and measure their performance do small refactor step by step to see what are the gain you can use gskinner library for the measurement don t use the debugging player since some function are slower int it

2393129
wxpython	pyqt
to my tastes it seems that wxpython s tutorial the new one in wiki form is what i m pointing to and recommending is really good and pyqt s not bad at all
pyside s docs don t include a good tutorial that i know of i believe pyside s intention is that you first learn pyqt with the reasonable available materials then apply these few differences to be programming in pyside instead of pyqt

2393155
sorting	grouping
with a reasonable amount of classes manual sorting is not so tedious
i also propose it since i think it makes much more sense to grouping superclasses together and make sure superclasses are defined before subclasses -- otherwise your module won t even be importable

2393989
nunit	mstest
nunit contains a testcase attribute that allows implementing parametrized tests
this does not exist in mstest this can be implemented using unit test extensibility in 2010

2393989
nunit	mstest
correct thats still there nunit has an assert.throws api to allow testing an exception on a specific line of code instead of the whole method you can easily implement this one yourself though jim implented a version of assert.throws for mstest at the same time as he did the original implementation for nunit nunit has included in subsequent releases mstest has not its still possible to use though
nunit contains a fluent version of assert api as already mentioned - assert.that.. there are several of these implemented by 3rd parties for mstest nunit is much faster see jamie s comment he has managed to get mstest running faster - nunit can run tests in 32 and 64 bit mstest only runs them in 32 bit iirc not in 2010 64 bit support is built in

2394015
disk	ram
a couple of advantages of using memcached no hit to the disk everything is in ram of course this means sessions will be lost if your server crashes
but if a crash happens you ll probably have other troubles than jsut losing sessions and this is not likely to happen often used in production by many websites and works well i m using it for a couple of websites better scalability if you need more ram or more cpu-power for your memcached cluster just add a couple of servers and i would add once you ve started using memcached you can also use it as a caching mecanism

2394026
int	chars
in some situations in the c library such as the getc function an int value is returned for the chars read from input
this is not a chars because an extra non-character value eof usually -1 can be returned to indicate the end of the chars stream

2394465
instances	transient
slide 30 is answer unfortunately not the first edition oversold the power of readresolve elvis has a nontransient field favoritesongs cleverly crafted attack can save reference to deserialized elvis instances when this field is deserialized see elvisstealer for details item 77 readresolve works only if all fields are transient item 77 is item 77 for instances control prefer enum types to readresolve .
if the elvis class is made to implement serializable the following readresolve method suffices to guarantee the singleton property this method ignores the deserialized object returning the distinguished elvis instances that was created when the class was initialized

2394465
instances	transient
therefore the serialized form of an elvis instances need not contain any real data
all instances fields should be declared transient

2394949
integer	unsigned
it is only if you abuse pointer and try to treat it as an integer of some sort that you will run into problems
you don t show the code for clause_computesplitfieldaddress but clearly you cannot pass the address of an unsigned int when the function takes a nat

2395244
disk	ram
but the difference is all user time not time spent blocked on disk i o
now 8000mb is much more than i have ram so i can avoid caching ignore the first of those three it benefited from the first 1000mb of the file already being in ram

2395269
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
the underlying problem is that you are using a new objectoutputstream to write to an existing objectinputstream that you have already used a prior objectoutputstream to write to
- 0xac and the existing objectinputstream isn t expecting another header at this point so it barfs

2395371
zlib	libpng
so when the linker handles -lz first there are not yet any calls to it so it doesn t pull in any of zlib
next when the linker handles libpng it sees that there are calls to it from your code

2395405
srand	math.h
srand is in stdlib.h not math.h
to seed with time you include time.h to use time null not math.h

2395432
lisp	scheme
for example a double linked list data structure is circular in the scheme lisp point of view if you try to print the cons-structure out you get backreferences cycles
so it s not really about having data structures that look like rings any data structure where you have some kind of backpointers is circular from the scheme lisp perspective

2395432
lisp	scheme
so it s not really about having data structures that look like rings any data structure where you have some kind of backpointers is circular from the scheme lisp perspective
a normal lisp list is single linked which means that a destructive mutation to remove an item from inside the list is an o n operation

2395918
udp	tcp
generally socks requires configuration on each client and isn t transparent to applications system-wide socket socksification isn t installed enabled by default on windows while nat even without upnp mostly works transparently and without any additional client configuration for outgoing tcp sockets and outgoing udp
nat with upnp also supports server tcp sockets better than socks socks can only accept a single connection with its bind request which is okay for receiving a single tcp connection in a protocol like ftp but useless for running a server that needs to accept many connections from many clients

2395959
postgresql	mysql
i don t know enough about the internal row-versioning mechanisms of mysql or indeed if there is one but other databases oracle postgresql and more recently sql server have invested a lot of effort into allowing writers to not block readers in so far as readers have access to the version of the rows that existed immediately before the update write process started
once the update is committed that version of the row becomes the one made availabe to all readers thereby avoiding a bottleneck that the above behaviour in mysql will introduce

2396128
folder	directory
i think you ll need to use the modules folder
a module is like a mini kohana application for example a simple module might have modules first_module ... config classes controller classes model views however if that isn t what you want just follow the same directory structure above under the application folder

2396759
folder	directory
in order to get to that file your path would simply need to contain the folder output not the whole package structure since your import statement provides all that information to the vm
now let s suppose that you bundle coolframework up into a .jar file and put that coolframework.jar into a lib directory in your project

2396767
x86	64bit
i believe that under windows x86 your code will run with the x87 precision already set to 53 bits double precision though i m not sure exactly when this gets set
on solaris x86 the x87 fpu is likely to be using its default precision of 64bit extended precision hence the difference

2397303
post	put
incidentally personally i avoid the cuda vs wizard partly because it is not provided supported by nvidia and use the strategy described in this other post
thrust code should be put in .cu files

2397748
int	chars
then iterate over the array containing the actual data and keep an int of which word you re currently at and a boolean if you already matched whitespace
while iterating you check if the chars is a vowel or not

2397855
cpu	processors
i have not tested the code enough but i think it s ok updated even more efficient updated 2 you can see the assembly code generated by delphi compiler in the disassembly or cpu window
eg the procedure generates code this code is linear contains no jumps and modern processors with long instruction pipeline are very efficient in executing linear code

2398273
implements	extends
there are however automatically implements properties in c# 3.0 and higher which you declause in the following way
please be also aware that the c# compiler will create a backing field automatically so basically both ways are the same but you gain more flexibility with the first because with automatically implements properties you cannot add more complex behaviour than just simple setting and retrieving of values at least in the class where you declare it making it virtual opens possibilites to extends property logic in subclasses..

2398619
comparator	comparable
that s not a comparator class
that s a name class that implements comparable

2398833
int	double
your code is equivalent to the reason is that f and d are passed to printf as values and then these values are interpreted as int s
this doesn t change the binary value so the number displayed is the binary representation of a float or a double

2398989
button	checkbox
i would favor field controls like text boxes checkbox and dropdown menus rather than command button so that the commanded value is clearly shown
continuous numeric attributes may include spinner button with the text box if it doesn t end up clogging the queue with incremental commands

2399226
children	parent
more specifically it prevents it from drawing in the areas occupied by its children
so if you re re-drawing the parent on a regular basis and ws_clipchildren isn t set you ll end up stomping on the child window s display.

2399339
width	height
after some very quick checking it looks like #fancybox-wrap is set to 20px wider than #fancybox-inner you can also control the width when you first register fancybox using the width option
from the fancybox api docs auto-resizes fancybox height to match height of content. so it looks like it is not intended to adjust the width

2399339
width	height
from the fancybox api docs auto-resizes fancybox height to match height of content. so it looks like it is not intended to adjust the width
if you wish to adjust the width you can do it by manually resizing the #fancybox-wrap and #fancybox-inner elements

2399385
super	self
if you want to know the nitty-gritty of what super does the best explanation i ve found for how super works is here though i m not necessarily endorsing that article s opinions
one way is to call a s constructor and pass self as an argument like so class b a def __init__ self a.__init__ self print hello the advantage of this style is that it s very clear

2399567
inherited	properties
visualtree inherited is not universal
the dependency properties specifies that it will inherit down the visual tree when it is declared

2399984
int	chars
the values are the result of chars int enumvalue
your class and mapping should be something like the following nhibernate has 3 built in mappers for enum persistentenumtype maps to an int column and is not declared in the mapping

2400341
put	get
as per the other answers you can then us the css hover pseudo-class to style the element for the href # i would put this in the html you submitted if not you can use the following jquery to add the attribute as for returning false from the click event it appares that at least when you have only one click event defined jquery will return what your click function returns so or use the preventdefault method on event see
in some browsers a hover does not work if you do not have an href to get the onclick and the hover functionality you can the return false on the onclick will prevent the browsers default action taking place and the href # means that even if it does this is just a link to this page

2400570
multiplying	add
the add reg reg instruction is 2 bytes per instruction so thats 6 bytes of instructions and 0 bytes for constants to multiplying by 3 that s smaller code than imul plus a 4 byte constant
plus the way the add instructions are used it works out to a pretty literal translation of 2 3 so this may not be a size optimization it may be the default compiler output whenever you multiplying by 2 or by 3

add is usually a faster instruction than multiplying

2401084
tcpclient	networkstream
you need to keep the reference of that tcpclient object as long as you wish to use it
if the object is not referenced it will be garbage collected eventually that will make your networkstream unusable

2402722
keydown	keyup
i cannot reproduce the problem- i do not find any keyup events thrown from keydown no matter how long i hold down a key
this method listens for a keydown runs some code and waits for a keyup before listening for another keydown

eiffel	spec#
they re not baked in like eiffel s design by contract but you can roll your own
for c# 3.5 and earlier there s spec#

2403370
websphere	ibm
last but not least you can set an iis in front of your domino server and use the websphere plugin so that a trust is define between domino and iis which will forward the windows account to domino
typically a domino server supports 4 modes of authentication - basic - session domino session id - ltpa ibm sso - spnego new from 8.5.1 ltpa is typically the way to achieve sso

2403752
put	get
the length function gives the number of characters not the number of bytes so when you put your string into the memory stream you only copy half the bytes from the string
even if you d copied all of them though you d still have a bunch of extra data in the stream since each character has two bytes and the server probably only expects to get one

2404040
int	chars	tinyint	nvarchar
i would go with int or even smallint up to 32 767 and 2 bytes of storage if tinyint up to 255 is not enough so i would use the first table in this case don t know what your queries will look like but might be an idea of switching the columns around and starting with typeid
remember that nvarchar requires 2 bytes per chars so if an int is 4 chars then to use the same space you could only use 2 chars in the nvarchar column

2404851
fgets	strcmp	strlen	strcmp
+-+-+-+--+--+ |b|o|b| n| 0| +-+-+-+--+--+ to get rid of the newline do this. caveats do not use strlen aname - 1 because a line returned by fgets may start with the nul character - thus the index into the buffer becomes -1 now strcmp should return 0.
strcmp is one of the few functions that has the reverse results of true and false...if the strings are equal the result is 0 not 1 as you would think..

2405055
equals	gethashcode
if they are equals the hashcodes should match however if they are not equals they could still have the same hash however small that possibility might be
from the article if two string objects are equals the gethashcode method returns identical values

2405422
post	get
and all other portions of code i will post will be contained in a file called temp.php -- which would have to include temp-2.php so the class definition is known
first try we try to unserialize the string without having defined the class a as output we get this which means that the autoloading function callback_spl has been called even if registered by spl_autoload_register but it has not autoloaded anything and as the class as not been autoloaded we get an object that s an instance of __php_incomplete_class now let s try using spl_autoload_register to register an autoloading function that actually autoloads the class definition and we get this ouput which means the autoloading function registered by spl_autoload_register has been called and this time it did require the file containing the definition of the class the un-serialization has been successful we don t get an instance of __php_incomplete_class anymore we actually get an instance of a so here i would say that unserialize_callback_func is not needed when spl_autoload_register is used

2405422
post	get
but i ll post a couple of other tests just for fun now what if we try using unserialize_callback_func and not using spl_autoload_register
use this portion of code we get exactly the same output as before which seems to indicate that the autoloader defined with spl_autoload_register as a higher priority than the one defined with unserialize_callback_func

2405608
int	chars
but they are of type they are strings so if you want to parse them as int you should do it using the function atoi will parse int that was as third parameter and place it into variable then you can check whatever you want
of course it doesn t work argv is a pointer to pointer to chars

2405781
free	malloc
this is how it is with malloc free this is how it is with
in fact in a typical implementation raw memory allocations for calls are eventually processed by some implementation-specific malloc free -like pair which means that doesn t really have to care about how much memory to deallocate it simply calls that internal free or whatever it is named which takes care of that

2406109
put	get
it isn t very flexible it isn t very fast for repeated or combined actions like the one above and it uses an atrocious syntax that may come in handy for certain types of applications but i personally prefer something like php thumb in fact i recently put together a simple wrapper library for php thumb download to use with codeigniter and it works fabulously
using the php thumb library instead of codeigniter s own you could get the job done like so more details on php thumb s github page

2406255
html5lib	beautifulsoup
the main alternative i think would be html5lib -- i haven t tries it on app engine but i believe it does run there quite slowly -- if that s a problem i think you need to stick with beautifulsoup this service runs on app engine and is based on html5lib
beautifulsoup runs fine on app engine just make sure to use 3.0.8 not the iffy 3.1.0

2406743
versioning	upgrade
we had lots of tug-of-wars with customers that didn t want to upgrade for whatever reason or wanted to do their own qa on the new versioning
we entertained the old instance new instance thing for upgrade but migrating data was risky and associated downtime did not make customers happy

2407018
serializable	deserialization
there are free serializable libraries for delphi also for free pascal json superobject and lkjson xml omnixml and nativexml json and xml are cross-platform cross-language which might be helpful for future interfaces to other systems like php-based web shop for example
they are also free and open standards no vendor lock-in update i would not use the constructor-based approach while maybe looking trivial in the beginning deserialization can become a complex process which would add more and more non-class-specific code to the classes which need serializable

qmainwindow	qwidget	qmenubar	qwidget	qmenubar	qmainwindow
if you want to remove the menu bar from the qmainwindow you can use the qt_no_menubar preprocessor to remove all uses of a qmenubar
if you are not using facilities provided by qmainwindow maybe you can use a simple qwidget as main window in your application

2407357
qmainwindow	qwidget
if you are not using facilities provided by qmainwindow maybe you can use a simple qwidget as main window in your application
edit if you want to hide qactions at runtime you will find them as member of the qmainwindow s ui

2407991
int	chars
i assume you have code like this when you enter something that cannot be read as an int the stream std cin enters a failed state and all following attempts at input fail as long as you don t deal with the input error
you can test the success of an input operation and you can restore the stream to a good state and discard unprocessed chars the input that caused the input failure another possibility is to accept input into a string variable which rarely fails and try to convert the string to int

2408241
getter	setter
but your getter could always return a copy of the instance variable. in addition using a getter setter also shields other parts of the same class from knowing about its own implementation which i ve found very useful on occasion
as a counterpoint to christophed s answer if your instance variable is strictly for private use i wouldn t bother with writing a getter setter and just declare the instance variable private

2408241
getter	setter
as a counterpoint to christophed s answer if your instance variable is strictly for private use i wouldn t bother with writing a getter setter and just declare the instance variable private
if other objects need to access the object you can always add a getter

2408806
switching	screens
this link in particular talks about the android design guidelines which don t mention switching views at all
it s centered around an activity-as-view design. android - should i use multiple activities or multiple content views android app with multiple activities how to pass the values from one activity to previous activity i m not sure what you mean by the back button not always going back to the right screens correctly

2408809
configure	libtool
try this make maintainer-clean . autogen.sh . configure make in any case the problem is not that you don t have libtool 2.2 because the autogen.sh script claims only to work with 1.5 and configure.ac uses 1.5-style libtool calls
in my experience these types of errors mean that your libtool script was generated using a different version of libtool than currently installed

2408928
put	get
note that there is some special treatment when a new value is put for a known key
also in this version nothing special is done when finding a cached value but we could rejuvenate accessed cached value upon get when a value is found but not in the first map it could be moved into the first map

2408973
folder	directory
this way you can create your folder in shared directory and symlink it upon deployment like
the accepted answer is ok but it s generally better not to copy everything upon the deployment but just symlink the cache folder

2409146
allocator	stl
as for memory allocator you use existing memory allocator such as hoard or ned allocator which is quite high performance and good for embedded system
why not use stl but provide your own allocator and deallocator for example stl vector is defined as you can create and set your own allocator that request memory space from your memory pool

2410105
instances	transient
so the solution was to prevent ninject from performing property injection on instances that had been previously activated and were singletons
my solution was to create a new property injection strategy that kept track of previously activated instances that were not transient in scope and skip the default property injection strategy for activation requests for such instances

2410769
subclass	inherited
the problem is that the definition of class b can t know that d is a subclass of c until it sees a full definition of class d but the definition of class d can t know that b is a subclass of a until it sees a full definition of class b and so you have a circular dependency
this can t be resolved with forward-declarations because a forward declaration unfortunately cannot specify an inherited relationship

2411594
inherited	subclassing
you could extend uiview with your gesture handling and then every objects that inherited from uiview will have the methods you want
not quite as awesome and subclassing but would work on the global scope

2411869
udp	tcp
and udp doesn t guarantee packets delivery
so probably tcp protocol will be a better choice

2412015
suppressfinalize	finalizer
by putting the suppressfinalize .. call in the dispose method it s causing that object to only trigger the debug.fail when dispose is not called
that code is working by making the finalizer for leakdetector cause a debug.fail so you see problems in the debugger when that object is finalized
