parallelizing B is simpler than B in-place

B consistently has less recursive calls than B

this means that while the two underlying sorts it uses B and insertion sort are both worse than B for many kinds of data timsort only uses them when it is advantageous to do so

that way B can reach recursive base case more quicker than B

however in this case B key size is less than B key size

note that the effective key size of B is larger than triple B

note that the effective key size of B is larger than triple B

since the next is not far the number of B steps is much fewer than with B matching

since the next is not far the number of B steps is much fewer than with B matching

execution of B is more faster than B for same key sizes

execution of B is more faster than B for same key sizes

1 B merge sort is used when you want to sort a list in o nlogn time while using less space than standard B

each iteration in B is a lot simpler than B

in fact the B algorithm works this way first arrange a random order into heap order and then obtain a sorted order somewhat less efficient than B on average

why B or introsort or any comparison-based sorting algorithm is more common than B

why B or introsort or any comparison-based sorting algorithm is more common than B

in cs B is less commonly used because we have much better algorithms B and merge-sort come to mind

short answer B is more efficient in this case than naive application of B s
