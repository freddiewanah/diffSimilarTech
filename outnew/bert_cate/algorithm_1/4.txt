technically B has a better time-behavior î nlogn worst and average cases than B î n 2 worst case î nlogn average case

B is slightly slower than B but it does not have B s susceptibility to pathological cases

B is approximately 40 faster than B on random data because of fewer data movements

when comparison function is a callback function like in B libc implementation B is slower than B by 15 on random input and 30 for already sorted array for 64 bit integers

depending on where i look people say B is faster than B due to its locality of reference cache hits etc

normally B is faster than B which is faster than heapsort

a B signature generation could be somewhat faster than a B signature generation maybe up to twice faster

B signatures are signficantly shorter than B ones

however B verification expect verification calls to be 100x issue is about 10x slower than B verification

but B is assumed to be on average somewhat slower than standard B quicksort

but B is assumed to be on average somewhat slower than standard B quicksort

the non-B B behaviour is more a reflection on the quality of the rand B â it is often not very good

normally quicksort is faster than B which is faster than B

typically B is slower than B and quicksort but that s usually under the assumption that comparisons are fast

turns out this was a hardware failure the B commands need more power than the B crypto1 ones 50 more which the antenna failed to deliver at the reading range i was testing with

the capturing group 1 in the first pattern is B it first matches everything and takes as less as it B

worst case for B is actually worse than B and mergesort but B is faster on average

in theory insertion sort and B are worse than B

for 5 000 000 ints still stored in memory B becomes suddenly worse then B and mergesort

what makes B faster than B in practice is its constant that was ignored by big o analysis

if it is true then B will always take less comparison than B because on real life data there is some pattern except data is truly random

you can take a look at B which for non completely random data performs better than B they have the same asymptotic complexity but B has lower constants

java s array .sort is from about java 6 actually B the fastest general purpose #sort out there much better than B in many situations

no practically B is faster than B s for all pair shortest path generally
