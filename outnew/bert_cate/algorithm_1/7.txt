B is more expensive than B for example

B is more expensive than B for example

B usually is better than B for two reasons

B is not better it is well suited for a different kind of application than B

i ve looked at the question at why is B better than B

B is not better than B

previously discussed on so why is B better than B

why is B better than B

B is worse complexity than B in the worst case.

scenarios when B is worse than B

is B always better than B

why is B better than B

B is worse complexity than B in the worst case.

scenarios when B is worse than B

is B always better than B

but B is older and weaker than B

but B is older and weaker than B

surely there is some situation in which the B approach is better than the B approach

but under what circumstances is the B algorithm better than the B algorithm

i guess B is older and B is newer

edit 3B is better than B in the sense that it s significantly more secure but still less secure than B but its performance is of necessity significantly worse than B B or twofish because you re essentially applying B three times

also see why B is more secure than B

how is B less secure than B in this scenario

how is B less secure than B in this scenario

in theory B is worse than B

in short - if all we care about are comparisons B is a better choice than B

can anyone explain why B performs better and under what circumstances quichesort would be better than both B and B
