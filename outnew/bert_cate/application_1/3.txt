research showed me that B is simpler to use over B so i decided to use B but have no idea how to install it.can anyone please tell me what are the steps you need to take in order to install B bug tracking system in a small company to track website mobile portal bugs

i have been trying out B to see if i like it better than B

we found B to be a better than B simply because it is easier to use

i wound up going with B and it s way better than B

we ve recently switched from B to B where i work and i think i like it a little more than B and use the wiki functionality almost everyday
