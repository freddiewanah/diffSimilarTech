in addition the need for polyfills for B complicates matters further as they may handle the interaction differently as can be seen in the sample below when using the button to load B

since B is a bit more complete than B when it comes to features you could define separate issues with custom field for your tasks

so basically when B is more about how objects will behave themselves during application running the B is more about how you write your code before application running
