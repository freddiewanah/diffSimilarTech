in B typeof is slower than the other two but in B it is the fastest

B encodes more characters than B

here is a simple performance test showing that in B filling is faster than clearing i am not sure what goes on with B and canvas nowadays but in B clearing is many times faster than filling both significantly faster than B

B is even slower that B

B handles these better than compared to B

phantomjs achieves a better accuracy than B slightly lower than B but in around half the time of B

apparently B is pickier than B

the performance in B is best less so in B and ie

B gsap performance is still much worse than in B but B gsap does still lag every few repeats or so while in B the css animations do not

of late B has had much better performance than B

ie B higher than baseline B on baseline

B takes almost 3 times longer than B

in B it seems .prototype is faster B shows no difference between the two although generally performs slower than B

in B it takes some more time compared to B safari

but B keeps being less responsive than B or ie

in ie8 and B it runs even faster than B in general and this slow down never happens

B is just faster than B which just faster than ie at bit-wise operations

B produces more space compared to B

B - good a bit slower than B

the funny thing is that for abc_def property B is actually much faster than B and ie as i expected

rendering without buffering on B is faster than B so i m actually not sure why B is having such a problem with drawimage

also ie and B seems to work better than B

as B s v8 is dramatically faster than B s spidermonkey at the moment these things are constantly in flux pick the forward loop as it s faster on the slower engine

the most interesting thing i noted is that certain test combos in B are much quicker than even B

the trouble is choosing a good value for x since for this particular page B is so very much faster than B which is faster than ie

B comes in at just under 41ms performing better than B but still not great

B is more secure than ie or B

B is worse than B

B comes in at just under 41ms performing better than B but still not great

B is more secure than ie or B

B is worse than B

on B everything is slower than on B still the object property access is more than two times faster

so to specify B greater than 20 B greater than 9.1 and ie greater than 9
