note i recommend using B - it is much faster than B as it doesn t have memory leaks and comes with a built-in ad blocker

though from a design perspective it may be easier to simply add the extra 5px to the width designing for the worst case browser to prevent wrapping in B which is worse than extra space in B ie

the idea is that if they are using ie then they must install B frame and if they are using less than B 4 or opera 11.5 then they must upgrade their browser not not sure if the way i am doing that is correct

it looks like it shows for B more-so than B but it might help

based on what you have provided i cannot tell if B actually does load faster than B

but i guess B i have version 10 should be much faster than B 3.6

no and there won t be any time soon because B s add-on api is more restrictive than B

using the same data B does in less than 5 seconds what took ie and B 10 to 15 seconds to accomplish

i inspected the range object in both B and B and then noticed that B s range object is far richer than B s

i m on a mac os x 10.8.2 running B 18.0.2 - it actually runs the game faster and smoother than my B 25.0.1364.99

the issue that i encountered was that B was giving me height about 300px more than the B ie

in B it seems more or less ok but in B when i first tried it it should give me not logged in my console

2 install the B extension there s also one for B but the B one is more reliable -- so if you re a B addict like i am then use both

B is reporting the missing key with a higher severity than B is so i want to eliminate that as a possible cause

in B this might be handled a little nicer than B but rather than completely redraw an element you should try to append only what you need

now when clicking a time less than 1 millisecond will be displayed however it obviously takes nearly a second on my computer until the changed color actually is displayed where btw. B seems to be faster than B

you can see if you look at the bottom and right hand edges of both B lines up perfectly but B seems further in both directions and i cannot work out why either in firebug or B dev tools

i need to do the same condition but for less than B version 46 and for less than B version 44

by highlighting the shape of the two elements you can see that in B left the button is 2px taller than in B right

i suspect that this may be the case because ie and B need to know about the content of the div earlier than B

what we can see is that regardless of raw hardware power B seems to run up to three times faster than edge and also significantly faster than B all updated to the latest verion

for my website i noticed that tooltip delay in B was much higher than in B

this is sporadic and i see it happening most of the time with B 4.0.1 and 5.0 and to a lesser extent with B

most noticeably if you look or B B and then internet explorer 9 you ll notice that the terms and conditions are slightly higher than in B or B and thus slightly touching the main content area

support exists in B and my test just confirmed thisâ but the handle is a little less noticeable than in B

this seems to me like a bandwidth error or something like that originally i ve got the error when i played with the html 5 audio api and if i loaded the audio file 10-15 times sequentially then i ve got the error but now i ve discovered that i get the error without the audio api too just by reloading the site a lots of times also B gives me the error much faster than B wtf

in B we found that the dom level 0 took twice the time off the dom level 2 but was still four times faster than either B case

i just tested geolocation on B 3.6 and iphone B os 3.1.3 the result is interesting B is more accurate than B
