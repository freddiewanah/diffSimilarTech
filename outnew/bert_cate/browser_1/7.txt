as you can see in the image B is running a lot longer than B

as you can see in the image B is running a lot longer than B

on B it s significantly faster to do this using 1 0 but on B it s slightly faster to do this using bool

however if thats the case does this mean B is faster in execution than B

why is B so much slower than B on my laptop

is it because B has much better javascript support than B

so why is B less efficient than B and ie

i would like this function to work in B ie B etc but at the moment it only works in B and older than B version 49

B is slower than B in javascript

do you have any idea why B loads javascript function much slower than B

and of course the results - if they are reproducible - might suggest that B is faster than B or that B just prioritises timeouts over dom events

also why does B perform way better than B on this benchmark

for example if you have a text size of 15px well B makes a larger 15px than B does

in my experience B has better javascript performance than B

and also does anyone know why is B so much slower than B in 3d rendering

i ve tested the sample on B and it s a bit slower than B but usable

that means B is more than 7x faster than B here

it s not the first time that the plugin for B works better for me than the one for B

i have been working with linear parsers lately and noticed the performance in B v37 was much slower than in B v30

as you can see ie 8 is about 5 times slower than B 3.6 and almost 20 times slower than B 9 at least when using sunspider tests

this makes B 50x faster than B and 70x faster than safari is there any known reason for that

the problem with this code is that it doesn t quite work on B and works even worse on B
