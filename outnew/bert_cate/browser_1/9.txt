B probably is more complete to manage canvas than B but the problem is always to exclude the finger touch if i m using the pen

also nice to know is the fact that the latest version of B and also B don t know since when but longer than B supports userscripts out of the box no need to install any add-ons

also about B i know still less than B and i m not sure about how it innerly manage resources among threads and if it is even possible to achieve what i want but if possible i d need to do the same work with B threads

often B is understanding more thing then it should and B is bringing you the reality back in your face eheh

my guess is B is caching more agressively and thats why you are seeing worse load time on B

B is clearly less secured it deliberately allows something that B locks down

ps i ve noticed that in B situation is better than in B but new line still starts beneath tag

i have tried B and it better than B crash issue is not always happen but not solved this issue

on stable versions of B the permissions show allow and it still won t connect even with B works older versions of B work

in my testing B is nicer it pops-up the unresponsive alert whereas B apparently doesn t care

in any case vorbis clearly has the most coverage B has more of the market than B now opera is about half of B and obviously firefox is huge and it doesn t really have the strong opposition that theora has

B has more of the market than B not and invitation for flame wars just a personal opinion without any weight -

to me it looks like B gets it more right than B text is generally more around a middle line
