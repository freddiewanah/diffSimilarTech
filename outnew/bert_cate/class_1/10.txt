i have tried connecting the qscrollbars but the maximum of the B is smaller than the B s

the issue is that once the alpha of the B is less than 1.0 i can see all the B sides and the one that gets me the most is the outline of an uiimageview can be seen that would otherwise not as it is the same colour as the B

because the B is smaller it is going to crop out the larger B

a B is no more than a wrapper for an underlying B

i want to add a B inside an B and this B will be smaller than the B

so what this says is that provided your B doesn t have any more values than the B used to determine ordering implementing is reasonable

the general problem is that the B is more specific than the B

in this case B is bigger than B that s why the second statement is correct

in other words if a B is more accessible than its B then the access modifier of the B loses effect

this breaks the inherited and the B is no longer an instance of the B

i think the problem happened because the padding left right of B is bigger than B

but the problem i am facing if text is doted inside the label it calculates B size less than B size in the below code

if the B is larger it will then wrap around the B to the next line

if the B is larger it will then wrap around the B to the next line

i don t see any form B in the code you posted so either the posted code has been modified or the B is higher in the B tree simpleformcontroller

it seems like if the B is slightly larger the B is double the size whereas if the B is slightly smaller this isn t the case

all-in all the reason is that B is able to do more things than B and can do anything B can hence the direction of inheritance
