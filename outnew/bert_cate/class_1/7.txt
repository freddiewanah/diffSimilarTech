instead of using a B in this instance perhaps you might consider using a B - they are built for something like you describe more than a B

making B before i had more than one B in mind for them

you are seeing a noticeable jump in interface response because B do in fact consume quite a bit of memory B are very expensive compared to their underlying calayers and as such calling -removesubview not only unloads stress from the gpu but also frees up more memory as the B is usually released afterwards

in fact each B has even more than 1 corresponding B

yes but if you think of your diagram as a topographic map the B have higher altitudes than the B

you cannot have a B with less methods than a B

take note of this there is no way to B more than one B at a time

take note of this there is no way to B more than one B at a time

finally consider that you can have more than one B as well as more than one B running on a B

unless you know exactly what you are doing do not use the same B for more than one B

note also that using B is more efficient than creating a new B each time a letter is added
