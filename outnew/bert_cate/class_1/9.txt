the B has a more stringent constraint on a property content blank false than the B content nullable true and i am using tableperhierarchy false

a B is more flexible and is treated as an entire object which responds to all B methods plus it s own

however they are not the same because the B has more specific functions and data members that accomplish a more specific task that the B

if we are creating an object of a B and invoking the method of B and if B extends more than one class which B method should be called

however if the B returns a narrower subtype of the B method return this is called a covariant return type and is allowed in java since jdk 1.5

B defines more general features of the objects of its B

for example you want to use abstract-class in such a case that each of the B is a more specific type of its abstract B fruit apple orange banana grape strawberries etc. and you want to use non-abstract B in a relationship such as dad and son

these relations naturally arise when you impose restrictions on what you can handle--then if a B means that the method can handle less acts as a B of since can handle everything that the B can handle and more

i believe the reasoning behind it is that it allows the parameters to be B nicer by preventing B of member variables

since ireadwrite implements ireadonly ireadwrite is said to be a B of ireadonly although B is more accurately used to describe a class which B a base class rather then implements an interface--for the sake of simplicity they are very nearly the same concept

with B this is less likely to happen due the contractual nature of B abstract classes

using dedicated methods for getting and setting B is also more clear in B

B is more of an is-a relationship for example a usermodel is-a model thus all B and methods of a model will be part of a usermodel

if the size of the B s element type is greater than the pointer s size B performs better than B because it doesn t store the objects sequentially but stores sequentially pointers to heap copies

it means a declared B is more than a pair of B methods getter setter

that suggests another aspect where a declared B is more than a pair of B methods that is more static type checking although it is undesirable here

in 6.7 a graph it shown that states that the performance of a B linq query is better than B linq query

it is a feature it is about B api but the same is true or worse with B api

B is more general subclasses support writing to different places B is a specific one writing to a string

B is more general as it leaves you the oppertunity to create another subclass of it that could add the altering functionality without using the B s implementation why ever you would want that to do
