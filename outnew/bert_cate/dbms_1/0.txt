as you can see the B result is way longer then the one from B

using B that is supposed ti be faster than B for depth i m seeing a slow performance

i read in some blog that B performs at least as good if not better than B while also offering more complex types like mongodb would

B looks more fancy and advanced but not as popular as B and is not supported on heroku

the number of requests B could serve is consistently 3 to 5 times lower than B

i found that B is too slow at least much slower than B even on relatively small 150k datasets when searching records by text pattern despite the presence of indices

drupal 7 B 5.0.15 or higher with pdo B 8.3 or higher

B supports some more security features than B for example integration with gssapi or kerberos for logins last i checked B didn t have these

i found that B 9.3 has better capabilities for json than the B versions i am using

as for reliability i think that B is more reliable especially when compared to B using myisam - innodb is a lot better here

B has better support but the support by B depends on the used storage engine

B is probably more often offered by shared hosting providers B is probably a little more powerful

if i were able to upgrade the server s versioning of B to 5.5 would innodb be a safer bet than B

B is more widely supported and a little easier to use but B has some very cool features and functionality that s worth taking a gander at

in fact this presentation which still refers to an older incomplete version of B s opengis support suggests that with proper indexing some B geospatial actions may actually perform better than B postgis though i m sure that s up for debate

with correct locking for safety reasons and heavy concurrent use B performed better than B

i did some benchmarking 3 years ago may be stale... which showed that on large datasets basically B fulltext is 10-100x faster than B and xapian 10-100x faster than B but not integrated

while B is more famous for serious enterprise-quality database where preserving your data is critical i recommend B

if you want to use sql i strongly reccommend B it seems to deal with large databases and frequent writes a lot better than B

the only reason i was considering B was that some research suggested B has much better support for changing schemas along the way than B

while B has a larger user base B is gaining more an more popularity ever since implementing several crucial features that were missing in earlier versions

i had mentioned that in our rails application all select queries dropped below 100ms after switching to B whereas some of the complex joins generated by activerecord would occasionally take as much as 15s or more with B 5.1 because of nested loops with inner table scans even when indices were available

fyi B scales better than B on multi-processor overlapping requests from a review i was reading a few months back sorry no link

some recent tests we did showed that B does perform faster than B and we believe the table partitioning feature in B will be very important with a table in our database we foresee to grow into 100 million rows and more in production

B s version is apparently marginally faster than B but lacks some of the more advanced spatial features therefore it s pretty much limited to finding records that match a certain range of coordinates

while B is less popular than B most of the serious web hosting supports it

i cannot propose any db not knowing your specific needs but if you want to use a free software which excludes oracle and you re not already experienced with B you should try B which is more powerful than B

according to my own experience B run much faster than B especially handling big tables 1.4 gb lineitem table in my case

though B is more popular than B but instagram is using B maybe due to these reasons

this is ancedotal but the B servers i ve managed have always been much less troublesome than B which likes to randomly crash once in a while occasionally corrupting a table on the way down

B is also a lot better imo than B and is the recommended database to use with django according to a lot of the people close to django

it s a shame B isn t more popular than B since it supports exactly this feature out-of-the-box you d only have to share one sequence object between tables.

B and other similar solutions should work a bit better than B depending on your data sets and use cases

according to the B which i gather B is based on documentation for sequence manipulation functions it should return the value most recently returned by nextval in the current session.
