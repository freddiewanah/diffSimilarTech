B is worth learning and much more advanced than B

there are workloads where B is better and there are workloads where B is better

now i m not sure if i d say B is generally better than B -- there are certainly things that B does much better and so it certainly has its uses -- but these are a few things i absolutely love about it

B is older than B so it might have influenced them

i feel B is much more mature and robust than B

in other words is B better or worse than B to handle unicode etc

B is a bit more restrictive than B

B will always be a little bit more mature than B

given B s reputation for doing things better than B or at least as good as i daresay that B would demonstrate similar performance if properly used

B run 4x faster than B

B is way better than B in nearly every respect

B seem to better than B in terms of speed

does this affect B harder than B

is B better than B for such purpose

B is better than B in many ways

honestly though B scales much better than B

may be B takes less time than B

then B is much better than B

B requires more tuning than B to achieve optimal performance

does that mean perhaps rails team favor B slightly more than B

B is easier than B but it doesn t really matter either way

B is not less complicated that B -- they re the same thing

an efficiently configured B is better than a badly configured B and vice-versa
