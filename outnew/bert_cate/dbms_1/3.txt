B is more sql compliant than B

i am aware that B interpretation of the sql standard is stricter than B and that consequently this type of query won t work...and have read a number of posts on stackoverflow and elsewhere on the subject - but none of them seem to be the definitive answer on this subject

for example pyqt is already available for python 3 as well as 2 and you can use B a splendid open-source sql database engine much more standard than B via py-B

the question is is B somehow more resistant than B to sql injection attack under the perl dbi and why might this be the case

from how i understand it B is a more correct database implementation while B is less correct less compliant but faster

the query optimizer in B is more advanced than in B and copes with complicated statements much better especially when it comes to sub-selects

B is much more complete and solid and will much better support complex queries and their optimization while B may shine in terms of retrieval speed for extremely simple queries

is B a better option than B for partitioning tables by date

i totally understand the error and assume that the B implementation is less sql conform than the B implementation

following the first answer it appears that B is more compliant to sql standard than B so it needs a group by clause for each selected column you want to display with your aggregated function

i suggest B it s more capable has more features and better support for complex queries and datatypes than B and has a lot of tuning options

B is much more similar to oracle than B is

B is stricter to the sql standard than B is

in general B knows more tricks for how to optimize complicated queries than the B optimizer does but it also relies heavily on your having given the optimizer enough data to work with

with django it is easy to use B instead of B so i tried it with the same query and same data in db B is much faster that B x10 more faster while using inner join analyse shows it uses indexes unlike B

triggers in B have a syntax a bit more complex than B because they execute procedures as the action

for these ultra simple queries B can be slower than B - B has richer planner that works better on more complex queries but on trivial queries is slower

if you are looking for location based queries in relational databases B is more matured compared to B

B supports recursive queries in the form of recursive common table expressions which make querying heirarchical data easier than in B and also give better performance
