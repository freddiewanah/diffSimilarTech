anyways B is bad and on longterm especially if you are enough good for java i suggest you to use some better db with B you were really satisfied i think

i ve found that B is in my expirience is slower as B

B is more than capable of serving your needs as well as alex s suggestion of B

B license bsd is undoubtedly more simple than B s

generally speaking i find B lends itself to 24 7 operations better than B

why B is more capable than others B etc. on django

B mariadb is slightly worse than B

all that said B is much more acid compliant than B it handles fks just as you re needing and i would generally recommend it based on what you ve expressed in your post

i know B could be considered more mature than B with regards to locking thanks to mvcc - can i use row-locking or some other feature in B instead of the token field

in my personal openion B is slower than B and mongo db

i am using B btw which can do more than B incase that changes things

i hear B is more robust and doesn t crash like B does in these situations

in my cases B was better than B B do not completely support unicode

B is far more powerful and scalable and doesn t have B s silly limitations and gotchas

B is faster than B s innodb

as i said B is far superior and i hate mucking with B s bizarre bugs and i think that overall B performance is probably better than B for any even slightly complicated query
