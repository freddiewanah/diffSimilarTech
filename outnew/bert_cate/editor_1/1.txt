i had previously used B 3 for a couple days and may have come to the conclusion that it is better than B at actual html css coding

if vim seems too much by the moment i think that B is better than B

personally i m using B right now which i find easier than B for searching and navigating the code but everyone has their taste

lately i have used B a bit more than B

B is a better B for macs though that won t help you with solaris

on windows machine i would probably go with B personally i now use programmers B 2 however it does not support a spell checker and i don t really thinks it s better than B by any measure

as it happens my choice is B but just about anything which is more advanced than B ought to be able to do this

it is worth learning both because B is better than B at editing certain languages and doing certain tasks and vice versa

on today s machines that s a non-issue but if you ever find yourself dealing with older gear it s my experience that B is far more likely to work on a wonky terminal than B is

i realized that B would load slower than B but this seems ridiculous for a fresh install

maybe not productive in the same way - i d say B is quicker for editing files B is better at doing everything else again i would personally say things like flymake-mode vcs bindings are such are quicker to use than the B equivalent

i ve used B for 10+ years but never really into B scripting always subjectively beliving that this was one area where B was weaker than B

you might want to try B - it has an inbuilt tutorial and some people like me find it easier over B no flames pls

personally i m using B right now which i find easier than B for searching and navigating the code but everyone has their taste

and i tend to think that after a moderate amount of customisation of either one B will still start up faster than B

B 3 needs much more time several seconds more then B before the opened file shows up and i suppose it is because B does some pre-evaluation of the file content like detecting areas suitable for folding there are fold triangles available depending on indentation of non-white characters in the file

i tried a few ides on ubuntu and it just didn t seem right - B is lightweight and i actually enjoy using it more than B on os x

when i m in a hurry i use B purely because it is quicker than B edit

by the way if you like minimalistic approach there is also B editor which is my personal preference for doing small bits of code it s even more lightweight than B

i have B 8 as well as B cs3 on my windows pc but i m more familiar with B
