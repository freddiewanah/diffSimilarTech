B is more powerful than B it s scripting engine is far more flexible and there are far more scripts modes and the likes built around B

since B is much older than the extensible B as opposed to the relatively non-extensible vi it has a much larger collection of extension modes covering almost any purpose you can imagine

there are definitely some advantages using external editors however B is ten million times better than B

cut and paste in B takes more steps than in B iirc

though similar in ui and ux B performs significantly better than B especially in heavy lifting like working with large files complex snr or plugins that do heavy processing on files buffers

why B uses more memory and takes more time to start as compare to B editor
