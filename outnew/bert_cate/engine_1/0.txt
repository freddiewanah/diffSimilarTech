if you would like a unified front-end for B and opentsdb you could consider grafana which has support for both B and opentsdb but less functionality than B in regard to B

the third line displays the data with the maximum useful precision - an B 754 64bit floating-point number has slightly less than 16 B digits of precision so all those digits of the literal in math.h are pointless perhaps they can be seen as future-proofing against a possible future redefinition in a format with more precision

the maximum representable value with B 754-2008 binary32 is so the base 2 log of a number stored in binary 32 is less than B 128

in addition the need for polyfills for B complicates matters further as they may handle the interaction differently as can be seen in the sample below when using the button to load B

so the easiest way is to use one either B or B B has probably better support for svg these days plus i can t find package of B right now

furthermore i do not have control over the engine â B or B B performs better due to row based locking instead of table as in case of B

B supports better locking semantics so if there will be occasional or frequent writes or if you want better data integrity i d suggest starting there and then benchmarking B later if you can t hit your performance targets

your table sounds fairly large so i doubt it s being held entirely in memory but it sounds like B handles indexes better than B anyway plus since you re being so specific it may be caching the result of the query

B has better performance than B though B needs more attention to tuning the configuration B supports atomic changes transactions foreign keys and B is much more resistant to corrupting data in a crash

B uses row level locking while B can only use table level locking that is why B has crash revovery is better than B

B provides more complex keys structure than B foreign keys and regenerating keys is really slow in B

3 a first of all if you haven t done yet change the storage engine to B which has row level locking and in newer versions of mysql has more optimization than B has

B doesnt read number of rows from stored cached value like B does if column is not null cause B is more optimized for writing than reading opposing to B

tuning B which is the better engine requires adjusting different values than B which is often the fast-but-unsafe default

B is a safer acid compliant engine with some integrity features that B lacks

most of the literature that says B is better faster whatever then B is old literature

for an oltp type system B is usually more sensible than B did you check the contention before trying a different engine

their conclusion B has 30 higher performance than B on average

in B the count s when where group by or join is not used execute slower than in B because the row count is not stored internally

to our suprise B took hours more than B

database performance of the B is not necessary faster than the B engine

generally you can have as good performance for reading as in B in B tables - you just can use count without where clause and you always should have a suitable index for where clauses as in B table scan will be slower than in B

1 in mysql engines B is better or B

there may be some exotic corner cases where B performs marginally better for certain workloads table-scans or high-volume insert-only work but the default choice should be B unless you can prove you have a case that B does better

also i can t see your table engine but B is better for full text searching rather than B

beststat is B so i have row-level locking and consindering i do a lot of inserts-updates it should be faster than B

i heard correct me if i am wrong that B is better for tables that will be updated a lot because of row locking opposed to B s table locking

B handles inserts with composite primary keys quicker than B

3 mysqlhotcopy inly works on B tables and in most applications you are better off with B

B is often slower than B being a transactional db engine with acid properties

this is a huge performance boost look like B is much more quicker for fulltext in mysql than B

B tables have smaller footprints than B ones myth

B is usually much better than B at tables being available while insert update and delete are happening because B uses row level locking for updates whereas B uses table level locking

B is slower for read only databases because it has features acid compliant row level locking that B leaves out

even this blog from 2007 shows benchmark results that B is on par with or faster than B under most workloads

B is better for high read volumes B for high update volumes due to table vs row locking

B tables are about 4x bigger than their B counterparts

if your in the market for a templating engine B a new templating engine used by symfony is much better than B imho
