anyway i just prefer not to use it because B is slower then B

but B has improved dramatically in the past few years and in most cases today B performs faster than B

in terms of pure speed it is not always the case that B is faster than B but in my experience it tends to be faster for pure read working environments by a factor of about 2.0-2.5 times

i did a search online comparing B and B but all of the articles i read judged B being faster than B on select queries

i am not sure if this is no longer true B is faster than B for reads

someone just told me that B is much better than B

as you know B table sizes are about three or more times smaller than same B tables

you are right because B is really faster than B

i currently have B and i would like to stay with it because it had far better performance than B in my case but i heard that B has acid transactions

B is a better choice as B is really old engine and would fade away in near future

oh and just incase you were thinking B is slower than B - the B implementation i tested was twice as slow in all counts

yes it is an old wives tale that B is faster than B

B has a higher resource consumption rates then B so keep that in mind

in general is B faster than B

since you don t do updates i think B would be better than B in this scenario

2 - i have read about B vs B the conclusion for me was that B is faster when it comes to read-only whereas B is designed for tables that get updated or inserts more frequently

in my opinion B use to be faster than B now they are pretty much the same in speed

you insert in there but never select from there as far as i know today B is better than B in this case

B is almost 4 time faster than B which is not acceptable in the environment we are working as i mentioned earlier that every second is worth many dollers for us

why is B so much slower than B in my case

i know B tends to be a bit slower than B on counting but this is far too long

now the response i got from my boss is that i need to prove that B will run faster than B

i know B is heavier than B but just how much more

B table is a bit slower than B tables but i don t think it is a major problem as you told you are using drupal system is that a kind of mult-sites like a word-press system

B has proved to be faster than B for me

either way i intend to use B partly because i have lots of experience with it and partly because its much more well documented and has much more functionality than blade and to me the syntax is slightly cleaner than B although the template engine is not the point of this question really
