B is a high performance 2 to 3 times faster than B pure java template which use razor like syntax

B is a strong typed java template engine using razor like syntax with high performance 2 to 3 times faster than B and fm

B types libraries are fantastic for financial applications because we re used to dealing with the style of rounding required in financial stuff but there is the cost that they tend to be slower than B floating point

it is working only for simple .php files but B is more complex and after long period of loading it show B nothing found site loaded

i m working in a spring mvc project and i want to use a template engine i originally choose apache B because a slideshare presentation that says it was two times faster than B page 41 and since i m working with big tables i need to use a fast template engine does apache B supports html5 if not is there other template engine that supports html5 that is not B

it s called web audio api and is currently a draft but is well supported by B you ll need to use prefixes and a little less by B

you can also try using B since it s said is better than B handling bulk inserts with data already on it

B is faster for certain queries and supports fulltext and spatial indexes while B is transactional and more concurrent

B is actually better than B for spatial data btw because it also supports r-tree spatial indexes but not as powerful queries as postgis. if you just need points though B or B b-trees are adequate

B is slightly faster than B and implements the fulltext index which is quite useful for integrating search capabilities

the lone exception is B which is an older mysql storage engine which does not support transactions is more prone to corruption and generally tends to perform worse than B

note however that for high traffic websites we do modify the joomla core and we also switch the tables from B to B regardless what others might think here B is much faster than B

out of experience i m involved to a project that uses huge amount of data using mysql and we mostly prefer B for data that can be generated it allows to achieve much higher performance losing transactions but generally speaking B is faster but B is more reliable

in many discussions and even in mysql documents it has been mentioned that in case of updates B performs much better than B

the script was tested using B and it indexes products relatively fast much much faster than B
