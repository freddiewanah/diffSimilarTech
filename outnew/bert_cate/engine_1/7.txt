B has a stronger syntax than html and is easier to convert to B this way

if you are targeting android you can use firefox for android by developing a webapp that has native B support and because of it will be much faster than B or other javascript solution

B is often considered to consume less memory than B but this depends a lot on how the browser is implemented

B not only has the advantages you list but it is also faster than B in many benchmarks

B is harder to tune since it has more knobs but a properly tuned B system can often have higher throughput than B due to better locking and better i o patterns

B is slower than B for most uses but can perform faster in certain conditions due to a better locking mechanism

have you considered changing to B - it has much better concurrency support and in some contexts will run faster than B

B has historically been viewed as faster than B but for recent versions of B that is true for a much much smaller set of use cases

newer versions of mysql 5.5+ have extended B to support all the features that were previously only available on B such as fulltext and geospatial indexing and B performance is usually considerably better than B when configured properly

there is a difference between the different storage engines though B is faster for a lot of select B is faster for a lot of insert update because it uses row locking instead of table locking and the way it handles indexes

also note that some mysql engines are faster than others for example B may run faster than B at expense of the lack of real foreign keys

also mysql version starting from 5.5 - B performs faster than B

probably you can take a look at B template engine which is much faster than B and velocity also much easier to use

B has a cleaner api lower system requirements and works better across platforms than B in my opinion
