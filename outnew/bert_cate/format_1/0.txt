you could use the B format which is more common than B and allows true grayscale images

note that the B format is much more complex than B since it allows compression etc

rebuild a new B format in-memory data which is much more smaller than current B data and send the new B format data by socket to remote server

not only do B files have natural support for transparency they are also smaller than B files

not only do B files have natural support for transparency they are also smaller than B files

however B files if stored properly are not significantly larger than B files because since windows vista B files can store B

the resulting B compression may produce a file size larger than your B compression

an B file is nothing more than a text file listing B and or other format digital audio files to be interpreted by player software as a series of audio files to be played in succession

for using a fileformat i thought B uses much less memory than B because all the formats are based on B but just compressed

if you are still having problems jdk 8 has the ability to play B files which are significantly smaller than B you may want to try this

B loads much quicker than B and can be integrated with the google maps api as a kml layer

the B format is substantially less capable than B

B is a newer format and often better than either jpeg of B - especially for screenshots

according to wikipedia the B format provides better compression than B

for example B has better support for transparency than B or jpeg

you can then use imagecopy to insert each B image including the background and imageB to generate B output which is better for line art than jpeg offers better compression than B and can support more than 256 colors

just press save and give it a name and that photoshop image will be saved into a transparent background B file which presents more colors and it s smaller than a B file and is as good as a jpg

B achieves better compression than B because it applies a pre-filtering step before the lossless compression deflate roughly equivalent to lzw. see wikipedia s explanation of B filtering

it will always be a web format which basically comes down to jpg B and B with B being very unlikely because of its limitations B can contain 256 colors at most and is generally larger than B
