the resulting file from this B approach is smaller in size than a B file and i guess may rescale better

B â any bit depth any compression lossy or lossless everything including the kitchen sink â and no better than B

also your B looks more like a B tab separated instead of comma separated

question iâ m seeing some compromise in B quality my converted B is lower file size when compared to B but my audio quality is little poor than B wonder if i can increase the quality of the B file

either way applying gain and or attenuation to time-domain sample data as in a B file is much easier than trying to apply these effects to frequency-domain data as in an B file

icon size indexed B is often smaller than the same B

B has a wider color pallete than B and B is properitary while B is not

B images are always compressed lossless but their compression algorithm works better than competition B

while B is definitely better that B occasionally there is a use case for needing to stay in B format

since that appears to generate index-color B files which are smaller than the B files that doxygen generates

but in that regard it is replaced by B which is generally smaller supports alpha transparency where B pixels are either fully transparent or fully opaque and most importantly B images are limited to 256 colors

there might be some edge cases where B is slightly better because the B format may have a slightly larger overhead from metadata but it s really not worth the worry

B vorbis is better quality per meg than B plus no licensing legal issues

moreover B vorbis is better then B at all bitrates
