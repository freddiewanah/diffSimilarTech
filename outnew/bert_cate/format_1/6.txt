for example if your screen is 600 pixels wide and if the B B string takes more than 600 pixels to display you will not be able to see the end of your B B

if a B file is newer than the corresponding B file or the corresponding B file doesn t exist then i want to run a bunch of commands to convert the B file to an B file and copy the tags across

if the latter is what you want you could use B which is somewhat easier than the B format

if you ask if a uncompressed B which contains pcm data is better than B then yes but the question sometimes is how much this better really matters to the human ear and how much postprocessing you have to perform on that data

you should definitely pick B because they are about 10x smaller than B files of the same duration

B files are about 3 times larger than B files so it would need 1.8gb additional space to do the conversion

one thing to note is that B supports a smaller palette than B - only up to 256 colors

but keep in mind that the B color palette is way smaller than B

if your B files are coming out larger than equivalent B files it is almost certainly because your source image has more than 256 colors

jpg and B work well for most applications but the files will be larger than B for very simple graphics

i used B because its file size 2.1kb was considerably less than B or jpeg in this case

i used ppm B files as they are simpler to write and more portable than B

the only thing i can suggest is that you use B format which is even easier than B for you to read from
