i read that B for beginner is better than B because educational reasons at the same time B have B oscar

B is clearly more bdd focused than B although i could see doing bdd with B by describing the tests in a behavior-oriented way

i should also say that i have the token at ctx.request.get authorization B based i think it s something like req.header authorization with B in all routes

it shows that B is faster then other framework but as this question is about B and restify B is faster than restify

i like B but the amount of gpu memory B use is larger than B i test in resnet-50 with B-memonger

anyway the most important issue is that B is easier than B pylons php and rails

B has more focus on simple is better than complex but B has more focus on explicit is better than implicit

having said that B has a lower initial learning curve than B as it was specifically designed as a learning tool

for the record B as of today supports more complex scenarios than B that s why the initial learning curve is steeper

in B when is it appropriate to render your game content using more than one B

B + monogame --- monogame s performance seems only slightly lower than B can build to most platforms
