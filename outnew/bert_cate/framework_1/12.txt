this is only a guess and is not based on actual performance testing probably B will be doing better than B

i have found one benchmark in which B is faster than B and another benchmark in which B is faster than B

i have found one benchmark in which B is faster than B and another benchmark in which B is faster than B

thus i suspect when people say that B is much faster than B it is because of the loading and updating delays but the actual test execution time appears to be very similar

nonetheless i tried to compare the sum of all test speeds and in some cases B is faster and in other cases B is faster

in my personal benchmarks B is undeniably faster than B due to lazy loading
