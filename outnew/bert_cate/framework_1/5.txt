in my view B seems much more lighter then B but i never used either one so i can t judge

B is considered slower than B but you can tweak it to enhance speed

i think B produces a bit uglier code than B but i m afraid to choose B because it s changing constantly and i will be stuck with the current version if it breaks backward compatibility

you cannot use mocks in conjunction with B it s better to let B provide the context you need here

you can do it with B but works better in 32bit B framework

here is what it would look like with B it s a little more contrived with B since you can t pass parameters directly to test functions

if you re doing non-unit testing B might be a better option than B

you could argue that the B style is simpler and you can do it in B too it just isn t optimal but keeping the state only in the server has many advantages

our team use B as our frame before but now we use B as our frame because it is more light than B but we still use B template.

but a friend told me to begin with B as it s simpler and will help me when i start learning B as B is more complicated than B

but if the use of mongodb is a must then i suggest that you reconsider using B in the first place because mongodb has a better integration with B through mongoengine

i think you ll find that B is even easier to learn and use than rails and B

various people told me to go with B since it s better than B apparently i have no idea and it also has very good support in resharper which i m using

btw why do you want to use B it looks to me less powerful than B

i would advise you to try B it is very easy to learn much easier than B and it let s you re-use many existing components as well

i am new to B it s good for coding but it is not much faster than B

if you ve been using B then you already know it is better than B

before i am using B but i found out that B is much better than B and it has a lot of features
