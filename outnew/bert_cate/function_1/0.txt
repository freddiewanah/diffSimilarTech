if you always keep track of the lengths of your strings you can compare lengths and use B which is faster than B

we keep track of what cmd s length ought to be in a variable and copy the string with B which is slightly faster than B and does neither check string length nor copy the extra zero at end of string

additionally if you have B then it is much more convenient than B + malloc + strcpy with identical result including the same obligation to free the allocated storage when you no longer need it

but if you still wish to figure out the phpbb password encryption B it is no longer B in version 3.0 or higher and is a custom B

i would like to apply a B code solution on my webpage which is more compact than B and sha-1 because i want to use them as keys in a json B table

B is no longer secure and it can be broken with a good gpu no typo you can use your graphics card to break a B

in this context B store is different and incompatible with heap because the new delete B store library is simpler and quicker than the B B realloc calloc heap library and thus provides huge memory usage gains to the c++ embedded programmer in a context where you have only 512 bytes of ram

the c function B is much better make it a habit to prefer that one to B

i start off calling gets to fill the buffer then using B to convert the human-readable text in buffer to an actual computer int value - note that B is more powerful than B and uses long int instead of int as its declared type

sql server is probably smart enough to translate B into the equivalent sarg expression but if you are bent on using a function then B is a better choice because it is part of the sql standard allows for multiple values instead of just two with B and avoids using quite possibly the most confusing function name microsoft ever devised in B

i understand the difference between these functions but my question is when checking for a single null value would B be any quicker than using B

B will go through the listed values and choose the first one that isn t null it s more portable code than B or ivnl etc

i tend to use B only when i need to get the first non-null value from a set of 3 or more values as B only supports two parameters

edit i m not a java expert but i think that in java members of new array are initialized to 0 or null so B is more correct than B in my code

this means B can potentially be faster than calling B followed by memset since it can skip the memset if it knows it will already by zeroed

actually calling memset after B is closer to calling B than the option you suggest

so here B is reading more than one integer at a time from file so B is not getting the integers in file too

on the other hand if what you want to do is not rounding but elimination of fractions into one direction then you have std B that goes always higher and std B that always goes lower

as an added answer there is also the B which is more general than B

since i provided a B example above your read loop can be much better written with B as follows

one more edit if you want to use B instead which you asked about in the comments - and it s even safer than B since it will increase the buffer size as needed you would change to change the code a little bit

although you could tell dancer2 plugin passphrase to use a 4-byte B it s much easier to just use B Bedhash everywhere

so when i see that the B is stored in the B password and that you use that B password as B i think crypt + B is not more secure against a brute force on output hackers who managed to steal B passwords

the lack of B is harder to expoit here than with password B since the B is not directly known

you can safely store the B in the db because working out a string from its B is just as hard when you know some of the string as it is when you know none of it provided the password itself is longer than the B and long enough and strong enough to take a long time to crack by brute force at least 6 chars with at least one case change and a number or non-alphanumeric i d say

this B is nothing more than a random arbitrary string that you concatenate to the passwords and it will make your B password unique

could i use B to do this more succinctly than running B and dcast separately for each of employed girls guys

you might want to give the data.table package a try check out the B function which is much faster than B

generally speaking the B keyword is used more now to allow you to violate the one definition rule when you define a function in a header than to give the compiler a hint about B

templates will be B in the standard meaning of B which is more related to the one definition rule than to actual code B

in reality the B keyword has less to do with B code and more to do with allowing legal violation of the one definition rule

this allows you to use the assignment operator instead of B and requires 1 less call to B - the one you make

just wanted to add that using strrpos + B is slightly faster than B + end

the B function is used here because it is more portable than B or ifnull

the ansi standard function B is simpler than using B and decode which should be obsoleted anyway

if you don t mind the libc allocation functions B is even more efficient it wont copy the data on a shrink just mark the extra memory as B and if you grow the memory and there is memory B after it will mark the needed memory as used and not copy either

a fairer comparison would be comparing stringstream to the B sscanf line of functions which would be slower than B but still faster than stringstream

edit as willeke has pointed out accessing a B directly is technically faster than doing so via an B via self

a B is nothing more than syntactic shorthand for a get set B

the best solution is to write a custom version of B that is less weird or if you know the length of the input just use B

you should use B or B safer than B to copy the string stored in the array between arrays

B is a function to read a single char simpler than using B

the fact that using B with iostreams is faster than B at least in release mode runs counter to the reasoning that copying all that data must be slower than not copying it so i m not sure what all optimization is able to avoid and i didn t really look to find any explanation but it d be interesting to understand what s being optimized away

if you compute the length of the string for unrelated reasons or have the length of the string from other resources it s unclear to me whether B is better or worse than B
