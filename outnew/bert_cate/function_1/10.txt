B is fast alloca is fast copying the string up to the first n is fast puts is faster than B but is is most likely far slower than all three operations mentioned before together

the reason for not having B i m guessing is that B can be replaced more efficiently with B for constant strings and if the string is not constant B is a bit more complicated than B anyway so not as beneficial to make inline optimisations for

if size is known normally a non-naive implementation of B is faster than B since it takes profit of the cpu s data bus size

all B functions have that problem but some are more robust than B

using a non-reversible B such as B is much more secure and you can store the B value as clear text

the B cake generates are more complex than B

in that case some B functions are somewhat faster than other B being one of the fast functions but md4 is faster and it is simple enough that its code can be included in any application without much hassle

other B functions such as sha-1 also have B collisions although it is much less likely than B

using B is better option than B or case..when for this problem since the input values for the B expression can be evaluated multiple times

is the performance of B field constant better than B

my question is is fast implementation of B x 0.5f faster than fast B x

and as tom karzes mentioned B is also better than using B for calculating square roots

in terms of speed B is likely to be faster than B + memset if memory needs to be zeroed out

B is better than a plain B because it is not vulnerable to B length extension attacks

the various alternatives B B work roughly the same way B is easier to use when dealing with arrays and zero-fills the data while B is useful when you need to resize a block of memory

nonatomic properties don t use locks but direct B is faster because it skips the B call

in the case of overflow a free B pair costs less than B because of its internal hidden memcpy

prepending a B is also more powerful than directly setting the seed values because in addition to changing the internal state of the B if the B is not a multiple of the digest block size then it can also perturb the alignment with which the input is fed into the B function

the other suggestion keep repeating until x stops changing does not work either because for non-perfect squares x will alternate between the B and the ceiling of the root â because of integer mathematics the term n x will alternate when x is slightly smaller or slightly larger than B n

in term of speed square rooting is easy a few arithmetical operations for some newton-like method but it is not clear what asin does probably quite Btly B is likely to be one order of magnitude slower than B and thus one square root is likely to be quickier than those two transcendental function calls

it means a declared B is more than a pair of B methods getter setter

that suggests another aspect where a declared B is more than a pair of B methods that is more static type checking although it is undesirable here

the second Bing function is B which supports many more algorithms and variants than B but does not support some algorithms that B does
