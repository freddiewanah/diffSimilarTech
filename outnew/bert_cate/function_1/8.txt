or you could employ a request signing scheme in which certain request fields are B together with the password of the user basically sending the password without sending the password similar to digest authentication but you can use something better than B

you might have even noticed the B version is simpler than the B version

you will find that B works better than B here

B is more correct of course you could just embed B over and over and over... but put that under a performance microscope and B may just win

but depending on the answers to those questions i m guessing that B might do the trick for you better than B

you may be interested in looking at the B keyword which i think is better than the B keyword when you can make use of it

decode the passwords yourself and re-encode them with a B i recommend something a little more fancy than B

i should also mention that B has this built-in and may be a better solution than B

B is far more flexible handling the allocation of space for you with B it is up to you

i mean i think B is way smarter so why do we even need B

i get the impression that most people think that Bing B passwords is the more secure way of handling passwords but i can t figure out a way to comply with current company operations when using B passwords

it should be in my opinion more strongly noted that password hashing with B is no longer secure and should not be used as others noted use B or bcrypt

you d be better off using B for this as it s dumber than B

the B version is not more complex or more dangerous than the B version

but for the example you give it doesn t matter - if it s going to fail it will be in the initial strlen so B doesn t buy you anything in terms of safety and presumbly B is slower as it has to both check bounds and for nul and any difference between B and strcpy isn t worth changing code for speculatively
