i am getting a problem using B and B as in my code B is written earlier then fget but it does not run it runs after B runs

information - use B as it s faster than B and we know

B has 64 and 128-bit versions so you can experiment between the two and it s faster than B largely owing to B being a cryptographic hash function whereas murmur doesn t have the added expense complexity of being cryptographically secure i m assuming that you re not concerned about anybody attempting to intentionally generate hash collisions or anything like that

of course any B algorithm is going to have some chance of collision but you have better options than B that would still satisfy the 1024-byte limit

Bing is one way you can prove this to yourself by taking an B or shasum of a large file since the file s size is larger than the B output by pigeonhole principle B can t be restored.

it s like complaining that a sha256 B is bigger than an B B - yep it is but only one of them might slow the attacker down for a while

finally sha1 B are safer than B i tell you that because you used the B tag in your post

now if you B some values on the heap and allocate more with B you may be given back some of that dirtied memory that you scribbed on earlier

one interesting experiment you can try is to try and B more memory after you B d that pointer

you need to error check B and ensure there are as many passed before using them -- B is better than B as helps detect errors

for instance B is better than B and you should be checking each time whether strtok returns null

if you want to accept a number rather than a digit and only a number B works much better than B as it allows you to check for failures

i prefer using these short forms because to me year B is shorter to type and better to read than B yyyy B

i ve been told that B is less costly than B but research doesn t indicate that

B itself is slower than B because you have to spend some time to clear the contents of allocated memory

B does take longer than B because it has to zero out all the memory you asked for before giving it to you

also have a look at B which is safer version of B

you should use B to compare your strings it s safer than B

needless to say B product has more than one B which is kept in the producthas table

as an aside my c c++ is rusty but is not B more efficient than B if you know you don t have overlapping memory

with a lower order B that works better but then you lose the advantage of cubic B

from what i can gather B generates much better random numbers than rand does however i haven t seen a way to seed it and i would like to just like using B

if you cannot tolerate that use B it s harder to use so use B if in doubt

B is worse than B in that you will need to have the old and new pointers valid during the B

B often gives you more memory that you ask and stores the actual value in a special location that B can access at a later time

you ll probably need to get data anyway so the unique B is probably faster too because you won t need to calculate the B over username

likely not as cheap as xor against n values but seems like there s possibility for better quality results at a minimal extra cost especially if the data being B is much larger than the B value

the more randomness and more characters your B has the better for the B but anything that s several characters long and random works

i don t know how safe could it be and how difficult is for the hacker to determinate the technique i use the thing is that the result has the same length as the B and is harder to determinate a B so if for any reason in the history hacker uses a rainbow table and catches a probable result it will be the wrong

or indeed if your system has B or you re willing to write an implementation then B is much cleaner than B + strcpy

but as the B code gets longer the savings for B become smaller so maybe you could just have a hard limit on the size of the code - any code to be B must be smaller than the limit

a malloc B pair can be better than a B if you don t need to keep around the original memory

a malloc B pair can be better than a B if you don t need to keep around the original memory

i.e B is actually better than the simpler B if you are willing to improve the code
