B won t allow you to do absolutely everything that B does but it will allow you to do almost everything and the code will be probably more robust considering that B is more modern language with stronger typing than B

also note that i use B more than B

early this month i started learning B as i found it fun and easier than B

bottom line i would personally hesitate to draw any simple conclusions of B is faster than B or vice versa

B is clearer on versions releases and i keep asking myself if i am missing something related to B since i can t find this information

the B designers went through a lot of trouble to make sure that it s more than just B without the constraints of c in fact i almost wish they hadn t said that since it s so often misquoted

i m learning B and much less familiar with B but for the life of me i can t figure out how they are trying to achieve the goal stated as build list of encodings sorted and including only those with human readable names.

personally i prefer B because you can use c very easily as anything that is legal in c is also legal in B added to which B is a more procedural in style where B is quite clearly object orientated

B seems to be less dynamic than B in these stuffs

B in that case would not be safer but less safe than B

it seems to me that B would be way simpler to learn then B for beginners i know because i learned it in like 2 months and B is less complicated and better laid out then B

i use B more than B

while i think the move to B is prudent but i think it overstates the case to argue that B is significantly more secure that B

no objects come magically into existence in B any more than in B

after reading some related articles i don t think B is more effective than B

however i read that B was the successor of B and i would feel more comfortable with B syntax

im new to B but i like it more than B as it looks a bit like java does to me from syntax wise compared to B

i feel B is better than B in many aspects but my major question is - will B dynamic libraries support older version of B

i don t think that as of today you can run these tests and determine with any certainty whether B 1.0 is faster or slower than B

one of the reasons we want to move is because B is more secure than B

i also use B more than B but here s what my guess is as to what the B code would come to

you will notice that B bundles are always about 4-5 mb larger than their B counterparts and this is precisely why

so i ve started learning B because it looks way better than B

apple seems to claim that the optional type in B is safer than nil in B but i don t understand why this is so

on the other hand B is easier to learn especially if you have B background so it can be adopted during the time slowly and paralelly with using B

my usual rule-of-thumb is that B is better than B for simple tasks whereas B is better for complex tasks

i hate to answer a request for a solution in language a by suggesting a solution in language b but what you are doing here falls into the class of problems which B handles much better than B

i would suggest you start with B and more specifically with B formerly plt B

what s the deal i thought B would be nicer than B

B is quicker than B but for what you re going to do you re trading speed for convenience - B comes with all the different ui classes list scrollbars etc already there

B does not provide an alternative and any alternative that was provided would likely be less reliable as B does not have the resources that sun oracle ibm etc

i don t see why sbcl should be so fast - B is a far simpler language than common B

for a counterexample i think B programs ran faster and used less memory than the B programs that preceded them mdash

i am not sure it can satisfy you but B test is 4 times slower than B

the reason i wanted to investigate this was because both c and B were significantly faster than B for this program

as others have pointed out B s learning curve will be lower than B s

however i ve noticed that running the B tools is becoming more and more painful over time so i m looking at the possibility of migrating this code to B 2008

yes they are different but you can hardly say that the B version is less capable than the B version

if you don t already know B there s little point in learning it now - your time could be put to much better use by learning B c#

especially as B is becoming more and more of a distant memory and the B language takes on a life of its own in conjunction with the core .net framework advancing

B methods tend to be more fine-grained than B functions so that may be a good place to begin

recently we noticed that B queries run faster than B so we decided to convert our queries

B seems much more clear to me than B and in general it seems that the guys in neo4j are going with B

i know that B performs better for some regex but will the B performance really be this bad in comparison
