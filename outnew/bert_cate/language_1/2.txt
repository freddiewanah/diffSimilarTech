adding lightweight generics to your B api makes it easier to interface with B because your api gets translated more precisely

the B compiler is doing a lot more and is quite a bit newer than the B compiler so it unlikely it will be as stable fast for quite some time

specifically it makes it possible to write B code that plays nicely with B which is more strongly typed than B

executable size of B application is much bigger than size of B application

but B is less dynamically typed than B and has less support for reflection

it is possible for B to be faster than pure B in things that you would traditionally use c or c++ for anyway

as B is the older programming language for ios or macos applications B allows you to use those classes structs in your code

however when i switch to B 4.0 the methods declared in B is no longer visible in B

this is because the B dictionary is more strongly typed than the B nsdictionary

injecting code in a B application is harder than it was for an B application but it s still possible

B s compiler is also doing a lot more than B s compiler considering B is more strongly typed and does not required specifying imports among other things

most importantly for your image processing app the compiler will optimize B code to run faster than B

B will incur this penalty in fewer situations than B will for instance method calls to B-only protocol methods do not hit objc_msgsend but if the protocol is declared in B or if the B protocol is decorated with B such that it can be adopted by B objects as well then method calls to methods in that protocol adopted by B objects appear to be dispatched via objc_msgsend

B is stricter about runtime type correctness than B so duck typing alone is not enough

unless you are using the static typing feature B is no more strongly typed than B

saxon-ee supports streaming of large xml documents using B or B streaming is better supported in B than in B

on the side of using macros B has always been more advanced than other B and lisp implementations

there are various object systems you can load as libraries when you want to do oop but integration with existing code heavily depends on the B dialect and its surrounding culture chicken B seems to be more object-oriented than B for instance

right now B is much better as it supports a broader set of language and platform features than B .net ever did

in free and turbo B file handling is much more easier than in B in B we have assign instead of assignfile and close instead of closefile

B is coco but much more compatible with B more functional and more feature rich

while B is more expressive B pattern matching is simpler which means a simpler language definition compiler etc. and you still can do what you need at the cost of writing more code

opengl is better for playing around and experimenting because you can easily draw triangle without messing with hardware buffers available on larger selection of platforms plus B is better than B because it doesn t compile into assembly

however gambit B has smoother access to c c++ code libraries which far outnumber common B s libraries

common B has a separate namespace for functions which makes operation like this more verbose than with B

it s popular it s actively developed it has many libraries offering the features of a modern programming environment and B is somewhat simpler not to say better just simpler than common B

i noted that while in languages like c variable identifiers can only be alphanumberics and underscores common B allows many more characters to be used like and at least B does

please consider also to use B for code generation that s much nicer than B and integrates smoothly with xtext infrastructure

B is a dependently-typed language that is designed for low-level programming though it s somewhat less elegant than B

all in all t4 to me is more of a inside vs code-generation tool to quickly create c# or other files while B is more of a data-processing data-transformation tool to turn data from xml into another format typically html or pdf using B

because B is eagerly evaluated the execution model is far easier to comprehend and debugging via printf works a lot better than in B

B has more momentum these days but there are plenty of good parsing libraries for B as well including the peg parser generator aurochs menhir and the glr parser generator dypgen

B has fewer industrial users than B and although it does have multicore support it is still being developed in a very unproductive direction

B is closer to c++ because of it s imperative and oo features but i recommend you learn B as it is more functional more mindbending and has more resources

secondly the B ffi is more powerful that is it does more with less code than B s and more libraries are avaliable via hackage so i don t think foreign interfaces will be a deciding factor

...i suggest doing all of the scripting from within the B file and avoiding the use of .cmd .bat files completely if you can as B is much more readable and powerful though i prefer using the B language instead but that s just me

the inclusion of B code into a batch file is simpler than B and the translation of a small code segment from vbs to B is not problematic

yes B was once much more feature-rich than B but later revisions of the language B 2001 B 2005 systemB etc.. have cherry-picked most of the interesting features and there is far more robust toolchain support for B and its variant these days in addition to it being the dominant language in use in the us in my experience B is only used here when dealing with extreme legacy blocks and in academic contexts partially due to the tools support mentioned previously

none of the .net libraries are there and there are some syntax differences as B is more strict than B is

biggest of all is that adding new features to your B application is more expensive than it would be if the application was in a better language like c# or B

while B syntax looks more related to shell syntax like bash or tcsh B is actually more closely related to B or php or ruby

B is no better nor worse than B ruby python or any other scripting language in this regard -- they all do basic file operations with equal aplomb
