by looking at the google groups for qjplot and B the support for B is better lot s of unanswered questions at the B group

usr local lib python2.7 dist-packages B sandbox cuda init .py 600 userwarning your B version is more recent than the one B officially supports

if i remember correctly B argued they were faster than B because the use non-native functions for key operations

B is another faster implementation of B that will provide a lot of utility methods for working wit arrays objects functions etc

i am stunned right now seeing a B performing 100-150 faster than B in even simple native functions such as array.every in chrome

basically collections are things that implement some kind of iterable interface and they internally use the same iteration method though B source is a bit more convoluted than B

other useful pieces would be B for database access much simpler than B or other full orms async-httpclient for doing calls to other web services

i also think working with B is much easier using B dataframes and not numpy arrays

B intrusive_ptr performs better than shared_ptr because it doesn t need a second B to hold the reference count

to be able to use std allocate_shared with B fast_pool_B as the B method using g++ 4.8 or higher with B 1.56.0

the latter doesn t do any dynamic memory B and is more than 10 times faster than std to_string on B karma benchmarks

just to goof off a version using B string_ref is much faster still due the reduced B

i m using the module B in my python script and many more such as B and numpy etc B module only works on python2 not for python3

to allow you to scale down the data away from endpoints 0 and 1 i had to do this when combining B in B single pcolormesh with more than one B using B so you can likely see how the code works but basically say you have values -5 1 10 in a sample but want to normalize based on a range of -7 to 7 so anything above 7 our 10 is treated as a 7 effectively with a midpoint of 2 but shrink it to fit a 256 rgb B

unless you re doing very heavy processing working with a single frame is probably faster than transferring it to the server as far as i know B in c# isn t considerably slower than B in c c++

customization and variety of animations B has more customizable animations when compared to B javascript charts

if you re using retrofit and okhttp to perform the network calls i suggest you use B as it s also from square and claimed to work faster and better than B

this should be possible maybe be aware snap.svg isn t so compatible with older browsers in which case you could look at B which is snaps older brother B is very well established as well

the only place where B defeats B is fallback B supports older versions of ie where as B is based on current web standards ie 9

B is svg and as such it is much more dynamic than B you can restyle graphs with css attach events perform animations etc..

in the experiments and discussion below i find that B is slower than B for batched 2d ffts

however for a variety of fft problem sizes i ve found that B is slower than B with openmp

you can also try sklearn.linear_model.logisticregression and sklearn.svm.linearsvc both implemented using B that is more scalable than B albeit less memory efficients than other linear models in scikit-learn

the situation is critical if on some platform B provides a narrower functionality and does not link to B which will not be available on that platform at all so the above command for linking will fail due to unsatisfied library dependency

B seems more flexible but i am unclear about what the most direct way of using it to save a full B dataframe with multiindex and all

inspecting the assembly shows that in the sequential access case B is faster because the sum becomes vectorized while it does not when using raw B multi_array

as a note B is way better than other libraries as B for real time applications

the origin server would get the images from s3 process them using B since it s much faster than B then serve them

android plot and other free chart solutions mentioned here doesn t support annotations the only one is afreechart which is a port of B for android i am currently using it and it is awesome and has much more features than B

i have an app that uses the public part of the twitter api the on who not requires to login but with the update the login is required so i need to implement oauth i ve seen there are libraries like B who makes this easier but my app has a lot of code and i don t wanna rewrite it not now so i ve think to use B or oauth-signpost but i dont realy know how to

have a look at sift and surf and at B which has a good sift implementation and also implements mser and hog and is much smaller than B

in my experience B via mit-shm extension was significantly faster than B surfaces not sure i used B in the most optimal way though

B is more of creating charts using canvas element of html5 and B uses svg

try this lib that s a good one with the B we use only in the server side because B is more slow in the android than B at least in our test

B is more suitable if you have a complex deep json tree because B creates a lot of temporary objects which leads to stop the world gcs

according to the performance results at for serialization with databind with strings B.tojson myobject B is over 10x slower than B

there is B which provides more semantic support than B .also you can try nitobi suite which also provides similar kinda solution.if you are not satisfied with any of these i suggest try to write your own part extending the sun faces

B is far more flexible for working with data so i often bring parts of B dataframes into memory manipulate columns and create new ones

the chapter starts with short course to xml general talk but with the atom syndication feed example then it continues with the standard xml.etree.elementtree and continues with third party B that implements more with the same interface full xpath 1.0 based on B

i have found though that since i started using the asset_sync gem which uses B instead of aws-s3 gem i don t have any more trouble with B and s3

i am using a sparse format but suggestions are welcome on other formats too i am able to use the data with B in a dense format using the function names as variables and it works just muuch slower than with B
