when one of the strings is a prefix of another the performance of B is worse as it still needs to determine the lexicographical ordering while B won t worry any more and return false immediately

in the B method you can decide which fields are used for the comparison greater less than or B

i am using the min value because i read that the B method returns negative 0 or positive whether the first string is less than B to or greater than the second

term B is more appropriate for run-time dynamic B B

according to this test - B is slightly faster then B since it doesn t use animations

that s because B is executed faster than B method you can remove the class when animation is complete

B is more relevant than B since the first method just waits for a delay and executes a logic whereas the second function is meant for repeating a logic on periodic intervals

it uses B however B is a better solution than B because it will only queue a new one if the previous one is complete

it uses B however B is a better solution than B because it will only queue a new one if the previous one is complete

the B solution is faster than using in and B clauses

the B solution is faster than using in and B clauses

in my fragments data handling is taking place starting from B which happens earlier than B

note that the test bean has a very special design as the B returns a more general type number than the B requests integer

if the calculation is expensive or the B is executed more often than the B for the changeable properties playername by far it can be an optimization to change the property inside the class into a read-write property and set the value every time the changeable properties are changed

the B complexity can be higher than the B and thus validate a unit-test

B is more vulnerable than B as it can be transmitted and stored

B has more capacity it can transfer more data than B

but i believe sending data using curl with B method is better than B method

B B method doesn t have the same lenght limit you can use B to send more data than with B

there is a default limit of B method which is 2mb which is way higher than B

the B request is marginally less secure than the B request

i m searching for the best method to B result with database contain more than 100000 B and more than 100000 cat

if you use B when B is more semantically correct it is less communicative of the intent of your request since B usually means you are sending a payload

usual way with tagging is to B objects by tag but if tags are used by few applications it may give more than B

B is not more secure than B as itâ s also send unencrypted

one reason B is worse for security is that B is logged by default parameters and all data is almost universally logged by your webserver

yes generally B is a better way of submitting data than B

B is more appropriate than B for queries because of its safe semantics

B makes it more indirect to intercept and read the payload than B but not safer

B is more appropiate for idempotent queries while B is more appropiate for action queries but you can shoot yourself in the foot just as easily with any of them if you don t understand the security architecture for the application you re maintaining

yes B is better than B because B data is not usualy logged by a proxy or server but it is not secure

standard B request is not more secure than B one

B gives you more options and dosn t have a limit on parameter query string length like B the only negative is B is slower by a couple of milliseconds to create the request

B is more secure then B and data transfer size limits are also there

as powelljf3 said B is more secure then B though it can still be gotten to

B requests are no less insecure than B requests

B is more performant as it is idempotent and does not contain a message body where as B does

however B is a bit more safe than B because B could be stored in the history

B requests are no safer than restful requests which are no safer than B requests

q1.i know that B is better than B for name-value pair parameters as the get exposes it in url and B doesn t

and that is for performance reasons assuming that a B implementation should always be much faster than an B implementation

in the B method only if you re certain the ensuing B implementation is much more expensive than B which is not vast majority of cases

1 is comparison via B check if the hashcode of both objects are the same faster than B

override both methods but make B more tolerant than B that means make unequal objects have the same hash code and not the opposite

B on the other hand can test accross a larger number of fields - ie its test is more specific than B comparisons
