the B api works better than B normally but has usage limits and the implementation is bigger

2 location + reverse B - seems more reliable but requests location services on the device does it work on wifi only tablets and for it to be enabled and requires time to a fetch location b server call to reverse B

also as mentioned elsewhere B is a better option to css visibility as B sets display none and not visibility

and im not shure about this statement javascript likes B more than B which gives a little performance boost

a B has broader application and is generally used to send persistent data to a server in fact prescriptively B should not be used for this purpose

however it isn t clear how much the value can be for the standard tumblr api you can t B more than 50 B at a time

we provide a number of support resources which may B faster response than B on third party sites including the virtuoso users mailing list public support forums and confidential support cases

this would make things considerably easier as the android library has native support for json serialization and making http B requests to restful urls is much simpler than http B requests it s not a huge deal but just less stuff you have to worry about

also B is generally considered better than B for ajax calls as it doesn t have the same string length limit slightly more secure too

Bs have a size restrictions B do not or at least it s a configurable setting on the server and has a larger higher end than a B request would

edit taking into account what was said in the comments though it looks more secure and is recommended by w3 see touheed khan s answer B isn t more secure than B and as riggsfolly said

B is more often used on unsecure type of datatransactions like for example a searchform and B is used when you want to make more secure things like a login form

other than that accepting a B request might be - depending on the server side rest framework - slightly more light weight than B requests

while the B method can be submitted with forms or ajax calls and it is pretty safe at least more than the B

a B request would not provide any more safety than a B request any half-decent web debugging tool can forge B requests

B method are generally consume more secure than B because when we use B method than it can display the data in url bar.if the data is more sensitive data like password then it can be inggeris

B method is not safer than B data never trust datas coming from the client side

when you use B data is a alot more safer than B and you can send large no

ajax calls using B are more performant than B according to yahoo

at very high speeds amazon s3 does have some recommended request rate and performance considerations but this is only when making more than 300 B list delete requests per second or more than 800 B requests per second for a particular bucket

from an interface design standpoint you want user-agents to make post and B and delete more difficult than B or at least distinctly different so that users can rely on that difference to hint when their actions might cause a change in the resource state because they are responsible for those changes
