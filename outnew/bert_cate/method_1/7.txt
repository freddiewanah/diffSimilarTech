is B ... more performant than B ...

B would be the better way than B

i think using B is safer than B

B would be the better way than B

i think using B is safer than B

in this case B behaves more like B ..

in this case B behaves more like B ..

but then your B is less restricted than your B which is odd.

but then your B is less restricted than your B which is odd.

B is faster than B

on that base a B is more appropriate then a B

when B is better than B

and i think B is better than B

in effect B is no more secure than B

is B safer than B

B is a little more complex than B though

B is not better than B

but a B seems more logical than a B anyway

B has a lot more advantages than B

B is always faster than B

first off B is no less secure than B

B is not any more secure than B

hence B is more secure than B

B is more secure than B this is just a quick example

i believe B is better than B

it is just an example that shows a scenario in which B is more secure than B but i don t think it would be a good idea to choose B over B from this attack reason

B has worse performance than B

in this case B may be better than B anyways

however note that B is not much safer than B

regarding your question about safety -- the answer is B is absolutely no safer than B

B is faster than B

on that base a B is more appropriate then a B

regarding your question about safety -- the answer is B is absolutely no safer than B

more importantly in this case i think B is more appropriate than B
