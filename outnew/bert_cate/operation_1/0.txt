since bit wise operations can be done very fast and B operations are relatively slow this type of B is much faster than doing a B

a side effect of many B routines is the B - so in few cases should B actually be faster than B

programmers like to use this property to speed up programs because it s easy to chop off some number of bits but performing a B is much harder it s about as hard as doing a B

on simple low-cost processors typically bitwise operations are substantially faster than division several times faster than B and sometimes significantly faster than B

each operation takes a specific length and typically B will take more than B

other cpus take three or four cycles to do a B which is a bit slower than B

for B the technique described at is a reasonably easy thing to implement and is better than serial B

it is well-known that the processor instruction for B takes several times more time than B division is even worse upd which is not true any more see below

on modern processors floating point B is generally slightly more expensive than B which is one reason why compilers will typically replace by x+x

my question is why do both integer and floating-point B execute faster than their B counterparts

it used to be that B was slower than B and programers used several tricks to avoid B but with haswell it seems that it s the other way around

then you can process any length number using very few division remainder B operations which is important because they are much slower than B

the B operation uses more clock cycles than the B on many processors

B is still somewhat more expensive than B on modern computers and compilers go to some effort to replace them with one or two shifts+B instructions

on a cpu with a fast multiplier B may only be on the order of 4 times slower than B but on normal hardware it s 16-32 times slower for a 32 bit operation

functionally a B will always take more time than an B because it combines a true B along with a true Bition step

i read in couple of blogs that in java B reminder operator is slower than B

i am a bit suspicious of the performance because modulo tends to use B which is slower than your B operations

B has worse latency than B or addition by a factor of 2 to 4 on modern x86 cpus and worse throughput by a factor of 6 to 40

on modern processors float B is a good order of magnitude slower than float B when measured by reciprocal throughput

in many processors integer B is vastly faster than integer B

the compiler or the jit is likely to convert the first case to the second anyway since B is typically faster than B

integer B is about an order of magnitude slower than B on current cpus.

the cpu operation for float B is much more complicated than B

hardware integer B is always slower than B and the gap in the relative latencies of these instructions continues to widen

here s one idea which uses one B and one shift so it ll be faster than a B on most systems

most optimizing c compilers optimize it out to a B operation which is much faster than B it can be done only if the divisor is constant though

in a 64 bit application this code will be a lot faster than in a 32 bit application in a 32 bit application multiplying two 64 bit numbers take 3 B and 3 additions on 32 bit values - however it might be still faster than a B on a 32 bit machine

it is common knowledge that B takes many more clock cycles to compute than B

on many processors integer B is faster than integer B

on many machines particularly those without hardware support for B B is a slower operation than B so this approach can yield a considerable speedup

as a rule of thumb B is faster than B on all cpus

on some machines B is much slower than B but on most machines j multiplies and j divides will run a lot faster than 2 n-2 B and one B

this can be a major clock-cycle saver since B is often much faster than a B operation

B is generally on the order of 10x slower than B on most processor families

usually B is a lot more expensive than B but a smart compiler will often convert B by a compile-time constant to a B anyway

B is far easier and faster for a cpu to do than B

on most processors B is slower than B for the same data types

from the performance side float B is faster than B but i don t think that in the gui code it can create significant difference

this is a hold over from older compilers and interpreters on old chip architecture that would do B slightly slower than B

performing B on this slightly larger type will pretty much always be faster than doing B or modulo on the type itself

for example on most 32 bit systems 64-bit B is faster than 32-bit B modulo

it could be done via B which is much slower than B or it could be translated into a bitwise and operation as well and end up being just as fast as the version

2.the B by 2 can be done by bit - shift operation is it really slower than B
