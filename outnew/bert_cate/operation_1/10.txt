inverse B for 300 time take 1.422 seconde more than executing B sub and multiplication 10k time even the core of inverse B is build with same B and sub and multiplication functions and for this number it just do 150 time inside while help plz why

B is the easier of the tasks just remember to B each block of one number with the other and carry the zeros

but in normal case it takes n 2 comparison so you half the height of tree but you B each merge with two so total running time is not better than B to 2 part

according to agner s instruction tables a single fp B is slower than a single reciprocal op and a single B op

the addition and B are much more than B and division

since fp B shifts the smaller operand s mantissa until both operands have the same B you can add a certain magic number to force it

as B of ints has more overhead than simple B

m_expr can expand to a u_expr because unaries bind tighter than B operations and a_expr can expand to a m_expr because B operations bind tighter than B operations

for example fp B throughput is lower than fma or B on intel before skylake 1 vector per clock instead of 2

however B is faster than Bing even though less clock cycles are used to B verses B according to what my particular cpu s datasheet says about the instructions being used

B is similar using B of the base type and borrow instead of carry multiplication can be done with repeated additions very slow or cross-products faster and B is trickier but can be done by shifting and B of the numbers involved the long B you would have learned as a kid

the double_unit stuff is how random actually does it internally because B is faster than B see floating point B vs floating point B

the B and subtraction is okay because the types of a and b force them to be performed using floating point arithmetic - but because B binds more tightly than B and subtraction it s like using the brackets above only the immediate operands are considered

multiplication and B are higher precedence than B so they get done first - before the implicit conversion to string for concatenation
