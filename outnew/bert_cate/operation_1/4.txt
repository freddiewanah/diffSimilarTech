if B is slower than B then case 2 is slightly slower than case 1

if B is slower than B then case 2 is slightly slower than case 1

B is faster than B

B is faster than B

B is slower than B

B is slower than B

the same speed as B though still faster than B

yes pow is slower than B B is slower than B

but in many cases B is faster than B

also remember B is much more expensive than B

for integers B is harder than B may be slower than B etc but may still be very fast as long as there is sufficient cpu-power dedicated to it

if B is slower than B instead of doing

B is cheaper than B

B is generally slower than B

at the time this was faster because B was a lot faster than B but that s no longer the case

B is nearly always a lot slower than B

B is much harder than B

the same speed as B though still faster than B

B is cheaper than B

B is generally slower than B

at the time this was faster because B was a lot faster than B but that s no longer the case

B is nearly always a lot slower than B

B is much harder than B

is the B really weaker than the B

is the B really weaker than the B

as of a few years ago B was 3x slower than B

where B binds more tightly than B

as of a few years ago B was 3x slower than B

where B binds more tightly than B

as you can see B is about an order of magnitude slower than B

the reason is that the B is slower than B

as you can see B is about an order of magnitude slower than B

the reason is that the B is slower than B

the reason for doing so is to reduce hardware cost as B is more expensive than B

B is always much more expensive than B

first of all B is faster than B

B is a lot more expensive than B

however in general one could expect that a B is a more expensive operation than a B

B is usually faster than B

B is faster than B so the second method is faster

it s just as fast as going the opposite direction if not faster given that B generally takes longer than B

therefore i conclude that B is faster than B

is B more expensive than B in c++

knowing that a B is much more costly than a B

yes B is usually much slower than B

why does B take so much longer than B

the B should perform somewhat better than B

i used B for both operations because B is typically faster than B

B is faster B is more accurate

B is about 10 times slower than B

B is less expensive than B so

B is usually significantly faster than B

B is slower than B due to some reasons

B is much more expensive than B

for the B-to-B case you are assuming that B is faster than B

B is more expensive than B

B algorithms are slower than B algorithms in most cases

in all other cases B appears to be several times slower than B

B is much faster than B

B is faster than B

B is about 20 faster than B

and B may be slower than B or may still be fast

the reason for doing so is to reduce hardware cost as B is more expensive than B

B is always much more expensive than B

and B may be slower than B or may still be fast

a111 B is equal or better than B

here it is conceivable that B is slower than B

a111 B is equal or better than B

here it is conceivable that B is slower than B

the first difference is that B is much more expensive than B

for example an B is typically much faster than a B

the first difference is that B is much more expensive than B
