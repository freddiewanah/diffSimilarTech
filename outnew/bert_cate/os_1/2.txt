this is because your B system has newer system libraries than your B one

it is widely used to have a separated tag with the postfix -alpine in it to indicate that alpine B is used which is a much smaller base-image than the B image

if your system B is older like B wheezy for example your glibc version will be older than the required one

B however is less forgiving and has a filesystem that is case sensitive at least my dev B version does but i guess it is the default for B

sometimes a B distribution contains far more than an operating system but is informally referred to by a single name such as B and so the line between what the operating system is the B kernel and standard libraries perhaps and the applications that merely ship with that operating system the gnome and kde environments on B is pretty gray

this is because B 15.10 uses a newer version of libc and libstdc++ which is not available on B 8

B heavily relies on python scripting and generally consumes more resources than B

recompiling B kernels is harder -- it will require working with B build tools

as for B being more stable than B for using as server it can be true in very rare occasions where the package is very obscure

we recently have migrated redmine from a server which was running under B 5.5 with the same ror environment the same load the performance was a way better than on B 7

note that B software versions are older than B s but versions of opensuse software are newer than B s versions
