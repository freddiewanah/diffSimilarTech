if you are on linux and have chosen blas and B from a repo it is very likely that they are much slower than B

b B runs always slower than B sequential around 10 times slower

dist fonts B gruntfile.js js less license B readme.md

with library B you can have a prettier more compact form see soto s answer for an even more compact one with B

could i use B to do this more succinctly than running B and dcast separately for each of employed girls guys

B also has more features and offers B too

how can i find all div and span tags with order preserved.with B it is very simple but i switched recently to B since it is much faster than B

B will let you use xpath here which i think will be less painful than B s interface

you might want to use r markdown and B which is easier than using B and r as also zhaoy suggested

B deals with badly formed html better than B is actively maintained B isn t and is a lot faster since it uses libxml2 internally

B is newer based on B internally and is often even faster
