B is more forgiving in terms of well-formed xml structure see i had to edit the xml a bit to make things work for B and it s actually much easier to work with

B uses the css selector syntax familiar from jquery which i find more intuitive than B s

one of the things that makes B better than B is support for proper css-like class selection or even supports full css selectors if you want to use them

note that using the B parser is a lot slower than B s default parser

the reason for using B for such a task is that it cleans html files better than B do

for starters B is no longer actively maintained and the author even recommends alternatives such as B

edit don t use this for html work use the B library it s python based and much faster than B

B is much faster than B and probably the fastest parser available for python

B enables you to search for elements using xpath which i think is easier than using B s api

B is more suitable for html parsing than B

even when B editors support B their support makes working with .rnw files much clunkier than pure B .tex files

the B package is a bit nicer than B for making http requests in my opinion and it sets a user-agent string by default

B provides more human-readable wrappers around the base r functions though as of dec 2014 the development version has a branch built on top of B mentioned below
