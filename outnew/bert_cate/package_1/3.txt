however there are many others ts B which is generally faster than B .

however there are many others ts B which is generally faster than B .

also B is significantly faster than B in many cases for processing results

according to some benchmark tests B is nearly 100 times faster than B

speed isn t important here but in other applications it is good to know that regexes are very fast 100 times faster than B and 1000 faster than B

alternatively you can use B module which is lot faster than B

it uses B underneath and is much faster than B

pyquery is based on B so it s also much faster than B

B is much easier to deal with and usually performance is good enough but for large brute force algorithms like this B will probably be at least an order of magnitude faster

but if you are allowed to store whole tree into memory you can use B which is faster than B

in the first example B is 3x slower than data.table and in the second its 200x faster than B and 100 times faster than data.table
