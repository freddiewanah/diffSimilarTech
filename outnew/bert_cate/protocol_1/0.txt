one might want to define B access to more than one B server

B could be considered as a better option than B

but as i understand it B disallows the more secure B domain credentials if they re available

B is complex to set up and even though it generally is considered faster than B this is only true when you reach a certain limit of simultanious users on your site

if we assume that you live in a poor coverage area and your phone and your tower are constantly dropping the signal then re-establishing a B connection is no worse off than re-establishing a tcp connection modulo B handshake

i m using keep-alive so i think the B handshake is more or less totally out but i hope to move to B soon so i don t really know how that helps after the initial handshake

plus once B becomes more common B slow down won t really account for anything much

B has to do a lot of error checking to ensure that your packets don t get dropped and so B is much slower than B

if i d directly say that B is faster comparatively than B that it is used for such applications

you ve struck lucky with the requirements - because you re going from B - B it s actually a lot simpler than doing B - B

what s currently baffling me is in my results B finishes almost 2x faster than B

B is certainly going to be more reliable than B since B doesn t guarantee packet delivery which is probably why you application is hanging on the receive

also if you have very limited memory processing resources it is worth bearing in mind that B is a less costly protocol as it avoids a lot of the overheads B incurs due to its inbuilt connection management

instead you can use B and implement your own scheme for verification of data that is less stringent than B

when writing your server bear in mind that the sequence of events for a B socket is much harder than for a B socket since as well as the normal socket and bind calls you also have to listen and accept

hello to all i am developing an application that needs to send a image via the B socket.i know that B is a better protocol but playing with kryonet in java i have learnt that B is better for this type of application.i have this small class that i have made

also note that it is easy to implement your own stack on top of B that performs worse than B

i assumend that the transmission using B have to be much faster than using B but in fact my tests proved that the B transmission is about 7 to 8 times slower than using B

instead of implementing all these over B it is much better just to switch to B

B mounts are more reliable and you know you have a network problem much faster than with B

while B has less network overhead than B it generally relies on you the developer to come up with your own mechanisms for flow control fragmentation handling lost packets etc.

actually we could say that B is a higher level protocol compared to B because B includes some advanced features which might be useful .

we know B is better suited for this but the hardware development decided it s got to be B

note that there are exceptions to the above - for example B generally traverses firewalls better than B which may be blocked due to security to traffic policy reasons so voip speech may sometimes be sent over B for part of its journey at least

you will notice that the B header has more fields than the B header and many of those fields will be populated by information from the handshake

from experience i can tell you B is about 10-15 faster than B on dedicated and B-tuned networks

the reason i asking this is because i read B is slower than B because B ensures order of packets

B is also more work than B if you need reliability which is built in to B

B is quicker than B but if you re using quickfix you ll be using B

i ve considered that B is more suitable for sending a series of discrete data sets but i need the reliability of B

if your client connections are more or less permanent and not too many clients are connected at the same time B is only slightly worse than B

if you can t afford lost packets then B is probably a better option than B since it provides that guarantee out of the box

i know that in practice this would only happen with a great amount of connection given that processing time of an B connection is faster than B but it could potentially happen

i m trying to avoid Bclient because B is faster but would this work in B since it s streamed

normally a server wouldn t need to know the client s address beforehand but B s knottier than B the more usual stream-oriented approach to socket communication in many ways

B has bigger overhead than B because it needs to add more data to your payload but you are guaranteed that your data will be received in it s destination in the order you sent it and not corrupted

B is reliable but slower than B while B is not safe and i have to implement my own fault-handling codes

theoretically B should be be 30-50 faster than B because it s missing the extra trip for the ack and has a smaller header overhead however in reality there are many cases where B would outperform B just because of congestion control

generally speaking B has less overhead than B allowing you to receive more data but this is not a strict rule and is almost negligible in this context

if you re more interested in latency and small amounts of data then something B based could be better than B but you d need to build extra logic for ordering the messages and retrying the lost ones

the downsides are that it is unreliable messages can be dropped or corrupted therefore you may want to add some safety and that some isp may restrict B more than B test yourself to be sure but usually there is no problems

please note however that this architecture implements B which is much slower than B and will not work for any type of fast-paced data intensive games but should accomplish your goals given your description above

some protocols are more complex because what s needed are some but not all of the features of B but more than what B provides

if the data is critical you should go for B which is slower as compared to B which in fact doesn t guarantee the packets will arrive in order or even if they d arrive or not

i know B is better to send file but i have a homework about sending file via B protocol

B is slower than B and you ll have to mitigate that in realtime multiplayer

i m aware of the differences in general the facts like B is more accurate while B is more fast

i am using B because it is much faster than B but sometimes i need the know for sure if the packet reached to the other side in my program i can not use B at all so i am sending ack packets

you can use B as well but if you are dealing with firewalls it is probably going to be simpler with B

c++ is not my first language and this is small part of code i can t figure out i ve chosen B because it is always much simpler than B

if you care a lot about efficiency or really need tens of thousands of connections then implementing your specific protocol in B will always be better than B

what i have thought of so far is that B is going to be more reliable than B and in rmi corba we want network reliability

the key question was related to what kind of situations would B be the better choice over B

i did some research and found that B may be more suitable in this case because B hole punching works much better than B hole punching

maybe one of you guys already sees a problem in the code snippets or have any other suggestion or hint for me why my B transmission is slower than B

as an additional note my suspicion is that you d need to indulge yourself in some pretty sophisticated benchmarks before you could conclude that B is actually going to have higher performance than B for web services

ever since i did sockets programming on a pdp 11 it s been the case that ip fragmentation will take care of the case where an ip datagram such as a B datagram is larger than the B for the segment allows

i am working on B socket programming and i have to stop the transmission in application if requested data is more than B value

and also don t forget - B much more customizable than B

you are right that using B is probably better to use for something like this or even an existing protocol like B

almost all B B providers allow you to forward calls from an attached did telephone number to more than one B device so your request could be satisfied by a basic account on your friendly neighbourhood B provider

since B proxy is in theory nothing more than a B tunnel i thought i could give that property another try
