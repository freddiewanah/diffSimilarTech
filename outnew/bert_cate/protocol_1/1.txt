you can also use B it is a lot simpler than B

what happen when B is disabled in an router and when packet size greater than B how the router fragments that packet

any device in the path of communication between the sender and receiver whose B is smaller than the packet will drop such packets and reply the sender with B destination unreachable datagram too big message containing the device s B

B is a more efficient protocol than B

in fact with optimizations like B you might find that a tls-secured connection actually performs better than plain B

as i understand websockets are on top of B and have higher latency than B that underlies webrtc when for example sending binary data between server and browser that also could be 2 peers in webrtc

note that B is more difficult to work with than B because packets are not always guaranteed to be delivered

B is far better at transferring large quantities of data but when the network fails it s more likely that B will get through

the fact that B s header size is less than B s is because is a simpler protocol that needs less header space that s all there is to it

B gives smaller latency with many many issues to discuss here of course B gives bigger latency

also remember that dns requests can use B if the request or response would need more than 1 B packet

+ consider that the implementation of B stack is much more complicated than B more instructions are executed there

B is much slower than B but when the two machines are not on the same lan B is not reliable

but with the B protocol in particular this is easier than for B

B scales better than B because of reduced states that need to be maintained in the operating system

in practice this means that B is better suited for continuous transmission of data whereas the more lightweight B can be used when reliability isn t important

like matzi suggested B gives you lower latency and lower packet overhead as the header is smaller than B but on the downside the delivery of the packet to the destination is never guaranteed ie

if the network between the two point have a very high quality B is absolutely faster than B but in some other case such as the gprs network B may been faster and more reliability than B

B is a slower more reliable protocol than B is

B is faster than B because packets are sent without guarantee of delivery nor order

why the header size of B is less than B

B communication requires much less overhead than B due to the number of messages exchanged

in general the B protocol manages the available network bandwidth better than the B protocol

B is actually expected to work better than B in lossy networks or congested networks

in a congested network yes B will send its packets faster than B this is because B takes then congestion into account using a mechanism called congestion control

is sending packets via an established B connection after all hand shaking has been done a method to be faster than B

apart from that B packets by themselves are not slower than B packets and data transfer with a simple B connection can be faster than with a simple B connection because flow control and reliable transfer is already integrated and you don t have to reinvent everything again and often worse

only when packets can be discarded unordered can B be faster than B

one can say B has a lower overhead than B because its packets have a smaller header and therefore take less bandwidth to send the payload the data

the reason B is faster than B is because there is no form of flow control or error correction

it is worth nothing that in a link where B and B are sharing the bandwidth B is better behaved than B in that it will try to limit itself to avoid congestion

also sending receiving data over B is much simpler than over B and it does not require any connections

the problem is that B creates bigger packages of data while B uses 8 kb of data blocks

B is slower assures data arrival B is faster data corruption may be possible

B is less reliable on a wide area network but in a closed environment of a vm talking to its host you can safely skip all the B reliability stuff

the problem with using B is obviously that it is a lot slower than B

getting much more information is needed in the packet header for connection less like B but why the header size of B is less than B

B sockets have much lower overhead than B because packets are not acknowledged by the recipient

B lends itself to real-time less latency than B

B is subject to higher latencies than B as it requires the client to send back packet confirmations

B is generally faster than B as it does not have to do the overhead checking of consistency that B must deal with

B ip is supposed to be more reliable than B ip see this comparison

as a general rule B is faster than B due to less protocol overhead

note that B is more difficult to work with than B because packets are not always guaranteed to be delivered

it is optimized for downloading larger files where the setup overhead is amortized over the size and number of downloads http is very light-weight you can communicate to an http server using B much easier than B especially before passive B and is designed around html -- the concept that in the course of your navigation you will be visiting many different servers and grabbing only a couple of files at a time from each

basically while sending B packets larger than B ip fragmentation can occur if it s supported on your platform but not all platforms support it

they are easily generated for B simply by making the datagram bigger than the B

B packets greater than the B size of the network that carries them will be automatically split up into multiple packets and then reassembled by the recipient

my lwip can send B packets to pc but my pc would fail to reassemble when the B packets are larger than B

if there is network congestion rate limiting or traffic profiling or if the B message size is larger than the B

if you send a B datagram larger than the B it will be fragmented

if B payload size is bigger than B size B will silently segment the packet

B uses datagrams chunks of data which are received whole on the other side unless the size is bigger than the B but that s a different story

in real life B packets size usually is equal or less than B size

when send a B datagram larger than the B size only the last fragment of the B datagram is putted out to the destination

to send large blocks of data via B you need to chop them up into pieces smaller than the B for the network segment across which you re transmitting them

an B packet has a header that is 20 bytes and is probably going to be slightly slower than B

B is more flexible than B an application can configure the level of security it needs
