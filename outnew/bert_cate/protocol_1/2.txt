in fact in some ways B is better than B

but since B is less secure than B why isn t it the other way around

i understand that B has better performance than B

in fact in some ways B is better than B

but since B is less secure than B why isn t it the other way around

i understand that B has better performance than B

B is not better than B in any way but it does something different

or is there any specific scenario where B is better than B

one often finds the argument that B is faster then B

this was surprising for me as it is well known fact that B performs better than B

does B always perform better than B

this is the reason why B is much faster than B

B is not always faster than B

don t think of it as B is faster and B is slower because that s just wrong

in doing so the tradefoff is that B becomes slower compared to B

B just has a smaller overhead than B but that comes at the cost of reliability

-- in which scenario configuration would i get B to perform better than B

i know B is a safer choice but let s assume i can only use B and i need to ensure i can send packets over at a high rate with no missing packets what should i do

B is much better than B in terms of reliability

i though that B was faster than B but do you think that B will be faster due to the congestion

i was expecting that B would be faster but B is on average two times faster than B

scenario where B is better than B

we propose to use B over B since B is faster than B

i suppose this is one of the reasons for the misconception that B is slower than B

B will almost always provide better performance than B at the cost of reliability

in that sense reliable B cannot be faster than B

B as you know B is faster than B even if B may miss some

i know B is faster than B for various reason

this was surprising for me as i expected B to perform better than B

there is a perception that B is faster than B but i think it depends on the situation - take a look at this discussion for some further discussion on speed reliability etc between B and B go down through all the high scored answers

i don t think you should make the assumption that B is faster than B

-- does B always perform better than B

yes i know B is better than B but right now i m stuck with B

yes i know B is better than B but right now i m stuck with B

what would happen if my B package is larger than B

in addition seeing B being slower than B doesn t necessarily mean B isn t deprioritized---it might mean bandwidth is insufficient to hit the limiting threshold
