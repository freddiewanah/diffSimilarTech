B is more of a handshake done with the server while B is the actual stream coming in once the handshake is done and you start streaming

in short as an authentication protocol B is far more secure out of the box is de-centralized and will put less load on your directory authentication servers than B will

for a low traffic site the huge tokens that B send across the network actually makes it slower than B

push log files to a central location B is faster than B the windows B command can be automated with -s scriptfile

for instance zeromq can leverage B multicast to run faster than any B protocol but the application programmer doesn t need to learn a new api

it may be that the kernel heuristics for servering B connections is more aggressive than for B sockets since B connections require more state and more continuous processing than do B sockets

use socket for B and datagram for B its a lot faster than B but less connection oriented

B is more popular in nat punching because provides much better results than B

B windowing is more expensive than raw B but if you use B to go faster and add a custom loss-recovery or seqno ack resend manager then that may slow you down again

http is an application layer protocol which could be encapsulated with a protocol that uses B providing arguably faster reliable communication than B

in gaming especially fpss B tends to be the chosen protocol because it s much less chatty than B

a heartbeat is by nature a connectionless contrivance so it goes that B connectionless is more relevant here than B connection-oriented

in a native application i would use B for the most data player position ... because it s way faster than B and it s uncritical when it is lost

B protocol is unreliable but much much faster than B which is most commonly used for communication

i was going through internet and so and understood that web sockets are encapsulations to B which by itself is slower than B ofcourse at the cost of reliability but i couldnt find much info if websockets or B would be ideal to implement such a server

B sockets- guaranteed delivery bigger payload than B cumbersome to setup for web based solutions

because of B requires connection and provides security it is slower than B and therefore it should not be preffered during a video streaming

you could get them to do a B multicast within a lan environment to identify the programs using protocol messages then have a stored cache of each other s identity and then use B to connect and do main exchanging of messages which is more reliable than B

for example B has much more flags window-length syn ack etc - and also starts and ends a connection in a very stable way - the three way handshake - while all B has is source ip dest ip length source port dest port and checksum

B is simpler protocol than B and you can still simulate features of B using B

for this particular application sending simple data chunk to the client from an index given by the client B will not perform any better than B

the decision on yours the B protocol used for connection oriented network that is more secure than B

i used iperf on two linux machines to send data using both B and B i found that B performs better than B average 65 better

for example i read an experiment in which a stream of 300 byte packets was being sent over ethernet 1500 byte mtu and B was 50 faster than B

B is extremely faster than B which is suitable to stream a user s voice input

if they are connected over the internet you could try to use the examples for B but B has more overhead than B

but when i used iperf on two linux machines to send data using both B and B i found that B performs better than B for 10mb of data

as far as B goes i think B is more generally used protocol for more data-centric requests like chat or things that require packet integrity B tolerates packet loss to lower latency

i read in a case where a stream of 300 byte packets was being sent over ethernet 1500 byte mtu and B was 50 faster than B

B streaming for audio can be less helpful than B rtp as you d have to turn off nagling

at my company we have found memory mapped files to be much faster than loopback B ip for communication on the same box so i m assuming it would be faster than B too

B packets are easier structured than B packets but sacrifice security for their size

the strange thing is that when streaming is done via rtsp unicast B generates both sender reports and receiver reports but when streaming is done via B multicast only sender reports are generated

B protocol is more complex than http or B form example

ideally your B frames are smaller than the B for your architecture say 1500 bytes so the messages won t get chopped up in transit

note that B packets bigger than the B s at every hope between your hosts will be split by ip

now if you re intending to use a remote filesystem with ofs which is the primary use-case you have to first install the relevant remote filesystem packages on the os you re using then use for example if we ve got B which is the newer name for B samba

in fact B especially the ttl excceeding message has even less limitations than B on nats for the error message can be sent from every corner of the internet and routers with nat cannot be aware that these messages are not the true ones

regardless the B protocol is more simplistic in nature can handle orders of magnitude more client connections than B for the same memory utilization uses less bandwidth on the wire doesn t require authentication although you can add this feature etc

if you are using linux check out netdiscover this uses B i think B is lower level than B udp and with java you can only create apps from B udp and above

you could always use B that will work both on http and B websites but loading a B resource is slower than loading a http resource because of the encryption and B handshakes

there is a limitation on creating virtual hosts for name based virtual host while using B 443 port so if you want to have more than one B port enabled you will need ip based virtual hosting
