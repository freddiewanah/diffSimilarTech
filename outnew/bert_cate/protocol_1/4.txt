B 2 is even better than B and check this article for a use case regarding B

anything that you do with B is more or less equivalent with B and neither is really anything but an implementation detail of your soa work

B 2 is even better than B and check this article for a use case regarding B

anything that you do with B is more or less equivalent with B and neither is really anything but an implementation detail of your soa work

how B is better then B

btw i concur that B is far more appropriate than B in this case

B socket is even more likely than B socket but both work

but it sounds like you want to do nat traversal over B which is a harder problem than B

i am confused why B throughput is bigger than B

as such traversing a nat through B is much easier than B

that among other things is why B is considered more reliable but slower than B

B should be much faster than B because there are no acknowledge and congestion detection

with B its slightly slower than B and has more features

4 B is a slower than B

in some applications B is faster better throughput than B

also see this other so answer about the misconception that B is always faster than B

the package is bigger than B s package but smaller than B s package

it was introduced since the nat traversal for B is much more complicated than B

B has a much lower overhead than B

alternatively it can be used over B which is less hungry than B

B is faster and requires less bandwidth than B

yes B is much much lighter than B

B is much faster then B but B has flow control and guaranteed delivery

B is connection less but at the same level as B

what is that key feature in B that makes it have much much higher throughput than B

B has less overhead than B and is therefore faster

keep in mind that implementing B traversal is easier than B

B is a bit slower than B but more failsafe

B is significantly faster than B and is why it is or was used for video and various things back in the day

for some requirements B is better for some B

B is way lighter and faster but somewhat less reliable than B

certainly B has more overhead than B

moreover B has more processing overhead than B

B is way better then B for that

because there is no confirmation on B packets it s slightly faster than B

and there are no handshakings required B are pretty much faster but less reliable than B

B port scanning is possible but it is harder than B scanning

a B stack is considerably simpler than a B stack

in my experience B based code is generally less complex than B based code

it seems like B will more efficient than B

try to increase timeout value B is slower than B

if you can do everything with B it is lighter than B

if you were attempting to beat the performance of B by shifting to B keep in mind that part of the reason you get lower performance with B is because B tracks and redelivers the lost packets for you

B is more general than B and is generally used for command and control

it would appear from your question that the period of the B message is shorter than the B refresh time
