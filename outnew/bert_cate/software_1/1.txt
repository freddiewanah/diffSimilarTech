in my experience i ve found that B seems to be faster than B although i don t have any hard data to back it up

i really miss this feature on B because i find B to be bloated and it slows the host system down much more than B does

even though B has been faster for me i still use B because it s good enough and is free and im cheap

i think that s why i can t use to launch my project this way works but B way is better because everything including the main_class is described in B

i mostly work with esri software though i ve had a little bit of work with B mostly for clients whose engineering departments are using cad more than B

i ve found that B was slightly faster than B non B image but i still use B the majority of the time because i like using the host os for things like mail chat browsing

that being said i find B much more complete than B like all those recent blog posts illustrate
