i would not mind changing to for example B or B if needed i am a bit afraid of B to be honest everything i read about B seems 10x more technical than anything i read about mercurial or B and installing it on windows seems to imply installing all sorts of secondary software it seems but that is another matter

i hear all this stuff about B being slower than B

it works fine and fits all my needs but recently i found that B works better than B so i decided to use it but i face a problem with B usability because most B s gui not user friendly as B explorer so i want your advice based on a practical experience which best B s gui user friendly or which one is most similar to B explorer

the authors of B are trying to create a better B than B

we found B to be a better than B simply because it is easier to use

i wound up going with B and it s way better than B

B was written to be a better B than B

we ve recently switched from B to B where i work and i think i like it a little more than B and use the wiki functionality almost everyday

B is better than B

B was supposed to be better than B but in some areas that didn t work well

i can only guess at the reasons and i don t worry much about the occasional downvote but perhaps some readers think i m advocating B as a better system than B or git

in addition another coworker said B was a lot more popular than B

that being said i think B is better in every other respect and you probably shouldn t start a new project with B
