make sure you re using a source control system that supports branching and merging i ve had experience with B and B and while B is better B is free

B does have support for many other oses but our non-windows devs feel more comfortable with B too

B is easier to extend in an api way B is easier to extend in a unix way pipes

B is an open source ruby on rails application that supports multiple projects much better than B and seems to be much easier to administer

the problem is that windows B is slower than typical linux B for these lookups

generally the performance of hard B like B is better than that of traditional unix B
