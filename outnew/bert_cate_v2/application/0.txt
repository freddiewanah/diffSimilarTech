if you would like a unified front-end for B and opentsdb you could consider grafana which has support for both B and opentsdb but less functionality than B in regard to B

B is more of visualization only while B is for searching the logs is that right

B focuses more on logs and adhoc search while B focuses more on creating dashboards for visualizing time series data

for load testing B is better option but you have quite enough funding then go for loadrunner B rational performance tester and for cloud try blazemeter

imo B is better than admob especially when using their B ads

we found B to be a better than B simply because it is easier to use

nobody has ever accused git of being easy-to-use no B for example although i hear it s coming so you might be better off with B beanstalk
