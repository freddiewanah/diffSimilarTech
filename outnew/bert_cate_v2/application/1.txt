research showed me that B is simpler to use over B so i decided to use B but have no idea how to install it.can anyone please tell me what are the steps you need to take in order to install B bug tracking system in a small company to track website mobile portal bugs

i ve read that B contains less project management tools than B

i understand B is more of a B clone but retrospectiva seem to support agile methodologies via a nice plugin

i wound up going with B and it s way better than B

B is an open source ruby on rails application that supports multiple projects much better than B and seems to be much easier to administer
