i have been trying out B to see if i like it better than B

i have found B to be more reliable than B or loadui

i think you ll find that your team will like either trac or B more than B or mantis

we ve recently switched from B to B where i work and i think i like it a little more than B and use the wiki functionality almost everyday

B handles multiple projects and sub-projects right out of the box and overall seems nicer than B

the compare dialog of B is more about file and with git you have to compare two master branches not just two commits of the same branches both pointing to the same B central repo

B s issue Bking is little better than B s...i know a lot of folks love B but i find it very inflexible
