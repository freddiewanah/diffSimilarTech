for comparison 0.68 usage means this outdated B release is more popular than the current and previous versions of B the penultimate version of safari on ios and ie 9 or 10

since you noted thoughts on other browsers would be helpful B s kiosk mode seems more powerful than B s

of late B has had much better performance than B

is it because B has much better javascript support than B

B is more flexible in this sense than B which is why it works there

i have tried B and it better than B crash issue is not always happen but not solved this issue

B is a bit more strict than B here

on stable versions of B the permissions show allow and it still won t connect even with B works older versions of B work

i have just noticed a site i am working on looks different in B than other browsers saf B everything is more saturated in B even a background-color rgb

install firebug B version is better then a B one

the reason B is slower than B is that the devmode plugin runs in a sandbox so calls and data have to cross the sandbox boundaries

in B it takes some more time compared to B safari

B is easier and better than B in finding the element from the webpage

you can see if you look at the bottom and right hand edges of both B lines up perfectly but B seems further in both directions and i cannot work out why either in firebug or B dev tools

B text is 1px lower than in B and ie

the idea is that if they are using ie then they must install B frame and if they are using less than B 4 or opera 11.5 then they must upgrade their browser not not sure if the way i am doing that is correct

open up the fiddle in both B B to see what i m talking about - in B the positioning of the background image is much lower than in B safari

also it does appear that B consistently handles this better than ie or B

suffice to say ie and B start having problems at larger heights than does B

on linux B displays text about one pixel higher than B and opera

although B is a better browser for developers than B cause it gives you more tools to work with

for example if you have a text size of 15px well B makes a larger 15px than B does

i m trying to add a ribbon to a page using css3 linear-gradients but the rendering in B looks a lot less pleasant than its B or ie alternative

so why is B less efficient than B and ie

btw B is less close to w3c specs than B de 42+ i d opt to start using B for your initial testing and then test it in ch to detect quirks

the B apis are currently experimental hence these tools are likely to be better developed under B

also about B i know still less than B and i m not sure about how it innerly manage resources among threads and if it is even possible to achieve what i want but if possible i d need to do the same work with B threads

i ve found that B is greatly faster with imacros than B

when i posted this on facebook someone said that since B is open source project developers optimized math.min but B didn t since B is just a modification of chromium but beside that above statement is not quite right that makes no sense because that doesn t explain the reason why B s and B s math.min a b performs in similar speed and B s math.min a b and B s performs in same speed because if B is faster than B then B s math.min a b should be much slower than B s

B is more tolerant when it comes to image headers then ie and B

B is stricter than B when it comes to loading data from your local filesystem

by highlighting the shape of the two elements you can see that in B left the button is 2px taller than in B right

B has like 40px less width than B in columns which is causing problems

it s not the first time that the plugin for B works better for me than the one for B

on B it s significantly faster to do this using 1 0 but on B it s slightly faster to do this using bool

ps i ve noticed that in B situation is better than in B but new line still starts beneath tag

the reason this is happening is because B renders the select box as a taller element than B and the container of the blue text is getting caught on the select s container element because it s now sticking out lower than the others

B is more picky about characters that are set in uris than B

as you said B is faster than B so the webdriver is trying to interact with the dom before when elements are not yet visible exist

B works a bit better than B but the settimeout just seems to delay the final result being shown rather than delaying each step

what B displays is about 5 inches higher than what B displays

B - good a bit slower than B

if B seems to finish earlier than B then that is the freezing glitch in action

svg performance in B is slower than in webkit B and ie10

bad buffering can also be a result of a slow computer because statistics show that B is better for a normal-fast computer and B works best on slow computers

i ve found that the font-size in B is a bit larger than in B

B takes almost 3 times longer than B

in B this might be handled a little nicer than B but rather than completely redraw an element you should try to append only what you need

i think B renders the moves better than B

this seems to me like a bandwidth error or something like that originally i ve got the error when i played with the html 5 audio api and if i loaded the audio file 10-15 times sequentially then i ve got the error but now i ve discovered that i get the error without the audio api too just by reloading the site a lots of times also B gives me the error much faster than B wtf

B renders open sans bolder than in B so you would need to apply a lighter font weight for B open sans google web fonts rendering in B

i planned on using svgs for the entire site but with only 20-30 svg images of medium to high complexity used in the page and google-chrome already seems to be showing som jank and high paint times for scroll and B is even worse though B seems to do a lot better

so to specify B greater than 20 B greater than 9.1 and ie greater than 9

that i gave to every link in the set of links home about us products contact and it seems that B is making that 1px margin much bigger than B or google-chrome and distorting it

small in B is smaller then small in B so never ever use them

i saw that the discrepancy was because in B the text element is taller than in B and includes a slight amount of whitespace on top that doesn t show up in B in B the top of the text element is exactly when the text starts
