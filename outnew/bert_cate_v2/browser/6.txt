on my computer B performs much better than B on these tests using jsperf

what s up with B that the debugger behaves less conveniently than B

i suspect that this may be the case because ie and B need to know about the content of the div earlier than B

B is clearly less secured it deliberately allows something that B locks down

as you can see ie 8 is about 5 times slower than B 3.6 and almost 20 times slower than B 9 at least when using sunspider tests

the logs only seem to work with a B browser which is a laugh as usually B is better at running google apps than B

i have been trying to do this in B webextensions but if it s easier with B i will try it that way instead.

i guess B is smarter about me being careless than B is

found that the issue stemmed from using the B webdriver which apparently has much higher security than its B counterpart

i found programming B extensions easier than B but i couldn t come across something similar to xpcom in B

B can get away with more than B before aborting

font-face bold in B is bolder than in B

here is a simple performance test showing that in B filling is faster than clearing i am not sure what goes on with B and canvas nowadays but in B clearing is many times faster than filling both significantly faster than B

why height in B is bigger than B of input

i ve tested the sample on B and it s a bit slower than B but usable

rendering without buffering on B is faster than B so i m actually not sure why B is having such a problem with drawimage

the problem with this code is that it doesn t quite work on B and works even worse on B

B just provides far more access to its own internals and system to the extensions so its technically possible to do more with them than with B widgets or google-chrome extensions

but if firebug donâ t enabled after launch B â time equal 2ms that faster than B and google-chrome and difference between empty filled array disappears

only B and B seem to have this issue B even worse than B but i don t care that much about B

B also uses an earlier version of webkit than the current B so pages should be checked in both browsers

B will display fonts without a specified size significantly smaller than in B

the one used by B and is slower than mobile B s nitro javascript engine

works in google-chrome firefox a bit weirdish blur effect on hover B ends look smaller B ends look smaller

B is just better for web development and i prefer B overall
