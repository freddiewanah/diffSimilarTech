especially in B there is much more green in the painting than in B

i built a site and the problem is B display font-size 1px bigger than B

B is probably easier than B these days

B has a bigger time difference yet B is the one with the gap in the animation

B s parsing may be more strict than B is at having things like trailing commas as specified by the standard at as stated in danilo celic s answer

B extensions are considerably more limited than B extensions â â they can only hook the behavior of the browser in certain predefined ways

in B it s less noticeable but in B it s very noticeable

i m taking a quite educated guess here that B is more forgiving with the irregular syntax than B

in my experience B has better javascript performance than B

also for animations B chromium behaves much better that is why i use it for development but do my general browsing in B

B is lightning fast when you use the dom api but vastly slower using the .innerhtml operator by a magnitude 1000-fold slower however B is worse than B in some areas for instance the append test is much slower than B but the innerhtml test runs much faster than B

most likely your post value has one or more characters in it that are breaking the html of the page and ie B are being a bit more forgiving than B is

use B network in development tools and check your requests sometimes it just sends options request in cross origin i insist on B because it s network tool is much more detailed than B and safari

here the working header request with B bigger than B request

i ve learned partly by trawling this site that the B security is fussier and the app loads correctly without errors in B and ie but i can t find any resources that are loaded from a non https source

while the rest of the browsers report the correct width of the document B reports a smaller one example at screen resolution of 1920x1080 ie B and safari reports 1920 while B reports 1903

though from a design perspective it may be easier to simply add the extra 5px to the width designing for the worst case browser to prevent wrapping in B which is worse than extra space in B ie

support exists in B and my test just confirmed thisâ but the handle is a little less noticeable than in B

now when clicking a time less than 1 millisecond will be displayed however it obviously takes nearly a second on my computer until the changed color actually is displayed where btw. B seems to be faster than B

B is slower than B in javascript

update under linux gentoo amd64 it s the same - B reneders slightly larger fonts than B but nothing that looks odd
