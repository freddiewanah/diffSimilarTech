i m not sure B is still better then B

B is more effective than B and B is needed anyhow but this will work also if you want to do multiples people then just for-loop it and dont forget to close

B should also be more efficient than B

B has smaller default internal margins than B

update i ve created a webhelper class that takes the place of B but provides more access to the necessary features of the underlying B

B is sometimes easier to use than B

B is simpler to use than B

is B better than B in terms of performance

this is better than using a second view a bit larger as a B is lighter than a B and you don t have do modify the frame of myview which is good for instance if myview is a uiimageview

i think the problem happened because the padding left right of B is bigger than B

the B is nothing more than a uiview with one or more B and background and selector views

B is newer than B if you are using swift language then you can use your own custom methods by using B or you can use alamofire

i don t see any reason why B could be any faster than B in this case

B is faster than B

i ve used B in the past and found it a lot better than B
