construct B is comparative slower than B

B consumes lesser battery power than B or thread

so if using B B is more limiting than B basic_B

B is more low level than B

B is much more complex under the hood than B

the B has a more stringent constraint on a property content blank false than the B content nullable true and i am using tableperhierarchy false

so i inspected the compiled firebasemessagingservice which was the B of com.google.firebase.iid.zzb and had zzae intent method as private but its B firebasemessagingservice had protected access i know that B cannot have weaker reference than its B so i guess there is something wrong with firebasemessagingservice library

so simply B is better option then B

B also provides nicer interfaces for requesting data using blocks in that it allows you to combine them with delegate methods for doing custom authentication handling redirect handling etc. whereas with B if you suddenly realized you needed to do those things you had to refactor your code to not use block-based callbacks

posting here an example showing how to implement same approach but now applied to B which a bit more involved than B

B is a much more pleasant api than B
