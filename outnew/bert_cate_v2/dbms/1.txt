i found that B is too slow at least much slower than B even on relatively small 150k datasets when searching records by text pattern despite the presence of indices

the number of requests B could serve is consistently 3 to 5 times lower than B

it seems B is more forgiving with this than B but in every case you use a reserved word you should escape it

B run 4x faster than B

B is far more powerful and scalable and doesn t have B s silly limitations and gotchas

generally speaking i find B lends itself to 24 7 operations better than B

i had mentioned that in our rails application all select queries dropped below 100ms after switching to B whereas some of the complex joins generated by activerecord would occasionally take as much as 15s or more with B 5.1 because of nested loops with inner table scans even when indices were available

B with the optional hstore module might be better than B at this.

what i am hearing from our group leader is that B is better than B when working with coordinates

B is more widely supported and a little easier to use but B has some very cool features and functionality that s worth taking a gander at

fyi B scales better than B on multi-processor overlapping requests from a review i was reading a few months back sorry no link

drupal 7 B 5.0.15 or higher with pdo B 8.3 or higher

B will always be a little bit more mature than B

following the first answer it appears that B is more compliant to sql standard than B so it needs a group by clause for each selected column you want to display with your aggregated function

it s a shame B isn t more popular than B since it supports exactly this feature out-of-the-box you d only have to share one sequence object between tables.

does that mean perhaps rails team favor B slightly more than B

some say B is much better for bigger projects while others think just go with B

B supports some more security features than B for example integration with gssapi or kerberos for logins last i checked B didn t have these

there is also B its a bit more robust than B and is free just the same

if you need spatial data capabilities postgis with B is better than B

the other question is that what i am hearing from our group leader is that B is better than B when working with coordinates

in fact this presentation which still refers to an older incomplete version of B s opengis support suggests that with proper indexing some B geospatial actions may actually perform better than B postgis though i m sure that s up for debate

does this affect B harder than B

i would recommend B for a beginner as it has far fewer surprises than B

B is more sql compliant than B

B is stricter to the sql standard than B is

according to my own experience B run much faster than B especially handling big tables 1.4 gb lineitem table in my case

not only does B have a far more flexible indexing than B but the table approaches are very different also meaning the appropriate indexing strategies are as different as the tactics are

given B s reputation for doing things better than B or at least as good as i daresay that B would demonstrate similar performance if properly used
