for these ultra simple queries B can be slower than B - B has richer planner that works better on more complex queries but on trivial queries is slower

i ve found that B is in my expirience is slower as B

is B a better option than B for partitioning tables by date

in most regards B is slower than B especially when it comes to fine tuning in the end

B is already slower than B up to a certain point it is actually faster when you have a ridiculously large database

B requires more tuning than B to achieve optimal performance

either B more proven than B for such huge data

with correct locking for safety reasons and heavy concurrent use B performed better than B

then B is much better than B

in your case B may be a better option than B because your query is going to likely be against secondary indexes

i feel B is much more mature and robust than B

may be B takes less time than B

i cannot propose any db not knowing your specific needs but if you want to use a free software which excludes oracle and you re not already experienced with B you should try B which is more powerful than B

from how i understand it B is a more correct database implementation while B is less correct less compliant but faster

i d also recommend B over B if you are going to have nested comments as B does hierarchical querying better than B

all that said B is much more acid compliant than B it handles fks just as you re needing and i would generally recommend it based on what you ve expressed in your post

ps you can also migrate to B it s smarter than B when choosing right indexes

B is probably more often offered by shared hosting providers B is probably a little more powerful

B specifically has gotten easier to manage while B has lost some of the simplicity that gave it an advantage without picking up enough features that really matter

B is faster than B s innodb

i hear B is more robust and doesn t crash like B does in these situations

in my cases B was better than B B do not completely support unicode

if you want to use sql i strongly reccommend B it seems to deal with large databases and frequent writes a lot better than B

B is also a lot better imo than B and is the recommended database to use with django according to a lot of the people close to django

B is easier than B but it doesn t really matter either way
