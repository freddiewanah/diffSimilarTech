B is much more similar to oracle than B is

B is a bit more restrictive than B

unfortunately in B select count is often slower than B to which it often get s compared to

for example pyqt is already available for python 3 as well as 2 and you can use B a splendid open-source sql database engine much more standard than B via py-B

B is more permissive and allows the non-standard use of distinct but B throws an error

B supports recursive queries in the form of recursive common table expressions which make querying heirarchical data easier than in B and also give better performance

since B is a lot more sane than B there are not that many tricks to report on

in other words is B better or worse than B to handle unicode etc

B has better support but the support by B depends on the used storage engine

though B is more popular than B but instagram is using B maybe due to these reasons

if you want open source B is much smarter than B as well

i am using B btw which can do more than B incase that changes things

i d have said that B is more security aware than B supporting roles more authentication methods ... but that the database itself has generally a very limited impact on the security of an application

i really like B s indexes which are far better than B s

this is ancedotal but the B servers i ve managed have always been much less troublesome than B which likes to randomly crash once in a while occasionally corrupting a table on the way down

anyways B is bad and on longterm especially if you are enough good for java i suggest you to use some better db with B you were really satisfied i think

B is much better suited for data warehousing compared to B

and a wiki for why B is better than B

B is worth learning and much more advanced than B

the only reason i was considering B was that some research suggested B has much better support for changing schemas along the way than B

the query optimizer in B is more advanced than in B and copes with complicated statements much better especially when it comes to sub-selects

this is a weak point that iirc B can handle better but with B you have to work around that by reverting the changes yourself in case of rollbacks

honestly though B scales much better than B

B is a little more strict than B about type conversion and does not let you implicitly cast convert between numbers and strings
