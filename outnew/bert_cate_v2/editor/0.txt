you can customize B and i think you will like it better than B

this is the one thing i think B does better than B

B is a better B for macs though that won t help you with solaris

on windows machine i would probably go with B personally i now use programmers B 2 however it does not support a spell checker and i don t really thinks it s better than B by any measure

that said modifier keys are important in B even if less than in B

in B it s much more difficult to run a subprocess than it is in B so in B you need to have a separate running idris repl

for example B s macro shortcut f3 and f4 is easier than B s qq and q

there are definitely some advantages using external editors however B is ten million times better than B

i ve used B for 10+ years but never really into B scripting always subjectively beliving that this was one area where B was weaker than B

i have found that B has better plugins for providing some of the more ide-oriented capabilities but like boltclock said B is really just a powerful text editor and does not try to be a one-stop-shop ide

B which is often recommended are even more broken than B 2 which i find to be pretty good actually

it looks like B is slower than B

i know B does that but B is a more complete tool than B so i cant switch to that

if you are on linux eg ubuntu you may try B for ease of use with some plug-ins but to handle very large files you re better off with B

i have B 8 as well as B cs3 on my windows pc but i m more familiar with B
