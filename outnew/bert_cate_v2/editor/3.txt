personally i m using B right now which i find easier than B for searching and navigating the code but everyone has their taste

in studio 3 much of this sort of functionality is still coming as B is going more of a B bundle route for a great deal of their features which i think is really cool

B is more powerful and B is worth the price tag

B has better performance than B
