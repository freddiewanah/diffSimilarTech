the third line displays the data with the maximum useful precision - an B 754 64bit floating-point number has slightly less than 16 B digits of precision so all those digits of the literal in math.h are pointless perhaps they can be seen as future-proofing against a possible future redefinition in a format with more precision

B has a stronger syntax than html and is easier to convert to B this way

in addition the need for polyfills for B complicates matters further as they may handle the interaction differently as can be seen in the sample below when using the button to load B

my understanding is B is pretty good smaller than B

i have been told B is faster on executing writes but slower than B doing reads i cannot back this up and could not find any article that analyses this i do however have the guy that told me this in high regard feel free to ignore this point or do your own research

put another way let s say i start with a new B table and insert 20 gb of data assuming that 20 gb incorporates all the excess B stuff i realize data stored in B is larger than B then i delete all data then i insert 10 gb of data

therefore accessing B consumes less resources than B

B is more resistant to table corruption than B

B has better crash recovery while B is poor at recovering data integrity at system crashes

B is a better choice as B is really old engine and would fade away in near future

you are right because B is really faster than B

B would be a better choice than B for a high-write table

B provides more complex keys structure than B foreign keys and regenerating keys is really slow in B

there are several q a for why is B much slower than B but i could not find any topic for the opposite

at the beginning the insert performance of B is almost 50 times slower than B and tokudb is 40 times slower than B

B when tuned well performs better than B

this is a huge performance boost look like B is much more quicker for fulltext in mysql than B

B supports longer rows than B does

1 in mysql engines B is better or B

in many discussions and even in mysql documents it has been mentioned that in case of updates B performs much better than B

B has more overhead but uses row-level locking so that reads and writes can happen concurrently without the problems that B s table locking incurs

plus you have to make your tables B which is generally less suitable than B

if you find that B is much slower for inserts updates bear in mind that it offers a much better level of durability - if you tune it for approximately the same durability as B then you ll see good performance hopefully

B is usually much better than B at tables being available while insert update and delete are happening because B uses row level locking for updates whereas B uses table level locking

i heard B is faster but others say B can be fast also but it takes abit more to optimize it

why is B so much slower than B in my case

nothing is 100 safe but B properly used is a lot safer than B against data loss and corruption

in fact oracle is so sure that B is better that they removed B from 8.0

edit for the read-performance this link shows that B often is actually not slower than B

B doesnt read number of rows from stored cached value like B does if column is not null cause B is more optimized for writing than reading opposing to B

it is possible that the config of your B engine is more efficient for your searches than the way you have B set up

B delivers better read performance compared to B at the cost of being less acid compliant

during my tests of B v B i found that when i did resolve any contention issues the B model was 40 slower than B

out of experience i m involved to a project that uses huge amount of data using mysql and we mostly prefer B for data that can be generated it allows to achieve much higher performance losing transactions but generally speaking B is faster but B is more reliable

since you don t do updates i think B would be better than B in this scenario

almost always B is a better choice than B

i currently have B and i would like to stay with it because it had far better performance than B in my case but i heard that B has acid transactions

B seems slightly faster than B but this is really marginal

B not only has the advantages you list but it is also faster than B in many benchmarks

B is relatively newer than B and is transaction safe

but B has improved dramatically in the past few years and in most cases today B performs faster than B

B is often faster than B but isn t safe to use in a production environment for critical data

therefore B can handle higher levels of concurrency better than B

B is harder to tune since it has more knobs but a properly tuned B system can often have higher throughput than B due to better locking and better i o patterns

B -- more effecient than B because of the way the primary key is clustered with the data in B

B is better for high read volumes B for high update volumes due to table vs row locking

the engine is B i ve heard people recommend switching to B but many others said B is faster with large amounts of data in terms of counting and B better for safe transactions

note however that for high traffic websites we do modify the joomla core and we also switch the tables from B to B regardless what others might think here B is much faster than B

i am not sure if this is no longer true B is faster than B for reads

B does support transactions and referential integrity but the trade-off is that it is a bit slower than B

probably you can take a look at B template engine which is much faster than B and velocity also much easier to use

B has a cleaner api lower system requirements and works better across platforms than B in my opinion
