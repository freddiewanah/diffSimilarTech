B is a strong typed java template engine using razor like syntax with high performance 2 to 3 times faster than B and fm

anyway i just prefer not to use it because B is slower then B

B table is a bit slower than B tables but i don t think it is a major problem as you told you are using drupal system is that a kind of mult-sites like a word-press system

there is a difference between the different storage engines though B is faster for a lot of select B is faster for a lot of insert update because it uses row locking instead of table locking and the way it handles indexes

you can also use compression on the tables to keep them smaller but B is vastly better than B at data integrity

also B is slower than B unless B is blocking for a huge select

now the response i got from my boss is that i need to prove that B will run faster than B

3 mysqlhotcopy inly works on B tables and in most applications you are better off with B

i am creating an commerce website and i am stuck in a database problem i am storing customer orders please tell me which is better B or B i have to use transaction like feature in customer order table and i personally prefer B because it is much faster than B and it also supports full-text searching is there any way to use transaction like rollback feature in B so that if anything goes wrong table will be rollback to its previous state how to do that without any external library or any other server side access and i have to use mysql

if you are not using transactions while storing or updating tables switch table type to B its quite faster than B with much less overhead

3 a first of all if you haven t done yet change the storage engine to B which has row level locking and in newer versions of mysql has more optimization than B has

also mysql version starting from 5.5 - B performs faster than B

B is newer while B is older

B is more susceptible to data corruption than B and usually B performs better because it caches both data and indexes

B has better performance than B though B needs more attention to tuning the configuration B supports atomic changes transactions foreign keys and B is much more resistant to corrupting data in a crash

the trope about B being faster than B is a holdover from code that was current in the mid-2000 s

B also tends to store data in less space than B

so that means that in practice an B write will take 3 times longer than a B write

this is one way in which B is sometimes better than B

it is a massive over simplification in some cases and plain wrong in others to say we know that B is faster than B

i heard correct me if i am wrong that B is better for tables that will be updated a lot because of row locking opposed to B s table locking

database performance of the B is not necessary faster than the B engine

B consumes more disk space than B -- typically 2x-3x

B is faster than B for reads myth

B uses less memory than B and the actual data files are often quite a bit larger for B

use B usually much faster than B if your data base isnt transaction oriented

B is more scalable and B doesn t support any of the properties of acid

B handles inserts with composite primary keys quicker than B

B tables are about 4x bigger than their B counterparts

after testing it seems that B is faster than B when using when there is no where clause

edited to add B is faster than B because it is simpler

B has proved to be faster than B for me

if you use B which i like better than B - although i still prefer self-restraint+plain php most ide s that support django templating should work with it since the syntax is nearly the same

B is no way better than B 3d or am not trying to prove that
