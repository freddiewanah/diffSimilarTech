from my personal use i experienced about 5 - 10 times less disk usage due to B s compression and it s much much faster than B or innodb

if you would like a unified front-end for B and opentsdb you could consider grafana which has support for both B and opentsdb but less functionality than B in regard to B

the benchmark shows B is 2 to 3 times faster than B on a normal page

B is a high performance 2 to 3 times faster than B pure java template which use razor like syntax

the maximum representable value with B 754-2008 binary32 is so the base 2 log of a number stored in binary 32 is less than B 128

if you are targeting android you can use firefox for android by developing a webapp that has native B support and because of it will be much faster than B or other javascript solution

it is working only for simple .php files but B is more complex and after long period of loading it show B nothing found site loaded

i m working in a spring mvc project and i want to use a template engine i originally choose apache B because a slideshare presentation that says it was two times faster than B page 41 and since i m working with big tables i need to use a fast template engine does apache B supports html5 if not is there other template engine that supports html5 that is not B

i m using the module B in my python script and many more such as B and numpy etc B module only works on python2 not for python3

B is stricter than B

B is often considered to consume less memory than B but this depends a lot on how the browser is implemented

so the easiest way is to use one either B or B B has probably better support for svg these days plus i can t find package of B right now

B is more complex while B is simpler

B tables are even slower than B tables for inserts and the delayed key write option is not available

the script was tested using B and it indexes products relatively fast much much faster than B

tuning B which is the better engine requires adjusting different values than B which is often the fast-but-unsafe default

generally B is much better for preserving your data integrity so stick with it and do not go back to B there is also a matter of what each engine is best fore but unless you give us more details there is no point in dwelling on that

in a thread i came to know that B is faster for reads B is faster for writes

but when B is really better than B

B is faster for certain queries and supports fulltext and spatial indexes while B is transactional and more concurrent

B is a safer acid compliant engine with some integrity features that B lacks

with B there is less time lost from table locking while B is faster in table readings

B is also being developed more than B

B uses row level locking while B can only use table level locking that is why B has crash revovery is better than B

anyone who thinks B is faster is either not tuning B correctly or has such small data that who cares

B generally performs faster because it lacks certain functions B has such as rollback... but it has only table locking

B is faster but does not support the use of transactions like B does

although 4m isn t that many rows with contention and depending on your structure and database engine it may take a while i think B alters take longer than B because B requires whole table locks and handles concurrency less well

B is much much stricter than B

some people have said that for reads B is faster but recent improvements in B have either alleviated or eradicated this difference

there may be some exotic corner cases where B performs marginally better for certain workloads table-scans or high-volume insert-only work but the default choice should be B unless you can prove you have a case that B does better

i know B tends to be a bit slower than B on counting but this is far too long

after all B shouldn t be slower than B when using count + where but that s exactly what is happening here

B is slightly faster than B and implements the fulltext index which is quite useful for integrating search capabilities

even this blog from 2007 shows benchmark results that B is on par with or faster than B under most workloads

B is actually better than B for spatial data btw because it also supports r-tree spatial indexes but not as powerful queries as postgis. if you just need points though B or B b-trees are adequate

select queries in B runs 2x faster then in B but the updates and insert queries are much slower in B

ok there are some cases where B is faster than B but rarely enough that it s worth putting up with the lack of acid-compliance

B is actually faster than B in quite a few cases so it depends on what your application s mix of selects updates concurrent queries indexes buffer configuration etc

also i can t see your table engine but B is better for full text searching rather than B

however B tends to be slower as B

in general is B faster than B

as you know B table sizes are about three or more times smaller than same B tables

B is faster when the query is simple but it s much slower in a high concurrent environment as its table level lock comparing to B s row level lock

2 - i have read about B vs B the conclusion for me was that B is faster when it comes to read-only whereas B is designed for tables that get updated or inserts more frequently

there are other optimizations available but general rule is that B will be quicker than B is even with table growth

i ve also noticed that B is significantly faster and more stable that the old B based widgets

so basically when B is more about how objects will behave themselves during application running the B is more about how you write your code before application running

B provides much better native whitespace handling recent B releases provide more interesting content controls #define #evaluate # literal block #

B is nicer templating tool and it was created by B and its designed to work cross language originally which can be forked from git - B

i use B on tables of up to 18 billion rows and nothing else comes close it s at least 100 times faster than B for random inserts on big tables
