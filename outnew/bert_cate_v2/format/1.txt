2 B seems a little better than B but not much

i suspect the computational demands of B decoding are probably considerably less than B and if dsp gets you excited taking the time to figure all this stuff out is 100 worth it even if the flash route possibly leads to disappointment

B is smaller than B

i ve heard that B decompression requires much more memory than B decompression

one reason to use B it is sooooo much better than B

many people don t know about 8-bit B which is usually better than B in size.

B gives you better alpha result than B

there might be some edge cases where B is slightly better because the B format may have a slightly larger overhead from metadata but it s really not worth the worry

wewtaco i noticed that your B file has wider dimension than the B file and i am guess that could be a reason the black bars are showing up

just press save and give it a name and that photoshop image will be saved into a transparent background B file which presents more colors and it s smaller than a B file and is as good as a jpg

i m not sure if this matters but the B is significantly larger than the B files

according to wikipedia the B format provides better compression than B

also if i change all to B is not bigger and alos i am using prawn pdf outputting these images so cant use B

moreover B vorbis is better then B at all bitrates

in general B achieves better compression than B which is a plus for things like download size bandwidth resource usage etc
