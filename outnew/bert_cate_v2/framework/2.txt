in my opinion it will probably be easier to integrate with B although someone more experienced with B might prove me wrong

B is considered slower than B but you can tweak it to enhance speed

i suspect B doesn t have quite as flexible a structure it s smaller and lighter than B but a quick look at the B manual to see how behaviors components helpers and the vendors folder may be helpful

it s very heavyweight and not fully featured for forms so prism or B works better as these are designed for forms from the ground up but if you do use B for forms its easy to go native if you need

you can do it with B but works better in 32bit B framework

according to my experience B is easy to use but it has some pros and cons too every framework has but i used B on some projects and i think B is much more better than B

with B it is even easier since you just need to bind a property on your B to selecteditem

how can i connect a method and not a command with a binding from the B to an attached event to ask in a more general way with B micro

it should be mentioned that B provides many more features for smart stubs spies than B so both can be used together

i am currently looking at B and while its more complex than B the documentation is much more informative and therefore understandable than cakephp s

i know this can be achieved with B but in my experience it is easier with B

edit it seems B has more printed books as references compared to B on amazon

B is a web ui framework whereas B is a more general web application framework that integrates not just B but conversational contexts workflow jbpm and object persistance preferably ejb3

building restful services with B is much simpler than with B in my experience

you could argue that the B style is simpler and you can do it in B too it just isn t optimal but keeping the state only in the server has many advantages

if you actually need dao s this is something that comes out-of-the-box in B and put partly in B roo but there is also a great addon for B roo hades addon that does a great job at this maybe even better than B

but a friend told me to begin with B as it s simpler and will help me when i start learning B as B is more complicated than B

either will do the trick but bottle or in my preference B will be faster as it is much more lightweight than B

first its not a bad idea to use B to satisfy your requirement the uniqueness of node and added advantage compared to conventional technologies like apache-php is clearly explained in this following video why B is better .the notion of node being just used for advanced or complex applications is wrong you can use node for building applications which are very simple to anything of huge proportion.it would be a not so comfortable task for a node beginner to code without using any frameworks but by using this web application framework called B you need not code from scratch and its very easy to setup html pages using its simplified html templating language called jade and route requests also you can even use your html pages if you are not willing to use jade for rendering the views of your application .here are the series of tutorials which would help you tutorials on beginning with B basics of Bjs

in my opinion this is a more elegant solution than jsf and i think B s ioc container makes it more powerful than B

B doesn t provide this kind of thing out of the box - it s designed to be a little more low level than B

B is more powerful verstile but to get started with it i feel you have to be a better php developer than you do to get started with something like B

i am using B 2 and i see more than one B method that takes an idictionary as a parameter for the html attributes

thus i think B is more suitable for intranet and takes less time to develop your app while B is better for more complex gui or unstable connections where additional roundtrips matter

even though B has better capabilities i prefer B due to Bs complexity overhead and lack of ui for control api

B the actionbean approach doesn t look much better than B

but B offers far more than just doing away with the need for your own writables although that is in my view a considerable plus it offers fairly efficient serialization the choice between serializing against generated entity classes like B requires or using a so-called genericrecord structure instead and not having to have tagged data

B s is better B s appadmin is for administrators only

for the record B as of today supports more complex scenarios than B that s why the initial learning curve is steeper

in B when is it appropriate to render your game content using more than one B

while B has much more sophisticated widgets than gwt you still can t use B in conjunction with it which is why i rejected using B

i already know that B is a more heavy weight approach in contrast to B
