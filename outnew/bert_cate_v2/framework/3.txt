personally i think B is much better suited for mocking the unmockable and i prefer a combination of B for my own interfaces and classes and B for framework and externalities like file i o gui db connections etc

i did some reading on B and it seems to be able to do what i m thinking of although at a much lower level than B

the docs for B 2 are clear user-friendly and much less intimidating than B 2 docs

i have worked pretty heavily with both flavors of the gwt B libraries though i ve spent more time with B recently

from what i have read on here i here that B is more popular over B

i would say B would be easier over B as the default ui elements look really good

we started experimenting with B on smaller services and kind of like it more than B

personally i d say B might have the edge as it encourages convention more than B would

B offers you more options and possibilites how to run your tests and in which order especially something B can t

B has more capabilities and can be helpful with integration tests B is more focused on unit tests

i m new to sever-side programming.some people told me that B is more suitable for beginners like me than B

B seemed a bit easier than B and i started to do a hello world B app with this tutorial

is B better than B

i read that B for beginner is better than B because educational reasons at the same time B have B oscar

i d totally go with B unless one dependency B is better than three B jinja2 and werkzeug

i ve found B to be really effective and surprisingly lightweight....it aims to be more lightweight than B

B is more often compared contrasted to B in that it offers a set of facilities outside of moq and or rhinomocks sweet spot

having said that B has a lower initial learning curve than B as it was specifically designed as a learning tool

to answer klochner both seems quite popular but ruby is not a language that i am familiar with and B seems more heavy and complex to me than B

i am new to B it s good for coding but it is not much faster than B

sinatra and B are not automatically faster than B
