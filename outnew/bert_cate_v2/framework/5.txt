or would a tool like B be better suited than B in this case

with this in mind customizing the css of a B app is significantly easier than B for the simple reason that you control the markup

B is not better than B express the big thing that differs is the structure of it

here is what it would look like with B it s a little more contrived with B since you can t pass parameters directly to test functions

B is much more mature than B web api

B s a much older library than B so you could expect that it would have many more features

B is rather faster than B

thus i suspect when people say that B is much faster than B it is because of the loading and updating delays but the actual test execution time appears to be very similar

nonetheless i tried to compare the sum of all test speeds and in some cases B is faster and in other cases B is faster

B is larger than B but thanks to expires cache-control this only matters on the the first load
