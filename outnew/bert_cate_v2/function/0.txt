notice that B is faster than B unless the source string is much smaller than the buffer s size which is rarely the case with ip addesses.

B can be more efficient than B since rep movs is highly optimized on intel cpus esp

information - use B as it s faster than B and we know

but sometimes B performs faster than B because it moves blocks of memory at a time which allows it to perform some optimization i will not go into details here

B is faster than B and also enforces you to specify a buffer size

additionally if you have B then it is much more convenient than B + malloc + strcpy with identical result including the same obligation to free the allocated storage when you no longer need it

so we can use B with sha512 to gain a very significant advantage over the phpass algorithm mainly because sha512 is a harder algorithm with more computation than B

while B gives you automatic de-Btion on function exit the stack is usually a smaller resource than the B heap and if you exhaust the heap it gives you back null

if you don t need the cryptographic properties then a non-cryptographic B or a B that is less cryptographically secure B being broken doesn t prevent it being a good B nor still strong enough for some uses is likely to be more performant

it is likely that you could do an sha B of 100kb in well less than 10 second though and though sha-1 is still theoretically flawed it is of higher strength than B

or you could employ a request signing scheme in which certain request fields are B together with the password of the user basically sending the password without sending the password similar to digest authentication but you can use something better than B

double B Bing is actually less secure than a single B with some attack vectors

the difference between crc32 and B is that B generates a larger B that s harder to predict

however if you want to use the sha256 B alogorithm which is better than the B then here s a code sample

actionlink B is more often used to generate url properly based on the B route values etc and anchor tag based on htmlattributes etc

presumably the mac B aligns to bigger boundaries and so it s spotting the pointer you re passing to B can t be correct since it has the wrong alignment

here is a solution which encapsulates the call to B allocates a bigger buffer for alignment purpose and stores the original allocated address just before the aligned buffer for a later call to B

most likely B allocates more memory and puts so-called guard values that happen to contain null bytes or it puts some metadata to be used by B later and this metadata happens to contain a null byte right at that position

one interesting experiment you can try is to try and B more memory after you B d that pointer

B finds 10 more B bytes and marks them as used

now if you B some values on the heap and allocate more with B you may be given back some of that dirtied memory that you scribbed on earlier

B is much easier to implement if there is no B

all have more or less cumbersome and non-obvious error checking involving errno B is way much better than B in any case so avoid using B

you will find that B works better than B here

this is pretty much the ifloop answer but B is slightly faster than B

B performs better than the generic B and better than having another and

my question is is fast implementation of B x 0.5f faster than fast B x

it would be better to use B over B unless we want the zero-initialization because B is faster than B

it takes a page off of the free_page_list updates mem_map zeroes the page and returns the physical address of the page. here s another post that explains it well and also explains why using B is better than B + memset

this means B can potentially be faster than calling B followed by memset since it can skip the memset if it knows it will already by zeroed

it s conceivable that B could return address of memory location that is already pre-initialized with zeros thus it may be faster than B + memset combo

B is faster than B reason is that B processed single dimensional array to pointer format whereas B takes double dimensional array and before processed it converts to single dimensional array then to pointer format

B is faster than B + memset because B knows that the mmap d pages are pre-zeroed and memset forces the allocation of physical ram

as written B would be better than B but the question used B and it would not be hard to make it sensible for use with this code too for example a conditional assignment in set_matrix such as

B also uses a more complex construction in particular B over direct digest to make recovering the input password from an output value more difficult

why is B so much slower than B or hand rolled copy on the server

as an aside my c c++ is rusty but is not B more efficient than B if you know you don t have overlapping memory

the question is about is there really any platform where B is faster than B

if you know buffers cannot overlap B is fine and may in any given library use optimizations that allow it to be faster than B

as an added answer there is also the B which is more general than B

technically accessing the B directly is faster than using B but there are very few situations in which it will make a significant performance difference and would probably be a case of premature optimization

B is far more flexible handling the allocation of space for you with B it is up to you

since i provided a B example above your read loop can be much better written with B as follows

although you could tell dancer2 plugin passphrase to use a 4-byte B it s much easier to just use B Bedhash everywhere

the justification of B is that it s faster than 2nd B manual copy free

in c memory most other things are managed by the programmer so B is no worse than forgetting to B malloc ed memory failing to null terminate a string using incorrect format string in scanf and invoking undefined behaviour accessing dangling pointer etc

B is more secure than a simple B or even a salt B

key derivation algorithms such as bcrypt and B aka rfc2898derivebytes are much slower than standard B algorithms

likely not as cheap as xor against n values but seems like there s possibility for better quality results at a minimal extra cost especially if the data being B is much larger than the B value

you can safely store the B in the db because working out a string from its B is just as hard when you know some of the string as it is when you know none of it provided the password itself is longer than the B and long enough and strong enough to take a long time to crack by brute force at least 6 chars with at least one case change and a number or non-alphanumeric i d say

i get the impression that most people think that Bing B passwords is the more secure way of handling passwords but i can t figure out a way to comply with current company operations when using B passwords

example the B field might only allow a 64 characters while the generated B might be longer therefore when you save the B it gets trimmed which ultimately changes the B password

you should know that B allocates more memory and returns its pointer which you then overwrite the original pointer returned by B so it will be impossible to free that memory since you no longer have the pointers

you can use either to create a new memory block which is separate from the original but naturally B is simpler since it doesn t require a separate B strlen call

or indeed if your system has B or you re willing to write an implementation then B is much cleaner than B + strcpy

B ... is extremely fast 10 - 100 times faster than B ... or read.csv ... for large datasets

B performs faster and more efficiently than B but B produces less no errors on the same data set

interestingly for 1 million rows per file the optimised version of read.csv and B take 422 and 430 more time than B whilst without optimisation this leaps to around 1500 and 1005 longer

a similar argument can be made for B functions B is generally faster but will remain in the same big-o complexity class although there is an additional size tradeoff B makes your compiled program larger if the code was being used in many places

templates will be B in the standard meaning of B which is more related to the one definition rule than to actual code B

but as the B code gets longer the savings for B become smaller so maybe you could just have a hard limit on the size of the code - any code to be B must be smaller than the limit

callee is too large message is printed by c1 when the size in bytecodes of the method being B is larger than maxBsize 35 multiplied by nestedBsizeratio 90 on each next level of B

B B produces fatter code which is faster the B functions will not appear in the call stack

in reality the B keyword has less to do with B code and more to do with allowing legal violation of the one definition rule

this allows you to use the assignment operator instead of B and requires 1 less call to B - the one you make

in term of speed square rooting is easy a few arithmetical operations for some newton-like method but it is not clear what asin does probably quite Btly B is likely to be one order of magnitude slower than B and thus one square root is likely to be quickier than those two transcendental function calls

just wanted to add that using strrpos + B is slightly faster than B + end

2 however B requires all arguments to be of the same data type thus being stricter than B which will first attempt an implicit conversion

B is more efficient than B as it only evaluates the second argument if the first is null whereas B evaluates both arguments every time

the B function is used here because it is more portable than B or ifnull

joe duffy s blog implies using B is more efficient than B

dynamic memory management on an small embedded system is tricky to begin with but B is no more complicated than a B and malloc of course that s not what it does

a fairer comparison would be comparing stringstream to the B sscanf line of functions which would be slower than B but still faster than stringstream

edit as willeke has pointed out accessing a B directly is technically faster than doing so via an B via self

it means a declared B is more than a pair of B methods getter setter

that suggests another aspect where a declared B is more than a pair of B methods that is more static type checking although it is undesirable here

a B is nothing more than syntactic shorthand for a get set B

i.e B is actually better than the simpler B if you are willing to improve the code

using B 3 is better than B 3 but things like strlcpy 3 are better still

B is safer than B

in general B is a safer alternative to B

B incoming connected will overwrite dataa and maybe datab if your first token pointed to by header is shorter than B connected

if B is anything like B it will write one byte more than B returns to zero terminate the string

B is a function to read a single char simpler than using B

it requests memory from the os kernel but the request is not satisfied until the memory is written to with B . this allows for greater efficiency in the system s memory management but it can result in misleading B behaviour

i confirmed that in debug mode the B version is slower about 130 âµs vs 60 âµs for the B version

which is more efficient is up for debate but based on cpu bulk instructions which can copy an entire block of memory in one instruction B is probably faster as B would check each copied byte for a nul character

the second Bing function is B which supports many more algorithms and variants than B but does not support some algorithms that B does
