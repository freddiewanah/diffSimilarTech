B is fast alloca is fast copying the string up to the first n is fast puts is faster than B but is is most likely far slower than all three operations mentioned before together

that said the date class is much better in php5.3 -- it even has B subtract functions which would also solve your problem much better than B .

if you always keep track of the lengths of your strings you can compare lengths and use B which is faster than B

B is simpler than B and can be implemented even more efficiently in places where the strings are known to be properly aligned

B is rarely slower than B or strncpy and often significantly faster

B is usually faster than B for longer strings

for example for small amounts of data an B optimised for large amounts of data may be significantly slower than a B that wasn t optimised for large amounts of data

we keep track of what cmd s length ought to be in a variable and copy the string with B which is slightly faster than B and does neither check string length nor copy the extra zero at end of string

because of the above replace strdup with strlen malloc B B is slightly faster than B

so i feel that on x86 B is faster than B

on almost any platform B is going to be faster than B when copying the same number of bytes

the reason for not having B i m guessing is that B can be replaced more efficiently with B for constant strings and if the string is not constant B is a bit more complicated than B anyway so not as beneficial to make inline optimisations for

B has 64 and 128-bit versions so you can experiment between the two and it s faster than B largely owing to B being a cryptographic hash function whereas murmur doesn t have the added expense complexity of being cryptographically secure i m assuming that you re not concerned about anybody attempting to intentionally generate hash collisions or anything like that

in that case some B functions are somewhat faster than other B being one of the fast functions but md4 is faster and it is simple enough that its code can be included in any application without much hassle

B is no longer secure and it can be broken with a good gpu no typo you can use your graphics card to break a B

all B functions have that problem but some are more robust than B

other B functions such as sha-1 also have B collisions although it is much less likely than B

because sha256 B are much longer than B B you can detect the B algorithm by looking at the length of the B

crypt with B is simply more expensive than B

Bing is one way you can prove this to yourself by taking an B or shasum of a large file since the file s size is larger than the B output by pigeonhole principle B can t be restored.

so i guess it s the B in the dump output cause the conflicts and the B value is longer than B outputs

also the B algorithm itself is much slower than sha1 B sha1 B are made for speed - not a useful property when storing passwords

this generally uses a B algorithm that is much faster than B

of course any B algorithm is going to have some chance of collision but you have better options than B that would still satisfy the 1024-byte limit

finally sha1 B are safer than B i tell you that because you used the B tag in your post

the fact that bcrypt produces B slower than B because of security reasons is also clear for me

i would like to apply a B code solution on my webpage which is more compact than B and sha-1 because i want to use them as keys in a json B table

suppose char p B n assigns more than n say n bytes of memory are allocated and B p is used to B the memory allocated to p

you might have even noticed the B version is simpler than the B version

at best it is a computationally expensive hash function like B that for example is five times slower than B and thus allows only a fifth of the number of hash operations in opposite to B

to prefer B over B when given the choice is that B tends to produce query plans that are more efficient than B

you can also use B which is the more general form of B and is actually part of the sql standard

sql server is probably smart enough to translate B into the equivalent sarg expression but if you are bent on using a function then B is a better choice because it is part of the sql standard allows for multiple values instead of just two with B and avoids using quite possibly the most confusing function name microsoft ever devised in B

you can use B also in place of B as B is comparatively faster than B

- B should be more portable than B

B is more cross-compatible than B or nvl it works on mssql oracle mysql derby et al.

B will be faster i think because it has lesser function code implementation for itself making it faster than B

B itself seems to be consistently a tick 0 01 better than B but the case distinction to reconstruct the sign has an extra test

or maybe flip them on my machine B seems faster than B

those answers was that B can allocate larger blocks than B can and etc

actually calling memset after B is closer to calling B than the option you suggest

g_new and g_new0 both take the same arguments unlike B that takes less arguments than B

B is faster since B initializes the allocated memory to contain all zeros

this is an enormous amount of extra work and explains why B is faster than B and memset

so here B is reading more than one integer at a time from file so B is not getting the integers in file too

bcrypt is weaker than B although still three orders of magnitude stronger than B because it only requires 4 kb of memory

indeed B is better than B and 1 B is better than B

in some cases on embedded platforms where a fast B function may not be available these may be more efficient than B

after looking it s seems that B is much faster and better in term of security even if the underlying B function sha1 is broken which is not the case when using rsa-sha1

B is better than a plain B because it is not vulnerable to B length extension attacks

note B is safer than B

is B slower than B as one can give pre-calculated string length to it but B does not receive such information

bcrypt is considered the most secure way to implement password hashing with B because it is slow - much slower than an B

using sha256 with a B will be much more secure than B

decode the passwords yourself and re-encode them with a B i recommend something a little more fancy than B

encrypt the passwords with one-way encryption algorithm with a random B like the common opinionï¼š sha-256 is stronger than B

on the other hand if what you want to do is not rounding but elimination of fractions into one direction then you have std B that goes always higher and std B that always goes lower

works because B a b is always one greater than B a b except when a b is a whole number

now if B is higher than 0 or B is lower than 0 on any axis it means that there just as many tiles outside of the camera scoop

edit B is 2x faster than B on the server

std B may be very slightly slower than std B emphasis added because it has to first check whether the source and target ranges overlap

bad news is that the asmlib version of B is slower than the glibc version it is now running at the 300ms mark on par with the glibc version of B

and it said B might be very slightly slower than B

from reading other so questions such as this or this gives the impression that B should work faster than B and intuitively this should be so

the various alternatives B B work roughly the same way B is easier to use when dealing with arrays and zero-fills the data while B is useful when you need to resize a block of memory

nonatomic properties don t use locks but direct B is faster because it skips the B call

i m also looking for more examples and explanations of complex B more complex than B in common programming languages

that s why B can temporarily require more memory than a B free pair

key strengthening techniques such as bcrypt or B are generally considered better than plain B since cracking them requires more resources

you ll probably need to get data anyway so the unique B is probably faster too because you won t need to calculate the B over username

the lack of B is harder to expoit here than with password B since the B is not directly known

this is the case here because B hello is greater than 3 your last B argument

you might want to give the data.table package a try check out the B function which is much faster than B

the keyword B is more about telling the compiler that the symbol will be present in more than one object file without violating the one definition rule than about actual B which the compiler can decide to do or not to do

if a function is static thus not exported anyway and only called once within your code and you never use a pointer to the function chances are good that gcc will decide to B it automatically as it will have no negative impact the binary won t get bigger by B it only once

i m well aware that B is more of compiler decision than of user going so far as even to B non-specified B-functions so the user control is almost negligible

the features stemming from those discussions permit less extreme B than processes which is symmetrically like the provision of more extensive independence between B

the ansi standard function B is simpler than using B and decode which should be obsoleted anyway

if you don t mind the libc allocation functions B is even more efficient it wont copy the data on a shrink just mark the extra memory as B and if you grow the memory and there is memory B after it will mark the needed memory as used and not copy either

the compiler is B to choose a method that is more efficient than B

B is notoriously unsafe as are it s cousins B_s and B although they are mildly safer than B

doing a single B and B is faster and simpler than doing 2-3 B calls

if not multiple B calls will still be faster than multiple B calls because the overhead of the latter will be greater

the fact that using B with iostreams is faster than B at least in release mode runs counter to the reasoning that copying all that data must be slower than not copying it so i m not sure what all optimization is able to avoid and i didn t really look to find any explanation but it d be interesting to understand what s being optimized away

even if underlying implementation is not so different B is much faster because it does not have to check what it s copying B will stop when it ll copy the end of string character null

B is newer and seems to support more Bing alogrithms than B
