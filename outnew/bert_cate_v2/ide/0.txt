i had previously used B 3 for a couple days and may have come to the conclusion that it is better than B at actual html css coding

however i do not know if B has a comparable option like that as it has less functionality than B or even intellij

i think B is better than B for 8-years old

i like the auto-complete feature of B but from my experience it is slower than B

we sort of settled on it but later found B and liked it better than B

i like the B ide even better than B but i m not sold on installing and using mono s compiler just yet nor do i know if it can even handle the latest vb.net c# language features

it looks like B is slower than B
