in studio 3 much of this sort of functionality is still coming as B is going more of a B bundle route for a great deal of their features which i think is really cool

my c B is faster than my embedded B function block in B environment but when i use it in rt-lab the embedded is faster

another alternative that people might mention is B which is from jetbrains but its closed-source not well supported and whilst it might look nicer than B it has more or less the same features but is much more resource-heavy and laggy so i d pass on that
