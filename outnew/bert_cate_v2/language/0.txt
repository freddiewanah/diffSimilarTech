also note that i use B more than B

B won t allow you to do absolutely everything that B does but it will allow you to do almost everything and the code will be probably more robust considering that B is more modern language with stronger typing than B

the B one is dramatically slower then B implementation

this article seems to suggest that this is possible by swizzling a fake location into apple s cllocationmanager class to be used by other apps but i am unfamiliar with the B code more familiar with B

better if you have a code B is better but is not problem B

the perf hit will be ridiculous i know apple say B execute faster than B but this is low level so it will be harmless

B seems to be less dynamic than B in these stuffs

injecting code in a B application is harder than it was for an B application but it s still possible

and also apple does might not confidently announce that B is more faster than B in all the cases

or is it merely a hint to whatever tool converts between B and B to better deal with B optionals

i know that B is buggy as heck i run into bugs everyday but ill bet B was even worse when it started out benefits of hindsight so in a couple of years B will be equal or greater than B keeping its basic simplicity as well

i use B more than B

i have a B application working fine and smooth to be more comfortable with B i decided to write the unit tests for this app in B

B is in fact a superset of B not a subset -- B has more functionality built in than B itself

saxon-ee supports streaming of large xml documents using B or B streaming is better supported in B than in B

my usual rule-of-thumb is that B is better than B for simple tasks whereas B is better for complex tasks

if your output is going to be similar to your input with small changes then the B solution is often a lot simpler than the B solution

on the side of using macros B has always been more advanced than other B and lisp implementations

B is closer to B than to common lisp but you could dip your toes into the lisp family without the speed bump of the emacs style of development

i would suggest you start with B and more specifically with B formerly plt B

right now B is much better as it supports a broader set of language and platform features than B .net ever did

in free and turbo B file handling is much more easier than in B in B we have assign instead of assignfile and close instead of closefile

from my pov the object B paradigm used with fpc object B dialect which can coexist with the default object B code is more advanced lightweight and integrated than the interface-based plumbing of B xe2 compiler with on-the-fly marshalling using rtti

B is coco but much more compatible with B more functional and more feature rich

while B is more expressive B pattern matching is simpler which means a simpler language definition compiler etc. and you still can do what you need at the cost of writing more code

opengl is better for playing around and experimenting because you can easily draw triangle without messing with hardware buffers available on larger selection of platforms plus B is better than B because it doesn t compile into assembly

it s popular it s actively developed it has many libraries offering the features of a modern programming environment and B is somewhat simpler not to say better just simpler than common B

here is a solution in B because i know that better than common B and have an interpreter for checking my work

for a counterexample i think B programs ran faster and used less memory than the B programs that preceded them mdash

my impression common B is more for getting stuff done B is more for education and fun

i also checked B and it seems a pretty cool language easy to do relations between data and easier than B but i d like to hear what you think

please consider also to use B for code generation that s much nicer than B and integrates smoothly with xtext infrastructure

B is a dependently-typed language that is designed for low-level programming though it s somewhat less elegant than B

all in all t4 to me is more of a inside vs code-generation tool to quickly create c# or other files while B is more of a data-processing data-transformation tool to turn data from xml into another format typically html or pdf using B

because B is eagerly evaluated the execution model is far easier to comprehend and debugging via printf works a lot better than in B

B has higher level bindings to llvm than B the B ones provide some interesting type safety guarantees and B has by far more libraries to use 1700 packages on making it easier to glue together components

secondly the B ffi is more powerful that is it does more with less code than B s and more libraries are avaliable via hackage so i don t think foreign interfaces will be a deciding factor

the reason i wanted to investigate this was because both c and B were significantly faster than B for this program

as others have pointed out B s learning curve will be lower than B s

i would just use B but B s syntax is so much better than B s and B is pure and has cool features such as type classes

in dependently-typed languages like B it s probably more useful than in B

on contrary B is more c-like do not require explicit enabling of script running accepts relative paths case sensitive and loosely typed both are imho advantages for scripting language compared to B

the inclusion of B code into a batch file is simpler than B and the translation of a small code segment from vbs to B is not problematic

yes B was once much more feature-rich than B but later revisions of the language B 2001 B 2005 systemB etc.. have cherry-picked most of the interesting features and there is far more robust toolchain support for B and its variant these days in addition to it being the dominant language in use in the us in my experience B is only used here when dealing with extreme legacy blocks and in academic contexts partially due to the tools support mentioned previously

yes they are different but you can hardly say that the B version is less capable than the B version

can i safely assume that B result is more precise than B and discard the B result completely

B is richer than languages such as B schema Bs

B and Bs are more expressive than B which means here that you can capture more complex relations for instance you can also represent the link between sets of things Bs subclassof or use transitive properties hasancestor

B methods tend to be more fine-grained than B functions so that may be a good place to begin

in this case a traversal-oriented approach is best maybe B is better since B doesn t allow you to specify traversal order

B is much more convenient than creating an activex on B or c# vb.net

while B syntax looks more related to shell syntax like bash or tcsh B is actually more closely related to B or php or ruby

it is written in B which is a language somewhat simpler than B but broadly in the same family and not difficult to learn

fortunately B 2.1 has a better alternative since it s supports the built-in calendrical types from B 1.3
