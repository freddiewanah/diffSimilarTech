there are multiple reasons why the B code is slower than the B code

personally i prefer B because you can use c very easily as anything that is legal in c is also legal in B added to which B is a more procedural in style where B is quite clearly object orientated

as you can see defining a singleton class in B is much easier than in B

so i ve started learning B because it looks way better than B

if you get a difference between B and B it s more because B is probably better on optimisation

as B is the older programming language for ios or macos applications B allows you to use those classes structs in your code

B is clearer on versions releases and i keep asking myself if i am missing something related to B since i can t find this information

B is much more free and easy with types and compilation checks where B isn t

so it should have always been gkagent under B in order to be strictly correct however B is less type-safe than B so you could get away with it with the possibility that you d get an unrecognized selector exception if a gkagent object was ever passed to the delegate method and you assumed it was a gkagent2d

B also prevents us i believe from overriding a parent class s property but also still lets us observe changes to that property--this is much better than B s approach

B print is more readable compared to B

adding lightweight generics to your B api makes it easier to interface with B because your api gets translated more precisely

early this month i started learning B as i found it fun and easier than B

however when i switch to B 4.0 the methods declared in B is no longer visible in B

the B runtime is smaller than the B runtime

B in that case would not be safer but less safe than B

those attributes let you create B code which is more understandable by B and complier warn you when you break the rule for example

while i think the move to B is prudent but i think it overstates the case to argue that B is significantly more secure that B

i find that B is much nicer for working with core audio than B

furthermore B is stricter than B when it comes to initialisers

because you can determine what code in a B is likely to do better than a B it has been determined more error free to use a compiled perspective for more things so as you can see with the availability of offset-management and lookup compiled behavior given to you in core perl there is no reason to mess with the symbol table if you don t have to

as dimitre says B is much better at this class of problem than B

what s the deal i thought B would be nicer than B

B is quicker than B but for what you re going to do you re trading speed for convenience - B comes with all the different ui classes list scrollbars etc already there

i can see that my skeleton B module is slightly larger than my B module 66kb vs

but B will be more than B and i use B heavily to validate xml values and i should be able to produce html reports well

i noted that while in languages like c variable identifiers can only be alphanumberics and underscores common B allows many more characters to be used like and at least B does

i don t see why sbcl should be so fast - B is a far simpler language than common B

overall common B is much more uniform than B and more radical language experiments if done at all are usually embedded as a portable library rather than defining a whole new language dialect

i ve also found B ides much more user-friendly than B s plt B is a good one

i am not sure it can satisfy you but B test is 4 times slower than B

keith pointed out that B has a more powerful type system but it can also be said that B has a more powerful module system than B

you will also likely find the performance characteristics of your B code more intuitive than B because of B s lazy evaluation

when writing code in B as i am wont to do as i have never been a fan of asp.net and B is infinitely more elegant than B you can call upon the arguments collection

...i suggest doing all of the scripting from within the B file and avoiding the use of .cmd .bat files completely if you can as B is much more readable and powerful though i prefer using the B language instead but that s just me

pacoblaze was written in B which like adam said less common than B

B appears much more complex then B and the learning curve is tough

none of the .net libraries are there and there are some syntax differences as B is more strict than B is

biggest of all is that adding new features to your B application is more expensive than it would be if the application was in a better language like c# or B

if you don t already know B there s little point in learning it now - your time could be put to much better use by learning B c#

also developing enterprise application is such new languages java c# B rubby is easier that B because they rely on frameworks every body can write c# java code that function but it requires tricks good practices and some of imagination to write B strong and rehusable code

fortunately B finally ended all that and is completely pixel based you can still alter you viewport scaling but .net seems to handle that much better than B

recently we noticed that B queries run faster than B so we decided to convert our queries

B seems much more clear to me than B and in general it seems that the guys in neo4j are going with B

B is no better nor worse than B ruby python or any other scripting language in this regard -- they all do basic file operations with equal aplomb
