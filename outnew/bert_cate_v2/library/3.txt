by looking at the google groups for qjplot and B the support for B is better lot s of unanswered questions at the B group

userwarning your B version is more recent than the one B

usr local lib python2.7 dist-packages B sandbox cuda init .py 600 userwarning your B version is more recent than the one B officially supports

the easiest solution is to just replace B with B which has even more features than the latest B

basically collections are things that implement some kind of iterable interface and they internally use the same iteration method though B source is a bit more convoluted than B

other useful pieces would be B for database access much simpler than B or other full orms async-httpclient for doing calls to other web services

in its stead you can use B - which does filtering a lot easier than B

just to goof off a version using B string_ref is much faster still due the reduced B

to be able to use std allocate_shared with B fast_pool_B as the B method using g++ 4.8 or higher with B 1.56.0

the latter doesn t do any dynamic memory B and is more than 10 times faster than std to_string on B karma benchmarks

B intrusive_ptr performs better than shared_ptr because it doesn t need a second B to hold the reference count

i m using the module B in my python script and many more such as B and numpy etc B module only works on python2 not for python3

while B is more modern c++ it also harder to use for non trivial tasks - and without a modern c++ experience and deep B knowledge it is difficult to use correctly

also if this controller is an hid the B library might be a better fit than B

customization and variety of animations B has more customizable animations when compared to B javascript charts

if you re using retrofit and okhttp to perform the network calls i suggest you use B as it s also from square and claimed to work faster and better than B

as it stands B is not just better than B and processing in many cases but is also a viable replacement for jquery underscore.js and other frameworks

this should be possible maybe be aware snap.svg isn t so compatible with older browsers in which case you could look at B which is snaps older brother B is very well established as well

but adding a class to B package seems harder first because there is different jars depending on the operating system used org.eclipse.B.cocoa org.eclipse.B.gtk .... and also because copy pasting the code of B is not that easy since there is call to external methods waiting for a strict B

B is svg and as such it is much more dynamic than B you can restyle graphs with css attach events perform animations etc..

there s a known bug that when you install the googleads library using pip it will install a newer version of the B library which will break my google analytics api scripts because the B uses an older version of B

B is considered faster than linear B and often used for large scale data set

the situation is critical if on some platform B provides a narrower functionality and does not link to B which will not be available on that platform at all so the above command for linking will fail due to unsatisfied library dependency

i found another approach using the B context passed to the handler of draw events but it resulted in capturing a region of the parent window that was larger than the B

it can be hard to get the layuots exact the way you want in B it s usually easier in B

i m not too eager for using B though since i m more familiar with B

as a note B is way better than other libraries as B for real time applications

the B library for example can be easily inserted into an application to evaluate performance gains in heavily threaded applications where B tends to perform a lot better than B s malloc implementation

android plot and other free chart solutions mentioned here doesn t support annotations the only one is afreechart which is a port of B for android i am currently using it and it is awesome and has much more features than B

the B library includes a confusion matrix that is simple to use and produces a nicer output than B

i have an app that uses the public part of the twitter api the on who not requires to login but with the update the login is required so i need to implement oauth i ve seen there are libraries like B who makes this easier but my app has a lot of code and i don t wanna rewrite it not now so i ve think to use B or oauth-signpost but i dont realy know how to

B is faster than the B 2.3 malloc available as a separate library called ptmalloc2 and other malloc s that i have tested

then we found B also have same issue but increase rate is less than B

as noted in the comment by quandary the B library offers a more relaxed license mit compared to the commercial or agpl license offered by B

you could use B it is way easier to use and works with B

one of the things that makes B better than B is support for proper css-like class selection or even supports full css selectors if you want to use them

B is more of creating charts using canvas element of html5 and B uses svg

code looks correct and even at its worst B should be no slower than B

since i am more familiar with B here are some aspects where i think B has more complete support than B apologies if i miss a B feature

B 1.6 now includes a low-level streaming api and a new parser which is actually faster than B

B is a more full-featured touch library has many swipe commands than B most upvoted answer

the chapter starts with short course to xml general talk but with the atom syndication feed example then it continues with the standard xml.etree.elementtree and continues with third party B that implements more with the same interface full xpath 1.0 based on B

i have found though that since i started using the asset_sync gem which uses B instead of aws-s3 gem i don t have any more trouble with B and s3

also B is recognized to be slower than B

note that B is significantly slower then for example B because it reads in class files directly instead of using reflective access in order to avoid class loading
