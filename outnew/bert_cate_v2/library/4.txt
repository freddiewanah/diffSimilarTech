if you re open to using B which is a better version of B imo this can be expressed fairly simply using flattendeep on each element of your multi-dimensional array

i also think working with B is much easier using B dataframes and not numpy arrays

they do this using a jquery plugin called B which is a more complete version of B you pay for

B libraries are generally less mature and less standard than B

ubuntu 12.04 ships with the B fork B in version 0.8 which is more compatible with B 1.0+ or even later B versions iirc

i have made an app similar to yours for android we use B whose surf is much faster than B

the only place where B defeats B is fallback B supports older versions of ie where as B is based on current web standards ie 9

the standard html.parser option handles broken html less well than other options while the B option is closest to how a modern browser would handle broken html albeit at a slower rate than B would handle html parsing

B parser does a better job than B or html.parser handling the debate element in this case

B parser is generally faster B is the most lenient one - this kind of difference would be relevant if you have a broken or non-well-formed html to parse

B is still faster than B in many respects and supports a wider range of operations

in my testing the slow-down from using B ranges from about 1.5-3.0 times slower than using B but its performance will depend on your application

and using keras or B is way simpler to develop nns then pure B which was just side research project in montreal to support development of pylearn

regarding skinning i feel B default skinning to be more basic than B one but i think both have ways to make them as beautiful as your css skills allow you

the B library is much more popular than B and does allow you to avoid for while loops by using preficates and filter methods

i also recommend B it s much easier to use than B and have builtin sqlalchemy extensions

i do know B better than B

instead doing it with B which i found to be the fastest somehow even faster than B

currently B supports the older B v.5.1 while there is a newer B 6.0 available on nvidia site

what you re looking for is linear regression and B is much better than B for this see

have a look at sift and surf and at B which has a good sift implementation and also implements mser and hog and is much smaller than B

according to some benchmark tests B is nearly 100 times faster than B

i found a solution to this problem using B at B-where-are-you-putting-my-html because i think it is easier than B

B will let you use xpath here which i think will be less painful than B s interface

note that B is probably a better option than B for this kind of task nowadays for the reasons given by B s author

i prefere B it s a harder to understand but much faster than B

edit don t use this for html work use the B library it s python based and much faster than B

how can i find all div and span tags with order preserved.with B it is very simple but i switched recently to B since it is much faster than B

B is more java-like whereas B provides more gaming functionality on top of opengl access

B is simpler B is faster

keep in mind though that B is a larger library than B so depending on your case you might prefer B to avoid 65k methods limitation

under some conditions B has proven to be a lot faster than B there also exists jsonp and json.simple

i looked at B metrics and it seems slower than B

there is B which provides more semantic support than B .also you can try nitobi suite which also provides similar kinda solution.if you are not satisfied with any of these i suggest try to write your own part extending the sun faces

so B is just a library for creating windows in a better way than B did before

B is much easier to use than B example of zipping all files in folder

B is simpler to use has a better response to a multithread environment but lacks documentation while B is a more dated complex tool better documented and fully implemented

but in general you will find that B is faster more effective and has an api which adheres closely to a python standard the B which comes with the python standard library

B is faster than B but i ve never found an application where the speed boost paid for the hassles of distribution

you should check out losswise it has a plugin for B that s easier to use than B and has some nice extra features
