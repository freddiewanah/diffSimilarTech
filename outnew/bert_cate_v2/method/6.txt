is a generic type at compile time java will require that an instance provide an implementation of int B t o which from the javadoc returns a negative integer zero or a positive integer as this object is less than B to or greater than the specified object

if you re simply looking to B the value from your cross table you shouldn t need anything more than the B B items menu

for formatting a single numeric value B is marginally more efficient than B because B has a bunch of overhead to parse the format string out of the curly braces and then pass it to B

other than the fact that B has one character less than B i doubt there is any performance difference

yes generally B is a better way of submitting data than B

B is also more secure than B because you aren t sticking information into a url

also a B request would be better than a B if you re sending json

B is also more secure than B because you aren t sticking

you can feel like B is more secure than B all you want but it s a false premise

note that i am assuming a user can B invited to more than one B which seems logical

B has worse performance than B

but using B instead of B presumably adds one more level of protection for xsrf types of attack it does not you need some form of explicit xsrf protection token with B or with B

B gives you more options and dosn t have a limit on parameter query string length like B the only negative is B is slower by a couple of milliseconds to create the request

from a hacker s point of view a B forgery is much easier than B forgery at the first you only B a link at the second you need to point to a malware website with hidden iframe and autosubmit forms but both of them fail if tokens are checked

using B is much easier than using B for most of developers

using B data is more secure than B because with B the details would be in the query string portion of the url

regarding your question about safety -- the answer is B is absolutely no safer than B

1 reading other questions about the rest method for this proposes i think that i should use B better than B

when you use B data is a alot more safer than B and you can send large no

B has a higher overhead marginally if we re honest but it all adds up but it doesn t become part of the url so can t be seen by say a casual observer over the user s shoulder - whereas B can

as it s widely known that an asynchronous B request is better since the user won t B a perception that the app has crashed while it s loading the long process

as suggested in the comments since you are saving data B is more appropriate than B

B is more appropiate for idempotent queries while B is more appropiate for action queries but you can shoot yourself in the foot just as easily with any of them if you don t understand the security architecture for the application you re maintaining

you can t B more than 20 B if you are a sandbox user

because B method storing capacity of response is better than B response

hope you B the more clarification by this B

if you use B when B is more semantically correct it is less communicative of the intent of your request since B usually means you are sending a payload

usual way with tagging is to B objects by tag but if tags are used by few applications it may give more than B

in this case B may be better than B anyways

speaking of B request types you should also know that B requests tend to perform better than B

the problem i have noticed is that sometimes the jquery B result is retrieved earlier than the load of the .js file has been completed so i B an error and of course the jquery plugin doesn t work

while the B method can be submitted with forms or ajax calls and it is pretty safe at least more than the B

the pinoyyd B is neater and B straight to the point how do i authorise a background web app without user intervention

B is more secure then B and data transfer size limits are also there

i ll B better with formatting and being more specific with the B

B is not any more secure than B

both B B user can put any thing in it and you must filter any input that user make it in your form example the value in textfiled sent to server by B method and that don t make it safer than B method the difference between them that the textfiled value doesn t visible in url

data should be in B or B.if you dont put your data in your form then you will have to use B which is less secure than B

you should check this thread why B method is faster than B

actually if you would like to retrieve specific task with all its details B request would be more suitable than B

B would obviously allow for a user to change the value a lot easier than B

and i think B is better than B

here s the solution for B variables as well which is probably trickier for more users than the B solution

i m able to query my database below to B the result that i want but i don t want to have to iterate through all of the author objects just the ones that have more than one B

B is a little more complex than B though

the plugin defaults to requiring a B request to logout but using the config setting you reference you can make your application more convenient to use but less secure by allowing B or B requests

to B more help with that B information about your table structures and content

one more thing some guys would misunderstand that B is safer than B as user can not see the sent data

q1.i know that B is better than B for name-value pair parameters as the get exposes it in url and B doesn t

i think that in that case the B verb is more appropriate because B really means i want to create something new

to receive a file in your api i would use a B request simpler than B multipart and fetch the data from the stream php inB

you got at least B and delete although they are used much less frequent than B and post as in hardly ever
