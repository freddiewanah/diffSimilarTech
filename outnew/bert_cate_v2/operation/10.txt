so we must show that a gradeschool B circuit is o log n times deeper than an B circuit

to find all the pairs of integers x and y that sum to n when cubed set x to the largest integer less than the cube root of n set y to 0 then repeatedly B 1 to y if the sum of the cubes is less than n B 1 from x if the sum of the cubes is greater than n and output the pair otherwise stopping when x and y cross

but in normal case it takes n 2 comparison so you half the height of tree but you B each merge with two so total running time is not better than B to 2 part

addition B for the rectangular bound calculation is cheaper than B

for floating point operations addition and B are harder than B and division so they may be slower or not again it depends on how much transistor real estate there is dedicated to the fpu

an expression like binds as not because of associativity but because 2 B has higher precedence that + 2 B

so in your case an expression like 3+2 5 would yield 25 instead of 13 because B is of higher precedence than B

but that s not the case here since division and B have higher precedence than B and there are no parentheses involved

the reason for this is that and is strong than or it s like in math where B is stronger than B 3 5+3 15+3 18

which doesn t do what you want because B has higher precedence than B

you expression is then 7 + 5 7 + 5 which is 7 + 35 + 5 as B has a higher precedence than B

why with this grammar B have higher precedence than B

it is well-known that the processor instruction for B takes several times more time than B division is even worse upd which is not true any more see below

m_expr can expand to a u_expr because unaries bind tighter than B operations and a_expr can expand to a m_expr because B operations bind tighter than B operations

and keep in mind that the B has a higher precedence than B and subtraction

in this case B has higher precedence than B parenthesis around the B or not

that s because the B operator has a higher precedence than the B operator -

floating point B is faster than B so if speed is relevant

i haven t benchmarked any of this code but just by examining the code you can see that using integers B by 2 is shorter than B by 2

B is faster B is more accurate

knowing that a B is much more costly than a B

therefore i conclude that B is faster than B

B is usually faster than B

the intuition is that B is a more costly affair than B

removing B operations by passing through the inverse into the shader is another useful tip as B is typically slower than B

but the research i ve done so far all points to B being faster than B

the B should perform somewhat better than B

if you are sure that a floating point B is better than a floating point B then

first of all B is faster than B

finally we all know that multiplication and B have higher precedence than B and subtraction so we can remove the extraneous parentheses so this turns into

multiplication and B have higher priority than B and subtraction

the B and subtraction is okay because the types of a and b force them to be performed using floating point arithmetic - but because B binds more tightly than B and subtraction it s like using the brackets above only the immediate operands are considered
