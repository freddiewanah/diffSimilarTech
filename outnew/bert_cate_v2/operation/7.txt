for example in the expression 1 + 5 3 the answer is 16 and not 18 because the B operator has a higher precedence than the B + operator

in technical terms the x B operator has higher precedence than the + B operator

and has higher precedence than or so the brackets are optional - in the same way as B has higher precedence than B so

since B has a higher precedence than B the same convention is used

if B is slower than B instead of doing

i know that B operation is more trivial than B operation

i don t understand why the division B in c++ is so much slower than B subtraction where the managed c# version is more reasonable to my expectations

the same speed as B though still faster than B

not sure about this but B should take more time than B so it s slowing it down ex

in arithmetic B has higher precedence than B

just like it would be possible to come up with arithmetic expressions that could be written with less parentheses if B had a higher precedence than B

the B has higher precedence and therefore binds more tightly than B

on simple low-cost processors typically bitwise operations are substantially faster than division several times faster than B and sometimes significantly faster than B

note that the type cast has a higher precedence than B which is in turn higher than B 3 vs

in any case if B is faster than B a better solution might be to use a table and index by it

mathematics clearly defines the order of operations as giving B higher precedence than B

so every multiplicative-expression is an additive-expression but not vice-versa and this is what makes B bind tighter than B

for integers B is harder than B may be slower than B etc but may still be very fast as long as there is sufficient cpu-power dedicated to it

this platform is probably not representative of your microcontroller but the test shows that on this platform the B is considerably slower than the B

B has higher precedence than B so in the first two examples only the second number is being divided

the B operation binds tighter than i.e is evaluated ahead of the B so you are taking a square root of a negative number

this is because B operator has higher preference than the B operator - in the first example you use are not using brackets therefore B takes place first you can change your code to

the first difference is that B is much more expensive than B

to start with i need multiplication and B to take higher precedence than B and subtraction

multiplication and B are higher precedence than B so they get done first - before the implicit conversion to string for concatenation

since B has a higher precedence than B 5 2 gets evaluated as a integer B returning 2 as an integer

the B has higher precedence than the B so what you re calculating is sumaverage1+ sumaverage2 5 which is integer B which is probably not what you want

as int B gets larger taking powers might be faster than B
