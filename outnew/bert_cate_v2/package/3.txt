however there are many others ts B which is generally faster than B .

also B is significantly faster than B in many cases for processing results

alternatively you can use B module which is lot faster than B

it uses B underneath and is much faster than B

pyquery is based on B so it s also much faster than B

i prefer to use B better than B

B deals with badly formed html better than B is actively maintained B isn t and is a lot faster since it uses libxml2 internally

in the first example B is 3x slower than data.table and in the second its 200x faster than B and 100 times faster than data.table
