what happen when B is disabled in an router and when packet size greater than B how the router fragments that packet

any device in the path of communication between the sender and receiver whose B is smaller than the packet will drop such packets and reply the sender with B destination unreachable datagram too big message containing the device s B

one might want to define B access to more than one B server

in fact with optimizations like B you might find that a tls-secured connection actually performs better than plain B

push log files to a central location B is faster than B the windows B command can be automated with -s scriptfile

theoretically B should be be 30-50 faster than B because it s missing the extra trip for the ack and has a smaller header overhead however in reality there are many cases where B would outperform B just because of congestion control

B is really faster than B and the simple reason is because it s non-existent acknowledge packet ack that permits a continuous packet stream instead of B that acknowledges a set of packets calculatd by using the B window size and round-trip time rtt .

i know B is a safer choice but let s assume i can only use B and i need to ensure i can send packets over at a high rate with no missing packets what should i do

getting much more information is needed in the packet header for connection less like B but why the header size of B is less than B

instead you can use B and implement your own scheme for verification of data that is less stringent than B

the reason B is faster than B is because there is no form of flow control or error correction

B has a much lower overhead than B

B mounts are more reliable and you know you have a network problem much faster than with B

i assumend that the transmission using B have to be much faster than using B but in fact my tests proved that the B transmission is about 7 to 8 times slower than using B

B is subject to higher latencies than B as it requires the client to send back packet confirmations

for example B has much more flags window-length syn ack etc - and also starts and ends a connection in a very stable way - the three way handshake - while all B has is source ip dest ip length source port dest port and checksum

B has less overhead than B and is therefore faster

i am using B because it is much faster than B but sometimes i need the know for sure if the packet reached to the other side in my program i can not use B at all so i am sending ack packets

and there are no handshakings required B are pretty much faster but less reliable than B

B is more popular in nat punching because provides much better results than B

B is slower assures data arrival B is faster data corruption may be possible

B sockets- guaranteed delivery bigger payload than B cumbersome to setup for web based solutions

i did some research and found that B may be more suitable in this case because B hole punching works much better than B hole punching

B is slower than B and you ll have to mitigate that in realtime multiplayer

if you were attempting to beat the performance of B by shifting to B keep in mind that part of the reason you get lower performance with B is because B tracks and redelivers the lost packets for you

B socket is even more likely than B socket but both work

B will almost always provide better performance than B at the cost of reliability

actually we could say that B is a higher level protocol compared to B because B includes some advanced features which might be useful .

since loosing some packets doesn t matter but speed latency is crucial B is much better than B

B is way lighter and faster but somewhat less reliable than B

in general the B protocol manages the available network bandwidth better than the B protocol

is sending packets via an established B connection after all hand shaking has been done a method to be faster than B

in a native application i would use B for the most data player position ... because it s way faster than B and it s uncritical when it is lost

as an additional note my suspicion is that you d need to indulge yourself in some pretty sophisticated benchmarks before you could conclude that B is actually going to have higher performance than B for web services

normally a server wouldn t need to know the client s address beforehand but B s knottier than B the more usual stream-oriented approach to socket communication in many ways

but there are some cases especially in iot domain B is more popular than B for its bigger transport overheads

i know that in practice this would only happen with a great amount of connection given that processing time of an B connection is faster than B but it could potentially happen

if you can t afford lost packets then B is probably a better option than B since it provides that guarantee out of the box

http is an application layer protocol which could be encapsulated with a protocol that uses B providing arguably faster reliable communication than B

-- in which scenario configuration would i get B to perform better than B

it is optimized for downloading larger files where the setup overhead is amortized over the size and number of downloads http is very light-weight you can communicate to an http server using B much easier than B especially before passive B and is designed around html -- the concept that in the course of your navigation you will be visiting many different servers and grabbing only a couple of files at a time from each

yes i know B is better than B but right now i m stuck with B

my lwip can send B packets to pc but my pc would fail to reassemble when the B packets are larger than B

ever since i did sockets programming on a pdp 11 it s been the case that ip fragmentation will take care of the case where an ip datagram such as a B datagram is larger than the B for the segment allows

i am working on B socket programming and i have to stop the transmission in application if requested data is more than B value

in real life B packets size usually is equal or less than B size

what would happen if my B package is larger than B

they are easily generated for B simply by making the datagram bigger than the B

if B payload size is bigger than B size B will silently segment the packet

ideally your B frames are smaller than the B for your architecture say 1500 bytes so the messages won t get chopped up in transit

if you send a B datagram larger than the B it will be fragmented

when send a B datagram larger than the B size only the last fragment of the B datagram is putted out to the destination

if there is network congestion rate limiting or traffic profiling or if the B message size is larger than the B

to send large blocks of data via B you need to chop them up into pieces smaller than the B for the network segment across which you re transmitting them

note that B packets bigger than the B s at every hope between your hosts will be split by ip

B packets greater than the B size of the network that carries them will be automatically split up into multiple packets and then reassembled by the recipient

now if you re intending to use a remote filesystem with ofs which is the primary use-case you have to first install the relevant remote filesystem packages on the os you re using then use for example if we ve got B which is the newer name for B samba

in fact B especially the ttl excceeding message has even less limitations than B on nats for the error message can be sent from every corner of the internet and routers with nat cannot be aware that these messages are not the true ones

regardless the B protocol is more simplistic in nature can handle orders of magnitude more client connections than B for the same memory utilization uses less bandwidth on the wire doesn t require authentication although you can add this feature etc

you are right that using B is probably better to use for something like this or even an existing protocol like B

if you are using linux check out netdiscover this uses B i think B is lower level than B udp and with java you can only create apps from B udp and above

almost all B B providers allow you to forward calls from an attached did telephone number to more than one B device so your request could be satisfied by a basic account on your friendly neighbourhood B provider

it could be a sni problem if you use any kind of load balancer B proxy or more than 1 B certificate on the same ip

B is more flexible than B an application can configure the level of security it needs

as last resort resolution i don t suggest this for security issues using B is always safer switch your registry to use http instead of B
