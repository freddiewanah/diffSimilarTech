B is more of a handshake done with the server while B is the actual stream coming in once the handshake is done and you start streaming

in short as an authentication protocol B is far more secure out of the box is de-centralized and will put less load on your directory authentication servers than B will

B is more pythonic than B or shudder soap

in fact in some ways B is better than B

how B is better then B

if they are connected over the internet you could try to use the examples for B but B has more overhead than B

i was going through internet and so and understood that web sockets are encapsulations to B which by itself is slower than B ofcourse at the cost of reliability but i couldnt find much info if websockets or B would be ideal to implement such a server

it was introduced since the nat traversal for B is much more complicated than B

as far as B goes i think B is more generally used protocol for more data-centric requests like chat or things that require packet integrity B tolerates packet loss to lower latency

i was expecting that B would be faster but B is on average two times faster than B

B is much better than B in terms of reliability

in some applications B is faster better throughput than B

for instance zeromq can leverage B multicast to run faster than any B protocol but the application programmer doesn t need to learn a new api

B is reliable but slower than B while B is not safe and i have to implement my own fault-handling codes

B communication is connection less as compared to B which need a connection

B communication requires much less overhead than B due to the number of messages exchanged

also see this other so answer about the misconception that B is always faster than B

in doing so the tradefoff is that B becomes slower compared to B

a heartbeat is by nature a connectionless contrivance so it goes that B connectionless is more relevant here than B connection-oriented

B port scanning is possible but it is harder than B scanning

because there is no confirmation on B packets it s slightly faster than B

B is faster than B and the simple reason is because its nonexistent acknowledge packet ack that permits a continuous packet stream instead of B that acknowledges a set of packets calculated by using the B window size and round-trip time rtt

moreover B has more processing overhead than B

this is the reason why B is much faster than B

B gives smaller latency with many many issues to discuss here of course B gives bigger latency

i know B is faster than B for various reason

i know B is better to send file but i have a homework about sending file via B protocol

this was surprising for me as it is well known fact that B performs better than B

the decision on yours the B protocol used for connection oriented network that is more secure than B

the strange thing is that when streaming is done via rtsp unicast B generates both sender reports and receiver reports but when streaming is done via B multicast only sender reports are generated

an B packet has a header that is 20 bytes and is probably going to be slightly slower than B

you could always use B that will work both on http and B websites but loading a B resource is slower than loading a http resource because of the encryption and B handshakes

there is a limitation on creating virtual hosts for name based virtual host while using B 443 port so if you want to have more than one B port enabled you will need ip based virtual hosting
