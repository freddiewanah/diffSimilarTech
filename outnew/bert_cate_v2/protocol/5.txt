B could be considered as a better option than B

for a low traffic site the huge tokens that B send across the network actually makes it slower than B

plus once B becomes more common B slow down won t really account for anything much

if we assume that you live in a poor coverage area and your phone and your tower are constantly dropping the signal then re-establishing a B connection is no worse off than re-establishing a tcp connection modulo B handshake

B is much faster then B but B has flow control and guaranteed delivery

i don t think you should make the assumption that B is faster than B

2 B needs more processing at network interface level where as in B it√¢ s not

B is extremely faster than B which is suitable to stream a user s voice input

B is actually expected to work better than B in lossy networks or congested networks

i m aware of the differences in general the facts like B is more accurate while B is more fast

i used iperf on two linux machines to send data using both B and B i found that B performs better than B average 65 better

note that B is more difficult to work with than B because packets are not always guaranteed to be delivered

some protocols are more complex because what s needed are some but not all of the features of B but more than what B provides

if the network between the two point have a very high quality B is absolutely faster than B but in some other case such as the gprs network B may been faster and more reliability than B

B streaming for audio can be less helpful than B rtp as you d have to turn off nagling

B has to do a lot of error checking to ensure that your packets don t get dropped and so B is much slower than B

B lends itself to real-time less latency than B

i am confused why B throughput is bigger than B

B is way better then B for that

this was surprising for me as i expected B to perform better than B

with B its slightly slower than B and has more features

but with the B protocol in particular this is easier than for B

also if you have very limited memory processing resources it is worth bearing in mind that B is a less costly protocol as it avoids a lot of the overheads B incurs due to its inbuilt connection management

if you can do everything with B it is lighter than B

because of B requires connection and provides security it is slower than B and therefore it should not be preffered during a video streaming

why the header size of B is less than B

B is not always faster than B

and also don t forget - B much more customizable than B

it would appear from your question that the period of the B message is shorter than the B refresh time

since B proxy is in theory nothing more than a B tunnel i thought i could give that property another try
