however i found that B is much more stable full screen resolution much much better to handle the iphone connection via usb and i didn t have yet any crash when on B it s quite often

even though B has been faster for me i still use B because it s good enough and is free and im cheap

however i wonder if this is the best way of doing this if you want to observe specific behaviour you might be better off isolating a specific input file and debugging against a local pseudo-cluster and if you want system B you could do worse than give B a lookm as it is pretty mauch already built into hadoop

i know B better than B
