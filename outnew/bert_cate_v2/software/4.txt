B is far more advanced than B and is quite easy to install directly from your workstation based on ssh communication with your git repository server

microsoft has the microsoft speech api sapi however if you want simple B it is better not to reinvent the wheel and customize an B implementation which i guess falls under the great B library for c++ category it s c not c++ but if you know c++ you should be able to understand the c . using Bnow you may not even need to write any custom code it may do what you want already
