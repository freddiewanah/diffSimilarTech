but in my opinion for most sites B is a better choice than B

research showed me that B is simpler to use over B so i decided to use B but have no idea how to install it.can anyone please tell me what are the steps you need to take in order to install B bug tracking system in a small company to track website mobile portal bugs

if anything i find working with B easier and more intuitive than B

B works much better when disconnected from the network - with B you have to tell the server when you ve done a checkout

i ve read that B contains less project management tools than B

i seem to be getting the impression that B is more popular than B nowadays

i hear all this stuff about B being slower than B

B is easier to extend in an api way B is easier to extend in a unix way pipes

a lot of articles about B will tell you it is a lot slower than B or mercurial

from the article it sounds like B isn t a database any more than B is a database

i understand B is more of a B clone but retrospectiva seem to support agile methodologies via a nice plugin

for next projects i m going to try B seems more clean and hipe than B

i wound up going with B and it s way better than B

B handles multiple projects and sub projects far nicer than B

the authors of B are trying to create a better B than B

B is an open source ruby on rails application that supports multiple projects much better than B and seems to be much easier to administer

the B encoding mechanism is less error-prone than B so i ll demonstrate using B

B is just less verbose and can express anything a B number can

that being said i think B is better in every other respect and you probably shouldn t start a new project with B

the other distributed tools are a lot faster B is slow as hell even B can be faster sometimes have much more useful features than B are developing rapidly while seeing any new feature in B takes years

for all the reasons linked in the comment and elsewhere B tends to be a much better enviroment than B or vss unless you have some weird requirements - so if you can successfully import your history and save the company money i wouldn t see why the bosses wouldn t go for it

B is better than B because it was designed to be - it s roughly the same thing with some simplications and new features

in addition another coworker said B was a lot more popular than B
