furthermore * is much slower than *

* is slightly slower than * but it does not have * s susceptibility to pathological cases

* usually is better than * for two reasons

* consistently has less recursive calls than *

is * always better than *

that s hard to say.the worst of * is n log2n -n+1 which is accurate if n equals 2 k i have already proved this .and for any n it s between n lg n - n + 1 and n lg n + n + o lg n .but for * its best is nlog2n also n equals 2 k .if you divide * by * it equals one when n is infinite.so it s as if the worst case of * is better than the best case of * why do we use *

* is worse complexity than * in the worst case.

however on smaller int sizes * gets slower and * gets faster

* - in general * is consistently faster than * however * is done in place and doesn t require allocating memory unlike *

for example locality of references has influence on cache hits or misses which is the reason why * performs better than *

given that it is possible to vastly reduce the likelihood of the worst case of * s time complexity via random selection of the pivot for example i think one could argue that * is worse in all but the pathological case of *

that way * can reach recursive base case more quicker than *

* uses about 30 less comparisons than *

* is approximately 40 faster than * on random data because of fewer data movements

* is more natural to implement for linked lists but you can do * very nicely

it might be helpful to see why * is usually faster than * since if you understand the reasons you can pretty quickly find some cases where * is a clear winner

this means that while the two underlying sorts it uses * and insertion sort are both worse than * for many kinds of data timsort only uses them when it is advantageous to do so

as many people have noted the average case performance for * is faster than *

depending on where i look people say * is faster than * due to its locality of reference cache hits etc

in most cases * will run faster than * even though the worst-case execution time is longer

but * is older and weaker than *

i personally would use * for my encryption as it is lighter and more secure than * in fact i think it is the de facto algorithm at the moment

the only issue with applying that technique for the single source shortest path problem is that reweighting with * takes o mn time which is slower than * s o m log n

however if g is guaranteed to have only non-negative weights g is non-positive weights then * s algorithm could be better choice over *

but under what circumstances is the * algorithm better than the * algorithm

since a proper implementation of * is faster than * use * unless there are negative weight edges in the graph

a * signature generation could be somewhat faster than a * signature generation maybe up to twice faster

use * it tends to be more compact than *

however in this case * key size is less than * key size

* has signature that is independent of key strength and is much smaller than * signature for equivalent security * 1024 1568 vs * 192

* tends to be slower than * for the same reason.

normally quicksort is faster than * which is faster than *

i ve read that * encryption is more secure than the triple * encryption ms is using in their example above

using * assuming it s a little faster than * and requires a smaller key and

as far as efficiency * is going to be orders of magnitudes slower than * so the trade-off you make is that you give up simplicity you give up the simplicity of using * in favor of some * chunking in return for poor performance you get the slower performance of *.

so the 115 seconds will be reduced to 3-4 secs plus the encryption decryption time used for * which is much faster than *

there are two reasons for that performance * is faster then * and resources * is less resource hungry than *

asymmetric key encryption ex * is no more secure than symmetric key encryption ex *

in your particular case an * key of 2048 bits has a lot less strenght than an * key of 256 bits

while 256-bit * might sound less secure than 4096-bit * they might actually be quite similar from the offered protection

one of the reasons to do so is that * is much slower than for example *

the difference is large enough that the constant factor in front of the n log n term in * is lower than the constant factor in front of the n log n term in * which is one reason why * is much faster than *

for example * average cost t n.log n and * average cost t n.log n are both sorting algorithms with the same average cost - yet * is typically much faster than *

you can indeed show that on average * will do more comparisons than * roughly 1.44 n log 2 n for * versus n log 2 n versus *

why it is said * has better constant factor than * and therefore * is better than * in average

this is because * is generally faster than * unless the call depth becomes to deep

i was just going to say radix sort however that could be a bit above what you were looking to implement introsort is generally the accepted sorting solution for data it s a variation of * that switches to * when it reaches smaller sets as it s faster on smaller sets than *

however * is somewhat slower in practice on most machines than a well-implemented *

if that is so you might find that * runs faster than *

you can take a look at * which for non completely random data performs better than * they have the same asymptotic complexity but * has lower constants

if you re interesting in reducing the size of the resulting cookies you should consider using * rather than * to produce the signatures - * signatures are considerably smaller than * signatures of an equivalent security factor
