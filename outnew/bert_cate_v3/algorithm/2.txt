* is more expensive than * for example

des is the least secure * is better but i d go for the *

from what i ve read i was expecting * to be faster than * but on my code it is not so i assume there must be a problem with my * algorithm

why is * better than *

* is implemented well it is typically 2-3 times faster than * or

* is also more complicated than * especially if you want to write a really solid implementation and so if you re aiming for simplicity and maintainability merge sort becomes a promising alternative with very little performance loss

to be specific the * runs faster than * in the first test case and loses badly in the following 9 tests

* has better locality of reference than * which means that the accesses performed in * are usually faster than the corresponding accesses in *

* is not better than *

* generally runs faster than * but under some circumstances it can degrade to quadratic running time

when comparing my * implementation with std sort on my compiler and my implementation of * i noticed an odd pattern on large data sets when operating on 64 bit integers * is consistently faster than *

* is not better it is well suited for a different kind of application than *

an interesting answer about this can be found at why is * better than *

in fact i think it is fair to say that * is more similar to * because of its use of iterative relaxation

however * verification expect verification calls to be 100x issue is about 10x slower than * verification

i have made some testing and it came out that * is lot slower than *

by comparison * see section 3.2 and other block ciphers are much faster than the * algorithm

* turned out to be even slower than * but for my current requirements a much simpler algorythm rc4 is sufficient

* is usually substantially slower than * on modern hardware and has keys that are far too short for modern use

edit 3* is better than * in the sense that it s significantly more secure but still less secure than * but its performance is of necessity significantly worse than * * or twofish because you re essentially applying * three times

according to this analysis * rijndael-128 is more than twice as fast as * 3* with a bigger key size more secure

if * is negotiated it s faster than * and 3* used by default by older applications

note that the effective key size of * is larger than triple *

since the next is not far the number of * steps is much fewer than with * matching

it shows that * encrypt is faster then * encrypt

for 5 000 000 ints still stored in memory * becomes suddenly worse then * and mergesort

in theory * is worse than *

after several tests i found out that my * is way quicker than * i think it should be the other way around my selection sort is also faster than insertion sort

when you say something like * should be faster than * what makes you say that

* also has a better cache access behavior than *

worst case for * is actually worse than * and mergesort but * is faster on average

so for instance * is faster than * in the worst case but slower in the average case

so for even small inputs * does less work than * and is physically faster for every n

but there are many citations of real world tests which show that * is significantly slower than * on average

* has higher overhead than * but its worst case is o n log n vs

for example * is faster than * in general although their time complexity are the same

what makes * faster than * in practice is its constant that was ignored by big o analysis

because * is actually slower than * for each n

* also consistently decompresses 20 + faster than * which is a pretty big win if you want it for files you re reading a lot over hadoop

* is much faster then * at verification
