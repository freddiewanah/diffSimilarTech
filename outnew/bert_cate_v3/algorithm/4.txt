i have read that * is much faster than * in practise and the reason for this is the hidden constant

technically * has a better time-behavior î nlogn worst and average cases than * î n 2 worst case î nlogn average case

* is more sensitive to input sortedness in a positive way than *

i ve looked at the question at why is * better than *

parallelizing * is simpler than * in-place

this is why * is much slower than *

that continued usage of 1024-bit prime field elgamal or * keys is much riskier than it is for 1024-bit * all are still commonly used because once a successful attack has been conducted against a single well-chosen prime field all users of that prime field may be affected at little additional effort.

* is also a better choice than * because it has much better breadth of support for signatures still considered secure by nist

but a large period * takes up more memory for maintaining the internal state and also takes more time for generating a * number due to complex transitions and post processing

the non-* * behaviour is more a reflection on the quality of the rand * â it is often not very good

* code is 8 times larger than *

turns out this was a hardware failure the * commands need more power than the * crypto1 ones 50 more which the antenna failed to deliver at the reading range i was testing with

if you used * then you might see a better speedup over the * 3* observations

this shows that the timings are sensitive to buffering and that * is faster than *

algorithms like * are much less user-friendly than *

but if you use public key encryption to encrypt messages you are a limited to small messages -- a 1024 bit * key encrypts less than 128 bytes and b going to pay in performance because public key encryption is much more costly than symmetric key encryption such as * encryption

execution of * is more faster than * for same key sizes

like you heard asymmetric cryptography like * is much slower than symmetric cryptography * but it does have it s advantages simpler key management a single private key to protect

* is much slower than *

how is * less secure than * in this scenario

note however that doing so means that each encrypted chunk has its own padding and that * is much more computationally expensive than *

block crypto algorithms like * do suffer from this problem too but without a pki * is no less safe than *

asymmetric encryption ex * is no more secure than symmetric encryption ex *

the whole purpose of using * to secure the communication or any symmetric key encryption is that it s a lot faster than * or any public key encryption

that is actually not the case with * which is --- more so than * --- just a math equation

the * key is encrypting much more data but is much faster than * encryption

considering most * moduli are at least 1024 bit this will be much larger than an * key

* is more difficult to implement * but the out-of-place version is very cache-friendly - i suspect real-world implementations accept the o n space overhead - ram is cheap but memory bandwidth is a major bottleneck so trading memory for cache-efficiency and speed is often a good deal

another reason is that * needs more memory because it s hard to implement it as an * sort

1 * merge sort is used when you want to sort a list in o nlogn time while using less space than standard *

if i do * i can create the stack while i m sorting but would this be faster than a * and then build the stack afterwords

asymptotic analysis reveals order of growth of * in the worst case is big-o n logn which is better than * s big-o n 2 as a worst case

* is also significantly faster than * for decompression

these formats allow various data compression codecs note that * is now much more popular than * and can also provide other benefits such as fast serializable deserialization column pruning and bundled metadata

* is used by python and java for their sort methods and is rather supernaturally fast but it s a more complex algorithm than * which matters if you re working in something like c - so if you just need something that works pretty well and is simple go with *

why * or introsort or any comparison-based sorting algorithm is more common than *

* is probably better though * was developed by google with protobufs in mind so you might want to test both on your data set.
