i have been trying out * to see if i like it better than *

i have found * to be more reliable than * or loadui

i think you ll find that your team will like either trac or * more than * or mantis

the authors of * are trying to create a better * than *

for next projects i m going to try * seems more clean and hipe than *

* handles multiple projects and sub projects far nicer than *

i d recommend * like the other posters as it is more complete than *

we found * to be a better than * simply because it is easier to use

nobody has ever accused git of being easy-to-use no * for example although i hear it s coming so you might be better off with * beanstalk
