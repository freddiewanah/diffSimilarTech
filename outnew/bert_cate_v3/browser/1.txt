in * this might be handled a little nicer than * but rather than completely redraw an element you should try to append only what you need

* is reporting the missing key with a higher severity than * is so i want to eliminate that as a possible cause

* seems to animate the element quicker than * does and so while a duration of 1s is enough for the animation in * * needs it to be 2s to be slower and show the effect

also for animations * chromium behaves much better that is why i use it for development but do my general browsing in *

obviously * is more persnickety whereas * defaults to moving and sizing the printout as necessary

* can get away with more than * before aborting

i have just noticed a site i am working on looks different in * than other browsers saf * everything is more saturated in * even a background-color rgb

rendering without buffering on * is faster than * so i m actually not sure why * is having such a problem with drawimage

maybe * is working faster than * try adding a wait with expected conditions

my question is similar the same page in my pc renders fine * * but the same one on a server rendered smaller by * * ok

performance is browser and device dependent for example * handles objects better than arrays while * prefers arrays

this is because in ie and * the footer link text is larger than in * and safari therefore the margins that i ve set up for the icons do not work

* encodes more characters than *

using the same data * does in less than 5 seconds what took ie and * 10 to 15 seconds to accomplish

also * s map function is up to 2x slower than * on my machine

maybe * is more lenient when it comes to illegal characters in the url than * or something like that

my * adds more chopping to video playing itself * plays the video much better

use * rather than * - * with dev mode is much slower than *

i ve tested the sample on * and it s a bit slower than * but usable

i found programming * extensions easier than * but i couldn t come across something similar to xpcom in *

my knowledge of * is better than * so my apologies if i missed something

bad buffering can also be a result of a slow computer because statistics show that * is better for a normal-fast computer and * works best on slow computers

* s default textbox includes more padding than ie *

however a sdp object local description by * does not contain datachannel at all and moreover the sdp is much shorter than * and less information bundled

spidermonkey * is slower 50 of * max speed but the speed is consistent

arabic default font in * is larger than it is in *

i have encounter a problem with * that is similar to an older issue with * at this url scrolling blocks javascript execution in *

apparently * is pickier than *

* has even fewer as far as i know and * has none

from testing this in * and * it seems * is more forgiving in that it parses the style string and puts the right style in place for you but * does not

total width of button in * web inspector 6px larger than in * web inspector
