* probably is more complete to manage canvas than * but the problem is always to exclude the finger touch if i m using the pen

especially in * there is much more green in the painting than in *

i ve found that the font-size in * is a bit larger than in *

the reason * is slower than * is that the devmode plugin runs in a sandbox so calls and data have to cross the sandbox boundaries

it seems that in * ie the line-through style is a bit lower than * i am not sure if this is because of the implementation of different browsers or something

it s clearly visible in * and is far more subtle yet also distinguishable in *

in my experience * has better javascript performance than *

often * is understanding more thing then it should and * is bringing you the reality back in your face eheh

in * it is appearing higher than the original in *

this is trickier to work around and you should file a * bug describing the situation and where it s slower than * but you could potentially reduce the amount of buffer uploads by looking into instancing or using uniform arrays instead of updating vertexes for positions textures

ellipsis still wraps in * but is more user friendly in * by adding the .

the logs only seem to work with a * browser which is a laugh as usually * is better at running google apps than *

graph beeing cut in * is a known issue * does not respect some print css and works much better with * not all versions still

i ve been trying to sum up values over a swipe and see how different browsers report values and they vary a lot with safari reporting order of magnitude bigger numbers on almost all platforms * reporting quite more like 3 times more than * * being balanced on the long run but quite different among platforms on small movements on ubuntu gnome nearly only +3 or -3 seems like it sums up smaller events and then send a big +3

based on what you have provided i cannot tell if * actually does load faster than *

this doesn t happen in * and is less frequent in * than in ie

and also does anyone know why is * so much slower than * in 3d rendering

any ideas why * is apply more spacing than * ie

better use * even thought * is not slower than * for once probably the tracing for the image comparison pays off yay

* produces more space compared to *

the * apis are currently experimental hence these tools are likely to be better developed under *

in * the render of new tiles and the panning is laggy this is not the case when using maps.google.com so it s not an issue of * being better than *

with * it was very easy i just grabbed the apk from their ftp server run the adb install command one would think it should be even easier with * but it s really not

* - good a bit slower than *

so i wonder the benchmark is also influenced by the installed extensions or * is really so much higher than * in performance

if you are able to enforce browser usage i find that * on android preserves line breaks when copying and pasting much better than *

ie * higher than baseline * on baseline

you can see if you look at the bottom and right hand edges of both * lines up perfectly but * seems further in both directions and i cannot work out why either in firebug or * dev tools

* takes almost 3 times longer than *

the most interesting thing i noted is that certain test combos in * are much quicker than even *

phantomjs achieves a better accuracy than * slightly lower than * but in around half the time of *

* handles these better than compared to *

it is also proper browser behavior * is just stricter about it than * is

i use * for development as i find it runs faster than * and ie so it is a bore to guess where the icons are

* which is more standards-compliant than * doesn t allow this

what s up with * that the debugger behaves less conveniently than *

but i guess * i have version 10 should be much faster than * 3.6

for example using renatoargh s test * is faster with option 2 * with option 1

the trouble is choosing a good value for x since for this particular page * is so very much faster than * which is faster than ie

for example in the classic browser share example if the * is at 45 i want to be rendered inside the pie distance -40 may be and where the slice is less such as * at 6 - i want it to be shown outside with a connector

conclusion diff1 is faster in firefox opera and * diff2 is faster in ie and *

it also gets broken even more in ios * which is an older version of *

the browser does not matter though * gets way more consistently working results than *

* has more of the market than * not and invitation for flame wars just a personal opinion without any weight -

my ipad 1 * js benchmarked 38 times slower than * on my pc

* 5.1 still renders smoother than * but it is now clear that google has done much improvement

to me it looks like * gets it more right than * text is generally more around a middle line

that i gave to every link in the set of links home about us products contact and it seems that * is making that 1px margin much bigger than * or google-chrome and distorting it

please especially test on * because it has some more problems than * and google-chrome

in * it is several pixels higher up than in * and google-chrome and significantly lower in opera

it seems that google-chrome internet explorer or * are more strict than * on terms of security

google-chrome or * on a mac could be much faster than * on a pc especially with newer apis
