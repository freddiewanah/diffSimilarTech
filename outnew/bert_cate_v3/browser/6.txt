first just a heads up you may want to try firebug+firepath on * which is a more handy tool than * s developer tool

in * it takes some more time compared to * safari

* thumbnail 4 times smaller than on *

and additionally the algorithm that * uses is better than the one in * at least for handling the resizing of text

in * it s less noticeable but in * it s very noticeable

i have been working with linear parsers lately and noticed the performance in * v37 was much slower than in * v30

as you can see ie 8 is about 5 times slower than * 3.6 and almost 20 times slower than * 9 at least when using sunspider tests

* is probably easier than * these days

right now * is faster than * sunspider tests so your statement it loads faster in * is not really correct

* is just faster than * which just faster than ie at bit-wise operations

it looks like * is smaller in your screenshot there so * could just not be at the defined break-point yet

i have too problem with text in the * is bigger maybe bolder as in * .

install firebug * version is better then a * one

suffice to say ie and * start having problems at larger heights than does *

* text is 1px lower than in * and ie

if i remove this code the width of green image in * becomes smaller but it s still bigger than necessary about 100px the * images keeps unchanged

we use * though which i believe uses more ram than *

* is slower than * which boats one of the highest javascript engines a modified version of webkit

i m sticking with * debugging of my angular 2 app outside of vs code as its user experience is better than * especially when working with typescript files so i ll stick with that for now unless i can figure this out

* is slower than * in javascript

transparency is also an issue however * seems to handle all three better than *

if * seems to finish earlier than * then that is the freezing glitch in action

here is a simple performance test showing that in * filling is faster than clearing i am not sure what goes on with * and canvas nowadays but in * clearing is many times faster than filling both significantly faster than *

it s just a matter of preferences and browser implementation eg * works faster with brackets while * works faster with the dots

i know different engines render fonts differently and but the issue i m having is that * renders the font higher than * - at the size i am displaying the font this is very noticeable 3 or 4 px - which on a button means they re totally misaligned

ie8 is the same and * is much better but i ve migrated away to * now so would like to stick with the one browser if possible

what * displays is about 5 inches higher than what * displays

while the rest of the browsers report the correct width of the document * reports a smaller one example at screen resolution of 1920x1080 ie * and safari reports 1920 while * reports 1903

in * it seems .prototype is faster * shows no difference between the two although generally performs slower than *

* just provides far more access to its own internals and system to the extensions so its technically possible to do more with them than with * widgets or google-chrome extensions

update under linux gentoo amd64 it s the same - * reneders slightly larger fonts than * but nothing that looks odd

i read somewhere that * has more stringent requirements on cross domain scripting - it and * share the same code base

if i try to do a google search for website loading slower in * than in * i get a lot of results about how * is slower than *

ios * is more ios * than * itself

* is more funny than * i can easily make * cache my page but * does not

i think * renders the moves better than *

* is just better for web development and i prefer * overall
