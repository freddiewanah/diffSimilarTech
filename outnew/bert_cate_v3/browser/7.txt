now this works fine in * and safari and i have had to use assitional css settings for firefox but ie and * both display my ribbon div about 25px higher than in * or safari

in * the font appears to be 1px smaller than * and ie and i cannot see why

here the working header request with * bigger than * request

i m taking a quite educated guess here that * is more forgiving with the irregular syntax than *

i would like this function to work in * ie * etc but at the moment it only works in * and older than * version 49

it seems * applies some formatting to render better than *

i inspected the range object in both * and * and then noticed that * s range object is far richer than * s

why is * so much slower than * on my laptop

* is just more forgiving for some mistakes then *

* works a bit better than * but the settimeout just seems to delay the final result being shown rather than delaying each step

update3 now it works here which means that i couldn t fully reproduce my bug to show it to you but in general the problem is that the height of 5x5 table in * is less from * on 22px which is 22px gap between table container and a table itself

by highlighting the shape of the two elements you can see that in * left the button is 2px taller than in * right

in * it seems more or less ok but in * when i first tried it it should give me not logged in my console

what we can see is that regardless of raw hardware power * seems to run up to three times faster than edge and also significantly faster than * all updated to the latest verion

i ve found that * is greatly faster with imacros than *

the * console gives more information than the * console

they use iframes in * which seems better but in * they do this by putting manually defined span and font tags

the same word in * look wider than in *

* and ie9 require a proper domain to run from presumably because they are more strict than * in the way they associate the localstorate object to a domain in * it doesn t need to be a domain as such

* sends back and html collection that is longer really better imo than * ie or chromium

i ve ran into out of memory errors on * with canvas heights greater than 8000 * seems to handle much higher at least to 32000

* is even slower that *

the funny thing is that for abc_def property * is actually much faster than * and ie as i expected

in * it goes little bit lower than in *

the problem with this code is that it doesn t quite work on * and works even worse on *

but if firebug donâ t enabled after launch * â time equal 2ms that faster than * and google-chrome and difference between empty filled array disappears

for example i ve read that * and ie will fix framerates slower than *

the * controller bar is the quicktime bar which is smaller and dark so the movement is less noticeable than * which has a big blue progress bar

* also uses an earlier version of webkit than the current * so pages should be checked in both browsers

works in google-chrome firefox a bit weirdish blur effect on hover * ends look smaller * ends look smaller

it seems that ie and * are less strict than *
