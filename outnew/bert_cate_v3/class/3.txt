i m not sure * is still better then *

* is more effective than * and * is needed anyhow but this will work also if you want to do multiples people then just for-loop it and dont forget to close

* consumes lesser battery power than * or thread

* is more low level than *

* has smaller default internal margins than *

in fact each * has even more than 1 corresponding *

my problem is * is more complicated than *

* is much more customizable than *

* has a much simpler interface than * and takes care of reading and writing from the streams for you

it s not my experience that * is any slower than * is

* is newer than * if you are using swift language then you can use your own custom methods by using * or you can use alamofire

i don t see any reason why * could be any faster than * in this case

* is faster than *

if anyone has some information on this problem i d really appreciate it - either things you did to make * faster or just confirmation that it runs slower than * so i can forget about it and just stick with *

when it comes to deletion it even gets worse when saving at the end of all entity removals * is around 18 times slower than *
