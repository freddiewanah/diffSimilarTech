a solution i ve used is a simple subclass of * which allows more customization than subclassing * and less hassle than nsattributedstring et al

in other words if a * is more accessible than its * then the access modifier of the * loses effect

here having a * makes more sense or at least having a realnumber * of number

watch out you can t query a * if you have more than 1 * then something like in jql

you can t cast a * in a * because the * may have a bigger interface than the * means the * can have functions like getunixtimestamp that the * doesn t have

if the * is more specific then it might fill in all by 2 of the arguments to its * __init__ method

this class leverages * which is a lower level approach to using *

* is more useful when a new * wants to change the way a method works if you just need to change the data the class uses to work probably an approach like this would do the trick

since ireadwrite implements ireadonly ireadwrite is said to be a * of ireadonly although * is more accurately used to describe a class which * a base class rather then implements an interface--for the sake of simplicity they are very nearly the same concept

secondviewcontroller which is a subclass of firstviewcontroller also has a * but has one more *

i don t see any form * in the code you posted so either the posted code has been modified or the * is higher in the * tree simpleformcontroller

multiple * makes it easier to compose classes from small mixin base classes that implement functionality and have * to remember state

* code is generally less optimized than * one

the * class methods are convenience methods for common animations but are more limited than *

it means a declared * is more than a pair of * methods getter setter

edit as willeke has pointed out accessing a * directly is technically faster than doing so via an * via self

it is a feature it is about * api but the same is true or worse with * api

besides the * api is easier to use than *

* is more general subclasses support writing to different places * is a specific one writing to a string
