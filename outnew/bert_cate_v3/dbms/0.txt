* is more than capable of serving your needs as well as alex s suggestion of *

i am using * btw which can do more than * incase that changes things

i suggest * it s more capable has more features and better support for complex queries and datatypes than * and has a lot of tuning options

from how i understand it * is a more correct database implementation while * is less correct less compliant but faster

as for reliability i think that * is more reliable especially when compared to * using myisam - innodb is a lot better here

does that mean perhaps rails team favor * slightly more than *

since * is a lot more sane than * there are not that many tricks to report on

triggers in * have a syntax a bit more complex than * because they execute procedures as the action

* is more compliant but if you re comfortable with * and you re using an orm you should probably use that

* specifically has gotten easier to manage while * has lost some of the simplicity that gave it an advantage without picking up enough features that really matter

if you are looking for location based queries in relational databases * is more matured compared to *

if you need spatial data capabilities postgis with * is better than *

however people often argue that * is cleaner and easier to use that *

* is worth learning and much more advanced than *

* is probably more often offered by shared hosting providers * is probably a little more powerful

for these ultra simple queries * can be slower than * - * has richer planner that works better on more complex queries but on trivial queries is slower

may be * takes less time than *

looks like * is a little more compliant than * so try this instead

in fact this presentation which still refers to an older incomplete version of * s opengis support suggests that with proper indexing some * geospatial actions may actually perform better than * postgis though i m sure that s up for debate

the other question is that what i am hearing from our group leader is that * is better than * when working with coordinates

and a wiki for why * is better than *

this is a weak point that iirc * can handle better but with * you have to work around that by reverting the changes yourself in case of rollbacks

generally speaking i find * lends itself to 24 7 operations better than *

i did a simple performance test and i noticed * is slower than *

* is easier than * but it doesn t really matter either way

i ve found that * is in my expirience is slower as *
