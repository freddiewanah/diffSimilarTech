as you can see the * result is way longer then the one from *

this is ancedotal but the * servers i ve managed have always been much less troublesome than * which likes to randomly crash once in a while occasionally corrupting a table on the way down

also you might take the time to compare * and see if there is something about it that meets your needs as well or better than *

drupal 7 * 5.0.15 or higher with pdo * 8.3 or higher

b use indexes - * has bigger repertoar of indexes then * so use it - there are gist gin indexes

do you find rails with * is slower than * knowing that it produce more query on the background

for example pyqt is already available for python 3 as well as 2 and you can use * a splendid open-source sql database engine much more standard than * via py-*

an efficiently configured * is better than a badly configured * and vice-versa

while * is less popular than * most of the serious web hosting supports it

i wonder why * s single insert statement is completely faster than * s when autocommit is turned on

i am aware that * interpretation of the sql standard is stricter than * and that consequently this type of query won t work...and have read a number of posts on stackoverflow and elsewhere on the subject - but none of them seem to be the definitive answer on this subject

* is not less complicated that * -- they re the same thing

* is also a lot better imo than * and is the recommended database to use with django according to a lot of the people close to django

if you want to use sql i strongly reccommend * it seems to deal with large databases and frequent writes a lot better than *

* gets much better performance and this is coming from a former * partisan

there is also * its a bit more robust than * and is free just the same

as i said * is far superior and i hate mucking with * s bizarre bugs and i think that overall * performance is probably better than * for any even slightly complicated query

i would need a scalable database so probably * would be better than *

if i were able to upgrade the server s versioning of * to 5.5 would innodb be a safer bet than *

with correct locking for safety reasons and heavy concurrent use * performed better than *

* with the optional hstore module might be better than * at this.

while * has a larger user base * is gaining more an more popularity ever since implementing several crucial features that were missing in earlier versions

if you want open source * is much smarter than * as well

* seem to better than * in terms of speed

is * better than * for such purpose

though * is more popular than * but instagram is using * maybe due to these reasons

* is better than * in many ways

some recent tests we did showed that * does perform faster than * and we believe the table partitioning feature in * will be very important with a table in our database we foresee to grow into 100 million rows and more in production

in most regards * is slower than * especially when it comes to fine tuning in the end

* is much better suited for data warehousing compared to *

* is a bit more restrictive than *

* s version is apparently marginally faster than * but lacks some of the more advanced spatial features therefore it s pretty much limited to finding records that match a certain range of coordinates

given * s reputation for doing things better than * or at least as good as i daresay that * would demonstrate similar performance if properly used
