why * is more capable than others * etc. on django

now i m not sure if i d say * is generally better than * -- there are certainly things that * does much better and so it certainly has its uses -- but these are a few things i absolutely love about it

the only reason i was considering * was that some research suggested * has much better support for changing schemas along the way than *

i cannot propose any db not knowing your specific needs but if you want to use a free software which excludes oracle and you re not already experienced with * you should try * which is more powerful than *

* supports recursive queries in the form of recursive common table expressions which make querying heirarchical data easier than in * and also give better performance

* is already slower than * up to a certain point it is actually faster when you have a ridiculously large database

either * more proven than * for such huge data

and * has fewer experienced administrators than the big databases and * which i believe contributes to the reputation

* is older than * so it might have influenced them

* is faster than * s innodb

* requires more tuning than * to achieve optimal performance

i totally understand the error and assume that the * implementation is less sql conform than the * implementation

* has more established support for this but * has played catch up in the last year or so and has a working method of this in the latest versions

in my personal openion * is slower than * and mongo db

i also personally believe that * has better handling of complex queries that include sub-selects and the like which most * users used to avoid

* has better support but the support by * depends on the used storage engine

however * s sql features are far more advanced than * s and * has a tendency to silently ignore things you tell it to do - especially in a default installation and if you rely on a foreign key to be created that might be a very unpleasant surprise

poor performance from * has more to do with it not being smart and automatically creating an optimized plan like sql server * or oracle would

fyi * scales better than * on multi-processor overlapping requests from a review i was reading a few months back sorry no link

* license bsd is undoubtedly more simple than * s
