some people were saying that * is better for security purposes whereas * is becoming more feature rich.

i was told that * is a better choice than * for displaying hierarchical data so i installed * and i m ready to go

the query optimizer in * is more advanced than in * and copes with complicated statements much better especially when it comes to sub-selects

i would recommend * for a beginner as it has far fewer surprises than *

i feel * is much more mature and robust than *

* is more sql compliant than *

according to the * which i gather * is based on documentation for sequence manipulation functions it should return the value most recently returned by nextval in the current session.
