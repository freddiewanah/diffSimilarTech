* or webstorm are far more accessible than * so it usually happens with their editor rather than mine

as it happens my choice is * but just about anything which is more advanced than * ought to be able to do this

cut and paste in * takes more steps than in * iirc

on today s machines that s a non-issue but if you ever find yourself dealing with older gear it s my experience that * is far more likely to work on a wonky terminal than * is

for example * s macro shortcut f3 and f4 is easier than * s qq and q

i realized that * would load slower than * but this seems ridiculous for a fresh install

it is worth learning both because * is better than * at editing certain languages and doing certain tasks and vice versa

there are definitely some advantages using external editors however * is ten million times better than *

since * is much older than the extensible * as opposed to the relatively non-extensible vi it has a much larger collection of extension modes covering almost any purpose you can imagine

i prefer * because it s a little more customizable than * but they re both great options and lighter than dreamweaver

plus copy as rtf for * has more recent updates than sublimehightlight for *

why * uses more memory and takes more time to start as compare to * editor

i find * has an easier time dealing with vectors because they re first class objects while in * they re actually a combination of a vector mask and a colour fill
