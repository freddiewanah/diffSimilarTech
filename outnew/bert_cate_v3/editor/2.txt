personally i m using * right now which i find easier than * for searching and navigating the code but everyone has their taste

i have found that * has better plugins for providing some of the more ide-oriented capabilities but like boltclock said * is really just a powerful text editor and does not try to be a one-stop-shop ide

in studio 3 much of this sort of functionality is still coming as * is going more of a * bundle route for a great deal of their features which i think is really cool

i like the idea of the of editing inside the terminal and like the key bindings of * but the text highlighting in my * is much worse than in *

* has better github support out of the box but * has a several git packages

* has better performance than *
