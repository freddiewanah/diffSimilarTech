i had previously used * 3 for a couple days and may have come to the conclusion that it is better than * at actual html css coding

if vim seems too much by the moment i think that * is better than *

you can customize * and i think you will like it better than *

lately i have used * a bit more than *

this is the one thing i think * does better than *

i feel like * is so much better than *

i think * is equal to or better than *

* is more powerful and * is worth the price tag

though similar in ui and ux * performs significantly better than * especially in heavy lifting like working with large files complex snr or plugins that do heavy processing on files buffers

it looks like * is slower than *

if you re just going to use * the same way you use * don t bother - * is better than * at being *
