* is a high performance 2 to 3 times faster than * pure java template which use razor like syntax

* has a stronger syntax than html and is easier to convert to * this way

* is often considered to consume less memory than * but this depends a lot on how the browser is implemented

with * there is less time lost from table locking while * is faster in table readings

there are other optimizations available but general rule is that * will be quicker than * is even with table growth

for an oltp type system * is usually more sensible than * did you check the contention before trying a different engine

1 in mysql engines * is better or *

first question is it normal that * is much slower 7x slower than * for such usage

* is often faster than * in terms of raw performance mostly because it is not acid

one thing is that if your inserts are not in the order of increasing primary keys * can take a bit longer than *

* -- more effecient than * because of the way the primary key is clustered with the data in *

* has a higher resource consumption rates then * so keep that in mind

as you are no doubt aware from your searches * is primarily better than * for high volume inserts not counting non-comparable features like foreign keys or full text searches which are exclusive to * and * respectively while * is primarily useful for tables which are read more often than they are written to

you insert in there but never select from there as far as i know today * is better than * in this case

* seems slightly faster than * but this is really marginal

* is more space friendly than * you can start with that one

furthermore i do not have control over the engine Ã¢ * or * * performs better due to row based locking instead of table as in case of *

* generally performs faster because it lacks certain functions * has such as rollback... but it has only table locking

* also tends to store data in less space than *

* is relatively newer than * and is transaction safe

* is a safer acid compliant engine with some integrity features that * lacks

this also affects how it is stored which leads to * being slower than * on insert due to * requiring a full index re-write on every insertion

* table is a bit slower than * tables but i don t think it is a major problem as you told you are using drupal system is that a kind of mult-sites like a word-press system

* supports better locking semantics so if there will be occasional or frequent writes or if you want better data integrity i d suggest starting there and then benchmarking * later if you can t hit your performance targets

* is more concurrent than * since it provides row-level locking

someone just told me that * is much better than *

* implements mvcc multi-versioning concurrency control so locking is much more complex than with *

* is slightly faster than * and implements the fulltext index which is quite useful for integrating search capabilities

nothing is 100 safe but * properly used is a lot safer than * against data loss and corruption

however * tends to be slower as *

* for reads may well be faster than *

in my opinion * use to be faster than * now they are pretty much the same in speed

but in certain scenarios * works better than *

it is said that if you have a mostly read based application you should use * as it is better than *

2 - i have read about * vs * the conclusion for me was that * is faster when it comes to read-only whereas * is designed for tables that get updated or inserts more frequently

there are several q a for why is * much slower than * but i could not find any topic for the opposite

* is faster in data warehousing situations such as full table scan reporting etc.. but * can actually be faster in many cases with normal oltp queries

so that means that in practice an * write will take 3 times longer than a * write

if your in the market for a templating engine * a new templating engine used by symfony is much better than * imho

* is more advanced but a little complex as compared to apache *

probably you can take a look at * template engine which is much faster than * and velocity also much easier to use
