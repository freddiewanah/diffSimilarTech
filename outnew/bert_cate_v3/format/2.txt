as you noticed yoou cannot create an * campaign *ed by more than oone *

the atom * option seems to load faster than the * one fwiw

the specification of atom * offers more value than the * one with internationalization content types and other things and every modern * reader supports it

the resulting file from this * approach is smaller in size than a * file and i guess may rescale better

jpg or * should get you smaller than *

also your * looks more like a * tab separated instead of comma separated

regearding your comment i also know that it can deal with * better than * and ogg that is not really the case

* is smaller than *

the * format is substantially less capable than *

* has a wider color pallete than * and * is properitary while * is not

you can then use imagecopy to insert each * image including the background and image* to generate * output which is better for line art than jpeg offers better compression than * and can support more than 256 colors

of those three * would usually be smaller than *

* vorbis is better quality per meg than * plus no licensing legal issues
