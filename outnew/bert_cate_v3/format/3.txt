2 * seems a little better than * but not much

i also know that it can deal with * better than * and ogg

one reason to use * it is sooooo much better than *

according to wikipedia the * format provides better compression than *

animated * is better than * if we re focused on file size Ã¢ achieving a smaller file size was one of the reasons the a* format was designed

jpg and * work well for most applications but the files will be larger than * for very simple graphics

if * isn t smaller than * then your software may be saving it poorly - look for * optimisation progams like *out and *nq

also if i change all to * is not bigger and alos i am using prawn pdf outputting these images so cant use *

* compresses much better than * and allows more colors at the same time
