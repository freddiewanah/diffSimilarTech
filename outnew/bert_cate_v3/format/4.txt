google does this because their * api can parse more than *

if a * file is newer than the corresponding * file or the corresponding * file doesn t exist then i want to run a bunch of commands to convert the * file to an * file and copy the tags across

it s possible for * software to make this a lot shorter with * but these calculations are hard and not everybody implements it

if the latter is what you want you could use * which is somewhat easier than the * format

today * is much more popular than * so if you re writing files outside of your own data store * would be a more common choice and you d need to work through nsimagerep to get there

i suspect the computational demands of * decoding are probably considerably less than * and if dsp gets you excited taking the time to figure all this stuff out is 100 worth it even if the flash route possibly leads to disappointment

it is even slower since i could only upload * which is way bigger in size compared with * and opus

now i assume you are worried your techno might not read a compressed * which should be smaller than a * from my memories

* files are about 3 times larger than * files so it would need 1.8gb additional space to do the conversion

i understand that * is much smaller but it has worst audio quality when is compared to * files

ok i am new to audio with unity but despite reading all the unity posts regarding audio adding 2 short .* clips i heard * was smaller than * to my app has added over 200mb

i ve heard that * decompression requires much more memory than * decompression

by the way i would suggest creating * self-extracting archives instead of * self-extracting archives as with * compression the exe file with the right switches for best compression using additionally also solid archive options could be much smaller than with * compression

i found the production of * much better and easier than * because all windows * encoders i tried are not really good and stable whereas pretty much every tool can natively output *

but in that regard it is replaced by * which is generally smaller supports alpha transparency where * pixels are either fully transparent or fully opaque and most importantly * images are limited to 256 colors

* achieves better compression than * because it applies a pre-filtering step before the lossless compression deflate roughly equivalent to lzw. see wikipedia s explanation of * filtering

if your * files are coming out larger than equivalent * files it is almost certainly because your source image has more than 256 colors

i used ppm * files as they are simpler to write and more portable than *

the only thing i can suggest is that you use * format which is even easier than * for you to read from
