* is newer more feature rich and heavier than * * is designed to have a much smaller footprint so you will most likely find yourself creating functionality in * to match cake s

i personally use * which probably falls in to the heavy framework category but is at least much lighter than * and lighter than zend too i think

in my opinion it will probably be easier to integrate with * although someone more experienced with * might prove me wrong

it fills the gap between * and * more powerful than * and easier to use than *

i would say * would be easier over * as the default ui elements look really good

i am currently looking at * and while its more complex than * the documentation is much more informative and therefore understandable than cakephp s

* is not better than * express the big thing that differs is the structure of it

i know this can be achieved with * but in my experience it is easier with *

* is more direct and simpel to use if you start to learn java * has more features but maybe is more complex

since * seems to be much lighter than * i would suggest that you take a look at *

is * better than *

* is very batteries included meaning that it comes with much more out-of-the-box than say * and to me a large part of that the user auth system

but a friend told me to begin with * as it s simpler and will help me when i start learning * as * is more complicated than *

i d totally go with * unless one dependency * is better than three * jinja2 and werkzeug

* is more popular and up to date as * hasn t had a new release for some time though for testing webforms it s still very useful as * does not have good support for that

i found * was even easier than * to set up

the best testdriven.net disables all instrumentation that * does so it makes * blazing fast - much faster than * for example

sriwantha * is a simpler framework than *

personally i really like * which is fairly unusual but does make getting things right an awful lot easier than *

the consensus seems to be that * is easier to use but that * has the advantages that come from being open source easy to customize merge with other code community etc

i already know that * is a more heavy weight approach in contrast to *
