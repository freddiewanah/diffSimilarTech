i am getting a problem using * and * as in my code * is written earlier then fget but it does not run it runs after * runs

we keep track of what cmd s length ought to be in a variable and copy the string with * which is slightly faster than * and does neither check string length nor copy the extra zero at end of string

information - use * as it s faster than * and we know

it is understandable that * is faster than *

the problem is that * is only slighly slower than * when i expect it to be about two times slower since it operations on twice the memory

as i noted in comments however if you re willing to rely on posix s * then that s cleaner than * + malloc + and has the same semantics you take responsibility for freeing the memory allocated for the copy

all * functions have that problem but some are more robust than *

i would like to apply a * code solution on my webpage which is more compact than * and sha-1 because i want to use them as keys in a json * table

as an example of the second option i ll use * here because it makes more sense than * for random data but * would have identical usage other than the interpolation option.

if your .so are statically linked to c++ runtimes - you should * objects in the same module where they were allocated since new delete is something more than * * and need some extra info to work properly

besides * is a better option than * as * can handle failures better

use * it does better error reporting than *

you can also look into * which is better than using * in terms of error checking

you need to error check * and ensure there are as many passed before using them -- * is better than * as helps detect errors

all have more or less cumbersome and non-obvious error checking involving errno * is way much better than * in any case so avoid using *

i prefer using these short forms because to me year * is shorter to type and better to read than * yyyy *

also * is a better alternative to *

* is more pythonic but * is fine here too

the * loop variant was consistently 45x slower than the * loop

you can also use * which is the more general form of * and is actually part of the sql standard

to prefer * over * when given the choice is that * tends to produce query plans that are more efficient than *

* can only have one input however it s been shown to be slightly faster than *

* will go through the listed values and choose the first one that isn t null it s more portable code than * or ivnl etc

on the subject of performance on sql server * often performs better than * but the latter is ansi compliant if that is important to you

i ve been told that * is less costly than * but research doesn t indicate that

in this case i would use * which provides more levels than * rather than the case stement

you can use * also in place of * as * is comparatively faster than *

this is pretty much the ifloop answer but * is slightly faster than *

* is more cross-compatible than * or nvl it works on mssql oracle mysql derby et al.

in some circumstances * is faster than case or *

* performs better than the generic * and better than having another and

my question is is fast implementation of * x 0.5f faster than fast * x

and is as far as i know faster than the combination of * and memset on the other hand * alone is faster than *

you may be interested in looking at the * keyword which i think is better than the * keyword when you can make use of it

indeed * is better than * and 1 * is better than *

in few words * is safer then * but it is slower too

is * slower than * as one can give pre-calculated string length to it but * does not receive such information

* is a little bit safer than * because you specify how many comparisons will be made at most

you should use * to compare your strings it s safer than *

needless to say * product has more than one * which is kept in the producthas table

works because * a b is always one greater than * a b except when a b is a whole number

why does * perform slower than * on my system

edit * is 2x faster than * on the server

it is entirely possible that in most implementations the cost of a * function call will not be significantly greater than * in any scenario in which the behavior of both is defined

note that * has more overhead than * because it has to determine which direction of copying is safe

on some arm platform im working on * was 3 times faster than * for short unalligned load

in addition as mats petersson said * is cache friendlier than *

as an added answer there is also the * which is more general than *

* is more general version of *

with a lower order * that works better but then you lose the advantage of cubic *

note the use of std * is safer and more convenient than std * *

at first glance it must be significantly faster because * must be significantly faster than *

from what i can gather * generates much better random numbers than rand does however i haven t seen a way to seed it and i would like to just like using *

i should also mention that * has this built-in and may be a better solution than *

* is far more flexible handling the allocation of space for you with * it is up to you

a * can occur significantly faster than a * memcpy and free

my question is why is malloc + * so much slower than *

see also why malloc + * is slower than *

in other words * is no more type-wise than *

likely not as cheap as xor against n values but seems like there s possibility for better quality results at a minimal extra cost especially if the data being * is much larger than the * value

you ll probably need to get data anyway so the unique * is probably faster too because you won t need to calculate the * over username

most attacks involve generating * for common passwords so for reasonably complicated passwords it becomes harder especially with * some people use usernames as * others use randomly generated numbers

interestingly for 1 million rows per file the optimised version of read.csv and * take 422 and 430 more time than * whilst without optimisation this leaps to around 1500 and 1005 longer

generally speaking the * keyword is used more now to allow you to violate the one definition rule when you define a function in a header than to give the compiler a hint about *

in reality the * keyword has less to do with * code and more to do with allowing legal violation of the one definition rule

i m well aware that * is more of compiler decision than of user going so far as even to * non-specified *-functions so the user control is almost negligible

but as the * code gets longer the savings for * become smaller so maybe you could just have a hard limit on the size of the code - any code to be * must be smaller than the limit

just wanted to add that using strrpos + * is slightly faster than * + end

it s like asking whether * is faster than *

the * function is used here because it is more portable than * or ifnull

* is probably better than * in most cases

a * is nothing more than syntactic shorthand for a get set *

so i guess * should be much faster than *

i was exploring around with c regarding * since most people says that it is safer than * additional parameter length to avoid buffer overflows

* could be better replaced by * which does some bound checking

for instance * is mostly useless it gives you nothing more than *

the best solution is to write a custom version of * that is less weird or if you know the length of the input just use *

if not multiple * calls will still be faster than multiple * calls because the overhead of the latter will be greater

even if underlying implementation is not so different * is much faster because it does not have to check what it s copying * will stop when it ll copy the end of string character null

but for the example you give it doesn t matter - if it s going to fail it will be in the initial strlen so * doesn t buy you anything in terms of safety and presumbly * is slower as it has to both check bounds and for nul and any difference between * and strcpy isn t worth changing code for speculatively
