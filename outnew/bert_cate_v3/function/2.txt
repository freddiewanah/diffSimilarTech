* is fast alloca is fast copying the string up to the first n is fast puts is faster than * but is is most likely far slower than all three operations mentioned before together

rest assured though that * is better equipped in the general case for string comparisons than * is

* can be more efficient than * since rep movs is highly optimized on intel cpus esp

your macro with memset and * was not any safer than *

the reason for not having * i m guessing is that * can be replaced more efficiently with * for constant strings and if the string is not constant * is a bit more complicated than * anyway so not as beneficial to make inline optimisations for

for example for small amounts of data an * optimised for large amounts of data may be significantly slower than a * that wasn t optimised for large amounts of data

memset behaves like * but the difference is that * copied the data as it is byte but * copies the formatted string as well so takes more time than * to execute

on almost any platform * is going to be faster than * when copying the same number of bytes

is * usually faster than * on most real platforms

so we can use * with sha512 to gain a very significant advantage over the phpass algorithm mainly because sha512 is a harder algorithm with more computation than *

this generally uses a * algorithm that is much faster than *

using a non-reversible * such as * is much more secure and you can store the * value as clear text

in that case some * functions are somewhat faster than other * being one of the fast functions but md4 is faster and it is simple enough that its code can be included in any application without much hassle

the difference between crc32 and * is that * generates a larger * that s harder to predict

however if you want to use the sha256 * alogorithm which is better than the * then here s a code sample

so i guess it s the * in the dump output cause the conflicts and the * value is longer than * outputs

if the * function is more complex and cryptographically strong * or sha1 then it is theoretically not possible

if you want to compare you re better off putting your result through getstring and compare the much less secure * even less secure than * already is

or you could employ a request signing scheme in which certain request fields are * together with the password of the user basically sending the password without sending the password similar to digest authentication but you can use something better than *

sha-256 uses 64 characters in the database but with an index on the column that isn t a problem and it is a proven * and more reliable than * and sha-1

also the * algorithm itself is much slower than sha1 * sha1 * are made for speed - not a useful property when storing passwords

of course any * algorithm is going to have some chance of collision but you have better options than * that would still satisfy the 1024-byte limit

obviously * is much more difficult to reverse even in this anything that will * to the right value sense then a simplistic algorithm like take the last two digits

valid choices for *ing include sha1 or * although sha1 is preferable because it produces a larger * and is considered cryptographically stronger than *

*ing is one way you can prove this to yourself by taking an * or shasum of a large file since the file s size is larger than the * output by pigeonhole principle * can t be restored.

any * function like * sha1 sha256 etc obviously cannot be 100 unique - because they have a fixed length and due to the there must necessarily be non-unique results for input content that is larger than the *

most likely * allocates more memory and puts so-called guard values that happen to contain null bytes or it puts some metadata to be used by * later and this metadata happens to contain a null byte right at that position

now if you * some values on the heap and allocate more with * you may be given back some of that dirtied memory that you scribbed on earlier

* is much easier to implement if there is no *

* finds 10 more * bytes and marks them as used

here is a solution which encapsulates the call to * allocates a bigger buffer for alignment purpose and stores the original allocated address just before the aligned buffer for a later call to *

the c function * is much better make it a habit to prefer that one to *

why is * slower than * + lst i

doing things like 1000 successive * is much slower than doing one single * of 1000 bytes

at best it is a computationally expensive hash function like * that for example is five times slower than * and thus allows only a fifth of the number of hash operations in opposite to *

edit based on the tests done by multiple people and by theory * seems to be a better option over *

* will be faster i think because it has lesser function code implementation for itself making it faster than *

* is faster than *

* is more correct of course you could just embed * over and over and over... but put that under a performance microscope and * may just win

* is marginally faster than *

so if we have a vector and want to calculate a component-wise function over it say * and * it is faster to use vv** from accelerate because it will pipeline the calculations of * and * for all the entries in the vector which is faster than u*g a for-loop over the vector

* itself seems to be consistently a tick 0 01 better than * but the case distinction to reconstruct the sign has an extra test

or maybe flip them on my machine * seems faster than *

first of all * x should be faster and more accurate than * x 0.5 why do you think it s in the library

and as tom karzes mentioned * is also better than using * for calculating square roots

* is far more common in c code than *

it would be better to use * over * unless we want the zero-initialization because * is faster than *

i remember somewhere i have read that * is slower than * because * performs initialization to zero after performing memory allocation

so here * is reading more than one integer at a time from file so * is not getting the integers in file too

* is arguably a better option than bcrypt * having been much more thoroughly studied and tested

the only case where * would be safer than * is when you re comparing two character arrays as strings you re certain that both arrays are at least n bytes long the 3rd argument passed to * and you re not certain that both arrays contain strings contain a 0 null character terminator

* is more secure than *

also have a look at * which is safer version of *

encrypt the passwords with one-way encryption algorithm with a random * like the common opinionï¼š sha-256 is stronger than *

bcrypt is considered the most secure way to implement password hashing with * because it is slow - much slower than an *

decode the passwords yourself and re-encode them with a * i recommend something a little more fancy than *

* also uses a more complex construction in particular * over direct digest to make recovering the input password from an output value more difficult

the * times the * are greater than the * xy...that s very much possible

so * idx is the lower element and * idx is the higher

now if * is higher than 0 or * is lower than 0 on any axis it means that there just as many tiles outside of the camera scoop

on the other hand if what you want to do is not rounding but elimination of fractions into one direction then you have std * that goes always higher and std * that always goes lower

this means that * might be very slightly slower than * as it cannot make the same assumptions

i changed out total for * which is more consistent with other databases sqlite *

* is more secure than a simple * or even a salt *

key derivation algorithms such as bcrypt and * aka rfc2898derivebytes are much slower than standard * algorithms

a key-stretching algorithm like * applies a quicker * like sha512 thousands of times typically causing the * generation to take 1 5 of a second or so

i get the impression that most people think that *ing * passwords is the more secure way of handling passwords but i can t figure out a way to comply with current company operations when using * passwords

i don t know how safe could it be and how difficult is for the hacker to determinate the technique i use the thing is that the result has the same length as the * and is harder to determinate a * so if for any reason in the history hacker uses a rainbow table and catches a probable result it will be the wrong

so when i see that the * is stored in the * password and that you use that * password as * i think crypt + * is not more secure against a brute force on output hackers who managed to steal * passwords

you can safely store the * in the db because working out a string from its * is just as hard when you know some of the string as it is when you know none of it provided the password itself is longer than the * and long enough and strong enough to take a long time to crack by brute force at least 6 chars with at least one case change and a number or non-alphanumeric i d say

* sha-512 offers a higher level of security and implementing a scheme where you stretch the * is even better do some high number of iterations of sha-512 - starting with the password+* of course

the lack of * is harder to expoit here than with password * since the * is not directly known

example the * field might only allow a 64 characters while the generated * might be longer therefore when you save the * it gets trimmed which ultimately changes the * password

you should know that * allocates more memory and returns its pointer which you then overwrite the original pointer returned by * so it will be impossible to free that memory since you no longer have the pointers

you can use either to create a new memory block which is separate from the original but naturally * is simpler since it doesn t require a separate * strlen call

however if * source is greater than n then * will simply copy the first n bytes and will not terminate the string dest with a null byte because there is no space for it

the other suggestion keep repeating until x stops changing does not work either because for non-perfect squares x will alternate between the * and the ceiling of the root â because of integer mathematics the term n x will alternate when x is slightly smaller or slightly larger than * n

the keyword * is more about telling the compiler that the symbol will be present in more than one object file without violating the one definition rule than about actual * which the compiler can decide to do or not to do

if a function is static thus not exported anyway and only called once within your code and you never use a pointer to the function chances are good that gcc will decide to * it automatically as it will have no negative impact the binary won t get bigger by * it only once

if your compiler can do this then writing functions in a way that the compiler is able to * is better than manually * the calls yourself

in term of speed square rooting is easy a few arithmetical operations for some newton-like method but it is not clear what asin does probably quite *tly * is likely to be one order of magnitude slower than * and thus one square root is likely to be quickier than those two transcendental function calls

but when is * and clone better than *

* is more efficient than * as it only evaluates the second argument if the first is null whereas * evaluates both arguments every time

2 however * requires all arguments to be of the same data type thus being stricter than * which will first attempt an implicit conversion

joe duffy s blog implies using * is more efficient than *

a fairer comparison would be comparing stringstream to the * sscanf line of functions which would be slower than * but still faster than stringstream

it means a declared * is more than a pair of * methods getter setter

that suggests another aspect where a declared * is more than a pair of * methods that is more static type checking although it is undesirable here

edit as willeke has pointed out accessing a * directly is technically faster than doing so via an * via self

* is safer than *

* is not safer method to use as *

if * is anything like * it will write one byte more than * returns to zero terminate the string

doing a single * and * is faster and simpler than doing 2-3 * calls

* is a function to read a single char simpler than using *

i confirmed that in debug mode the * version is slower about 130 âµs vs 60 âµs for the * version

the fact that using * with iostreams is faster than * at least in release mode runs counter to the reasoning that copying all that data must be slower than not copying it so i m not sure what all optimization is able to avoid and i didn t really look to find any explanation but it d be interesting to understand what s being optimized away

it should be in my opinion more strongly noted that password hashing with * is no longer secure and should not be used as others noted use * or bcrypt

the * version is not more complex or more dangerous than the * version

the second *ing function is * which supports many more algorithms and variants than * but does not support some algorithms that * does
