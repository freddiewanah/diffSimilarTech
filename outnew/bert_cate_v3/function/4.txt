that said the date class is much better in php5.3 -- it even has * subtract functions which would also solve your problem much better than * .

* is simpler than * and can be implemented even more efficiently in places where the strings are known to be properly aligned

if you always keep track of the lengths of your strings you can compare lengths and use * which is faster than *

but sometimes * performs faster than * because it moves blocks of memory at a time which allows it to perform some optimization i will not go into details here

* is not really any slower than *

so i feel that on x86 * is faster than *

notice that * is faster than * unless the source string is much smaller than the buffer s size which is rarely the case with ip addesses.

* has 64 and 128-bit versions so you can experiment between the two and it s faster than * largely owing to * being a cryptographic hash function whereas murmur doesn t have the added expense complexity of being cryptographically secure i m assuming that you re not concerned about anybody attempting to intentionally generate hash collisions or anything like that

* is no longer secure and it can be broken with a good gpu no typo you can use your graphics card to break a *

suppose char p * n assigns more than n say n bytes of memory are allocated and * p is used to * the memory allocated to p

you will find that * works better than * here

is the performance of * field constant better than *

sql server is probably smart enough to translate * into the equivalent sarg expression but if you are bent on using a function then * is a better choice because it is part of the sql standard allows for multiple values instead of just two with * and avoids using quite possibly the most confusing function name microsoft ever devised in *

i understand the difference between these functions but my question is when checking for a single null value would * be any quicker than using *

* is better then * because of how datatypes are handled

an example of why * is better than *

it takes a page off of the free_page_list updates mem_map zeroes the page and returns the physical address of the page. here s another post that explains it well and also explains why using * is better than * + memset

if end up using the memory anyway * is still faster than * and memset but the difference is not quite so ridiculous

this means * can potentially be faster than calling * followed by memset since it can skip the memset if it knows it will already by zeroed

for this reason since * uses two arguments of type size_t it can allocate bigger blocks than * will ever be able to since * takes only one argument of type size_t

* itself is slower than * because you have to spend some time to clear the contents of allocated memory

with typical libraries on common modern hardware * is faster than *

the structure of the * algorithm makes it less susceptible to attacks on properties of the underlying * algorithm

* is better than a plain * because it is not vulnerable to * length extension attacks

the question is about is there really any platform where * is faster than *

as already pointed out in other answers * is more sophisticated than * such that it accounts for memory overlaps

bad news is that the asmlib version of * is slower than the glibc version it is now running at the 300ms mark on par with the glibc version of *

as an aside my c c++ is rusty but is not * more efficient than * if you know you don t have overlapping memory

the various alternatives * * work roughly the same way * is easier to use when dealing with arrays and zero-fills the data while * is useful when you need to resize a block of memory

technically accessing the * directly is faster than using * but there are very few situations in which it will make a significant performance difference and would probably be a case of premature optimization

i m also looking for more examples and explanations of complex * more complex than * in common programming languages

the justification of * is that it s faster than 2nd * manual copy free

this * is nothing more than a random arbitrary string that you concatenate to the passwords and it will make your * password unique

you might want to give the data.table package a try check out the * function which is much faster than *

* * produces fatter code which is faster the * functions will not appear in the call stack

templates will be * in the standard meaning of * which is more related to the one definition rule than to actual code *

the ansi standard function * is simpler than using * and decode which should be obsoleted anyway

if you don t mind the libc allocation functions * is even more efficient it wont copy the data on a shrink just mark the extra memory as * and if you grow the memory and there is memory * after it will mark the needed memory as used and not copy either

in general it is nicer in c to have the caller allocate memory not the callee - hence why * is a nicer function in my opinion than *

the compiler is * to choose a method that is more efficient than *

it requests memory from the os kernel but the request is not satisfied until the memory is written to with * . this allows for greater efficiency in the system s memory management but it can result in misleading * behaviour

* will always be faster than * for any real world situation even in the corner case i spoke before look page_copy_fwd_maybe
