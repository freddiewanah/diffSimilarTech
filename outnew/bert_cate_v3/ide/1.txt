i had previously used * 3 for a couple days and may have come to the conclusion that it is better than * at actual html css coding

i think * is better than * for 8-years old

i like the auto-complete feature of * but from my experience it is slower than *

we sort of settled on it but later found * and liked it better than *

i like the * ide even better than * but i m not sold on installing and using mono s compiler just yet nor do i know if it can even handle the latest vb.net c# language features

it looks like * is slower than *
