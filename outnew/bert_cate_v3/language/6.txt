the perf hit will be ridiculous i know apple say * execute faster than * but this is low level so it will be harmless

one of the reasons we want to move is because * is more secure than *

usually i find * s method naming to be cleaner than * s but init methods can be an exception

as you can see the * example is more complex and error prone than your * code

* seems to be less dynamic than * in these stuffs

* is lot smarter than * about singleton class

my view is that if in some cases * is faster than * it doesn t mean that all over performance of * is slower

bottom line i would personally hesitate to draw any simple conclusions of * is faster than * or vice versa

or is it merely a hint to whatever tool converts between * and * to better deal with * optionals

* is in fact a superset of * not a subset -- * has more functionality built in than * itself

* being a whole lot less than *

if your output is going to be similar to your input with small changes then the * solution is often a lot simpler than the * solution

* is significantly more appropriate to use than * for such kind of tasks

saxon-ee supports streaming of large xml documents using * or * streaming is better supported in * than in *

i m doing a comparison of * haskell * and es6 and i m less farmiliar with * and * but i want to represent all of these languages fairly so is this good * code

like the rest of rest * is lightweight easier to understand and easier to write than *

* is perhaps more approachable than * however

because * is more or less superset of * it of course works also in *

for a counterexample i think * programs ran faster and used less memory than the * programs that preceded them mdash

however gambit * has smoother access to c c++ code libraries which far outnumber common * s libraries

* is older than common *

also * has stricter precedence rules than *

aside does this mean * is more homoiconic than *

my experience is that designers can use whichever they prefer usually and most agree that * is easier to use and the code is shorter fact than equivalent *

pacoblaze was written in * which like adam said less common than *

* is a more advanced language than *

* has more structure than *

* is more verbose than * here

i know that * performs better for some regex but will the * performance really be this bad in comparison
