by looking at the google groups for qjplot and * the support for * is better lot s of unanswered questions at the * group

also linearsvc class from * performs even better than * whch is also surprising considering that it s a wrapper of *

edit more recent * does a better job of not always padding to powers of 2 length so is closer in output to the * case

* routine *_gemm has higher performance than * in some cases

* is definitely not slower than *

other useful pieces would be * for database access much simpler than * or other full orms async-httpclient for doing calls to other web services

they do this using a jquery plugin called * which is a more complete version of * you pay for

* is more developed and tested generally since * came out later than rf

i haven t tried any of these in a jsf 2 application but i would recommend using the * one at least the documentation is better than *

is * consumes more gpu memory than equivalent * model training

in my testing the slow-down from using * ranges from about 1.5-3.0 times slower than using * but its performance will depend on your application

it is similar in spirit to keras which is built as a high-level api on top of * tensorflow cntk although the main difference is that * implements only one backend allowing it to integrate more deeply with * features

in java if you want a graphic user interface you can use * or * and * is better than *

android plot and other free chart solutions mentioned here doesn t support annotations the only one is afreechart which is a port of * for android i am currently using it and it is awesome and has much more features than *

2 readability library content is passable slower on average than * but faster than *

i found a solution to this problem using * at *-where-are-you-putting-my-html because i think it is easier than *

* is a higher level library above *

if your company s concern is to avoid big unknown libraries which is prefectly understandable i d advise you to stick with * which is smaller that *

also i want to know if google * is better than * for json parsing

going to go ahead and say that * is a lot more user friendly albeit less powerful than *

that said i found * to be a useful product and much better than * especially in terms of the quality of the documentation

1 i guess * will be slower than * for smaller datasets

* is a more full-featured touch library has many swipe commands than * most upvoted answer

or if you re really focused on only doing opengl i may suggest using * which is the better * but you ll have to draw the menus yourself using opengl

* offers native support and has a quite friendly api and is my opinion more flexible than *

* xml module faster than *
