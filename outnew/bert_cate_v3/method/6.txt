i am using the * method in java to try and check if a certain date is greater than or * than 24 hours after another date

as of right now * is much faster than *

otherwise if * is being called more than * receiver is registered multiple time and the app mis-behaves

you could try the block of code in the * method which is called earlier than *

if you re simply looking to * the value from your cross table you shouldn t need anything more than the * * items menu

term * is more appropriate for run-time dynamic * *

ironically enough its object model * more details than it * - good for learning but bad for abstraction

you can * * the status bar on android 4.1 api level 16 and higher by using * * functionality

it doesn t * at all if * is called less than 0.5s after * and it * for at least 0.5s this prevents very fast flickering stuff that you might see with naive implementations

it displays things normally on the screen of course but when you go to print preview in ie7 the only thing that * is longer description. so in other words it * that first column and it also * the second column

can anyone help me to * it onload and * when is more than delta and * on scroll up when is before delta

* is simpler because it will * it for you automatically when it is done so you can save that code and it automatically waits for the animation to be done before hiding the element something your current code was not doing

for some reason * works better than show or simply removing a hidden class via * if you take that approach

if so then you can just pop lines off the array using * which is better than * for most animations

* is more useful than * here as it recurs automatically and you don t need to keep setting it

the use of one * timer is more preferably than several * timers

i understand from searching on so that * is a better way to approach this that * which i was using initially but i haven t figured out how to specify that the function needs to repeat

* is more relevant than * since the first method just waits for a delay and executes a logic whereas the second function is meant for repeating a logic on periodic intervals

and im not shure about this statement javascript likes * more than * which gives a little performance boost

keep in mind that using * is less efficient for this case then using * which doesn t require comparing times at all as it schedules the alarm to occur at a particular time as * will use more processor cycles to both schedule a check and then to compare the times

* is much more suited for countdown timers and things you need to run continually since * only runs once and you need to keep on calling it

* is better than * for this task

the * example does more or less the same * from an oop perspective

i want smooth * * animations instead setting visibility where * is slower than * animation so i ve used enteractions and exitaction of datatrigger

otherwise you will run into issues of trying to * and * at the same time if your delay is shorter than your *

the code in the * is far more interesting than the * should it not take precedence and be defined first

i think using * is more elegant and has more options for further development than passing them via *

usually in ajax * method is faster as it doesn t involve proccessing * fields and as you are only *ting information i would stick it

data should be in * or *.if you dont put your data in your form then you will have to use * which is less secure than *

is * method is better than * method if you use a form

is this why * method is more preferred than * or does it really matter in any case if it internally uses * or *

generaly * is shorter than *

but a * seems more logical than a * anyway

i m sure there s a work around to use * for emails but the alternative * is much more easier and doesn t require any hacks to * around

* is simpler and faster than * and can be used in most cases

you can feel like * is more secure than * all you want but it s a false premise

this blog * explains more on how to * an access token on android

i used * because is faster than * if you need it just to * a list of element for suggestions

more over it seems that * requests are more lightweight than * under high load

* is a little safer than * because the parameters are not stored in browser history or in web server logs. also data is not displayed in the url

after that is done you can go into security details where * is slightly less secure than * - see the comments for details.

when you use * data is a alot more safer than * and you can send large no

as far as security goes * is much better than * as the data is sent behind-the-scenes rather than embedded in the url making it the typical protocol for login info

an initial * request to a page usually costs less than subsequent * anyway so there s not much reason to avoid it

so for creating a friendship * method suits better than *

from a hacker s point of view a * forgery is much easier than * forgery at the first you only * a link at the second you need to point to a malware website with hidden iframe and autosubmit forms but both of them fail if tokens are checked

i m trying to * deeper with * and pre incrementors but am a bit stuck with the following expression

what i m trying to * is a page that displays 20 users per page will have pagination with the fallowing info it should show only users that have more than 2 * published

this blog * is more detailed but unfortunately does also not mention where to * the product key

using * is more secure than * in the sense that data shown into the url in * request but not in *

edit taking into account what was said in the comments though it looks more secure and is recommended by w3 see touheed khan s answer * isn t more secure than * and as riggsfolly said

i have simplified the app so the * is shorter but the basic problem is that if i * test in workouthandler - it cannot recognize methods in wardenstrategies or loginhelper unless i also include those files in the handler they are already included in app.rb

the * request is marginally less secure than the * request

also * is generally considered better than * for ajax calls as it doesn t have the same string length limit slightly more secure too

note that doing this will * the values via * var instead * wich makes more sense since you are sending via * your form

* is a better method in this case than *

hope you * the more clarification by this *

when * is better than *

is type * faster than type * cause i am curious how both work

you should check this thread why * method is faster than *

i need to create a menu based on that list but cannot simply list all * and * it because it is a busy blog and has more than 2000 *

on an unencrypted connection * is no more secure than *

however there s one thing we haven t considered yet - what if you never * more than 5 *

* has one more letter in it than * so it s less compact

a * request would not provide any more safety than a * request any half-decent web debugging tool can forge * requests

* is not any more secure than *

you can t * more than 20 * if you are a sandbox user

the pinoyyd * is neater and * straight to the point how do i authorise a background web app without user intervention

i can t help with the coding side of your question but if you re passing in a non-url input then the * method would be more appropriate than *

sometimes * is a better option in those read-only scenarios because it makes your url scheme richer and avoids these sort of * warnings

1 reading other questions about the rest method for this proposes i think that i should use * better than *

* is more often used on unsecure type of datatransactions like for example a searchform and * is used when you want to make more secure things like a login form

also note that using * is absolutely not more secure than * because the request parameters aren t immediately visible in url

so it is considerably less then what facebook states in their documentation at least looking by the date however by count it seems you * more than 50 *

this * is more to * advises and ideas rather than solving a problem

* is more secure then * and data transfer size limits are also there

however in the comparative table i linked * is listed as less secure than *

i believe * is better than *

because * method storing capacity of response is better than * response

other than the fact that * has one character less than * i doubt there is any performance difference

words like arbitrary processing and neither not safe make * sounds less secure than * when there is a choice

* is better but if you want it to be truly restful you should ensure that the uri uniquely identifies the resource and use *

more importantly in this case i think * is more appropriate than *

side note if you are attempting to create a new customer you may want to use * instead as it may be considered more restful as * s are generally for updating an existing resource but this is up to you

to * your code to run more than once * it in a while loop

as long as the dataframe is small your assumption that the * process is faster than the * seems true we can fetch all 5 items within one loop of while not q.empty

right now i would have to say the * method is better since it works and i could not * the webservice to work

when i * my loop counter variable pagessent in the watch window it *s optmized when i declare as volatile it still *s optimized but when the max value is set to 4 the loop exits properly but if max value is higher than 4 * stuck..

i m concerned this is going to * worse as we * more tests into the specflow project

* on the other hand can test accross a larger number of fields - ie its test is more specific than * comparisons

in the * method only if you re certain the ensuing * implementation is much more expensive than * which is not vast majority of cases
