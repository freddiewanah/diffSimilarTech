this is because your * system has newer system libraries than your * one

is there anything obvious in * that would otherwise be making sfphpview- render run slower than *

see but if you are using a * distro there may be shortcut instructions that make it simpler under * for example there are shortcuts in

i don t know why arch * is slower than * on your machine

i m testing some simple benchmarking calculations on win7 and * * 16 to compare the timings and being wonder win appears to be much faster than *

one one * distro fuser -n tcp 3000 will report a process if i own the process yet on another * distro i think centos it won t report the process even if i own it

recompiling * kernels is harder -- it will require working with * build tools

as for * being more stable than * for using as server it can be true in very rare occasions where the package is very obscure

i m in * wheezy which is much more recent than * 10.04

note that * software versions are older than * s but versions of opensuse software are newer than * s versions

just a tip but from personal experience i ve found that * works much better on low-end hardware than a modern * distro does
