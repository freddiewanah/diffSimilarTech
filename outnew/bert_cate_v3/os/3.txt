it is widely used to have a separated tag with the postfix -alpine in it to indicate that alpine * is used which is a much smaller base-image than the * image

* makes it easier to maintain groups of machines without having to manually update each one using *

i strongly suggest either of the first two options over the latter option as the latter option does not always play nicely with the way * and * handle transactions when more than one * are involved

sometimes a * distribution contains far more than an operating system but is informally referred to by a single name such as * and so the line between what the operating system is the * kernel and standard libraries perhaps and the applications that merely ship with that operating system the gnome and kde environments on * is pretty gray

* is more similar to * than it is to watchos although they all have some similarities

be aware that the bourne shell in * is more capable than on *
