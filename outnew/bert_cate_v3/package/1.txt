in either case * is going to add a tiny amount of overhead so it s likely to be technically slower than * but not by any meaningful amount like it takes 5.1 seconds to insert 20k records vs 5.0 seconds

note that while you could use * for the job it s not particularly better suited than regular *

you ll probably find that * runs faster than * but in my uses * was very easy to learn and use and handled typical crappy html as found in the wild well enough that i don t have need for anything else

it s generally accepted that * is faster than * ref

regarding * * is more efficient and in my experience can handle broken html better than *

how can i find all div and span tags with order preserved.with * it is very simple but i switched recently to * since it is much faster than *

* is much easier to deal with and usually performance is good enough but for large brute force algorithms like this * will probably be at least an order of magnitude faster
