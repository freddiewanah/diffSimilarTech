* is more forgiving in terms of well-formed xml structure see i had to edit the xml a bit to make things work for * and it s actually much easier to work with

possibly part of the reason of my problems is that the original code from ramnath uses rmaps while i m using * also developed by ramnath as it is more developed better integrated with * and of course includes leaflet

if you are on linux and have chosen blas and * from a repo it is very likely that they are much slower than *

also * is significantly faster than * in many cases for processing results

* is faster than * i think and has much better functionality while remaining relatively easy to use

i do understand that traditionally they are saying that * are stricter than * however what i do not get is the following

even when * editors support * their support makes working with .rnw files much clunkier than pure * .tex files

the * package is a bit nicer than * for making http requests in my opinion and it sets a user-agent string by default

* is newer based on * internally and is often even faster
