yet from my point of view * is more efficient that * and easier to customize than xtable

i have tried * too but * is smarter than * on this aspect

i ve found that even if * is faster than * for documents that size it s usually best to try to reduce the size to a few kb via regex or direct stripping and load that into bs as you are doing now

* also has more features and offers * too

* enables you to search for elements using xpath which i think is easier than using * s api

note that using the * parser is a lot slower than * s default parser

according to some benchmark tests * is nearly 100 times faster than *

alternatively you can use * module which is lot faster than *

* is at least in my experience more general than * from hmisc
