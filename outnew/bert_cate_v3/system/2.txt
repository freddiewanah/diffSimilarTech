but in my opinion for most sites * is a better choice than *

since * is a bit more complete than * when it comes to features you could define separate issues with custom field for your tasks

make sure you re using a source control system that supports branching and merging i ve had experience with * and * and while * is better * is free

if you want to a little bit further you can imagine use more powerfull scm clearcase * ... but maven integration is fewer not well documented and community provide less examples than * or git

i ve read that * contains less project management tools than *

yes * takes more time in cooking the resulting html when compared to *

an incredibly rough eye balling of the numbers they posted showed * to be 2-4x slower than either * or mercurial in the use cases tested

a lot of articles about * will tell you it is a lot slower than * or mercurial

for next projects i m going to try * seems more clean and hipe than *

i understand * is more of a * clone but retrospectiva seem to support agile methodologies via a nice plugin

* was written to be a better * than *

* is an open source ruby on rails application that supports multiple projects much better than * and seems to be much easier to administer

* handles multiple projects and sub-projects right out of the box and overall seems nicer than *

this is still accepted by calls like inet_addr and has several advantages all fields are fixed width there are only 8 characters to update and the * to * conversion is usually faster than * to decimal

in addition another coworker said * was a lot more popular than *

the other distributed tools are a lot faster * is slow as hell even * can be faster sometimes have much more useful features than * are developing rapidly while seeing any new feature in * takes years

* is better than * because it was designed to be - it s roughly the same thing with some simplications and new features

* is better than *

for all the reasons linked in the comment and elsewhere * tends to be a much better enviroment than * or vss unless you have some weird requirements - so if you can successfully import your history and save the company money i wouldn t see why the bosses wouldn t go for it

that being said i think * is better in every other respect and you probably shouldn t start a new project with *

* s issue *king is little better than * s...i know a lot of folks love * but i find it very inflexible
