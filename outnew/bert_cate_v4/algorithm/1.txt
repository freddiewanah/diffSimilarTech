furthermore * is much slower than *

des is the least secure * is better but i d go for the *

should be as fast as * * turned out to be much faster than * in software typically 5 to 10 times faster

why is * better than *

to be specific the * runs faster than * in the first test case and loses badly in the following 9 tests

this means that while the two underlying sorts it uses * and insertion sort are both worse than * for many kinds of data timsort only uses them when it is advantageous to do so

* is more sensitive to input sortedness in a positive way than *

it might be helpful to see why * is usually faster than * since if you understand the reasons you can pretty quickly find some cases where * is a clear winner

* is also more complicated than * especially if you want to write a really solid implementation and so if you re aiming for simplicity and maintainability merge sort becomes a promising alternative with very little performance loss

* may use more space than * i m not entirely sure and merge may be better for linkedlists

purely in terms of the number of comparisons performed is * always more efficient than *

the * algorithm is faster than * which is what sorted will get you when called on a sequence of objects via java.util.arrays.sort

technically * has a better time-behavior î nlogn worst and average cases than * î n 2 worst case î nlogn average case

given that it is possible to vastly reduce the likelihood of the worst case of * s time complexity via random selection of the pivot for example i think one could argue that * is worse in all but the pathological case of *

i know * is better since it is stable and doesn t have n 2 as worst case but i required to implement *

that way * can reach recursive base case more quicker than *

* generally runs faster than * but under some circumstances it can degrade to quadratic running time

i ve looked at the question at why is * better than *

depending on where i look people say * is faster than * due to its locality of reference cache hits etc

i had been taught that * is almost always quicker than * and i understand that there is some debate on this topic but i at least expected it to be closer than this

for the 10 tests on the same list the results should be quite the same at least all showing that * is faster than * or vice vesa

the only issue with applying that technique for the single source shortest path problem is that reweighting with * takes o mn time which is slower than * s o m log n

however * verification expect verification calls to be 100x issue is about 10x slower than * verification

* is also a better choice than * because it has much better breadth of support for signatures still considered secure by nist

what baffles me is that my * seems to be slower than * in both of the languages

normally quicksort is faster than * which is faster than *

typically * is slower than * and quicksort but that s usually under the assumption that comparisons are fast

* can be even much faster than * or 3* when the cpu supports *-ni

turns out this was a hardware failure the * commands need more power than the * crypto1 ones 50 more which the antenna failed to deliver at the reading range i was testing with

edit 3* is better than * in the sense that it s significantly more secure but still less secure than * but its performance is of necessity significantly worse than * * or twofish because you re essentially applying * three times

using * assuming it s a little faster than * and requires a smaller key and

this shows that the timings are sensitive to buffering and that * is faster than *

algorithms like * are much less user-friendly than *

if i do * i can create the stack while i m sorting but would this be faster than a * and then build the stack afterwords

so for instance * is faster than * in the worst case but slower in the average case

* has a better big-o than say * yet * performs much better in practice

in practice however * is usually faster then *

* time complexity is typically o n log n but it s worst case is o n 2 which is avoided with the switch to * since * is always o n log n but slower than * so it s only used to avoid o n 2

worst case for * is actually worse than * and mergesort but * is faster on average

in my tests * performs better than * by the way

these formats allow various data compression codecs note that * is now much more popular than * and can also provide other benefits such as fast serializable deserialization column pruning and bundled metadata

* is much faster then * at verification

* is much faster than * for private key operations so it should definitely be preferred over * when high efficiency is required unless * is still fast enough something that may very well be the case
