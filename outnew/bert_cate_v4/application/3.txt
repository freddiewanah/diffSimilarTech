* has a stronger syntax than html and is easier to convert to * this way

in addition the need for polyfills for * complicates matters further as they may handle the interaction differently as can be seen in the sample below when using the button to load *

i wound up going with * and it s way better than *

so basically when * is more about how objects will behave themselves during application running the * is more about how you write your code before application running
