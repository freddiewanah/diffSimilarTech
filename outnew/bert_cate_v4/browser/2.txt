since you noted thoughts on other browsers would be helpful * s kiosk mode seems more powerful than * s

on linux * displays text about one pixel higher than * and opera

i have too problem with text in the * is bigger maybe bolder as in * .

in * it s less noticeable but in * it s very noticeable

in * the input button has more padding than in *

because of how * s plugin system works development mode in * is much slower than in * or safari see here for more details

suffice to say ie and * start having problems at larger heights than does *

you can see if you look at the bottom and right hand edges of both * lines up perfectly but * seems further in both directions and i cannot work out why either in firebug or * dev tools

when i posted this on facebook someone said that since * is open source project developers optimized math.min but * didn t since * is just a modification of chromium but beside that above statement is not quite right that makes no sense because that doesn t explain the reason why * s and * s math.min a b performs in similar speed and * s math.min a b and * s performs in same speed because if * is faster than * then * s math.min a b should be much slower than * s

and also does anyone know why is * so much slower than * in 3d rendering

what * displays is about 5 inches higher than what * displays

* is easier and better than * in finding the element from the webpage

however a sdp object local description by * does not contain datachannel at all and moreover the sdp is much shorter than * and less information bundled

* is a bit more strict than * here

* is lightning fast when you use the dom api but vastly slower using the .innerhtml operator by a magnitude 1000-fold slower however * is worse than * in some areas for instance the append test is much slower than * but the innerhtml test runs much faster than *

it works fine even for italics but i m aware that the user s browser is being asked to make a best-guess here and have noticed that * will make individual chars appear slightly fatter than * when i do things this way

better use * even thought * is not slower than * for once probably the tracing for the image comparison pays off yay

often * is understanding more thing then it should and * is bringing you the reality back in your face eheh

* has a more advanced plugin than the * extension but both work

i ve tested the sample on * and it s a bit slower than * but usable

* gsap performance is still much worse than in * but * gsap does still lag every few repeats or so while in * the css animations do not

if we remove the font-size it appears properly in * but shows up smaller in *

here the working header request with * bigger than * request

* is more tolerant when it comes to image headers then ie and *

on * it s significantly faster to do this using 1 0 but on * it s slightly faster to do this using bool

in my experience * has better javascript performance than *

in * it seems that this is 1px lower than in * and safari

this makes * 50x faster than * and 70x faster than safari is there any known reason for that

spidermonkey * is slower 50 of * max speed but the speed is consistent

i have encounter a problem with * that is similar to an older issue with * at this url scrolling blocks javascript execution in *

what s up with * that the debugger behaves less conveniently than *

use * rather than * - * with dev mode is much slower than *

* is slower than * which boats one of the highest javascript engines a modified version of webkit

* is even slower that *

i ve found that * is greatly faster with imacros than *

i have been working with linear parsers lately and noticed the performance in * v37 was much slower than in * v30

of late * has had much better performance than *

install firebug * version is better then a * one

so if something works on * it s more likely to work straightaway on * more than it is on firefox - but that s just a family resemblance at the end of the day you ll still have to test each as every webkit browser product and version still uses a different version of webkit

i planned on using svgs for the entire site but with only 20-30 svg images of medium to high complexity used in the page and google-chrome already seems to be showing som jank and high paint times for scroll and * is even worse though * seems to do a lot better

the service is still in beta trial and * conversion is working better than * one

so to specify * greater than 20 * greater than 9.1 and ie greater than 9
