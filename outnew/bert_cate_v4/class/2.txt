on second thoughts in your case * is surely a better candidate than *

i m not sure * is still better then *

i m not sure if * or * is better but * worked for me

* is more low level than *

* is much more complex under the hood than *

i think the problem happened because the padding left right of * is bigger than *

* has more features than * so it might be better suited and more easily adapted for your purposes

* also provides nicer interfaces for requesting data using blocks in that it allows you to combine them with delegate methods for doing custom authentication handling redirect handling etc. whereas with * if you suddenly realized you needed to do those things you had to refactor your code to not use block-based callbacks

* is newer than * if you are using swift language then you can use your own custom methods by using * or you can use alamofire

i don t see any reason why * could be any faster than * in this case

somewhat good news you could move to * which is much better at handling utf8 and is more modern in general than *

my understanding is that although * is newer it s not necessarily better than * it just provides a different api that might be considered simpler but doesn t that depend on the use case
