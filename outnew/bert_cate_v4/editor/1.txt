i had previously used * 3 for a couple days and may have come to the conclusion that it is better than * at actual html css coding

you can customize * and i think you will like it better than *

lately i have used * a bit more than *

this is the one thing i think * does better than *

* is a better * for macs though that won t help you with solaris

i think * is equal to or better than *

i like the idea of the of editing inside the terminal and like the key bindings of * but the text highlighting in my * is much worse than in *

though similar in ui and ux * performs significantly better than * especially in heavy lifting like working with large files complex snr or plugins that do heavy processing on files buffers

it looks like * is slower than *

when i m in a hurry i use * purely because it is quicker than * edit
