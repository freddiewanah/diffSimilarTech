but i ve found that * 2 has some features i like more than * and also tm v2 which is in beta

that said modifier keys are important in * even if less than in *

i ve used * for 10+ years but never really into * scripting always subjectively beliving that this was one area where * was weaker than *

cut and paste in * takes more steps than in * iirc

and i tend to think that after a moderate amount of customisation of either one * will still start up faster than *

since * is much older than the extensible * as opposed to the relatively non-extensible vi it has a much larger collection of extension modes covering almost any purpose you can imagine

plus copy as rtf for * has more recent updates than sublimehightlight for *
