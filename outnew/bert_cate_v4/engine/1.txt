at the beginning the insert performance of innodb is almost 50 times slower than * and * is 40 times slower than *

the benchmark shows * is 2 to 3 times faster than * on a normal page

double has its * floating point definition which is also much more complex than *

* seems to be more mature than * judging by the amount of applications and games that is

it s called web audio api and is currently a draft but is well supported by * you ll need to use prefixes and a little less by *

* is stricter than *

so the easiest way is to use one either * or * * has probably better support for svg these days plus i can t find package of * right now

* is often faster than * in terms of raw performance mostly because it is not acid

* has better crash recovery while * is poor at recovering data integrity at system crashes

* is better than * when you don t need those advanced features and storage speed is more important than other concerns

* is slightly faster than * and implements the fulltext index which is quite useful for integrating search capabilities

mostly * is better choice than a *

* provides more complex keys structure than * foreign keys and regenerating keys is really slow in *

* has a higher resource consumption rates then * so keep that in mind

* doesnt read number of rows from stored cached value like * does if column is not null cause * is more optimized for writing than reading opposing to *

for an oltp type system * is usually more sensible than * did you check the contention before trying a different engine

* is more space friendly than * you can start with that one

* has historically been viewed as faster than * but for recent versions of * that is true for a much much smaller set of use cases

* is usually much better than * at tables being available while insert update and delete are happening because * uses row level locking for updates whereas * uses table level locking

finally even if somehow you could manage * to perform better than * that doesn t mean * is inadecuate at all

* is actually faster than * in quite a few cases so it depends on what your application s mix of selects updates concurrent queries indexes buffer configuration etc

if you have so many records in the table then the first thing is to change the table engine to * if its not * because for large number of records * is much faster as it caches the table data while on the contrary * engine only caches the indexes so each time it has to do a full table scan from disk if the data required cannot be fetched from index

most of the literature that says * is better faster whatever then * is old literature

* has more overhead but uses row-level locking so that reads and writes can happen concurrently without the problems that * s table locking incurs

* is not faster than * anymore for most types of queries

* is newer while * is older

2 - i have read about * vs * the conclusion for me was that * is faster when it comes to read-only whereas * is designed for tables that get updated or inserts more frequently

* generally performs faster because it lacks certain functions * has such as rollback... but it has only table locking

if you are not using transactions while storing or updating tables switch table type to * its quite faster than * with much less overhead

* is relatively newer than * and is transaction safe

* is more strict in data integrity while * is not as

edited to add * is faster than * because it is simpler

newer versions of mysql 5.5+ have extended * to support all the features that were previously only available on * such as fulltext and geospatial indexing and * performance is usually considerably better than * when configured properly

* is a better choice as * is really old engine and would fade away in near future

there is a difference between the different storage engines though * is faster for a lot of select * is faster for a lot of insert update because it uses row locking instead of table locking and the way it handles indexes

* is often faster than * but isn t safe to use in a production environment for critical data

* is transactional so inserts will generally be slower than *

it is said that if you have a mostly read based application you should use * as it is better than *

why is * so much slower than * in my case

* is more concurrent than * since it provides row-level locking

if your database has a large * buffer pool and a small key buffer then * performance is going to be better than * performance especially for large tables

oracle has kept improving * by so much that they declare that it is better than * in virtually all situations

put another way let s say i start with a new * table and insert 20 gb of data assuming that 20 gb incorporates all the excess * stuff i realize data stored in * is larger than * then i delete all data then i insert 10 gb of data

if you find that * is much slower for inserts updates bear in mind that it offers a much better level of durability - if you tune it for approximately the same durability as * then you ll see good performance hopefully

* consumes more disk space than * -- typically 2x-3x

it is a massive over simplification in some cases and plain wrong in others to say we know that * is faster than *

* is more scalable and * doesn t support any of the properties of acid

with * there is less time lost from table locking while * is faster in table readings

after all * shouldn t be slower than * when using count + where but that s exactly what is happening here

so for such an application is it will * be a better choice over *

* shouldn t be much slower than *

even this blog from 2007 shows benchmark results that * is on par with or faster than * under most workloads

* -- more effecient than * because of the way the primary key is clustered with the data in *

the script was tested using * and it indexes products relatively fast much much faster than *

the engine is * i ve heard people recommend switching to * but many others said * is faster with large amounts of data in terms of counting and * better for safe transactions

3 a first of all if you haven t done yet change the storage engine to * which has row level locking and in newer versions of mysql has more optimization than * has

so that means that in practice an * write will take 3 times longer than a * write

* is almost 4 time faster than * which is not acceptable in the environment we are working as i mentioned earlier that every second is worth many dollers for us

i ve also noticed that * is significantly faster and more stable that the old * based widgets

unfortunately * has much worse and poorer integration with the rest of qt facilities than *

either way i intend to use * partly because i have lots of experience with it and partly because its much more well documented and has much more functionality than blade and to me the syntax is slightly cleaner than * although the template engine is not the point of this question really

template engines are rarely the cause of performance problems even if * is slightly faster than * i doubt the effort of learning a new template language etc

i use * on tables of up to 18 billion rows and nothing else comes close it s at least 100 times faster than * for random inserts on big tables
