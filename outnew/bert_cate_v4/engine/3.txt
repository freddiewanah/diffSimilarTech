if you are targeting android you can use firefox for android by developing a webapp that has native * support and because of it will be much faster than * or other javascript solution

i m developing with canvas too and have found that * based browsers in general handle canvas operations quicker than * in most cases

* does support transactions and referential integrity but the trade-off is that it is a bit slower than *

in a thread i came to know that * is faster for reads * is faster for writes

* is more prone to locking problems than * i believe

* delivered 4.6x higher throughput than * while achieving

and now i have learned that * uses more memory at-least while reading than * engine so i am trying to change the default engine of mysql to use *

this is a huge performance boost look like * is much more quicker for fulltext in mysql than *

therefore accessing * consumes less resources than *

i am trying to compare the * and * write read performance but i am suprised that the * s read is much more slower than * while its write is much more faster this is totally opposite compared to what i have learned

i am not sure if this is no longer true * is faster than * for reads

in fact oracle is so sure that * is better that they removed * from 8.0

1 in mysql engines * is better or *

* scales better than *

you can also try using * since it s said is better than * handling bulk inserts with data already on it

oh and just incase you were thinking * is slower than * - the * implementation i tested was twice as slow in all counts

in some benchmarks i see that * is faster than * but seems i have a little improvement

also * is slower than * unless * is blocking for a huge select

i ve figure out that even though * has locking contention it s still faster than * in most scenarios because of the rapid lock acquisition scheme it uses

* is also being developed more than *

ok there are some cases where * is faster than * but rarely enough that it s worth putting up with the lack of acid-compliance

also i can t see your table engine but * is better for full text searching rather than *

* uses less memory than * and the actual data files are often quite a bit larger for *

in general it seems as though the concensus is to primarily use * but there are still some areas in which * is much faster than *

in terms of pure speed it is not always the case that * is faster than * but in my experience it tends to be faster for pure read working environments by a factor of about 2.0-2.5 times

their conclusion * has 30 higher performance than * on average

* is slower than * for most uses but can perform faster in certain conditions due to a better locking mechanism

* is the perfect choice since the database is almost only used for reading and * is significantly faster that *

* tables have smaller footprints than * ones myth

i heard * is faster but others say * can be fast also but it takes abit more to optimize it

* tables are about 4x bigger than their * counterparts

* tables are even slower than * tables for inserts and the delayed key write option is not available

* handles inserts with composite primary keys quicker than *

if you use * which i like better than * - although i still prefer self-restraint+plain php most ide s that support django templating should work with it since the syntax is nearly the same

* provides much better native whitespace handling recent * releases provide more interesting content controls #define #evaluate # literal block #

* is simpler than *

* is no way better than * 3d or am not trying to prove that
