from my personal use i experienced about 5 - 10 times less disk usage due to * s compression and it s much much faster than * or innodb

the maximum representable value with * 754-2008 binary32 is so the base 2 log of a number stored in binary 32 is less than * 128

* has a stronger syntax than html and is easier to convert to * this way

in addition the need for polyfills for * complicates matters further as they may handle the interaction differently as can be seen in the sample below when using the button to load *

somehow * seems to do better than * on the html5 single-page spec scripts and i can t figure out why at this point

in many discussions and even in mysql documents it has been mentioned that in case of updates * performs much better than *

speed does matter here * is still slightly faster than * especially for reads

although 4m isn t that many rows with contention and depending on your structure and database engine it may take a while i think * alters take longer than * because * requires whole table locks and handles concurrency less well

* table is much faster than * but no rollback is possible

* is faster but does not support the use of transactions like * does

you can also use compression on the tables to keep them smaller but * is vastly better than * at data integrity

* is a safer acid compliant engine with some integrity features that * lacks

use * usually much faster than * if your data base isnt transaction oriented

* is more resistant to table corruption than *

we know that * is faster than * when we don t have many concurrent updates inserts

* supports better locking semantics so if there will be occasional or frequent writes or if you want better data integrity i d suggest starting there and then benchmarking * later if you can t hit your performance targets

* table is a bit slower than * tables but i don t think it is a major problem as you told you are using drupal system is that a kind of mult-sites like a word-press system

as you know * table sizes are about three or more times smaller than same * tables

* has better crash recovery while * is poor at recovering

however * tends to be slower as *

* is faster when the query is simple but it s much slower in a high concurrent environment as its table level lock comparing to * s row level lock

in general is * faster than *

3 mysqlhotcopy inly works on * tables and in most applications you are better off with *

i know * tends to be a bit slower than * on counting but this is far too long

therefore * can handle higher levels of concurrency better than *

if there are many modifications of the data it s said that * works faster because it uses row locking instead of table locking like *

after testing it seems that * is faster than * when using when there is no where clause

in this area i think * s change buffer does a better job than * s do it now

* is faster than * for reads myth

in my opinion * use to be faster than * now they are pretty much the same in speed

* inserts are going to be faster than * so if you re logging data and retrieving it later that will be a win

to answer the real question why is * slower than * i can t give an authoritative answer

* is more susceptible to data corruption than * and usually * performs better because it caches both data and indexes

this also affects how it is stored which leads to * being slower than * on insert due to * requiring a full index re-write on every insertion

since you don t do updates i think * would be better than * in this scenario

i have heard that * performs better than * on read-oriented tables

* is worse than * and stringtemplate has got its own issues

probably you can take a look at * template engine which is much faster than * and velocity also much easier to use

* has a cleaner api lower system requirements and works better across platforms than * in my opinion
