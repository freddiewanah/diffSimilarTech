for example if your screen is 600 pixels wide and if the * * string takes more than 600 pixels to display you will not be able to see the end of your * *

it s possible for * software to make this a lot shorter with * but these calculations are hard and not everybody implements it

there s a post on the subject on the birt world blog here specifically relating to xls emitters although the tribix emitters mentioned should also enable output to * a microsoft format readable by word that is much more concise than *

* â any bit depth any compression lossy or lossless everything including the kitchen sink â and no better than *

it is even slower since i could only upload * which is way bigger in size compared with * and opus

if you are still having problems jdk 8 has the ability to play * files which are significantly smaller than * you may want to try this

* files are about 3 times larger than * files so it would need 1.8gb additional space to do the conversion

ok i am new to audio with unity but despite reading all the unity posts regarding audio adding 2 short .* clips i heard * was smaller than * to my app has added over 200mb

i understand that * is much smaller but it has worst audio quality when is compared to * files

if you ask if a uncompressed * which contains pcm data is better than * then yes but the question sometimes is how much this better really matters to the human ear and how much postprocessing you have to perform on that data

i found the production of * much better and easier than * because all windows * encoders i tried are not really good and stable whereas pretty much every tool can natively output *

wewtaco i noticed that your * file has wider dimension than the * file and i am guess that could be a reason the black bars are showing up

if your * files are coming out larger than equivalent * files it is almost certainly because your source image has more than 256 colors

paul points out that * compresses static line art better than * for nearly every situation

the * format is substantially less capable than *

icon size indexed * is often smaller than the same *

according to wikipedia the * format provides better compression than *

there might be some edge cases where * is slightly better because the * format may have a slightly larger overhead from metadata but it s really not worth the worry

but keep in mind that the * color palette is way smaller than *

but in that regard it is replaced by * which is generally smaller supports alpha transparency where * pixels are either fully transparent or fully opaque and most importantly * images are limited to 256 colors

* vorbis is better quality per meg than * plus no licensing legal issues
