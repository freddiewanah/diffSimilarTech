2 * seems a little better than * but not much

regearding your comment i also know that it can deal with * better than * and ogg that is not really the case

i ve heard that * decompression requires much more memory than * decompression

convert it to * 10-30 smaller than * on average

it might help to reduce your * file sizes smaller oh and i believe -depth 8 can only be used for * images

for example * has better support for transparency than * or jpeg

many people don t know about 8-bit * which is usually better than * in size.
