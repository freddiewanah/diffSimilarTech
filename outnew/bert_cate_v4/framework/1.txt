i have been reading about * but it seems a bit more complicated than *

in my view * seems much more lighter then * but i never used either one so i can t judge

* has the lower learning curve overall so i would recommend it over *

i personally use * which probably falls in to the heavy framework category but is at least much lighter than * and lighter than zend too i think

or would a tool like * be better suited than * in this case

it fills the gap between * and * more powerful than * and easier to use than *

i ve only done one experiment with * material myself and i wasn t experiencing any real performance issues at the time but i did read some people writing about it being slower than plain *

* has a better data store api than the one * has

with this in mind customizing the css of a * app is significantly easier than * for the simple reason that you control the markup

* probably has more resources than *

i would say * would be easier over * as the default ui elements look really good

i have found one benchmark in which * is faster than * and another benchmark in which * is faster than *

* is not better than * express the big thing that differs is the structure of it

* is more direct and simpel to use if you start to learn java * has more features but maybe is more complex

to be perfectly honest i * is way more popular than * at least here where i work and live

* offers you more options and possibilites how to run your tests and in which order especially something * can t

edit it seems * has more printed books as references compared to * on amazon

if there is a * extension or similar framework that provides a better solution than * then please let me know

since * seems to be much lighter than * i would suggest that you take a look at *

current task looks like * is ok for it since it is smaller and simplier than *

i m building an application in both bottle and * to see which i am more comfortable with as * is too much batteries included

both frameworks are fairly easy to implement * is much easier than * imo although * has a built in authentication layer that you can use albeit more difficult to implement in a client server scenario like you need

subjective * provides much nicer code coverage reports than *

i found * was even easier than * to set up

in my opinion this is a more elegant solution than jsf and i think * s ioc container makes it more powerful than *

i should also say that i have the token at ctx.request.get authorization * based i think it s something like req.header authorization with * in all routes

i ve found * to be really effective and surprisingly lightweight....it aims to be more lightweight than *

* is more often compared contrasted to * in that it offers a set of facilities outside of moq and or rhinomocks sweet spot

overall * is more flexible than * and a great base to build a web application and api on

but * offers far more than just doing away with the need for your own writables although that is in my view a considerable plus it offers fairly efficient serialization the choice between serializing against generated entity classes like * requires or using a so-called genericrecord structure instead and not having to have tagged data

* s admin is better and more customizable than * s appadmin

btw why do you want to use * it looks to me less powerful than *

i would advise you to try * it is very easy to learn much easier than * and it let s you re-use many existing components as well

unfortunately i m pretty sure you ll not find any packages or projects that migrates a joomla web site to * or maybe * which is much older than *

the consensus seems to be that * is easier to use but that * has the advantages that come from being open source easy to customize merge with other code community etc

i would recommend * as it is in my opinion equally or even better than * and it is free

but on the other hand although new the * package is actually more complete imo than *

* would make things even simpler than *

i already know that * is a more heavy weight approach in contrast to *
