* makes use of bindings better than * currently does

* has a higher learning curve than say * and cakephp

so what makes * significantly better than *

i m new to sever-side programming.some people told me that * is more suitable for beginners like me than *

though * looks more mature than * web api i m still a bit confused

our team use * as our frame before but now we use * as our frame because it is more light than * but we still use * template.

if you are looking for the latter then * is a micro framework that is considerably smaller than *

comparison between * vs * - why is * voted better than *

* doesn t provide this kind of thing out of the box - it s designed to be a little more low level than *

* s is better * s appadmin is for administrators only

thus i suspect when people say that * is much faster than * it is because of the loading and updating delays but the actual test execution time appears to be very similar

* has better support for parameterized tests than *

sriwantha * is a simpler framework than *

if you have a full version of visual studio 2008 rather than the express edition it integrates the inbuilt * much better than * does and cruise control also supports *

as wuliwong said sinatra and * are way less complex than *

sinatra and * are not automatically faster than *
