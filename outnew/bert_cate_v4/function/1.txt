* is simpler than * and can be implemented even more efficiently in places where the strings are known to be properly aligned

if size is known normally a non-naive implementation of * is faster than * since it takes profit of the cpu s data bus size

so i feel that on x86 * is faster than *

your macro with memset and * was not any safer than *

is * usually faster than * on most real platforms

the problem is that * is only slighly slower than * when i expect it to be about two times slower since it operations on twice the memory

but as that reference points out * is way faster than * and sha functions although it doesn t do a direct comparison to the object.gethashcode method i mentioned above

* of course does not process escape sequences any more than * would

so we can use * with sha512 to gain a very significant advantage over the phpass algorithm mainly because sha512 is a harder algorithm with more computation than *

using a non-reversible * such as * is much more secure and you can store the * value as clear text

or you could employ a request signing scheme in which certain request fields are * together with the password of the user basically sending the password without sending the password similar to digest authentication but you can use something better than *

the difference between crc32 and * is that * generates a larger * that s harder to predict

if the * function is more complex and cryptographically strong * or sha1 then it is theoretically not possible

all * functions have that problem but some are more robust than *

sha-256 uses 64 characters in the database but with an index on the column that isn t a problem and it is a proven * and more reliable than * and sha-1

however if you want to use the sha256 * alogorithm which is better than the * then here s a code sample

as an example of the second option i ll use * here because it makes more sense than * for random data but * would have identical usage other than the interpolation option.

marcus yes * is faster than * and faster than python but why

remember * is quite expensive action and * costs even much more than *

besides * is a better option than * as * can handle failures better

i understand that * and strtof are preferred to * atof since the former detect errors and also * is much more flexible than * when it comes to non-base-10

for instance * is better than * and you should be checking each time whether strtok returns null

use * it does better error reporting than *

you need to error check * and ensure there are as many passed before using them -- * is better than * as helps detect errors

i start off calling gets to fill the buffer then using * to convert the human-readable text in buffer to an actual computer int value - note that * is more powerful than * and uses long int instead of int as its declared type

all have more or less cumbersome and non-obvious error checking involving errno * is way much better than * in any case so avoid using *

doing things like 1000 successive * is much slower than doing one single * of 1000 bytes

you can also use * which is the more general form of * and is actually part of the sql standard

in some circumstances * is faster than case or *

* will go through the listed values and choose the first one that isn t null it s more portable code than * or ivnl etc

* is marginally faster than *

* will be faster i think because it has lesser function code implementation for itself making it faster than *

* can only have one input however it s been shown to be slightly faster than *

you can use * also in place of * as * is comparatively faster than *

i ve been told that * is less costly than * but research doesn t indicate that

sql server is probably smart enough to translate * into the equivalent sarg expression but if you are bent on using a function then * is a better choice because it is part of the sql standard allows for multiple values instead of just two with * and avoids using quite possibly the most confusing function name microsoft ever devised in *

in this case i would use * which provides more levels than * rather than the case stement

if i want to calculate a * and a * is it cheaper to calculate a * and a * or calculate a * then a sqrt 1-* 2 to get the *

so if we have a vector and want to calculate a component-wise function over it say * and * it is faster to use vv** from accelerate because it will pipeline the calculations of * and * for all the entries in the vector which is faster than u*g a for-loop over the vector

my question is is fast implementation of * x 0.5f faster than fast * x

and as tom karzes mentioned * is also better than using * for calculating square roots

actually calling memset after * is closer to calling * than the option you suggest

for this reason since * uses two arguments of type size_t it can allocate bigger blocks than * will ever be able to since * takes only one argument of type size_t

edit i m not a java expert but i think that in java members of new array are initialized to 0 or null so * is more correct than * in my code

bcrypt is weaker than * although still three orders of magnitude stronger than * because it only requires 4 kb of memory

as we can see copying manually with * is always slower than * because in this scenario malloc is guaranteed to allocate new memory and you re forced to copy the data in every allocation which shows us that * is indeed reusing the same address and enlarging the block size in some cases

the roundabout method i ve employed is to create additional columns with a regular * and counta formulae - in other words i count the number of countries a * has visited more than x times * and then use the counta to sum the number of * in that column who have visited x times

finally i also made a benchmark test which shows that * operation is slightly better than sapply * and significantly better than vectorised * alone

the structure of the * algorithm makes it less susceptible to attacks on properties of the underlying * algorithm

in few words * is safer then * but it is slower too

* is a little bit safer than * because you specify how many comparisons will be made at most

now if * is higher than 0 or * is lower than 0 on any axis it means that there just as many tiles outside of the camera scoop

* is more efficient than *. in general use * only if you have to

this means that * might be very slightly slower than * as it cannot make the same assumptions

while * will be only slightly slower than * due to the assumptions it needs to make about the source and destination in * they cannot overlap it should still be far superior to any standard loop

bad news is that the asmlib version of * is slower than the glibc version it is now running at the 300ms mark on par with the glibc version of *

if you know buffers cannot overlap * is fine and may in any given library use optimizations that allow it to be faster than *

why does * perform slower than * on my system

i changed out total for * which is more consistent with other databases sqlite *

with a lower order * that works better but then you lose the advantage of cubic *

note the use of std * is safer and more convenient than std * *

the various alternatives * * work roughly the same way * is easier to use when dealing with arrays and zero-fills the data while * is useful when you need to resize a block of memory

from what i can gather * generates much better random numbers than rand does however i haven t seen a way to seed it and i would like to just like using *

* is far more flexible handling the allocation of space for you with * it is up to you

one more edit if you want to use * instead which you asked about in the comments - and it s even safer than * since it will increase the buffer size as needed you would change to change the code a little bit

i m also looking for more examples and explanations of complex * more complex than * in common programming languages

in the case of overflow a free * pair costs less than * because of its internal hidden memcpy

if for some strange reason you can do the obvious * would be more efficient than *

see also why malloc + * is slower than *

malloc + * is slower than * under certain conditions

my question is why is malloc + * so much slower than *

* sha-512 offers a higher level of security and implementing a scheme where you stretch the * is even better do some high number of iterations of sha-512 - starting with the password+* of course

you can safely store the * in the db because working out a string from its * is just as hard when you know some of the string as it is when you know none of it provided the password itself is longer than the * and long enough and strong enough to take a long time to crack by brute force at least 6 chars with at least one case change and a number or non-alphanumeric i d say

this * is nothing more than a random arbitrary string that you concatenate to the passwords and it will make your * password unique

however if * source is greater than n then * will simply copy the first n bytes and will not terminate the string dest with a null byte because there is no space for it

the other suggestion keep repeating until x stops changing does not work either because for non-perfect squares x will alternate between the * and the ceiling of the root Ã¢ because of integer mathematics the term n x will alternate when x is slightly smaller or slightly larger than * n

you might want to give the data.table package a try check out the * function which is much faster than *

if your compiler can do this then writing functions in a way that the compiler is able to * is better than manually * the calls yourself

callee is too large message is printed by c1 when the size in bytecodes of the method being * is larger than max*size 35 multiplied by nested*sizeratio 90 on each next level of *

the keyword * is more about telling the compiler that the symbol will be present in more than one object file without violating the one definition rule than about actual * which the compiler can decide to do or not to do

in reality the * keyword has less to do with * code and more to do with allowing legal violation of the one definition rule

this allows you to use the assignment operator instead of * and requires 1 less call to * - the one you make

in term of speed square rooting is easy a few arithmetical operations for some newton-like method but it is not clear what asin does probably quite *tly * is likely to be one order of magnitude slower than * and thus one square root is likely to be quickier than those two transcendental function calls

there is a nice comparison of threads and processes here when is clone and * better than *

just wanted to add that using strrpos + * is slightly faster than * + end

the ansi standard function * is simpler than using * and decode which should be obsoleted anyway

the * function is used here because it is more portable than * or ifnull

* is probably better than * in most cases

dynamic memory management on an small embedded system is tricky to begin with but * is no more complicated than a * and malloc of course that s not what it does

it means a declared * is more than a pair of * methods getter setter

i.e * is actually better than the simpler * if you are willing to improve the code

the math.floor * method being marginally faster than * and mod

it should be in my opinion more strongly noted that password hashing with * is no longer secure and should not be used as others noted use * or bcrypt

if you compute the length of the string for unrelated reasons or have the length of the string from other resources it s unclear to me whether * is better or worse than *
