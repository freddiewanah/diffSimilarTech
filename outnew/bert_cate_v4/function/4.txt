* is fast alloca is fast copying the string up to the first n is fast puts is faster than * but is is most likely far slower than all three operations mentioned before together

* is usually faster than * for longer strings

* is faster than * and also enforces you to specify a buffer size

for example for small amounts of data an * optimised for large amounts of data may be significantly slower than a * that wasn t optimised for large amounts of data

information - use * as it s faster than * and we know

notice that * is faster than * unless the source string is much smaller than the buffer s size which is rarely the case with ip addesses.

while * gives you automatic de-*tion on function exit the stack is usually a smaller resource than the * heap and if you exhaust the heap it gives you back null

crypt with * is simply more expensive than *

obviously * is much more difficult to reverse even in this anything that will * to the right value sense then a simplistic algorithm like take the last two digits

valid choices for *ing include sha1 or * although sha1 is preferable because it produces a larger * and is considered cryptographically stronger than *

* finds 10 more * bytes and marks them as used

in addition to the previous answers the strncpy char pointer which seems unsafe for my opinion and the * which is safer but you need to remember to * it outside of the function and its inconsistent with the hierarchy of the program you can do the following

you will find that * works better than * here

but depending on the answers to those questions i m guessing that * might do the trick for you better than *

g_new and g_new0 both take the same arguments unlike * that takes less arguments than *

is * slower than * as one can give pre-calculated string length to it but * does not receive such information

* also uses a more complex construction in particular * over direct digest to make recovering the input password from an output value more difficult

* is still a little bit slower than *

* is more secure than a simple * or even a salt *

a key-stretching algorithm like * applies a quicker * like sha512 thousands of times typically causing the * generation to take 1 5 of a second or so

however using a * offers more protection against rainbow tables precalculated * tables so they re still worth using

this is the case here because * hello is greater than 3 your last * argument

generally speaking the * keyword is used more now to allow you to violate the one definition rule when you define a function in a header than to give the compiler a hint about *

but as the * code gets longer the savings for * become smaller so maybe you could just have a hard limit on the size of the code - any code to be * must be smaller than the limit

* is more efficient than * as it only evaluates the second argument if the first is null whereas * evaluates both arguments every time

2 however * requires all arguments to be of the same data type thus being stricter than * which will first attempt an implicit conversion

a * is nothing more than syntactic shorthand for a get set *

that suggests another aspect where a declared * is more than a pair of * methods that is more static type checking although it is undesirable here

using * is considered safier than * because the second one can easily cause buffer overrun

* could be better replaced by * which does some bound checking

if * is anything like * it will write one byte more than * returns to zero terminate the string

if not multiple * calls will still be faster than multiple * calls because the overhead of the latter will be greater

which is more efficient is up for debate but based on cpu bulk instructions which can copy an entire block of memory in one instruction * is probably faster as * would check each copied byte for a nul character
