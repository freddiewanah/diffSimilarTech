because of the above replace strdup with strlen malloc * * is slightly faster than *

memset behaves like * but the difference is that * copied the data as it is byte but * copies the formatted string as well so takes more time than * to execute

additionally if you have * then it is much more convenient than * + malloc + strcpy with identical result including the same obligation to free the allocated storage when you no longer need it

it is likely that you could do an sha * of 100kb in well less than 10 second though and though sha-1 is still theoretically flawed it is of higher strength than *

if you don t need the cryptographic properties then a non-cryptographic * or a * that is less cryptographically secure * being broken doesn t prevent it being a good * nor still strong enough for some uses is likely to be more performant

with a salt * is much more secure than without but you re better off using one of the sha * such as sha256managed

* is no longer secure and it can be broken with a good gpu no typo you can use your graphics card to break a *

in that case some * functions are somewhat faster than other * being one of the fast functions but md4 is faster and it is simple enough that its code can be included in any application without much hassle

but if you still wish to figure out the phpbb password encryption * it is no longer * in version 3.0 or higher and is a custom *

how does * know how much memory to be * d which was earlier allocated by * or calloc

* is also more appropriate than *

* is more correct of course you could just embed * over and over and over... but put that under a performance microscope and * may just win

* performs better than the generic * and better than having another and

note * is safer than *

you should use * to compare your strings it s safer than *

in addition as mats petersson said * is cache friendlier than *

since i provided a * example above your read loop can be much better written with * as follows

if you cannot tolerate that use * it s harder to use so use * if in doubt

the justification of * is that it s faster than 2nd * manual copy free

key strengthening techniques such as bcrypt or * are generally considered better than plain * since cracking them requires more resources

i don t know how safe could it be and how difficult is for the hacker to determinate the technique i use the thing is that the result has the same length as the * and is harder to determinate a * so if for any reason in the history hacker uses a rainbow table and catches a probable result it will be the wrong

a similar argument can be made for * functions * is generally faster but will remain in the same big-o complexity class although there is an additional size tradeoff * makes your compiled program larger if the code was being used in many places

a malloc * pair can be better than a * if you don t need to keep around the original memory

so that the * is more secure than *

the best solution is to write a custom version of * that is less weird or if you know the length of the input just use *

i was exploring around with c regarding * since most people says that it is safer than * additional parameter length to avoid buffer overflows

* is safer than *

* is notoriously unsafe as are it s cousins *_s and * although they are mildly safer than *

you d be better off using * for this as it s dumber than *

the second *ing function is * which supports many more algorithms and variants than * but does not support some algorithms that * does
