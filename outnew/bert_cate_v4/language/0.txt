while i think the move to * is prudent but i think it overstates the case to argue that * is significantly more secure that *

* is more strictly typed than *

after reading some related articles i don t think * is more effective than *

as craig revealed within the announcement of * it is said to be faster than * by far

on the other hand * is easier to learn especially if you have * background so it can be adopted during the time slowly and paralelly with using *

* will incur this penalty in fewer situations than * will for instance method calls to *-only protocol methods do not hit objc_msgsend but if the protocol is declared in * or if the * protocol is decorated with * such that it can be adopted by * objects as well then method calls to methods in that protocol adopted by * objects appear to be dispatched via objc_msgsend

as you can see the * example is more complex and error prone than your * code

* in that case would not be safer but less safe than *

as * is the older programming language for ios or macos applications * allows you to use those classes structs in your code

the perf hit will be ridiculous i know apple say * execute faster than * but this is low level so it will be harmless

* -documentary provides more content than the documentary for *

it is possible for * to be faster than pure * in things that you would traditionally use c or c++ for anyway

adding lightweight generics to your * api makes it easier to interface with * because your api gets translated more precisely

im new to * but i like it more than * as it looks a bit like java does to me from syntax wise compared to *

injecting code in a * application is harder than it was for an * application but it s still possible

this is because the * dictionary is more strongly typed than the * nsdictionary

* is stricter about runtime type correctness than * so duck typing alone is not enough

download xcode free and learn * or * * is easier to learn than *

* also prevents us i believe from overriding a parent class s property but also still lets us observe changes to that property--this is much better than * s approach

this article seems to suggest that this is possible by swizzling a fake location into apple s cllocationmanager class to be used by other apps but i am unfamiliar with the * code more familiar with *

* being a whole lot less than *

this kind of processing is most easily done with * which is more expressive than *

my usual rule-of-thumb is that * is better than * for simple tasks whereas * is better for complex tasks

i m doing a comparison of * haskell * and es6 and i m less farmiliar with * and * but i want to represent all of these languages fairly so is this good * code

what s the deal i thought * would be nicer than *

so yes it can be used with flash or rather pure * but it is a little less convenient than with * where everything is set up by the framework because it takes more under the hood configuration to be able to run all the necessary parts for remoting

* does not provide an alternative and any alternative that was provided would likely be less reliable as * does not have the resources that sun oracle ibm etc

here is a solution in * because i know that better than common * and have an interpreter for checking my work

for a counterexample i think * programs ran faster and used less memory than the * programs that preceded them mdash

i am not sure it can satisfy you but * test is 4 times slower than *

* has more momentum these days but there are plenty of good parsing libraries for * as well including the peg parser generator aurochs menhir and the glr parser generator dypgen

on contrary * is more c-like do not require explicit enabling of script running accepts relative paths case sensitive and loosely typed both are imho advantages for scripting language compared to *

especially as * is becoming more and more of a distant memory and the * language takes on a life of its own in conjunction with the core .net framework advancing

also developing enterprise application is such new languages java c# * rubby is easier that * because they rely on frameworks every body can write c# java code that function but it requires tricks good practices and some of imagination to write * strong and rehusable code

getting your project migrated to * is certainly easier when you keep the old * controls

can i safely assume that * result is more precise than * and discard the * result completely

biggest of all is that adding new features to your * application is more expensive than it would be if the application was in a better language like c# or *

common * is an image base language although usually to a lesser extent than *

i know that * performs better for some regex but will the * performance really be this bad in comparison

in * it s better to say * a decimal number like 32.98 is written 32 98 slash is used instead of point
