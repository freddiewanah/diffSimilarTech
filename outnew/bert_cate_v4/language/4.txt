there are multiple reasons why the * code is slower than the * code

note that * s arrays are much more sensible than * s

or is it merely a hint to whatever tool converts between * and * to better deal with * optionals

most importantly for your image processing app the compiler will optimize * code to run faster than *

* is neither easier to read nor understand than *

my view is that if in some cases * is faster than * it doesn t mean that all over performance of * is slower

* is more amenable to static analysis than * because it lacks the very dynamic template despatch mechanism

as dimitre says * is much better at this class of problem than *

all of * s languages can interoperate so your language of choice is up to you though the rnrs languages tend to go unused in the * community #lang * is much more useful for writing programs than any of the * implementations but they can be useful if you want to write programs that run on different * implementations

in free and turbo * file handling is much more easier than in * in * we have assign instead of assignfile and close instead of closefile

* is coco but much more compatible with * more functional and more feature rich

vb6 * though a little better than * in general still has many similar issues where for their domain they require much more boiler plate to do simple tasks than what i would like and have seen in other scripting languages

opengl is better for playing around and experimenting because you can easily draw triangle without messing with hardware buffers available on larger selection of platforms plus * is better than * because it doesn t compile into assembly

it s popular it s actively developed it has many libraries offering the features of a modern programming environment and * is somewhat simpler not to say better just simpler than common *

please consider also to use * for code generation that s much nicer than * and integrates smoothly with xtext infrastructure

the * zipwith is friendlier than the * list.map2 which requires the lists to be the same length

* is closer to c++ because of it s imperative and oo features but i recommend you learn * as it is more functional more mindbending and has more resources

* has higher level bindings to llvm than * the * ones provide some interesting type safety guarantees and * has by far more libraries to use 1700 packages on making it easier to glue together components

i would just use * but * s syntax is so much better than * s and * is pure and has cool features such as type classes

the inclusion of * code into a batch file is simpler than * and the translation of a small code segment from vbs to * is not problematic

when writing code in * as i am wont to do as i have never been a fan of asp.net and * is infinitely more elegant than * you can call upon the arguments collection

pacoblaze was written in * which like adam said less common than *

none of the .net libraries are there and there are some syntax differences as * is more strict than * is

avoiding them by modifying * is lot easier than fixing the issues in *

while * syntax looks more related to shell syntax like bash or tcsh * is actually more closely related to * or php or ruby

fortunately * 2.1 has a better alternative since it s supports the built-in calendrical types from * 1.3
