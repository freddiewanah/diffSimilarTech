by looking at the google groups for qjplot and * the support for * is better lot s of unanswered questions at the * group

also linearsvc class from * performs even better than * whch is also surprising considering that it s a wrapper of *

usr local lib python2.7 dist-packages * sandbox cuda init .py 600 userwarning your * version is more recent than the one * officially supports

the use of * is also a performant option but slightly lower than *

* routine *_gemm has higher performance than * in some cases

* is definitely not slower than *

if i remember correctly * argued they were faster than * because the use non-native functions for key operations

i am stunned right now seeing a * performing 100-150 faster than * in even simple native functions such as array.every in chrome

other useful pieces would be * for database access much simpler than * or other full orms async-httpclient for doing calls to other web services

* intrusive_ptr performs better than shared_ptr because it doesn t need a second * to hold the reference count

the latter doesn t do any dynamic memory * and is more than 10 times faster than std to_string on * karma benchmarks

just to goof off a version using * string_ref is much faster still due the reduced *

to be able to use std allocate_shared with * fast_pool_* as the * method using g++ 4.8 or higher with * 1.56.0

* is more developed and tested generally since * came out later than rf

i m using the module * in my python script and many more such as * and numpy etc * module only works on python2 not for python3

on the downside * is less mature than * so it has less features and documentation available

* s io stream might be a better solution than * s own stream

i don t want to use * because that s a library i haven t used extensively yet and i m doing this partly as an exercise to gain greater mastery over the *

customization and variety of animations * has more customizable animations when compared to * javascript charts

if you re using retrofit and okhttp to perform the network calls i suggest you use * as it s also from square and claimed to work faster and better than *

this should be possible maybe be aware snap.svg isn t so compatible with older browsers in which case you could look at * which is snaps older brother * is very well established as well

* is much harder to learn than * but in both cases you will also have to learn svg to be able to create better animations

* supports older versions of ie whereas * is based on current web standards

but adding a class to * package seems harder first because there is different jars depending on the operating system used org.eclipse.*.cocoa org.eclipse.*.gtk .... and also because copy pasting the code of * is not that easy since there is call to external methods waiting for a strict *

* is svg and as such it is much more dynamic than * you can restyle graphs with css attach events perform animations etc..

there s a known bug that when you install the googleads library using pip it will install a newer version of the * library which will break my google analytics api scripts because the * uses an older version of *

and how do the differences make * faster than *

* s api is also a bit richer than * s api

the situation is critical if on some platform * provides a narrower functionality and does not link to * which will not be available on that platform at all so the above command for linking will fail due to unsatisfied library dependency

* provides a simpler quicker way to build and train models in * at no performance cost since the models are still being run by the same * engine

i m not too eager for using * though since i m more familiar with *

even though i liked many design aspects of * and it is simpler than * imo * is the one to learn because imo it has far far better documentation examples etc

is * faster than *

the * library is much more popular than * and does allow you to avoid for while loops by using preficates and filter methods

i also recommend * it s much easier to use than * and have builtin sqlalchemy extensions

as a note * is way better than other libraries as * for real time applications

the * library for example can be easily inserted into an application to evaluate performance gains in heavily threaded applications where * tends to perform a lot better than * s malloc implementation

there exists a simd fork of * which claims to have much better performance than * or plain * but there are no comparisons to opencv

* also seems to be faster than * using better multitasking

* converted much faster than * although i did not test conversion with cuda processing

android plot and other free chart solutions mentioned here doesn t support annotations the only one is afreechart which is a port of * for android i am currently using it and it is awesome and has much more features than *

what you re looking for is linear regression and * is much better than * for this see

if * doesn t satisfy you for any reason you can also try * which does much more than * it s not only for images but the same rules apply

i have an app that uses the public part of the twitter api the on who not requires to login but with the update the login is required so i need to implement oauth i ve seen there are libraries like * who makes this easier but my app has a lot of code and i don t wanna rewrite it not now so i ve think to use * or oauth-signpost but i dont realy know how to

p.s. my recommendation would be to remove jsonobject conversion and instead return an object of actual class as internally spring uses * which is more powerful json framework then *

jemalloc and * with some setting changes can be more aggressive than * to release memory to the os - but again it depends on the allocation patterns

as noted in the comment by quandary the * library offers a more relaxed license mit compared to the commercial or agpl license offered by *

* is made to work with * 2 * 3 however is way newer than * and therefore * does not support using * 3

have a look at sift and surf and at * which has a good sift implementation and also implements mser and hog and is much smaller than *

* also has more features and offers * too

* is a higher level library above *

* is much more aimed towards gaming with opengl where as * is more worried about complete and perfect bindings to opengl opencl

* is more java-like whereas * provides more gaming functionality on top of opengl access

* is more of creating charts using canvas element of html5 and * uses svg

it seems * is more faster than * the average time of * is about 2ms while * is about 16ms does i make mistake when using *

* 1.6 now includes a low-level streaming api and a new parser which is actually faster than *

i looked at * metrics and it seems slower than *

try this lib that s a good one with the * we use only in the server side because * is more slow in the android than * at least in our test

code looks correct and even at its worst * should be no slower than *

* is more suitable if you have a complex deep json tree because * creates a lot of temporary objects which leads to stop the world gcs

very small object google * performs faster than * and simple json

* has better ajax support than *

when hdf5 storage can be accessed fast than .csv and when * creates dataframes faster than * why is * from hdf5 slower than * from csv

* is a more full-featured touch library has many swipe commands than * most upvoted answer

* is more about json-based persistence in the vein of * which can do json too and sounds a bit too heavyweight for just an applet

the chapter starts with short course to xml general talk but with the atom syndication feed example then it continues with the standard xml.etree.elementtree and continues with third party * that implements more with the same interface full xpath 1.0 based on *

i have found though that since i started using the asset_sync gem which uses * instead of aws-s3 gem i don t have any more trouble with * and s3

here in so i found a lot of questions asking something similar and the answers normally said you can use * or asm or * is better than * or bcel is old and is dying or asm is the best because it gives x and y

also * is recognized to be slower than *

the javadoc of * is way better than that of *

you should check out losswise it has a plugin for * that s easier to use than * and has some nice extra features
