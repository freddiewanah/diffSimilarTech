i am using the * method in java to try and check if a certain date is greater than or * than 24 hours after another date

you need to call the * method which will indicate the result of the comparison by returning an integer less than greater than or * to 0

and my guess as to why an element is being dropped is your * method never returns a 1 in any case so elements are always considered to be less than or * to other elements which is probably screwing with the treeset

the * method returns one of -1 0 1 depending on whether or not the argument is less than * to or greater than respectively

icomparable declares the * method which returns an integer that specifies a less than * to or greater than relationship between two objects of the same type

per the page i linked to * returns a negative integer zero or a positive integer as this object is less than * to or greater than the specified object.

* seems to be much faster than *

the use of one * timer is more preferably than several * timers

well * and * essentially try to do the same thing but for your case * method will be more accurate than *

now a routine to initiate once per second - * is usually more useful than *

* is much more suited for countdown timers and things you need to run continually since * only runs once and you need to keep on calling it

using * is considered better than * because of the screwy ways that js s event loop works

for such numbers as 54321 the else statement will be executed never because any * digit is greater than max1 * the first two digits

* is less commonly used than *

i want smooth * * animations instead setting visibility where * is slower than * animation so i ve used enteractions and exitaction of datatrigger

the * complexity can be higher than the * and thus validate a unit-test

note that doing this will * the values via * var instead * wich makes more sense since you are sending via * your form

* requests are no less insecure than * requests

i m sure there s a work around to use * for emails but the alternative * is much more easier and doesn t require any hacks to * around

however * is a bit more safe than * because * could be stored in the history

you can feel like * is more secure than * all you want but it s a false premise

but a * seems more logical than a * anyway

in my opinion * requests are not more secure than * requests and the data can be easily intercepted

i need a query to * results from stackexchange dataset in such a way that it returns me 100 top reputation users with not more than 3 * body of * for each user

i noticed once the length of a * parameter is longer than 400 bytes or 2000 bytes for a * parameter g-wan returns 400 error

although * is more secure as compared to * when ssl is present

this * is more to * advises and ideas rather than solving a problem

* is more secure than * because you aren t showing information anywhere

note that i am assuming a user can * invited to more than one * which seems logical

because * method storing capacity of response is better than * response

* isn t more secure than *

so i have a * system and i want the box to * larger as more * come in

following my comment on your original * here s some more information that will help you * through this

as far as security goes * is much better than * as the data is sent behind-the-scenes rather than embedded in the url making it the typical protocol for login info

firstly * can seem more secure than *

when i want to * more than 54 * i receive this error

however * data are not much safer than * data anyway

* is a little safer than * because the parameters are not stored in browser history or in web server logs. also data is not displayed in the url

i think using * is more elegant and has more options for further development than passing them via *

more over it seems that * requests are more lightweight than * under high load

yes generally * is a better way of submitting data than *

using * over https is better than using * and http

is * safer than *

edit2 seems as if i m wrong re * being more secure than *

i think that in that case the * verb is more appropriate because * really means i want to create something new

side note if you are attempting to create a new customer you may want to use * instead as it may be considered more restful as * s are generally for updating an existing resource but this is up to you

now don t * me wrong regenerating the session id on login or more accurately as oswap * it on privilege level change is indeed a very good defense against session fixation

even though * itself should be fast it s not mostly faster than equivalent *
