is a generic type at compile time java will require that an instance provide an implementation of int * t o which from the javadoc returns a negative integer zero or a positive integer as this object is less than * to or greater than the specified object

if this works it seems that u are still comparing the strings in your ordered list and u should now check if the return value of * is less grater * to 0

* returns a number that is less than * to or greater than zero corresponding to the first string being before the same as or after the second string respectively

note that in both cases you can take advantage of the fact that int also implements so you can use its * method to determine whether corresponding values in each instance of your class are less than * to or greater than each other

in the * method you can then write the code which will call the getters for the year month and so on until it figures out whether the current object is less than * to or greater than the object o being passed into the * method

all i changed was the first * comparison to be less than instead of less than or * to

this interface defines the method * t which will return a negative number zero or a positive number if the first object is less than * to or greater than the other one respectively

according to javadoc * needs to return a negative integer zero or a positive integer as this object is less than * to or greater than the specified object

i know that in java there is a * method that you can write in a class that will compare two variables and return a value -1 1 or 0 signifing greater than less than and * to operations

most likely hashcode will be faster unless for whatever reason calling hashcode + * once is much slower than calling * log n times

the interface defines one method * that must return a negative integer zero or a positive integer if this object is less than * to or greater than the other object respectively

with this rather than needing to implement a comparator all you need to implement is the int * class o method in the class which returns a negative integer zero or a positive integer as this object is less than * to or greater than the specified object.

implement * in temporary temporary.* left such that it returns a negative integer zero or a positive integer as temporary is less than * to or greater than the left

when one of the strings is a prefix of another the performance of * is worse as it still needs to determine the lexicographical ordering while * won t worry any more and return false immediately

or is it * returns negative numbers 0 and positive numbers respectively indicating whether the calling object is less than * to or greater than the specified object

* returns a negative integer zero or a positive integer as this object is less than * to or greater than the specified object

* defines whether your base student is greater than less than or * to your studenttocompare and you can define these with any criteria you please

if the value of * is greater than * then an active touch is going on

if the value of * is more than 3 seconds beyond the current time and the time of * is still before * then it s time to show your hint

no - * is for seeing if one object is greater than * to or less than another

for me they serve pretty same purpose to hide complexity * accordion is imho better for continuous-reading it s easier to quickly go to * section while tabs seems to be more random-access

now i would like to take the ceiling of this number * in cases where the amount it is greater than the * lower integer is smaller than some epsilon

other than the fact that * has one character less than * i doubt there is any performance difference
