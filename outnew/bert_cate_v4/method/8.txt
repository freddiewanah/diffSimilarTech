you can * * the status bar on android 4.1 api level 16 and higher by using * * functionality

the plugin defaults to requiring a * request to logout but using the config setting you reference you can make your application more convenient to use but less secure by allowing * or * requests

it is just an example that shows a scenario in which * is more secure than * but i don t think it would be a good idea to choose * over * from this attack reason

why * method is faster than *

when i try to * more than 100 * it returns

after that is done you can go into security details where * is slightly less secure than * - see the comments for details.

i need to create a menu based on that list but cannot simply list all * and * it because it is a busy blog and has more than 2000 *

in this case * may be better than * anyways

is * method is better than * method if you use a form

maybe i would mostly always choose * over * it s more tidy and refreshing and going back issues with * method are a thing from the past in any major browser they just ask you if you want to resend the data don t they

i m searching for the best method to * result with database contain more than 100000 * and more than 100000 cat

i normally use something like this tag.object.annotate num_* count * .filter num_*__gt 2 to * tags with more than 2 *

*s have a size restrictions * do not or at least it s a configurable setting on the server and has a larger higher end than a * request would

the * is usually faster because it has no encapsulation sends data via url usually with a 255 character limit as * exists encapsulation by being sent by the body of the http request

although putting data with * method little harder than simple *

i * somehow category repeated if it has more than 1 * eg

in my opinion the second way to achieve this is better because using * is not thats ecure in my opinion.it s easier than using *

there is a default limit of * method which is 2mb which is way higher than *

on the php docs link above they say a * request is much simpler than a * request when uploading file along with this advantage what other advantages disadvanatges do the * has got compared to the *
