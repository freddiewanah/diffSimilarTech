this is easy to implement with buttons select items click up or down buttons to * - just loop through and apply the * to each selected item but much more difficult with * reordering

note that i ve incorporated dshin s comment that * is faster than * however the performance improvement is about 90 removing the binary search 10 multiplication vs

but in normal case it takes n 2 comparison so you half the height of tree but you * each merge with two so total running time is not better than * to 2 part

these can be compared to * by 2 x left-shift or divinding by 2 x right-shift but it should be noted that a binary shift is much faster than a * operation

addition * for the rectangular bound calculation is cheaper than *

in * for doing powers of two bitshifting is usually a little clearer than doing * though choose whatever works for you

i must also add that designing the rsa key so that the private * is substantially shorter than the * to speed up operations is a security risk if the * is smaller than 29 of the * length then the key can be cracked

1024 bit private * large number lower than the *

if the * is truly faster than the * then i expect somebody well-versed in byte code could explain why the load_fast for num is faster than the five operations for line 12

* is much harder than *

for example 1 + 2 3 is treated as 1 + 2 3 whereas 1 2 + 3 is treated as 1 2 + 3 since * has a higher precedence than * +

just like it would be possible to come up with arithmetic expressions that could be written with less parentheses if * had a higher precedence than *

* is more expensive than * subtraction and division is more expensive still

on simple low-cost processors typically bitwise operations are substantially faster than division several times faster than * and sometimes significantly faster than *

this line works because of operator precedence * has a higher precedence than * + so it will be done first

* has a higher operator precedence than * so it s done before the two *s when calculating the value for a

also remember * is much more expensive than *

the * are the bottleneck of the calculation even though they may be one instruction a * takes longer than an *

and as you hopefully knows * have higher precedence than * so the expression is equivalent to probably not what was intended by the macro writer

for * the technique described at is a reasonably easy thing to implement and is better than serial *

at the time this was faster because * was a lot faster than * but that s no longer the case

note that the type cast has a higher precedence than * which is in turn higher than * 3 vs

on a cpu with a fast multiplier * may only be on the order of 4 times slower than * but on normal hardware it s 16-32 times slower for a 32 bit operation

functionally a * will always take more time than an * because it combines a true * along with a true *ition step

then i think it would be the problem of precedence in most case they are left-to-right and i think * would be calculated first because in c * is more prior than * instruction by one level

its the * that historically was slower than the *

as of a few years ago * was 3x slower than *

to give * and divide higher precedence than * and subtract you can do something like this example adapted from john levine lex yacc 2 e 1992

note that is equivalent to i 10 but much faster since * is around 10 times slower than *

i don t think they have a natural precedence unlike say multiplication and * being of greater precedence than * and addition because they can be built from * and addition

in this case * has higher precedence than * parenthesis around the * or not

knowing that a * is much more costly than a *

it s just as fast as going the opposite direction if not faster given that * generally takes longer than *

on some machines * is much slower than * but on most machines j multiplies and j divides will run a lot faster than 2 n-2 * and one *

formally it means * cannot have a complexity worse than *

if you think back to grade school you ll recall that * was harder than addition and * was harder than *

even simpler and probably even faster because * is faster than * is dav s answer which is the most natural algorithm.

the only way it would be broken up differently would be if * had a higher precedence than * like multiplication does

multiplication and * are higher precedence than * so they get done first - before the implicit conversion to string for concatenation
