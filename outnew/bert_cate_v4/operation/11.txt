* first field from the other and if the value is not greater than 0 * by -1

since * has a higher precedence than * you should subtract 0 to your digit character before multiplying it

usually * has a higher precedence than * but the grammar you have posted has the reverse that might be part of your problem

also * is faster than * and * is faster than division

trig functions should have precedence lower than * and higher than *

proposition when implemented in logic gates using the usual algorithms an integer * circuit is o log n times slower than an * circuit where n is the number of bits in a word

as i said this may increase the speed especially in an environment where * is more expensive than simple * but you would want to actually benchmark it to be certain

* takes a lot longer than * - just do it with pen and paper to see

is * more expensive than * in c++

removing * operations by passing through the inverse into the shader is another useful tip as * is typically slower than *

this solution has the disadvantage that if the other factor is not constant the compiler and you can t reasonably avoid the * int_max n to be done at runtime and * is normally more expensive than *

* is slower than * is generally - and definitely using regular expression matching is going to be slower than * is..

for * things are a little more complicated than * see

as to why * is faster than * and when the divisor is fixed this is a faster route

* is less expensive than * so

in some of the academic literature implied * is interpreted as having higher precedence than *

your friend has a point a * actual * not just writing in c is slower than a *

* is generally on the order of 10x slower than * on most processor families
