this * operator occurs within the second brackets and so has a higher precedence than the *

* is a relatively complex operation and is likely to be slower than say * or comparison

* is not more difficult than repeated *

if we look at the speed of operations * is not drastically slower than *

yes pow is slower than * * is slower than *

however in general one could expect that a * is a more expensive operation than a *

i have heard * takes more time then * but beyond that i could not determine whether writing this in one line or multiple assignment lines was more efficient

* is usually faster than *

it s possible though that software could mess things up by making * slower than * - but that s unlikely

the * operator has a higher precendence than the * operator so your function is calculating 1 1 + e -x
