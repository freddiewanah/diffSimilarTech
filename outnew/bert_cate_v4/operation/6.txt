however * is a more complex operation than * or shifting

if * is slower than * then case 2 is slightly slower than case 1

* is slower than *

and has higher precedence than or just like * has higher precedence than *

since * has more priority than * when you give a+1 to the macro it becomes 10 + 10 + 1 21

i don t understand why the division * in c++ is so much slower than * subtraction where the managed c# version is more reasonable to my expectations

that s akin to * has higher precedence than * so 3 sticks to 4 instead of 5 so the output is 17

if * is slower than * instead of doing

where * binds more tightly than *

it appears that you consider * to have lower precedence than * and division when in fact it does not

without parentheses math.exp c b is executed first as * has higher precedence than * -

this is called a strength reduction optimization because * is stronger slower more expensive than *

that s because the * operator has a higher precedence than the * operator -

hardware integer * is always slower than * and the gap in the relative latencies of these instructions continues to widen

integer * is much faster than *

* is faster * is more accurate

on most processors * is slower than * for the same data types

since * is of higher precedence than *

* is slower than * due to some reasons

the reason for doing so is to reduce hardware cost as * is more expensive than *

* is much more expensive than *

* is about 10 times slower than *

* takes less time then * so you can try this

both works but * is generally slower than *

i read that * has has higher presedence than *

as a rule of thumb * is faster than * on all cpus

* is usually significantly faster than *

in usual programming practice one wouldn t bother and simply multiplying by the floating-point representation of 180 Ã¯ because * is so much faster than *

i haven t benchmarked any of this code but just by examining the code you can see that using integers * by 2 is shorter than * by 2

according to this author integer * can be 40 times faster than integer *

in a 64 bit application this code will be a lot faster than in a 32 bit application in a 32 bit application multiplying two 64 bit numbers take 3 * and 3 additions on 32 bit values - however it might be still faster than a * on a 32 bit machine

so * is always a bit worse than *

integer * is about an order of magnitude slower than * on current cpus.

since * has a higher precedence than * 5 2 gets evaluated as a integer * returning 2 as an integer

with careful optimization however you can make * 61 times faster than *

multiplication and * have higher priority than * and subtraction

however with really very small parameter 2 in your case * is faster than *

this is analogous to the way you can compute * using successive squaring much faster than by repeated *

the misunderstanding is that incrementing the * is not faster than doing a *
