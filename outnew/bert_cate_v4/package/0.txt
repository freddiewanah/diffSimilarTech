in either case * is going to add a tiny amount of overhead so it s likely to be technically slower than * but not by any meaningful amount like it takes 5.1 seconds to insert 20k records vs 5.0 seconds

* is more suitable for html parsing than *

according to the above posts and my own experience * is definitely faster than *

the reason for using * for such a task is that it cleans html files better than * do

how can i find all div and span tags with order preserved.with * it is very simple but i switched recently to * since it is much faster than *

* enables you to search for elements using xpath which i think is easier than using * s api

it s generally accepted that * is faster than * ref

* is much easier to deal with and usually performance is good enough but for large brute force algorithms like this * will probably be at least an order of magnitude faster

in the first example * is 3x slower than data.table and in the second its 200x faster than * and 100 times faster than data.table
