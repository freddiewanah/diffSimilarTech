yet from my point of view * is more efficient that * and easier to customize than xtable

could i use * to do this more succinctly than running * and dcast separately for each of employed girls guys

regarding * * is more efficient and in my experience can handle broken html better than *

i do understand that traditionally they are saying that * are stricter than * however what i do not get is the following

* will let you use xpath here which i think will be less painful than * s interface

pyquery is based on * so it s also much faster than *

i ve found that even if * is faster than * for documents that size it s usually best to try to reduce the size to a few kb via regex or direct stripping and load that into bs as you are doing now

* is at least in my experience more general than * from hmisc
