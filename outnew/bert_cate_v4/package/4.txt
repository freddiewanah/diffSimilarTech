if you are on linux and have chosen blas and * from a repo it is very likely that they are much slower than *

* is significantly more powerful and robust than * in my experienced opinion

one of the things that makes * better than * is support for proper css-like class selection or even supports full css selectors if you want to use them

speed isn t important here but in other applications it is good to know that regexes are very fast 100 times faster than * and 1000 faster than *

you might want to use r markdown and * which is easier than using * and r as also zhaoy suggested

* deals with badly formed html better than * is actively maintained * isn t and is a lot faster since it uses libxml2 internally
