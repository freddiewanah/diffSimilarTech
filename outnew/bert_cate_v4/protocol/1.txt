* is a more efficient protocol than *

* 2 is even better than * and check this article for a use case regarding *

in fact in some ways * is better than *

i understand that * has better performance than *

how * is better then *

plus once * becomes more common * slow down won t really account for anything much

you will notice that the * header has more fields than the * header and many of those fields will be populated by information from the handshake

* is way better then * for that

as an additional note my suspicion is that you d need to indulge yourself in some pretty sophisticated benchmarks before you could conclude that * is actually going to have higher performance than * for web services

* is connection less but at the same level as *

i am confused why * throughput is bigger than *

like matzi suggested * gives you lower latency and lower packet overhead as the header is smaller than * but on the downside the delivery of the packet to the destination is never guaranteed ie

2 * needs more processing at network interface level where as in * it√¢ s not

because there is no confirmation on * packets it s slightly faster than *

* mounts are more reliable and you know you have a network problem much faster than with *

* has less overhead than * and is therefore faster

it is worth nothing that in a link where * and * are sharing the bandwidth * is better behaved than * in that it will try to limit itself to avoid congestion

so assess the situation the development cost of a * transport is higher to significantly higher than * and to some degree you are re-inventing *

* is certainly going to be more reliable than * since * doesn t guarantee packet delivery which is probably why you application is hanging on the receive

you could get them to do a * multicast within a lan environment to identify the programs using protocol messages then have a stored cache of each other s identity and then use * to connect and do main exchanging of messages which is more reliable than *

* is more of a fire and forget whereas * maintains a connection state

note that there are exceptions to the above - for example * generally traverses firewalls better than * which may be blocked due to security to traffic policy reasons so voip speech may sometimes be sent over * for part of its journey at least

it was introduced since the nat traversal for * is much more complicated than *

* communication is connection less as compared to * which need a connection

* will almost always provide better performance than * at the cost of reliability

for example i read an experiment in which a stream of 300 byte packets was being sent over ethernet 1500 byte mtu and * was 50 faster than *

* gives smaller latency with many many issues to discuss here of course * gives bigger latency

this was surprising for me as it is well known fact that * performs better than *

* lends itself to real-time less latency than *

* is less reliable on a wide area network but in a closed environment of a vm talking to its host you can safely skip all the * reliability stuff

* should be much faster than * because there are no acknowledge and congestion detection

also if you have very limited memory processing resources it is worth bearing in mind that * is a less costly protocol as it avoids a lot of the overheads * incurs due to its inbuilt connection management

only when packets can be discarded unordered can * be faster than *

in practice this means that * is better suited for continuous transmission of data whereas the more lightweight * can be used when reliability isn t important

if the network between the two point have a very high quality * is absolutely faster than * but in some other case such as the gprs network * may been faster and more reliability than *

certainly * has more overhead than *

* is slower than * and you ll have to mitigate that in realtime multiplayer

maybe one of you guys already sees a problem in the code snippets or have any other suggestion or hint for me why my * transmission is slower than *

if your client connections are more or less permanent and not too many clients are connected at the same time * is only slightly worse than *

* is much better than * in terms of reliability

use socket for * and datagram for * its a lot faster than * but less connection oriented

if you re more interested in latency and small amounts of data then something * based could be better than * but you d need to build extra logic for ordering the messages and retrying the lost ones

in my experience * based code is generally less complex than * based code

* is subject to higher latencies than * as it requires the client to send back packet confirmations

you can use * as well but if you are dealing with firewalls it is probably going to be simpler with *

4 * is a slower than *

the decision on yours the * protocol used for connection oriented network that is more secure than *

i m trying to avoid *client because * is faster but would this work in * since it s streamed

please note however that this architecture implements * which is much slower than * and will not work for any type of fast-paced data intensive games but should accomplish your goals given your description above

yes * is much much lighter than *

* is faster and requires less bandwidth than *

* is a bit slower than * but more failsafe

at my company we have found memory mapped files to be much faster than loopback * ip for communication on the same box so i m assuming it would be faster than * too

* socket is even more likely than * socket but both work

what s currently baffling me is in my results * finishes almost 2x faster than *

* is significantly easier do you really need * btw

* ip is supposed to be more reliable than * ip see this comparison

* protocol is more complex than http or * form example

in real life * packets size usually is equal or less than * size
