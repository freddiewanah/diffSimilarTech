what happen when * is disabled in an router and when packet size greater than * how the router fragments that packet

any device in the path of communication between the sender and receiver whose * is smaller than the packet will drop such packets and reply the sender with * destination unreachable datagram too big message containing the device s *

one might want to define * access to more than one * server

in fact with optimizations like * you might find that a tls-secured connection actually performs better than plain *

as i understand websockets are on top of * and have higher latency than * that underlies webrtc when for example sending binary data between server and browser that also could be 2 peers in webrtc

push log files to a central location * is faster than * the windows * command can be automated with -s scriptfile

it may be that the kernel heuristics for servering * connections is more aggressive than for * sockets since * connections require more state and more continuous processing than do * sockets

in some applications * is faster better throughput than *

* is more popular in nat punching because provides much better results than *

for example * has much more flags window-length syn ack etc - and also starts and ends a connection in a very stable way - the three way handshake - while all * has is source ip dest ip length source port dest port and checksum

* is much faster then * but * has flow control and guaranteed delivery

don t think of it as * is faster and * is slower because that s just wrong

the problem is that * creates bigger packages of data while * uses 8 kb of data blocks

tldr * ip is more reliable than * but not a 100 iron-clad guarantee that nothing will ever go wrong

or is there any specific scenario where * is better than *

but there are some cases especially in iot domain * is more popular than * for its bigger transport overheads

moreover * has more processing overhead than *

if the data is critical you should go for * which is slower as compared to * which in fact doesn t guarantee the packets will arrive in order or even if they d arrive or not

does * always perform better than *

* is much slower than * but when the two machines are not on the same lan * is not reliable

* - more reliable than * but this comes with some overhead there is a distinct connection a better match for games which require less frequent data transmission such as turn based games as is your game

* is slower assures data arrival * is faster data corruption may be possible

i used iperf on two linux machines to send data using both * and * i found that * performs better than * average 65 better

one can say * has a lower overhead than * because its packets have a smaller header and therefore take less bandwidth to send the payload the data

* windowing is more expensive than raw * but if you use * to go faster and add a custom loss-recovery or seqno ack resend manager then that may slow you down again

while * has less network overhead than * it generally relies on you the developer to come up with your own mechanisms for flow control fragmentation handling lost packets etc.

we know * is better suited for this but the hardware development decided it s got to be *

if i d directly say that * is faster comparatively than * that it is used for such applications

but with the * protocol in particular this is easier than for *

since loosing some packets doesn t matter but speed latency is crucial * is much better than *

and there are no handshakings required * are pretty much faster but less reliable than *

* as you know * is faster than * even if * may miss some

if you can t afford lost packets then * is probably a better option than * since it provides that guarantee out of the box

as such traversing a nat through * is much easier than *

in general the * protocol manages the available network bandwidth better than the * protocol

most importantly you can easily supplement * with some reliable delivery hand-shaking that s less overhead than *

* packets are easier structured than * packets but sacrifice security for their size

if you care a lot about efficiency or really need tens of thousands of connections then implementing your specific protocol in * will always be better than *

try to increase timeout value * is slower than *

apart from that * packets by themselves are not slower than * packets and data transfer with a simple * connection can be faster than with a simple * connection because flow control and reliable transfer is already integrated and you don t have to reinvent everything again and often worse

in gaming especially fpss * tends to be the chosen protocol because it s much less chatty than *

the strange thing is that when streaming is done via rtsp unicast * generates both sender reports and receiver reports but when streaming is done via * multicast only sender reports are generated

it is optimized for downloading larger files where the setup overhead is amortized over the size and number of downloads http is very light-weight you can communicate to an http server using * much easier than * especially before passive * and is designed around html -- the concept that in the course of your navigation you will be visiting many different servers and grabbing only a couple of files at a time from each

yes i know * is better than * but right now i m stuck with *

i am working on * socket programming and i have to stop the transmission in application if requested data is more than * value

when send a * datagram larger than the * size only the last fragment of the * datagram is putted out to the destination

basically while sending * packets larger than * ip fragmentation can occur if it s supported on your platform but not all platforms support it

note that * packets bigger than the * s at every hope between your hosts will be split by ip

if you send a * datagram larger than the * it will be fragmented

now if you re intending to use a remote filesystem with ofs which is the primary use-case you have to first install the relevant remote filesystem packages on the os you re using then use for example if we ve got * which is the newer name for * samba

an * packet has a header that is 20 bytes and is probably going to be slightly slower than *

in fact * especially the ttl excceeding message has even less limitations than * on nats for the error message can be sent from every corner of the internet and routers with nat cannot be aware that these messages are not the true ones

if you are using linux check out netdiscover this uses * i think * is lower level than * udp and with java you can only create apps from * udp and above

almost all * * providers allow you to forward calls from an attached did telephone number to more than one * device so your request could be satisfied by a basic account on your friendly neighbourhood * provider

as last resort resolution i don t suggest this for security issues using * is always safer switch your registry to use http instead of *

it could be a sni problem if you use any kind of load balancer * proxy or more than 1 * certificate on the same ip
