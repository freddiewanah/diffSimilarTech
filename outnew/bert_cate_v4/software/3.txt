alternatively * looks simpler than * but without some of the flexibility

even though * has been faster for me i still use * because it s good enough and is free and im cheap

however i found that * is much more stable full screen resolution much much better to handle the iphone connection via usb and i didn t have yet any crash when on * it s quite often

conceptually it seems like a type of central authentication system * but is more similar to * also a federated identity management system

either way * is easier to maintain and more up-to-date than * see how do programs like * work

that being said i find * much more complete than * like all those recent blog posts illustrate
