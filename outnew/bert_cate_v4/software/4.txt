* has more features but costs 80 * on the other hand is more basic but is free for most users see * licensing faq for details

i am not sure if * server will be much better than *

* free but less powerfull than *

i really miss this feature on * because i find * to be bloated and it slows the host system down much more than * does

fwiw i have never gotten freebsd to work properly under * perhaps if you need that you would be better off with * which does

i think that s why i can t use to launch my project this way works but * way is better because everything including the main_class is described in *

i ve found that * was slightly faster than * non * image but i still use * the majority of the time because i like using the host os for things like mail chat browsing

for this the best option is * better than *
