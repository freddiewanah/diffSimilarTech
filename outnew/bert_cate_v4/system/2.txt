consider * its architecture is definitely better than * s

but in my opinion for most sites * is a better choice than *

since * is a bit more complete than * when it comes to features you could define separate issues with custom field for your tasks

make sure you re using a source control system that supports branching and merging i ve had experience with * and * and while * is better * is free

i ve read that * contains less project management tools than *

i have been trying out * to see if i like it better than *

however if i d built a new site with a cms on java i d probably go with * cms because the documentation and community is more mature despite that it s newer than *

i seem to be getting the impression that * is more popular than * nowadays

i hear all this stuff about * being slower than *

i would not mind changing to for example * or * if needed i am a bit afraid of * to be honest everything i read about * seems 10x more technical than anything i read about mercurial or * and installing it on windows seems to imply installing all sorts of secondary software it seems but that is another matter

it works fine and fits all my needs but recently i found that * works better than * so i decided to use it but i face a problem with * usability because most * s gui not user friendly as * explorer so i want your advice based on a practical experience which best * s gui user friendly or which one is most similar to * explorer

most modern * are also considerably more complex than * which would add further difficulty to the implementation

i d recommend * like the other posters as it is more complete than *

* was written to be a better * than *

generally the performance of hard * like * is better than that of traditional unix *

the compare dialog of * is more about file and with git you have to compare two master branches not just two commits of the same branches both pointing to the same * central repo

one important reason is because * is alot shorter and easier to read than * is for humans

if you use * then it still okay because * handles binary files much better than *

* was supposed to be better than * but in some areas that didn t work well

for all the reasons linked in the comment and elsewhere * tends to be a much better enviroment than * or vss unless you have some weird requirements - so if you can successfully import your history and save the company money i wouldn t see why the bosses wouldn t go for it

in this case i converted the * to * and found the file size on the hard drive it was on my own laptop at the time but it was much smaller in * than in * but there could have been some compression applied i dont know but everything on the web said * would actually be bigger than *

part of the point of * was to make the use of branches and merging much easier than in *

* s issue *king is little better than * s...i know a lot of folks love * but i find it very inflexible
