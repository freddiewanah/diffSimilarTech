a T will generally run faster than an T so i think ruby and php start behind the eight ball but it really comes down to how you use the language and how you structure the code
and perl like any T is much slower than a T
fact is that T like php are always slower than a T
it should be noted that T are inherently many time slower than natively T
mostly T are a bit slower compared with T but i guess the difference is almost negligible in coffeescript javascript because of node.js
php is an T so will run a little slower than a T
this is a good question but should be formulated a little different in my opinion for example why are T slower than T
an T surely makes it easier but this is still entirely possible with T like c
especially in an T like php where classes add more overhead than a T
from wha i know a  such as c++ is much faser han an  such as javascrip
in my general programming experience compiled c c++ programs generally run faser han mos oher  like java or even compiled pyhon and almos always run faser han  like uncompiled pyhon or javascrip
naurally  will run slower han  as compiled code can be ran blindly by he cpu where as compiled code needs o be checked ran line by line
wriing in a  java or c++ in your examples would almos cerainly give beer performance han an  like php
while java could be described as a compiled and  i s probably easier o hink of java iself as a  and java byecode as an 
hen c which is one hose languages closer o he processor level is very performan and generally speaking  because hey urn your code ino assembly language are more performan han 
especially in an  like php where classes add more overhead han a 
in my general programming experience compiled c c++ programs generally run faster than most other B like java or even compiled python and almost always run faster than C like uncompiled python or javascript
naturally C will run slower than B as compiled code can be ran blindly by the cpu where as compiled code needs to be checked ran line by line
python is an C so by definition is slower than other B but the drawback in the execution speed is not even noticeable in most of applications
this makes C generally slower than B due to the overhead of running the vm or interpreter
while ruby and python are both C and operation-for-operation slower than B the reality is in executing an application only a small portion of cpu time is spent in your code and the majority is spent into the built-in libraries you call into which are often native implementations and thus are as fast as compiled code
writing in a B java or c++ in your examples would almost certainly give better performance than an C like php
C are inherently less performant than B - c will generally outperform python - some operations more than others

while ruby and python are both C and operation-for-operation slower than B the reality is in executing an application only a small portion of cpu time is spent in your code and the majority is spent into the built-in libraries you call into which are often native implementations and thus are as fast as compiled code
performance of programs in B is significantly better than that of an C
writing in a B java or c++ in your examples would almost certainly give better performance than an C like php
while java could be described as a compiled and C it s probably easier to think of java itself as a B and java bytecode as an C
C are inherently less performant than B - c will generally outperform python - some operations more than others
my guess is that in C the efficiency benefit in using switch statements is indeed smaller than in B

this is usually seen in dynamic C but is less common in B
