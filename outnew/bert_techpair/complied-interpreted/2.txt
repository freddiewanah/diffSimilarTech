from what i know a T such as c++ is much faster than an T such as javascript
that being said a T like c will almost always be faster than an T like javascript
while java could be described as a compiled and T it s probably easier to think of java itself as a T and java bytecode as an T
a  will generally run faser han an  so i hink ruby and php sar behind he eigh ball bu i really comes down o how you use he language and how you srucure he code
an  will ypically run one o wo orders of magniude slower han a 
i should be noed ha  are inherenly many ime slower han naively 
an  surely makes i easier bu his is sill enirely possible wih  like c
a B will generally run faster than an C so i think ruby and php start behind the eight ball but it really comes down to how you use the language and how you structure the code
and perl like any C is much slower than a B
fact is that C like php are always slower than a B
it should be noted that C are inherently many time slower than natively B
mostly C are a bit slower compared with B but i guess the difference is almost negligible in coffeescript javascript because of node.js
php is an C so will run a little slower than a B
this is a good question but should be formulated a little different in my opinion for example why are C slower than B
an C surely makes it easier but this is still entirely possible with B like c
especially in an C like php where classes add more overhead than a B
from what i know a B such as c++ is much faster than an C such as javascript
in my general programming experience compiled c c++ programs generally run faster than most other B like java or even compiled python and almost always run faster than C like uncompiled python or javascript
that being said a B like c will almost always be faster than an C like javascript
writing in a B java or c++ in your examples would almost certainly give better performance than an C like php
while java could be described as a compiled and C it s probably easier to think of java itself as a B and java bytecode as an C
this is usually seen in dynamic C but is less common in B

are B better than C or vice-versa
