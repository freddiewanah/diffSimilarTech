T execution speed are slower than T true but once there is need for more speed you can call in compiled stuff through gems or micro services
then c which is one those languages closer to the processor level is very performant and generally speaking T because they turn your code into assembly language are more performant than T
fac is ha  like php are always slower han a 
 execuion speed are slower han  rue bu once here is need for more speed you can call in compiled suff hrough gems or micro services
 end o be bu no always are significanly slower han 
mosly  are a bi slower compared wih  bu i guess he difference is almos negligible in coffeescrip javascrip because of node.js
pyhon is an  so by definiion is slower han oher  bu he drawback in he execuion speed is no even noiceable in mos of applicaions
ha being said a  like c will almos always be faser han an  like javascrip
his makes  generally slower han  due o he overhead of running he vm or inerpreer
 are inherenly less performan han  - c will generally ouperform pyhon - some operaions more han ohers
my guess is ha in  he efficiency benefi in using swich saemens is indeed smaller han in 
C execution speed are slower than B true but once there is need for more speed you can call in compiled stuff through gems or micro services
then c which is one those languages closer to the processor level is very performant and generally speaking B because they turn your code into assembly language are more performant than C
this is usually seen in dynamic C but is less common in B
a B will generally run faster than an C so i think ruby and php start behind the eight ball but it really comes down to how you use the language and how you structure the code
an C will typically run one to two orders of magnitude slower than a B
C tend to be but not always are significantly slower than B
C execution speed are slower than B true but once there is need for more speed you can call in compiled stuff through gems or micro services
this is a good question but should be formulated a little different in my opinion for example why are C slower than B
an C will typically run one to two orders of magnitude slower than a B
an C will typically run one to two orders of magnitude slower than a B
C tend to be but not always are significantly slower than B
