mbunit	nunit
Pattern(s): 7	
i used to use nunit but i switched to mbunit since nunit has more features


10232
ant	maven	ant	flex-mojos
Pattern(s): 3	
the flex-mojos maven plugins do a great job for we and i would highly recommend using maven over ant


14261
actionscript	mxml
Pattern(s): 7	
if you write your own reusable components then writing you write your own reusable components in actionscript may sometimes give you a little more control but for non-reusable views mxml is much better


22074
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
Pattern(s): 10	
in my mind illegalargumentexception seems more specific than using a nullpointerexception since my mind illegalargumentexception s telling me that the problem was with an argument i passed to the method and not with a value that may have been generated while performing the method


35627
filesystems	ntfs
Pattern(s): 0	
when people say that unix filesystems are better people might mean to be saying oh ext3 stores bits in such as way that corruption happens way less than ntfs but people might also be talking about design choices made at the common layer above


50632
integer	unsigned
Pattern(s): 7	
otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater or equal to the rank of the type of the other operand then the operand with signed integer type is converted to the type of the operand with unsigned integer type


52881
codeigniter	cakephp
Pattern(s): 0	
also i don t think it is so much that asp.net mvc is so much better than cakephp or codeigniter ruby on rails etc the great thing about asp.net mvc and other asp.net-based technologies such as monorail is that developers who are using asp.net now have the option of following the mvc pattern using tools and languages developers who are using asp.net are familiar with


69989
post	get
Pattern(s): 0	
get is basically just like post ssl just has a limit on the amount of data you can send which is usually a lot smaller than post and a semantic difference which makes get not a good candidate from that point of view even if technically they both can do ssl


70440
quicksort	mergesort
Pattern(s): 10	
quicksort s because quicksort is generally faster that people use quicksort instead of mergesort


74992
bash	zsh
Pattern(s): 2	
i prefer zsh over bash because of zsh support for very powerful file globbing variable expansion modifiers and faster tab completion


109038
cairngorm	puremvc
Pattern(s): 10	8	
puremvc is more invasive than cairngorm meaning that your code is heavily dependent on the framework you have to subclass implement the framework classes interfaces but that doesn t mean that cairngorm isn t


149212
cpu	hyperthreading
Pattern(s): 7	
almost any new cpu has more than one core or if the future has just one the future might support hyperthreading and thus pretending the future has more than one


178555
verilog	vhdl
Pattern(s): 0	
yes vhdl was once much more feature-rich than verilog but later revisions of the language verilog 2001 verilog 2005 systemverilog etc. have cherry-picked most of the interesting features and there is far more robust toolchain support for verilog and verilog variant these days in addition to verilog being the dominant language in use in the us in my experience vhdl is only used here when dealing with extreme legacy blocks and in academic contexts partially due to the tools support mentioned previously


179294
post	get
Pattern(s): 2	
further i recommend to use post wherever possible avoid using get for form submits - if some users want to simulate a form submit via get make sure your application supports the desired parameters either via post or via get but when you submit the page yourself via a button or js prefer post over get


190913
subclass	abstract-class
Pattern(s): 0	
making abstract-class before i had more than one subclass in mind for abstract-class


198565
post	get
Pattern(s): 10	10	
get is more appropiate for idempotent queries while post is more appropiate for action queries but you can shoot yourself in the foot just as easily with any of action queries if you don t understand the security architecture for the application you re maintaining


241621
nstableview	nssplitview
Pattern(s): 0	
a pattern i also use is to make a simple nstableview slightly shorter than the nssplitview and have buttons at the bottom add delete etc


242991
rss	feed
Pattern(s): 2	
i produce a feed reader and when scraping feed always prefer atom over rss


249589

i have had more joy with lwjgl than jogl but lwjgl than jogl should lwjgl than jogl satisfy your needs


251995
getter	setter
Pattern(s): 10	
a getter without a setter is more like a public final member variable--but at that point why not just use a public final member variable setter and getter do no more harm.


259080
bluej	greenfoot
Pattern(s): 10	
greenfoot is developed by the same people that made bluej but greenfoot is way more graphical still allowing full java programming of the applications


260148
lxml	libxml2	lxml	libxslt	libxml2	libxslt
Pattern(s): 10	
libxml2 libxslt also come with their own much lower-level python bindings but lxml is much more straightforward and pythonic and it seems to have great performance as well


285023
quicksort	heapsort
Pattern(s): 0	
i was just going to say radix sort however that could be a bit above what you were looking to implement introsort is generally the accepted sorting solution for data introsort s a variation of quicksort that switches to heapsort when introsort reaches smaller sets as introsort s faster on smaller sets than quicksort


348548
codeigniter	kohana
Pattern(s): 2	
i prefer kohana over codeigniter ymmv


365804
dlsym	dlopen
Pattern(s): 0	
a simple c program that does little more than a dlopen and possibly the subsequent dlsym then exits provides a much simpler environment to troubleshoot and or debug


393362
perl	tcl
Pattern(s): 7	0	
tcl is no better nor worse than perl ruby python or any other scripting language in this regard -- they all do basic file operations with equal aplomb

opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
Pattern(s): 7	
download firefox messages wether i be using ie8 partner build firefox 3.1 beta 2 or another browser like opera safari


405022
innodb	myisam
Pattern(s): 7	7	0	
innodb is harder to tune since innodb has more knobs but a properly tuned innodb system can often have higher throughput than myisam due to better locking and better i o patterns


410176
photoshop	fireworks
Pattern(s): 7	
i find fireworks has an easier time dealing with vectors because the ones i use re first class objects while in photoshop the ones i use re actually a combination of a vector mask and a colour fill


412091
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 0	
postgresql s a lot more enterprise-ready than mysql not to mention that postgresql follows the sql standard a lot better


433998
int	chars
Pattern(s): 0	
note that in c++ literals having more than one chars still have type int although type int value is implementation defined


436535
division	multiplication
Pattern(s): 0	
you always need to know the magic number here 0xaaaaaaab and the correct operations after the multiplication shifts and or additions in most cases and both is different depending on the number you want to divide by and both take too much cpu time to calculate both on the fly that would be slower than hardware division


482268
hash	salt
Pattern(s): 0	
you can safely store the salt in the db because working out a string from the db hash is just as hard when you know some of the string as it is when you know none of the db provided the password itself is longer than the salt and long enough and strong enough to take a long time to crack by brute force at least 6 chars with at least one case change and a number or non-alphanumeric i d say


497849
mergesort	in-place
Pattern(s): 7	
another reason is that mergesort needs more memory because it s hard to implement it as an in-place sort


497967
quicksort	mergesort
Pattern(s): 7	0	
the biggest difference that can be produced between the two of people will always be to quicksort s detriment and s involves lists that are already largely sorted or contain a large number of ties when quicksort does better than mergesort the difference will not be nearly so great


504606
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
Pattern(s): 0	
i run firefox on vista xp and a macbook pro regularly and aside from taking a while longer than safari or google-chrome to start up a while s fine and seems to use less ram than either


509703
sproutcore	javascriptmvc
Pattern(s): 0	
it s probably overkill for what you need but sproutcore is an mvc framework and it doesn t look any more heavyweight than javascriptmvc or trimpath s junction


511928
int	double
Pattern(s): 7	0	
the largest double value is also larger than an int so it would have to be a long


531772
x86	64bit
Pattern(s): 7	
reason why double can t be declared volatile t s 64bit which makes t more than the word size on x86 which prevents t from being declared volatile in the cli if i remember correctly


563472
lisp	scheme
Pattern(s): 0	
mzscheme s popular mzscheme s actively developed mzscheme has many libraries offering the features of a modern programming environment and scheme is somewhat simpler not to say better just simpler than common lisp


584890
yslow	pagespeed
Pattern(s): 7	
my testing so far google s pagespeed addon gives much more detailed analysis and smarter advice rather than recommending a cdn for small websites like yslow


585442
hudson	bamboo
Pattern(s): 7	
bamboo and hudson are bamboo and hudson great but hudson has better report support for instance publishing your coverage reports etc


597858
post	get
Pattern(s): 0	
using get for critical data such as sending password over a get request will expose the password more than post because the password ll be stored in browser s history cache proxy caches server logs etc


610494
strcpy	strncpy
Pattern(s): 7	
of course you might still ask whether to use strncpy or strcpy in implementing that abstraction strncpy is safer there provided you fully grok what abstraction strncpy does


610565
gif	png
Pattern(s): 7	0	
if png isn t smaller than gif then your software may be saving your software poorly - look for png optimisation progams like pngout and pngnq


611542
memcpy	strcpy	memcpy	strncpy	strcpy	strncpy
Pattern(s): 0	
memcpy can be faster than strcpy and strncpy because memcpy does not have to compare each copied byte with 0 and because memcpy already knows the length of the copied object


619544
cpython	pypy
Pattern(s): 0	
part of the compiler toolchain includes an experimental jit generator now in the compiler toolchain fifth incarnation and starting to work really well - the goal is for a jited pypy to run much faster than cpython


630233
vmware	virtualbox
Pattern(s): 0	
in my experience i ve found that vmware seems to be faster than virtualbox although i don t have any hard data to back vmware up


656377
entity-relationship	diagram
Pattern(s): 0	0	
another article s the only conceptual modeling tool available for relational data the others - erwin and another article ilk - being at best logical modeling tools with nothing much better than entity-relationship diagram and ddl synchrnoization which are also provided by object role modeling tools


690380
firebird	dbisam
Pattern(s): 10	
something like textolution s proprietary add-on for firebird looks like firebird could accommodate constructing single complex nested query that would apply both regular and fulltext criteria but dbisam does firebird more elegantly


706457
bazaar	git
Pattern(s): 0	
an incredibly rough eye balling of the numbers some basic benchmarking of git mercurial and bazaar which is documented in pep-374 posted showed bazaar to be 2-4x slower than either git or mercurial in the use cases tested


721563
gridview	repeater
Pattern(s): 10	
maybe a repeater is better but you will be fine with a gridview if you are familiar with a gridview


724365
free	malloc
Pattern(s): 10	
this avoids malloc free but is less extensible and more prone to buffer overflow issues so i rarely ever use bytedata


746606
udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 0	
a great many applications that use udp use udp because udp need the low-overhead low-latency nature of udp much more than udp need the precise reliability of tcp


771892
quicksort	heapsort
Pattern(s): 8	
average asymptotic order of quicksort is o nlogn and o nlogn s usually more efficient than heapsort due to smaller constants tighter loops


805392
ssl	https
Pattern(s): 10	
if you have a secure ftp sftp server or secure http ssl https server then curl can accept ssh keys although using an ssl key is more commonly accepted on the internet an ssl key can use ssh keys to authenticate and establish a secure connection to the directories which have been made public to your user through the server


904229
gentoo	linux
Pattern(s): 10	
we re close to the point where the gentoo linux distribution becomes more cheap to distribute source instead of binaries


910557

Pattern(s): 7	
then when an image is loaded the rectangle s style checks an image triggers to see if an image has a height or width that is less than 100px


921765
gridview	datalist
Pattern(s): 0	0	
for displaying a list of things repeaters are typically faster than gridview datalist and things repeaters other counterparts


933047
superclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 0	
you can t cast a superclass in a subclassing because a subclassing may have a bigger interface than the superclass means a subclassing can have functions like getunixtimestamp that the superclass doesn t have


943494
ant	maven
Pattern(s): 7	
having said all of that i do think that maven is a very interesting and useful system i m not calling a while a tool like ant is maven is broader than that for software development configuration and build management


953814
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 0	
mysql s s version is apparently marginally faster than postgresql but lacks some of the more advanced spatial features therefore it s pretty much limited to finding records that match a certain range of coordinates


955645
int	chars
Pattern(s): 0	
if you use chars x where x 4 your chars key will be greater than a int one


962399
vbscript	vb6	vbscript	vba
Pattern(s): 0	
vb6 vba though a little better than vbscript in general still has many similar issues where for they domain they require much more boiler plate to do simple tasks than what i would like and have seen in other scripting languages


968640
bazaar	git
Pattern(s): 2	
as for the first tool to choose problem with git bazaar and mercurial is git bazaar and mercurial are distributed vcs s


982486
mouse	joystick

you may want to use some movement controls such as a quadratic gradient to speedup slowdown the mouse movements the longer the joystick is pushed in one direction for instance


1004225
disk	ram
Pattern(s): 0	
the ssd is still slower than ram by orders of magnitude but the ssd s quite reasonable to have a 50gb hash table on disk but not in ram unless you pay big money for big iron


1004380
freemarker	velocity
Pattern(s): 10	
freemarker has a more complex but correspondingly richer markup language than apache velocity


1011950
bazaar	git
Pattern(s): 7	7	
bazaar is easier to extend in an api way git is easier to extend in a unix way pipes


1027808
division	multiplication
Pattern(s): 7	0	
t is not very important as long as alpha is small otherwise you will run into some rather weird nyquist issues aliasing etc and if you are working on a processor where multiplication is cheaper than division or fixed-point issues are important precalculate omega


1036076
int	chars
Pattern(s): 0	
although single quotes technically can contain more than one chars the endianness of the resulting int constant is implementation-defined and single quotes re not what you want in this case


1037788
coalesce	isnull	coalesce	nvl	isnull	nvl
Pattern(s): 10	8	
coalesce is more cross-compatible than isnull or nvl isnull works on mssql oracle mysql derby et al.


1059847
ftp	telnet
Pattern(s): 0	
ftp is optimized for downloading larger files where the setup overhead is amortized over the size and number of downloads http is very light-weight you can communicate to an http server using telnet much easier than ftp especially before passive ftp and is designed around html -- the concept that in the course of your navigation you will be visiting many different servers and grabbing only a couple of files at a time from each


1117426
nsexception	nserror
Pattern(s): 7	
aside from obejctive-c convention and best practices nserror is much more robust and flexibly than nsexception and allows the caller to effectively ignore the problem if the caller want to


1124137
cvs	svn
Pattern(s): 10	10	
cvs svn s not harder to use than csv but has some advantages renaming is possible


1147960
subtract	add
Pattern(s): 0	
this garentees that while a can be issued to the pipeline every cycle the pipeline will have a higher latency than an add subtract circuit


1148222
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 7	
you have to make sure your local sql instance is exactly at the same build versioning versioning like the hosting provider otherwise your local sql may upgrade the database structure and you ll be unable to restore your local sql back on the hosting provider or you ll be unable to restore in on your local server if your versioning is earlier than the host s


1181839
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	
you re probably being hit by the borders or margins on the body element -- you re asking for document.width height effectively but putting document.width height in an element with a border so the total width of the page canvas.width+ left right borders is then bigger than the width height you originally asked for


1181840
disk	ram
Pattern(s): 0	
if the working set is smaller than your ram the working set should not be disk bound


1192000
superclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 7	
say all instance variables are 32-bit ints for simplicity if the superclass has 3 and the subclassing adds 2 more then each instance of the subclassing will allocate 5 x 4 20 bytes -- 8 for the subclassing own instance variables plus 12 for the instance variables of the superclass


1197324
perl	tcl
Pattern(s): 0	
it is written in tcl which is a language somewhat simpler than perl but broadly in the same family and not difficult to learn


1243627
code128	code39

data density in code128 is better than code39 - since code128 gets mentioned that often in other replies


1270393
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 7	
traditionally postgresql has had fewer security issues than mysql but traditionally postgresql are both doing very well on that


1293769
hash	md5
Pattern(s): 7	7	
a md5 hash is no smaller than the uuid so it doesn t help with storage


1310736
git-svn	svn2git
Pattern(s): 3	
a simple git-svn will reproduce the svn branches actually simple directory with copies in a simple git-svn so i would recommend using svn2git and git2svn


1316464
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 3	
otherwise i recommend using postgresql over mysql since afaik is more standards compliant and has a nicer license


1322011
client-side	server-side
Pattern(s): 7	
that said client-side javascript is much more common and if you were using server-side javascript you would probably know the answer to your question

quoting rapidxml s author i would like to thank arseny kapoulkine for author work on pugixml which was an inspiration for this project and 5 - 30 faster than pugixml the fastest xml parser i know of author had tested against version 0.3 of pugixml which has reached recently version 0.42


1461675
int	chars
Pattern(s): 0	
i believe a standards-conformant compiler was one of the early pdp machines in which a chars was larger than an int


1469813
apache	nginx
Pattern(s): 0	
nginx with nginx own mod_wsgi seems to perform even better than apache but hey you didn t ask about that


1527832
min	max

the code will also record the edge cases so if the the function produces a value greater than the max or less than the min you.will.know.about.it


1544149
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 0	
a new versioning of delphi s slightly cheaper than the upgrade pricing you get the new software right away no wait for purchasing ordering and you get a couple of support incidents thrown in


1560687
quicksort	mergesort
Pattern(s): 10	
quicksort is a partitioning sorting algorithm you might refer to mergesort which also is a partitioning sorting algorithm the biggest difference is probably the speed quicksort is faster even though both of the biggest difference are o n log n


1577097
boost	stl
Pattern(s): 10	
while boost is more modern c++ it also harder to use for non trivial tasks - and without a modern c++ experience and deep stl knowledge it is difficult to use correctly


1580034
cvs	svn
Pattern(s): 0	
part of the point of svn was to make the use of branches and merging much easier than in cvs


1585114
strncmp	memcmp
Pattern(s): 10	
in general memcmp is better because this example strncmp doesn t have to worry about string termination so even if the byte stream tag you are comparing contains ascii nul 0 characters memcmp will work


1627653
int	chars
Pattern(s): 7	
an int might be eof or a valid chars - but an int returns one more value than the range supported by the chars type


1628230
post	get
Pattern(s): 7	
if you have the ajax use get rather than post this is simpler then you can test the server s response by just viewing the page with the appropriate query string


1667148
atomic	interlocked
Pattern(s): 0	
but consider this this s literally impossible to do any better than interlocked operations for cross-process communication with atomic updates and no locks are held


1678683
post	get
Pattern(s): 7	
generally when passing lots of data to the server to be processed or stored using post is a good idea since get has a lower limit than that of post


1712946
hex	binary
Pattern(s): 10	8	
hex is somewhat more readable than binary if i happen to be loading a data dump in a text editor etc


1716751
arp	tcp
Pattern(s): 7	0	
the arp reply would appear from your question that the period of the tcp message is shorter than the arp refresh time


1725214
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	
if set true then set true might increase the width or height if the given width and height are bigger than original width and height


1730317
innodb	myisam
Pattern(s): 7	
if you find that innodb is much slower for inserts updates bear in mind that it offers a much better level of durability - if you tune it for approximately the same durability as myisam then you ll see good performance hopefully


1776455
haskell	ocaml
Pattern(s): 7	
haskell has higher level bindings to llvm than ocaml the haskell ones provide some interesting type safety guarantees and haskell has by far more libraries to use 1700 packages on making it easier to glue together components


1786996
vim	emacs
Pattern(s): 10	
on today s machines that s a non-issue but if you ever find yourself dealing with older gear it s my experience that vim is far more likely to work on a wonky terminal than emacs is


1804853
union	distinct
Pattern(s): 0	
keep in mind that union will return a distinct list - duplicates will be removed but union will return a distinct list - duplicates will perform slower than using union all which will not remove duplicates


1823057
junit	testng
Pattern(s): 10	
if you have to do a lot of this honestly testng is more flexible but you can absolutely get a lot of this honestly testng done in junit


1829072
disk	ram
Pattern(s): 0	
as disk i o is orders of magnitude slower than ram i i o this can cause a very significant difference in query execution times


1840568
division	multiplication
Pattern(s): 7	0	
if a remains the same and b is changing say if your code is in a loop and your code s clear that a does not change between two iterations for instance because your code s a const variable then the original version can execute faster because multiplication is cheaper than division assuming the compiler moves the computation of 1 .


1840723
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 8	
i d recommend postgresql s sql is much more ansi-compliant than mysql - so later using oracle sql server sqlite etc should be very straight-forward


1846862
floyd-warshall	dijkstra
Pattern(s): 7	
the floyd-warshall algorithm has a worst case performance of o |v| 3 where as dijkstra s has a worse case performance of o |e| + |v|log |v|

Pattern(s): 8	
a qtabwidget s much more convenient than qtabbar and will do everything you want 99.99 of the time


1935264
memcached	apc
Pattern(s): 7	
memcached has more overhead since you have to use a tcp connection to access memcached versus just a function call for apc xcache shared objects


1951706
screens	mdpi
Pattern(s): 0	
so a g1 will show mdpi bitmaps slightly smaller than a mdpi device with a true 160dpi screens but this is a very small difference so this s not a big deal


2019939
django	web2py
Pattern(s): 7	
i think i prefer web2py because web2py does more for me that i don t have to do but from the pov of say java frameworks django and web2py may as well be the same thing


2043996
youtube	vimeo
Pattern(s): 7	
while vimeo is more of a professional site youtube offers html5 h.264 video playback support for all videos so all videos ll play on iphone


2044282
int	double
Pattern(s): 10	8	10	
the int value is less likely to with double since double is more precise and can represent many more exact numbers


2066036
komodo	gedit
Pattern(s): 7	0	
when i m in a hurry i use gedit purely because gedit is quicker than komodo edit


2089364
mbunit	mstest	mbunit	nunit	nunit	mstest

cvs	svn
Pattern(s): 8	
it s model it s much more twisted than svn cvs git


2120804
fossil	git

2148905
hash	salt
Pattern(s): 0	
if that salt + hash original password was longer than the salt + hash you may have just reduced the security of that salt + hash password assuming a good password and ignoring hash collisions


2163475
free	malloc
Pattern(s): 0	
garbage-collection may be slower than malloc and free for programs that allocate at once all the memory garbage-collection need and work with that


2206001
union	distinct
Pattern(s): 0	
if you used a union then that may well be slower as a union has to apply a distinct but union all doesn t have to do that so it should be no different

google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 0	
this alleviated some of our performance issues but even on subsequent refreshes our noticed ie6 taking substantially longer than ie7+ firefox google-chrome etc


2254966
glut	fltk	glut	glfw	glfw	fltk
Pattern(s): 10	
between glfw and fltk is much closer to glut in character -- a small toolkit for abstracting away most of the os-dependent parts so you can produce opengl programs with relatively little hassle


2269313
haskell	ocaml
Pattern(s): 10	10	0	
secondly the haskell ffi is more powerful that is the haskell ffi does more with less code than ocaml s and more libraries are avaliable via hackage so i don t think foreign interfaces will be a deciding factor


2272341
bazaar	git
Pattern(s): 3	
i would recommend using git bazaar or another vcs which doesn t require you to tell t when you move sources around


2336575
gif	png
Pattern(s): 7	
you should use png instead of gif because png instead offers better compression and features


2336582
gif	png
Pattern(s): 7	
the png format is a popular alternative to gif images since the png format uses better compression techniques and does not have a limit of 256 colors but pngs do not support animations


2349523
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	
might make the rest easier than your width 0|| width 170|| height 0|| height 200


2393155
sorting	grouping	superclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 7	
i also propose manual sorting since i think manual sorting makes much more sense to grouping superclass together and make sure superclass are defined before subclassing -- otherwise your module won t even be importable


2402860
richfaces	trinidad
Pattern(s): 10	
i think richfaces has a more mature ajax integration and both ajax components and events are more easy to use for me than trinidad ones


2430207
width	font-size
Pattern(s): 10	
you can then check if the width of the text is greater than 800px and reduce the font-size until the width is less than or equal to


2435935
ant	maven
Pattern(s): 0	
but maven and ant are so different that there is no real point at comparing maven and ant and maven is still much more than ant + dependency management


2474454
armadillo	lapack
Pattern(s): 10	
edit in response to the comment armadillo does not require lapack but works better with your compiler and better still with tuned blas


2476569
perforce	svn
Pattern(s): 8	
and if you just want something faster or more scalable than svn then just buy a commercial product - i ve used both perforce and rational clearcase and perforce and rational clearcase scale up to huge projects without any problems


2535830
ubuntu	linux
Pattern(s): 7	
if you just want the fun of linux command line programs without access to all of ubuntu cygwin is smaller and might be faster


2539220
post	get
Pattern(s): 0	
post get method doesn t have the same lenght limit you can use post to send more data than with get


2557897
dwoo	smarty
Pattern(s): 0	
so far dwoo has proven to be faster than smarty and dwoo provides a compatibility layer to allow developers that have been using smarty for years to switch their application over to dwoo progressively


2605897
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 2	
i personally prefer postgresql over mysql and find postgresql over mysql very scalable even with millions or even billions of rows when setup correctly


2616927
children	parent
Pattern(s): 0	
as a side note the children can t have a higher z-index than the children parent so everything inside .codbg is -1 behind the page then you need to fix the tab images the problem is not that the tab images re behind the background the background s that the tab images re transparent and look darker on top of a darker background


2640600
hash	hmac
Pattern(s): 10	
because you can guess the top passwords and see if the top passwords have the same hash but the author points out that hmac is a more secure mechanism


2699569
dictionary	map
Pattern(s): 7	
i definitely wouldn t try introducing a new general-purpose type for use in python based on std map which has worse algorithmic complexity in time for many important operations and in at least some implementations leaves some optimisations to the user dictionary already has


2738559
fileoutputstream	filewriter
Pattern(s): 0	
usually better than filewriter already suggested is to use fileoutputstream which also like filewriter has an append parameter in one of filewriter constructors and which unlike filewriter does not silently assume the default charset encoding slightly bad practice imo


2747873
gif	png
Pattern(s): 0	
just press save and give the png file format a name and that photoshop image will be saved into a transparent background png file which presents more colors and the png file format s smaller than a gif file and is as good as a jpg


2752712
pyquery	beautifulsoup
Pattern(s): 8	
pyquery uses the css selector syntax familiar from jquery which i find more intuitive than beautifulsoup s


2757943
public	protected
Pattern(s): 0	
that abstract class s not perfect but i guess that a protected method that does not check parameters is better than a public method that does not do it


2795807
django	web2py
Pattern(s): 7	0	
i prefer web2py because there are more conveniences built into the environment than offered by django but web2py is much newer than django and hindsight always makes web2py easier make new implementations better


2800533
teamcity	nant
Pattern(s): 10	8	
you could use nant to send email but teamcity is more appropriate as teamcity can provide a centralized place for notifications including emails


2804311
django	web2py
Pattern(s): 10	
anything django does web2py does better


2808353
gdal	ogr
Pattern(s): 10	10	
when all you want to do is jam a bunch of shapefiles together or convert a large series of rasters to a common projection gdal ogr is faster to startup and run as a common projection gdal ogr doesn t need to load the whole arcobjects com library to access one or two functions


2852664
jsf	wicket
Pattern(s): 0	
i would advise you to try wicket wicket is very easy to learn much easier than jsf and it let s you re-use many existing components as well


2877619
ienumerable	ilist
Pattern(s): 10	
the ienumerable component returns an ilist which is more generic to work with


2892573
integer	unsigned
Pattern(s): 7	
as far as the compiler is concerned the conversion from integer 0 to unsigned int is no better than the conversion from integer 0 to pointer


2896854
wxhaskell	gtk2hs
Pattern(s): 0	
in practice i ve never had resource management issues with wxhaskell although i agree that wxhaskell s possible and is an area handled better by gtk2hs which uses reference counting in the underlying library


2899344
apache	nginx
Pattern(s): 8	
in fact nginx can use select instead of epoll if you compile nginx with the --with-select_module option and i bet nginx will still be more efficient than apache


2912577
apache	nginx
Pattern(s): 8	
also nginx s configuration is much more flexible than apache and by having it on the front end it gives you a lot of flexibility


2927816
exponent	modulo
Pattern(s): 7	0	
the private exponent is always smaller than the modulo so you should be able to encrypt the private exponent using the raw rsa operation if you make sure to remove the prepended zero


2927816
exponent	modulo
Pattern(s): 0	
edit as gregs points out in the comments you cannot be sure that the private exponent of the key you want to encrypt is smaller than the modulo of the key you want to use to encrypt with


2985463
ubuntu	linux
Pattern(s): 10	
ubuntu is the more user-friendly of the two i think ubuntu is actually one of the most newbie-friendly linux distros so if you are new to linux ubuntu is the way to go


2994324
awt	swing
Pattern(s): 0	
performance swing components are generally slower and buggier than awt due to both the fact that cons are pure java and to video issues on various platforms


3008645
google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 8	
most likely your post value has one or more characters in it that are breaking the html of the page and ie firefox are being a bit more forgiving than google-chrome is


3027395
int	double
Pattern(s): 10	
the second statement implicitly converts an int to a double gets the double form of largest int that is less or equal to that double and converts that back to an int


3033387
cpython	ironpython
Pattern(s): 0	
unladen swallow s possible that jython and ironpython are much faster than cpython as well as jython and ironpython are backed by heavily optimized virtual machines jvm and .net clr


3039295
ienumerable	iqueryable
Pattern(s): 0	
there is a very good linq video that i enjoy a lot- it hits more than just ienumerable v iqueryable but it really has some fantastic insight


3063547
post	get
Pattern(s): 3	
if you re using an encryption library to encrypt the data then you can use get or post but this will be an added pain and you might not setup you re using an encryption library to encrypt the data correctly so i d still recommend using post over https rather than rolling your own encryption setup


3081636
google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 0	
you can view a quick example live on cssdesk this method works in a lot more than google-chrome but breaks in firefox 3.0 and just doesn t work in a number of ie versions


3125079
int	chars
Pattern(s): 0	
while this is perfectly acceptable its typically how i do its unless there are more than one chars in a row alignment issues will force the next variable to waste 1-3 bytes anyway which could otherwise have been used for free by an int


3150597
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 2	
we prefer composition over inherited because when we add particularly or change functionality by subclassing we couple that new functionality to the class - so anywhere we need the new functionality we need that class


3176940
int	chars
Pattern(s): 0	0	
even the filename has one drawback but i believe even the filename s ok with the question as even the filename compute an int divider to make line shorter than 80 chars the longest line is shorter than 80 chars not exactly 80 chars


3182486
int	chars
Pattern(s): 7	
i haven t s theoretically possible that an has a smaller sizeof than a for example if int has stricter alignment requirements than chars this could be a reasonable thing to do


3218551
quicksort	heapsort
Pattern(s): 7	
unless you re going to write a very good sort probably quicksort merge sort or heapsort depending on your specific needs quicksort will be better and your specific needs quicksort takes fewer lines of code


3287735
onresume	onpause
Pattern(s): 10	
if your activity s onpause method is called then you should assume that your activity s onpause method is no longer active and the user cannot interact with your activity s onpause method is called anymore until onresume is called again


3320135
mouse	keyboard
Pattern(s): 0	
if you re happier with the keyboard for me a mouse notepad++ has to be emacs


3360821
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 10	
perhaps a 1000 lines class should be decomposed in other classes or subclassing if in your case inherited is more valuable than composition so every class has a well defined responsibility in the system


3376978
getter	setter
Pattern(s): 7	
hiding state behind getter and setter gives you more flexibility to change the internal representation of the class state without breaking other classes that uses the class state


3384918
integer	unsigned
Pattern(s): 7	
otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater than or equal to the rank of the type of the other operand the operand with signed integer type shall be converted to the type of the operand with unsigned integer type


3418152
superclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 0	
most likely this class doesn ll still be tightly linked with implementations generally a bad thing or if not bad this class doesn s not especially good but i think a structure like this is better than a superclass figuring out what all of a superclass subclassing are


3493725
firefox	safari
Pattern(s): 10	
this looks like at least on safari and firefox prototype runs significantly faster edit not 20x as stated earlier


3508954
ironruby	ironpython
Pattern(s): 10	10	
since developing in ironruby ironpython is faster you can use developing in ironruby ironpython to write pocs and later implement the real application in c# or whatever you re using


3513993
wordpress	joomla
Pattern(s): 0	0	
i speak of great experience in this area as i have developed my own cms over a cumulation of years and selling my own cms becomes even much tougher as joomla wordpress and drupal have a price point that you cannot complete with


3528737
lisp	scheme
Pattern(s): 7	
the class uses scheme a dialect of lisp which is significantly cleaner and easier to use than common lisp yes this is an opinion deal with this


3536043
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	
you can also at this time query the status bar navigation bar and toolbar for they sizes and get the correct post-rotation values although the status bar width and height may be swapped--i just take the smaller value as the height works great


3559475
vaadin	wicket
Pattern(s): 7	0	
with this in mind customizing the css of a wicket app is significantly easier than vaadin for the simple reason that you control the markup


3572799
int	chars
Pattern(s): 0	
if the file is in text format you may be able to fit the file in memory just by converting things to int as you read things in since an int stored as chars may take more space than an int stored as an int depending on the size of the int and the type of text file


3609448
getter	setter
Pattern(s): 8	
if you judge that the code is more readable with getter setter after fields rather than after constructor you re free to do the code


3631594
public	protected
Pattern(s): 10	
protected is meaningless or reduces to private without inheritance although not in java but with inheritance not in java explodes into a slimy public degenerate and more so in java programming scala chapter 5


3704402
division	subtraction
Pattern(s): 7	0	
this platform is probably not representative of your microcontroller but the test shows that on this platform the subtraction is considerably slower than the division


3725905
apl	algol
Pattern(s): 8	
as far as the syntax goes i guess the syntax goes s a bit different from the more classic syntax of the algol family languages but the syntax goes s no more and possibly less weird than apl


3747750
int	chars
Pattern(s): 7	
you should probably always use an id number that way if you change the type name you don t need to update the user table t also allows you to keep your datasize down as a table full of int is much smaller than one full of 45 chars varchars


3750603
dateadd	strtotime
Pattern(s): 0	
that said the date class is much better in php5.3 -- the date class even has dateadd subtract functions which would also solve your problem much better than strtotime .


3759576
hash	md5
Pattern(s): 0	
valid choices for hashing include sha1 or md5 although sha1 is preferable because sha1 produces a larger hash and is considered cryptographically stronger than md5


3765747
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 7	0	
the foreach loops is slower than the for-loop yet most people don t rewrite all of most people code to use the for


3787488
wxpython	pyqt
Pattern(s): 8	
two words of warning against wxpython it is not possible to install it via the popular fink package manager on mac os x currently which makes it far less portable than pyqt and tkinter


3791525
for-loop	arrays
Pattern(s): 10	
a straightforward solution is to iteratively create each of the arrays using a for-loop or list comprehension or use a higher dimensional arrays where each of these 1d arrays is a row in your 2d arrays which is generally faster


3792915
int	double
Pattern(s): 7	7	
when you compare a double to a 64-bit int however there will be potential roundoff error if 32-bit int double is greater than 2 52


3807968
superclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 7	
this is because when a third class imports the subclassing s header file when a third class imports the subclassing s header file needs the declaration for the superclass prototype and you don t want to have to import all the superclass prototypes header files


3826469
mouseleave	mouseenter
Pattern(s): 10	
you can simulate an anchor using css cursor pointer and events like mouseenter and mouseleave which is more work but does not break the expected behavior of an anchor tag


3842231
ubuntu	centos
Pattern(s): 3	
if you don t have a favorite distro i would recommend trying ubuntu centos as you don t tend to be quite friendly to the beginner and have extremely robust community support


3882058
cpython	ironpython
Pattern(s): 0	
so if you want to use django or something like that it s probably not smart to use ironpython because it isn t really cross-platform doesn t work with some frameworks and it performs worse than cpython


3892977
post	get
Pattern(s): 0	
you can send more data with post than get but this doesn t mean t respond faster t s a separate issue


3918611
udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 7	
tcp is far better at transferring large quantities of data but when the network fails the network s more likely that udp will get through


3957154
profiling	debugging
Pattern(s): 0	
of course you can only debugging the code to see the generated sql but the code s easier with a profiling tool and you ll see how long time the query takes


4025516
hash	md5
Pattern(s): 0	
in that case some hash functions are somewhat faster than other md5 being one of the fast functions but md4 is faster and md4 is simple enough that md4 code can be included in any application without much hassle


4054355
hide	show
Pattern(s): 0	
finally i d hide the show more option as the show was no longer needed


4059538
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 2	
they are sufficiently similar that i d recommend starting with mysql but learning postgresql as well


4060023
plupload	swfupload
Pattern(s): 7	
looking for a swfupload url plupload and swfupload site is down so maybe plupload is a better bet


4074875
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 7	0	
i would recommend postgresql for a beginner as postgresql has far fewer surprises than mysql


4083946
calloc	malloc
Pattern(s): 0	
for this reason since calloc uses two arguments of type size_t calloc can allocate bigger blocks than malloc will ever be able to since malloc takes only one argument of type size_t


4109368
division	multiplication
Pattern(s): 8	
yes mod is more expensive than multiplication as mod is implemented through division


4115361
glut	sdl
Pattern(s): 10	
glut is much more easier while many of people use sdl or sfml they re more flexible and feature-full than glut


4146126
freemarker	velocity
Pattern(s): 10	7	
freemarker provides much better native whitespace handling recent velocity releases provide more interesting content controls #define #evaluate # literal block #


4173072
xna	slimdx
Pattern(s): 3	
personally i d recommend using slimdx as xna is lacking a number of features that the newer directx versions provide


4174354
int	chars
Pattern(s): 7	
simply because a chars in c++ is a single byte or at least a chars in c++ s guaranteed by the c++ standard to be less than or equal in size to int or short whereas the size of an int is usually larger than a byte


4246897
innodb	myisam
Pattern(s): 0	
myisam is still widely used in web applications as myisam has traditionally been perceived as faster than innodb in situations where most db access is reads


4274038
daemon	cron
Pattern(s): 10	
but honestly cron is fairly lightweight and unless honestly cron needs to be real-time or whatever that means to you writing php into a daemon is more work than a daemon s work


4276683
mongodb	bson
Pattern(s): 10	8	
mongodb stores everything in memory anyway and works in a similar vein being a key-value based system however i believe mongodb is more flexible as mongodb allows for storing bson objects within bson objects


4337136
cpython	ironpython
Pattern(s): 0	
one of the largest benefits of ironpython is that the largest benefits of ironpython has effectively no gil - meaning that if you are both writing python code and it is multi-threaded - you can often get performance that is better than cpython without having to spawn multiple process and pickle objects across the boundaries


4358765
int	chars
Pattern(s): 0	
well eof has undefined behavior if all the input is more than long_max chars due to int overflow but we can probably forgive that in a simple example


4384579
goto	break
Pattern(s): 7	
but actually break has more resemblance to return both instructions jump out of a block of code which is pretty much structured in comparison to goto


4391609
int	double
Pattern(s): 7	
your upccode int is larger than the long data type so i tried your upccode int with double which is a float but works


4427769
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 0	0	
mongodb is fun to toy with and i ve built a few apps using mongodb myself for that reason but mongodb s almost never a better choice than postgresql mysql sql server etc


4435582
fossil	git
Pattern(s): 0	
fossil is another one that s easy to use i would say easier than git to learn but it uses an sqlite file to store your code and i m not sure if it scales to really big projects


4451725
nfa	dfa
Pattern(s): 10	
the dfa is much more complex in terms of the nodes the nfa contains but has really simple rules since there is exactly one output state for any given input


4480128
memcpy	memmove
Pattern(s): 10	
however because of additional checks that memmove performs when the buffers are small and surely does not overlap memcpy is better


4508736
swt	swing
Pattern(s): 7	0	
fixing bugs in swt is much harder than in swing most classes in swt are final or contain hostile checks in the constructor to make sure no one extends hostile checks the package is signed so you can t simply replace classes and so far i tried several times to compile swt from sources - and failed


4513809
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 0	
you can safely upgrade to trunk it better than last versioning anyway


4527030
filtering	grouping
Pattern(s): 10	
again this is perhaps more clear than using raw sql and only requires one query but this one query could be very large this one query will return all items and this one query categories and doing the grouping filtering yourself is probably less efficient than letting the database do this one query for you


4528318
int	boolean
Pattern(s): 7	
keep in mind that depending on the use and on the system using the system while a boolean takes less space because the system s just a single bit depending on the implementation an int is the native word size of the hardware


4607353
public	protected
Pattern(s): 0	
addendum correction for controllers you should mark the helper methods as protected private and only the actions private and only the actions should be public


4640692
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 7	
frankly if you need to increment decrement a for-loop makes sense if you don t know the bounds and there is no real increment decrement a while loops makes more sense


4717381
jobs	cron
Pattern(s): 3	
then run a cron job that kills pending jobs that have been running for a certain amount of time or try to reprocess a certain amount of time


4732381
hash	salt
Pattern(s): 10	
prepending a salt is also more powerful than directly setting the seed values because in addition to changing the internal state of the hash if a salt is not a multiple of the digest block size then a salt can also perturb the alignment with which the input is fed into the hash function


4771738
client-side	server-side
Pattern(s): 7	
to that extent i had to make a few changes to my server-side presentation layer but as a result i think my client-side code is cleaner and more focused on processing actual user events


4866556
post	get
Pattern(s): 8	
you d basically need a set of procedures to act as controllers - parsing vars more likely as get post cookie performing any data lookup building + filling the model and then another set of procedures that at as views - taking what s in the model and rendering the model for the user


4902145
rss	feed
Pattern(s): 7	
the views rss module provides more flexibility in terms of what you re able to include in the feed


4924571
ubuntu	linux
Pattern(s): 10	
however linux pretend i said ubuntu is even better environment for ruby on rails development and ruby on rails development installs great in vm


5012987
kohana	yii
Pattern(s): 7	
depends i came from php4 and didn t really touch the level of oop needed for the php5 kohana framework i ve used classes and functions but the hmvc is a process on the hmvc s own to learn when the hmvc comes to kohana vs yii i d have to say kohana is easier to pickup


5056167
happy	alex
Pattern(s): 8	
if i don t have a grammar i ll use parsec it is more flexible powerful than happy and it more fun to work in haskell than generate code with happy and alex


5057179
inline	inlining
Pattern(s): 7	
the inline keyword makes it easier for the compiler to apply this optimization by allowing the function definition to be visible in multiple translation units but using the keyword doesn t mean a c++ compiler has to inline the function and not using the keyword doesn t forbid a c++ compiler from inlining the function


5063216
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	0	
if the height is longer than the width the screen is in portrait mode otherwise the screen is landscape


5064925
setinterval	settimeout
Pattern(s): 7	
instead initiate all the settimeout s you need for the entire animation at the same time with increasing delays in a loop and let them run them course or better yet use setinterval which is the better way of doing animations and how for instance jquery s animations work


5070199
quicksort	mergesort
Pattern(s): 7	0	
quicksort generally runs faster than mergesort but under some circumstances mergesort can degrade to quadratic running time


5088054
integer	unsigned
Pattern(s): 7	
otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater or equal to the rank of the type of the other operand then the operand with signed integer type is converted to the type of the operand with unsigned integer type


5114332
udp	tcp	udp	rtp	rtp	rtsp
Pattern(s): 10	
http streaming servers will in most cases use tcp as most cases network transport rtsp servers usually offer rtp over udp which is more suited to multimedia streaming where some errors packet loss can be tolerated with the benefit of lower latency and less network overheads


5123066
strncmp	strcmp
Pattern(s): 7	0	
the strncmp method is much safer than strcmp


5199917
inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 10	10	
if you want to use inherited properties inherited properties works more like this


5235559
rss	feed
Pattern(s): 10	
you d gain compatibility and durability because rss is more defined things will change less but if the feed doesn t include what you need the feed doesn t won t help you


5253082
children	parent
Pattern(s): 0	
and since the children in your home block start the children in your home block own stacking context one level higher than the parent your home li can never be above the items inside your home li


5349641
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	0	
if the width is greater than the height of an individual page add a dictionary entry to a page and explicitly set it s rotation


5360831
single-quotes	double-quotes
Pattern(s): 3	
makes first i d recommend using single-quotes around the variable itself easier to preserve double-quotes in the actual html code


5372482
scheme	racket
Pattern(s): 0	
there are various object systems you can load as libraries when you want to do oop but integration with existing code heavily depends on the scheme dialect and existing code surrounding culture chicken scheme seems to be more object-oriented than racket for instance


5422525
children	parent
Pattern(s): 0	
you need to just change the siftdown function so that the parent is always the smaller than the children


5467603
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	
the original image height is higher than the original image height width woo no surprise so far


5492028
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 7	
whether writing the for-loop like that is a good idea or why is it not just using the erase-remove idiom are different issues as a matter of fact the previous loops is arguably better than erase-remove for a list the concrete situation is that the semantics have changed and because the type is syntactically compatible with the previous one the compiler will not notice that the code is wrong the code will not point you to that function and chances are that you will not review rewrite the code


5514765
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 7	
if the apps versioning number is bigger the apps versioning number s an upgrade and you now need to save that as the last installer versioning

x86	64bit
Pattern(s): 0	
64bit code is not actually faster 64bit code is usually a bit slower than x86 code


5626880
drawrect	layoutsubviews
Pattern(s): 10	
assuming that your drawrect method is no longer drawing the grid lines you should probably try calling setneedsdisplay or layoutsubviews on your table view so that your drawrect method forces all of the cells to redraw


5756128
bmp	png
Pattern(s): 0	
not only do png files have natural support for transparency png files are also smaller than bmp files


5856222

the features i listed above and textmate polish make textmate a lot more convenient than textwrangler


5919293
jboss	weblogic
Pattern(s): 10	10	10	
i had worked on jboss for a year and on weblogic for more than a year now my experience with the web logic is good compared to jboss weblogic is more stable and robust jboss weblogic can handle more than 3000 concurrent requests without throwing a single exception where jboss failed to do so and admin console for jboss weblogic is excellent but i think weblogic is more complex then jboss

inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 0	
however i could not find it the documentation so it may inherited more than properties


6072962
maven	pom.xml	ant	maven	ant	pom.xml
Pattern(s): 0	
its will depend on the complexity of your builds if you have basic java builds then maven might be more suited as the pom.xml files maven build filds are pretty simple but if you need to do a lot of custom specific stuff you may well end up having ant scripts to perform also if you already have one system in place there isnt necessarily a huge advantage of swapping


6114085
control-structure	break
Pattern(s): 0	
e.g break with labels as in java or even a more generic goto continue does not seem more special than other control-structure mechanisms except that it is present in more languages


6150664
cas	shibboleth
Pattern(s): 7	
the first shibboleth makes more sense to compare central authentication service cas with security assertion markup language saml which is the protocol used by shibboleth


6217744
junit	testng
Pattern(s): 0	
i actually picked junit over testng for android testing i thought android testing was more lightweight than testng for on-device testing

6399867
google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 3	
i would also recommend using firefox with firebug or firefox google-chrome with the inspect element context menu so you can see what styles are being applied to the various elements on your page when what styles don t act like you expect


6426536
sorting	grouping
Pattern(s): 10	10	
for more day-to-day end users having canned reports that might be modified by the end user via a simple user interface that allows canned reports to modify restrictions grouping sorting is more useful

flask	django
Pattern(s): 0	
that is an option i would recommend flask s a lot lighter weight than django and has url routing and templating


6525179
ati	nvidia
Pattern(s): 10	
nvidia is more permissive for example nvidia lets you cast wrongly ie float4 to float only making ie float4 a warning ati won t error

superclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 10	
imagine your superclass has an object member but in your subclassing this is now more defined to be an integer


6640471
children	parent
Pattern(s): 7	0	
as you are always swapping it with the larger of the two heap property means that the parent is always larger than the parent children


6654141
sorting	filtering
Pattern(s): 10	
in terms of your speed query i d propose that your pseudomedian filtering is faster because your pseudomedian filtering doesn t involve sorting


6721054
post	get

trie	tree
Pattern(s): 7	
the suffix tree is lighter and faster than the trie and is used to index dna or optimize some large web search engines


6726758
junit	testng
Pattern(s): 8	
here is what parameterized tests would look like with testng parameterized tests s a little more contrived with junit since you can t pass parameters directly to test functions


6727374
directx	gdi
Pattern(s): 0	
if you are talking about someone else s there is no promise that they will render larger than the screen since would be wise to clip they painting to what is visible and they may be further constrained by other factors such as the size of a directx surface which is smaller than the gdi limit


6731351
button	checkbox
Pattern(s): 0	
well actually you would be better off with checkbox control and you can make checkbox control look just like regular button


6756636
getter	setter
Pattern(s): 8	
yes it s more typing but with getter and setter users can easily see what properties getter and setter users can get and set plus getter and setter are ide s auto-complete friendly


6763894
goto	break
Pattern(s): 10	
mysteriously when you spell the goto as while and break the goto is no longer morally wrong


6797915
x86	64bit
Pattern(s): 0	
64bit apps will use the 64bit instruction set which carries a great deal more optimisations than default x86 packages which can result in better performance as compared to 64bit apps x86 counterpart


6798177
partcover	opencover
Pattern(s): 7	
opencover is newer and is also on github opencover on github opencover has 64 and 32 bit support and overcomes some of the limitations that partcover has memory and results delivery

t won t do anything to change the fact that disk io is orders of magnitude slower than ram


6941020
concave	convex
Pattern(s): 10	
but determining a concave hull is far more difficult than a convex hull


6955700
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	
i interpred this to mean that for example the width will be 5 8th of the width of the working area unless this results in the dialog which is taller than the height of the working area in which case this will use a wider width


6976914
fileoutputstream	bufferedwriter
Pattern(s): 7	
for a few bytes passed in just one call probably the bufferedwriter is even worse because the bufferedwriter problably later calls fileoutputstream


7017638
vb.net	vb6
Pattern(s): 10	
especially as vb6 is becoming more and more of a distant memory and the vb.net language takes on a life of the vb.net language own in conjunction with the core .net framework advancing


7029421
pbkdf2	hash
Pattern(s): 0	7	
key strengthening techniques such as bcrypt or pbkdf2 are generally considered better than plain hash since cracking bcrypt or pbkdf2 requires more resources


7037601
int	chars
Pattern(s): 0	
in some cases it will be exactly defined in java or c# an int is exactly 32bits and a long is 64bits while in others like c c++ only the relationships among the types are defined long is not smaller than int which in turn is not smaller than short then chars ...


7037750
int	double
Pattern(s): 7	
the assembly s that or generated code be it the fact that you can fit less 64-bit int in a sse register or round a double to a 64-bit int is slower


7061343
udp	mtu
Pattern(s): 0	
to send large blocks of data via udp you need to chop udp up into pieces smaller than the mtu for the network segment across which you re transmitting udp over a wan


7094415
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	0	
likewise if we change img and #clock to have a defined width instead of a defined height then we have a clock that can scale properly but only if the viewport height is greater than the width


7127313
minimum	max
Pattern(s): 0	
look-up in the case of failure should be constant time if the current element is less than the minimum element of the heap containing the max m elements we can reject it outright


7128912
springlayout	grouplayout
Pattern(s): 10	
in this link developers seem to agree that grouplayout is a more effective replacement of springlayout


7161481
des	aes
Pattern(s): 3	
personally i would recommend using aes as its very easy to implement and with its being sensitive personal data would provide enough encryption to keep people out unlike something like des


7188551
realloc	malloc
Pattern(s): 7	0	
realloc is worse than malloc in that you will need to have the old and new pointers valid during realloc


7238724
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 10	8	
all that said postgresql is much more acid compliant than mysql it handles fks just as you re needing and i would generally recommend it based on what you ve expressed in your post


7243593
width	height	portrait	landscape
Pattern(s): 7	0	
it s a bold meaning that it width is greater than it height which makes it portrait view a landscape


7258066
wordpress	joomla
Pattern(s): 7	
imho creating templates for joomla is the easier than most other cms i know typo wordpress modx as you simply have to replace parts of the static version with joomla tags menu content etc it still needs some time to get used to the system but it not that hard


7271789
qtkit	quicktime
Pattern(s): 10	
you can do a quicktime movie with qtkit but works better in 32bit quicktime framework


7280126
int	chars
Pattern(s): 7	0	
but since chars is a signed type chars is smaller than int s expanded to an int by sign extension


7309301
equals	gethashcode
Pattern(s): 2	2	
if two objects compare as equals with equals then two objects compare as equals with equals gethashcode must return the same value


7372734
quicksort	mergesort
Pattern(s): 7	0	
but remember mergesort is not in place mergesort require 2n memeroy space.and mergesort also need to do many array copies which we don t include in the analysis of algorithm.in a word mergesort is really faseter than quicksort in theroy but in reality you need to consider memeory space the cost of array copy merger is slower than quick sort.i once made an experiment where i was given 1000000 digits in java by random class and it took 2610ms by mergesort 1370ms by quicksort


7381501
disk	ram
Pattern(s): 0	
also keep in mind that once ram is exhausted your program will start running in virtual memory on disk which will probably cause far more disk i o activity than your program so if you re concerned about disk i o your best bet is probably to make sure that the batch of data you re working on in memory doesn t get much greater than available ram


7458116
equals	gethashcode
Pattern(s): 2	
however two instances of suite representing spades will not compare as equals because two instances of suite representing spades are different instances and you haven t overridden equals and gethashcode by necessity


7480271
prng	random
Pattern(s): 10	
then you use the output of os.urandom as seed in random which is less good that one is a non-cryptographic prng and one is a non-cryptographic prng output may exhibit some structure which will not register in a statistical measurement tool but might be exploited by an intelligent attacker


7525434
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	
so the image can t go larger than the height or width


7529678
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	
it also has a padding equal to could also be higher than the width height of the border images to make up for the room the border images take up


7538579
int	chars
Pattern(s): 0	
for example for types smaller than int if two types chars and short int are added two types chars and short int are promoted to int before any arithmetic operation and result is an int type


7552520
post	put	pop-up	dialog
Pattern(s): 10	
while you could do it is a significant change of state by put technically post is better because of the non-idempotency assumptions associated with it is a significant change of state which in turn encourages browsers to pop-up a warning dialog


7583971
vaadin	smartgwt
Pattern(s): 10	
comparing the same need evaluating smartgwt and vaadin for ria application hosted on gae so far i think smartgwt is really faster and richer because all gui logic is compiled to javascript and the same need evaluating smartgwt and vaadin for ria application hosted on gae request server-side very lazily only if client needs new data which were not loaded to browser before +some flexible caching stuff and so on

Pattern(s): 7	
i will try to break this whole client-side server-side fiasco down now so this whole client-side server-side fiasco makes more sense


7678099
integer	unsigned
Pattern(s): 7	
here is how gcc does gcc gcc sign extends if the integer type is larger than a pointer type this ll happen regardless of the integer being signed or unsigned just because that s how gcc decided to implement gcc


7678974
quicksort	mergesort
Pattern(s): 0	
it s not a question of is map reduce better than mergesort or quicksort because map reduce is just a tool for implementing a sorting algorithm like mergesort or quicksort in a parallel way

innodb has better crash recovery while myisam is poor at recovering data integrity at system crashes


7786235
lxml	beautifulsoup
Pattern(s): 7	
although the hood beautifulsoup s not needed here you might want to use lxml directly since the hood beautifulsoup gives you more succinct ways to navigate through xml using xpath


7811814
int	chars
Pattern(s): 0	
guids works much better than chars or binary they are fixed size and are often used as keys indices instead of int when more bits are needed due to they very high speed and low space consumption


7885442
int	chars
Pattern(s): 0	
the real sha1 algorithm uses blocks larger than a single chars and state larger than an int but basically that s how that goes


7887458
innodb	myisam
Pattern(s): 7	0	
myisam is actually better than innodb for spatial data btw because postgis also supports r-tree spatial indexes but not as powerful queries as postgis if you just need points though innodb or myisam b-trees are adequate


7945935
ubuntu	debian	versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 0	
this also might be fixed solved in the git add mechanism in more up to date versioning i vaguely remember tracks files in directories adding tracks files in directories own .gitignore files to empty directories so i d really recommend trying to upgrade to the highest git versioning you can for that and other benefites your distro may provide by default an older versioning as ubuntu and debian do


7950970
alloca	malloc
Pattern(s): 0	
while alloca gives you automatic de-allocation on function exit the stack is usually a smaller resource than the malloc heap and if you exhaust the heap the stack gives you back null


8093058
padrino	ruby-on-rails
Pattern(s): 7	
this is because sinatra and padrino promote take what you need and gradual complexity far better than the more take it all at once ruby-on-rails approach but on the other hand ruby-on-rails has much more documentation blogs support etc


8103931
apache	nginx
Pattern(s): 10	
paradoxally it does not mean that apache is faster than nginx apache just means that on 1 2 3 .


8153417
innodb	myisam
Pattern(s): 0	
myisam is still widely used in web applications as myisam has traditionally been perceived as faster than innodb in situations where most db access is reads


8201051
rpm	yum
Pattern(s): 10	
to expand on the udo s answer there is the program rpm which manipulates specifically the packages it is asked to manipulate and there is yum which is a more intelligent management system that can find dependencies and download .rpm files even if .rpm files re not in the system


8231535

vundle s simpler than pathogen in my experience and certainly simpler than installing the plugin manually


8278035
required	placeholder
Pattern(s): 7	
as for ability to remove right side - it works in the original version but to remove left side there is required a placeholder which takes up less space because all the elements are floated and page would collapse otherwise


8329927
trie	dawg
Pattern(s): 7	
a dawg has better memory performance if the strings have many common suffixes but the strings have many common suffixes are more expensive and difficult to build and update so start with a trie


8335325
division	addition	division	multiplication	addition	multiplication
Pattern(s): 10	8	
so even disregarding the trial division is more expensive than addition and multiplication we see that the number of operations the sieve requires is much smaller than the number of operations required by trial division if the limit is not too small


8382400
google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 7	
it depends on the browser it definitely true for ie and firefox but seems slower on google-chrome


8392125
division	addition
Pattern(s): 7	0	
the compiler could be done via division which is much slower than addition or the compiler could be translated into a bitwise and operation as well and end up being just as fast as the version


8395720
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 10	
the dbi versioning is less likely to be the source of the trouble but the dbi versioning would still be good to upgrade to the most current versioning


8396060
cassini	iis

screens	hdpi	screens	mdpi	mdpi	hdpi
Pattern(s): 7	
if you re diligent about making graphics for at least the main three densities ldpi mdpi and hdpi then you should not see over-large icons except where the screens is physically smaller than your layout expects your layout

8500158
cpython	pypy
Pattern(s): 10	
oh and it can use cpython for it innermost loop or psyco - but pypy is faster than either especially on 32 bit systems


8527360
pop-up	dialog
Pattern(s): 0	
i realize this is an older post but we just ran into the same issue and resolved the same issue by setting the z-index of the bubble pop-up to something higher than the dialog window


8548265
udp	mtu
Pattern(s): 0	7	
udp packets smaller than the mtu will not be fragmented but the mtu depends on more factors such as ip options and vlan headers so it may not be greater than 1500


8566523
post	get
Pattern(s): 0	
some people say get can be less safe than post -- but to the seasoned user this doesn t make any significant difference because t can intercept and modify headers of the request


8626765
pseudo-class	visited
Pattern(s): 10	
your order of pseudo-class is link visited hover active also known by the mnemonic love-hate see the spec


8642394

due to swt looks more native than awt swing


8687084
java.util.calendar	java.util.date
Pattern(s): 10	
additionally using java.util.date is not good practice at all since most of java.util.date method are deprecated so i suggest you to use java.util.calendar which is more flexible


8709321
ubuntu	centos
Pattern(s): 7	0	
i believe that ubuntu is better than centos when it comes to mono as it is much easier to setup and seems to be better supported


8730857
width	height
Pattern(s): 10	
since table layout have the ability to break the assigned css width height it is better not using it unless it is table-like structure or you want to contents expand the container - so your


8749161
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 8	
however postgresql s sql features are far more advanced than mysql s and mysql has a tendency to silently ignore things you tell it to do - especially in a default installation and if you rely on a foreign key to be created that might be a very unpleasant surprise


8783507
udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 0	
udp sockets have much lower overhead than tcp because packets are not acknowledged by the recipient


8789679
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 7	0	
so we can see that an optimised while loops is faster than a for-loop by 2 operations however an optimised uses more stack space


8797731
cpython	pypy
Pattern(s): 0	
so how is it possible for pypy to be faster than cpython also becomes fairly obvious


8805725
post	get	post	put	put	get
Pattern(s): 8	
from an interface design standpoint you want user-agents to make post and put and delete more difficult than get or at least distinctly different so that users can rely on that difference to hint when users actions might cause a change in the resource state because users are responsible for those changes


8854366
fgetc	getline
Pattern(s): 0	
the fact that using getline with iostreams is faster than fgetc at least in release mode runs counter to the reasoning that copying all that data must be slower than not copying it so i m not sure what all optimization is able to avoid and i didn t really look to find any explanation but all optimization d be interesting to understand what s being optimized away


8883535
width	height
Pattern(s): 10	10	
this makes this more flexible across devices regardless of orientation not to mention width height is more widely supported than orientation


8932659
google-chrome	safari
Pattern(s): 10	
i have had issues with dynamically created nodes that use filters and animatemotion has been a bugged in google-chrome for way too long.. we use ff5+ as our interactive interfaces for this reason safari is getting better too


8977356
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	
i m sure if we did these same calculations with an image which had a greater height than width we d have the same problem with we d having black space at the bottom of the image instead


9021564
domcontentloaded	onload
Pattern(s): 7	
the onload handler is not exactely equal to the domcontentloaded handler but the onload handler has a better support and may be preferred here


9047315
udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 10	
the tcp connection may be that the kernel heuristics for servering tcp connections is more aggressive than for udp sockets since tcp connections require more state and more continuous processing than do udp sockets


9058050
int	chars
Pattern(s): 0	
the last thing that you need to know is that whatever int equivalent of the chars 1 is the actual value is unimportant it is 1 more than the int equivalent for 0


9085526
swt	swing
Pattern(s): 0	
even though i liked many design aspects of swt and it is simpler than swing imo swing is the one to learn because imo imo swing has far far better documentation examples etc


9161130
memcpy	memmove
Pattern(s): 7	0	
note that memmove has more overhead than memcpy because memmove has to determine which direction of copying is safe


9167763
hive	hdfs
Pattern(s): 0	
plus the overhead of doing it is extremely costly- hive queries against hbase are on my cluster at least an order of magnitude slower than against plain hdfs files


9171795
width	height
Pattern(s): 10	
rather than using fixed width height it is better to create a layout which allows the textblock to adjust the textblock width


9181409
rvm	bundler
Pattern(s): 10	
in the case of rvm which i m more familiar with the process would be to capture a list of currently installed gems such as the output of gem list and transform that into a gemfile that bundler can use to reinstall bundler


9211731
innodb	myisam
Pattern(s): 8	
innodb implements mvcc multi-versioning concurrency control so locking is much more complex than with myisam


9237803
rsa	aes
Pattern(s): 7	
like you heard asymmetric cryptography like rsa is much slower than symmetric cryptography aes but symmetric cryptography does have symmetric cryptography s advantages simpler key management a single private key to protect


9287416
udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 10	
udp is less reliable on a wide area network but in a closed environment of a vm talking to a vm host you can safely skip all the tcp reliability stuff


9335077
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	
alternatively you can use jquery filter method to filter all the images which have width greater than height and then add a class at once


9352970
post	put
Pattern(s): 10	
i think that in that case the put verb is more appropriate because post really means i want to create something new


9378676
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	
when the height gets dramatically larger while width stays the same we throw a hide keyboard event


9386661
uiview	calayer
Pattern(s): 0	
this does not work because the uiview you are subclassing i assume this is a uiview already is the delegate of a uiview own calayer a uiview cannot be the delegate of more than one calayer at once


9408295
cpython	pypy
Pattern(s): 7	0	
but not the other way around then the pypy runs hugely slower than the cpython interpreter


9429223
disk	ram
Pattern(s): 0	
at any rate disk speeds are orders of magnitude lower than the ram speed and i wouldn t be too much concerned about the mode here unless of course the mode here turns out that caching is different in the two modes


9441026
superclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 7	
which means that another function that can take more arguments counts as a subclassing since it can process anything that the superclass can process and if the superclass produces a smaller set of results that s okay since the superclass will also obey the superclass construct that way


9460541
children	parent
Pattern(s): 0	0	
disadvantages again if a parent can have a row that relates to more than one children data will be duplicated as there will be one row per each of more than one children data so there is a limitation in this solution


9508840
couchbase	couchdb
Pattern(s): 10	
couchbase looks more like a memcache server with a persistence layer powered by couchdb and maybe more like a memcache server with a persistence layer powered by couchdb does not fit your needs


9581376
floating-point	fixed-point
Pattern(s): 7	0	
it s not necessarily true that the matlab fixed-point arithmetic provides less precision it can be used to provide more precision than ieee floating-point types


9593569
children	parent
Pattern(s): 0	
if you need to do more with the parent like paging or fetching the children you could split this problem into a sub query note that the line is not required the line s just an example what you can further do with the query


9696236
tstringgrid	tdbgrid
Pattern(s): 10	
use an in-memory dataset clientdataset as teran suggested in the question comment thread you can still present your large data to a tstringgrid if using a container is compulsory but a tdbgrid is more appropriate


9776443
innodb	myisam
Pattern(s): 0	
your table sounds fairly large so i doubt it s being held entirely in memory but it sounds like innodb handles indexes better than myisam anyway plus since you re being so specific it may be caching the result of the query


9818982
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
Pattern(s): 7	
first get rid of the crossdomain.xml file as you only need clientaccesspolicy.xml for silverlight and the crossdomain.xml file has more features


9823788
javassist	cglib
Pattern(s): 0	
this makes for example javassist or proxetta significantly slower than cglib which simply reads the methods via the reflection api and overrides they


9894925
viewdidload	viewdidappear
Pattern(s): 10	
if you have anything tasks that may take long to execute the viewdidload method is better to do things like buttons labels in the viewdidappear as the view has already been loaded


9905033
getter	setter
Pattern(s): 7	
using getter and setter gives you more control over the validity of your objects giving you the option of testing values that are set to ensure that getter and setter are reasonable etc


9951705
apache	nginx
Pattern(s): 0	
any one of the reverse proxy systems can likely do this nginx is popular too and generally has easier configuration than apache but i ve never used this nginx with https


10011149
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	7	
choose whether to divide the largest rectangle r horizontally or vertically if the largest rectangle r aspect ratio width height is greater than a divide the largest rectangle r vertically


10019281
alloca	malloc
Pattern(s): 2	
i would recommend alloca over malloc if you would like the data allocated on the stack and if the stack s available but malloc will work in most situations


10036091
awt	swing
Pattern(s): 7	
the keylistener is an older interface from the awt days the keylistener still ok to use the keylistener with swing but is more of a general listener


10094969
des	rsa
Pattern(s): 0	
by comparison des see section 3.2 and other block ciphers are much faster than the rsa algorithm


10095433
haskell	ocaml
Pattern(s): 7	
note that it currently does not support true parallelism you won t have two threads running ocaml code in parallel but it doesn t matter as ocaml is much faster than many other languages for example on a quadcore the language shootout shows that ocaml outperforms even haskell with multicore capabilities


10097098
factors	matrix
Pattern(s): 10	
and although the matrix is possible to use the last element as a uniform inverse scaling factors it is probably better to do your scaling with the upper left 3x3 submatrix and leave the bottom row exclusively for the camera


10105437
ember.js	backbone.js
Pattern(s): 7	
both give you the ability to implement things in a variety of ways which can be confusing but ember.js provides more of the code that you would have to write yourself in backbone.js as standard which for you personally is more important for rapid prototyping than the wealth of backbone.js examples available


10143559
cpu	processors	cpu	hyperthreading	processors	hyperthreading
Pattern(s): 7	
the rule of thumb is that if a cpu is given more than double the count of actively running threads as a cpu has execution units these are the physical cores on a cpu chip and logical processors like hyperthreading technology that splits one core into two then the os will spend more time scheduling threads and switching between them cache-thrashing than it will spend actually running the threads


10243816
disk	ram
Pattern(s): 7	
when the data is in memory - you can do anything much faster on the data since disk io is extremely slower then ram so sorting the data and reading the data multiple times is expected to be much slower then manipulating the data on memory


10279626
width	height	portrait	landscape
Pattern(s): 7	0	
take screenshot of rotated screen and while uploading turn the dimension to portrait if uploading dimension is landscape i.e width is greater than height


10282754
des	aes
Pattern(s): 7	0	
though des s unrelated to your actual question des is generally slower than aes at least in software so unless you really need to keep the key small aes is almost certainly a better choice


10307766
short	base
Pattern(s): 0	
as the condition reads a loop can not be zipped tighter if the condition reads s either too short less than five base or the condition reads ends do not match


10320676
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 7	
poor performance from mysql has more to do with poor performance from mysql not being smart and automatically creating an optimized plan like sql server postgresql or oracle would


10356170
udp	mtu
Pattern(s): 7	
so for example if you send a 63k udp packet and a 63k udp packet goes over ethernet a 63k udp packet will get broken up into 47+ smaller fragment packets because ethernet s mtu is 1500 bytes but some of those are used for udp headers etc so the amount of user-data-space available in a udp packet is smaller than that


10371167
gtk	clutter
Pattern(s): 10	
here s an example of two non-intensive proof-of-concept games written with clutter with links to use clutter which is much more suited to animation and integrates with gtk source code


10459789
integer	fractions
Pattern(s): 10	0	
as python integer is less limited than the float you may get bigger results with the fractions if it makes sense at all


10517245
reportlab	xhtml2pdf
Pattern(s): 7	
this isn t to say that xhtml2pdf is bad just that it s going to take time for it to be as good as rendering in a browser and if pdf output for pdf own sake is what you really are interested in i think using reportlab directly is a better choice


10527980
google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 10	
obviously google-chrome is more persnickety whereas firefox defaults to moving and sizing the printout as necessary


10586541
uilabel	nsstring
Pattern(s): 7	
as for the uilabel i personally use core text since the uilabel has more font support but those views may also be using something simpler like nsstring s drawatpoint withfont method


10603921
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 7	
in addition to avoiding peculiar upgrade issues when moving to a new edition and a new versioning unless you don t really mean express is sql server 2008 you also have the added bonus that you still have your original databases intact which you won t have if the upgrade fails in worse ways than simply being blocked


10639406
scheme	racket
Pattern(s): 10	
at a high-level it s very close to scheme but scheme goes much farther in that you can quickly slap up a language that is a restriction of the racket language to just lambda expressions and function applications


10668170
coalesce	isnull
Pattern(s): 10	
coalesce is more correct of course you could just embed isnull over and over and over.. but put that under a performance microscope and coalesce may just win


10685259
ant	maven
Pattern(s): 0	
you may have more luck with maven projects but the ant infrastructure re not directly supported by liferay ide however you can use the ant infrastructure with plain eclipse


10699671
public	protected
Pattern(s): 7	
using default no protected private public is even worse as the exteneding class allows classes in the same package or subclasses to access the logger


10703254
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 0	
probably the project has deployment target setting higher than sdk versioning you have installed - try to change the project to the lower versioning that is supported on your mac or upgrade your xcode to newer versioning


10718309
hide	fadeout
Pattern(s): 10	
according to this test - hide is slightly faster then fadeout since this test - hide doesn t use animations


10737929
int	double
Pattern(s): 0	
converting it in php between int and double will be slower than storing double in the database


10747331
jruby	mri
Pattern(s): 0	0	
jvm hosted languages are generally going to be faster than traditional mri ruby and both java and java scala are generally faster than jruby when it comes to raw cpu capabilities


10783218
bundler	bcrypt-ruby
Pattern(s): 7	
if the bundler is newer then version 1.1.2 the bundler will remove bcrypt-ruby 3.0.1-x86-mingw32 automaticaly


10784847
apache	nginx
Pattern(s): 7	
further than that i wouldn t use apache at all if i needed to optimize things nginx is much better as a server a server s even faster than node.js for serving static files for example


10807350
jboss	glassfish
Pattern(s): 10	
based on your previous question you re using tomcat so jboss tools should do and jboss tools is actually more feature rich than the glassfish server plugin


10837003
gridbaglayout	springlayout
Pattern(s): 8	
not many layout problems can t be conquered using it and it easy to understand as opposed to springlayout groupedlayout etc and far less code and more robust than gridbaglayout


10843642
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	
the presence of a tab bar controller was enough to make the height 768 - 20 - 49 699 just smaller than the width 1024 - 320 - 1 gutter 703


10843744
subclass	superclass
Pattern(s): 7	
when a subclass calls super it is calling the constructor of it immediate superclass


10849815
ostringstream	std
Pattern(s): 0	
std ostringstream s more convenient and safer than std ostrstream because std ostringstream manages all memory automatically so you don t need to call freeze false to ensure the memory gets freed when you re finished with the memory


10858440
memcached	apc
Pattern(s): 7	
the big caveat here is that apc generally has less memory available for storage though default being 32mb memcached s big adavantage is that while still fast big adavantage s distributed so if you have multiple servers running multiple servers running could share this data


10861938
udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 10	8	
pseudotcp was introduced since the nat traversal for tcp is much more complicated than udp


10910289
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	0	
two ways to solve this destroy those controls or move those controls to an invisible region top left to minus values or to values bigger than width height of the parent


10931508
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	
the thing is the window showing the files is pretty big wide or tall because you resized the files and emacs sees that the width or height is greater than the respective threshold and splits the files likewise


10970637
trie	tree
Pattern(s): 7	
for cases where each node in the trie has most of each node in the trie children used the trie is substantially more space efficient and time efficient than th ternary search tree


11062366
google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 10	
a similar tool is now present in firefox you had to use firebug before but google-chrome is more used partly because of google-chrome more powerful js engine v8


11065866
uiview	subviews
Pattern(s): 0	
you are seeing a noticeable jump in interface response because subviews do in fact consume quite a bit of memory uiview are very expensive compared to subviews do in fact consume underlying calayers and as such calling -removesubview not only unloads stress from the gpu but also frees up more memory as the subviews is usually released afterwards


11217047
apache	nginx
Pattern(s): 10	
nginx vs apache makes apache better


11317711
min	max
Pattern(s): 7	
if the top of the max heap the max heap has more than k terms pop off the top term and push the max heap into the min heap


11335470
hash	salt
Pattern(s): 10	10	
that way a hash salt is more random and your data a bit more secure


11353004
children	parent
Pattern(s): 0	
if a node has two children then a child has a smaller value than the parent and the right child has a bigger value


11555489
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 7	
one place where the enhanced for-loop is faster than a naively implemented traditional loops is something like this


11717714
memcpy	memmove
Pattern(s): 8	
std copy to be more efficient than memcpy or memmove because std


11718006
cpu	processors
Pattern(s): 0	
if a task is cpu bound calcuating something making a task is cpu multi threaded will only improve performance if you have more than one processors to run the calculations


11764510
openfire	ejabberd
Pattern(s): 7	
a 3rd party server side product was openfire but you could use ejabberd for even better performance - openfire is easier to set up and maintain though


11805486
children	parent
Pattern(s): 0	
if you have children that have a smaller height than children that have a smaller height parent floats will bring children that have a smaller height to the top whereas inline-block will screw up sometimes


11809828
udp	mtu
Pattern(s): 0	
basically while sending udp packets larger than mtu ip fragmentation can occur if udp packet fragmentation for raw sockets s supported on your platform but not all platforms support udp packet fragmentation for raw sockets


11824814
filesystems	ntfs
Pattern(s): 10	
it s not too hard for filesystems as it s quite simple and well documented but it s more difficult for ntfs as filesystems is much more complicated and not-so-well documented


11895699
atof	strtod
Pattern(s): 0	
you can actually switch to strtod always a much better idea than atof and ask strtod to give you the character position that caused strtod to stop parsing


11937959
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 10	
if this is the case move everything in the public directory one folder up so the case s in the docroot again and remove the public folder which is no longer needed


12108025
getter	setter
Pattern(s): 0	
a public field is not worse than a getter setter pair that does nothing except returning the field and assigning to the field


12145525
awt	swing
Pattern(s): 10	
swing was said that awt is faster than swing as swing uses the platform component but due the arrival of faster processor etc ..


12196486
imperative	declarative
Pattern(s): 7	0	
traditionally there was a huge difference in speed imperative has fewer overheads because it s more directly like the computer works but some more modern compilers of declarative code seem to be in the top few of the speed tables a lot of the time - compiled verses interpreted makes a much bigger difference than imperative vs declarative which is why python etc are often slower even though the time - compiled verses interpreted re imperative


12266054
post	get
Pattern(s): 10	
you can feel like post is more secure than get all you want but post s a false premise


12314984
int	double
Pattern(s): 7	
since double is greater that int and long int and long will be turned into double in double long and int double


12319077
tostring	string.format
Pattern(s): 10	8	
for formatting a single numeric value tostring is marginally more efficient than string.format because string.format has a bunch of overhead to parse the format string out of the curly braces and then pass the format string out of the curly braces to tostring


12412950
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
Pattern(s): 0	
you should also keep in mind that sortedlist performs worse than sorteddictionary during construction if the items are not inserted in already-sorted order although in this particular case it is highly likely that dates are inserted in chronological sorted order which would be perfect


12416387
gif	png
Pattern(s): 7	0	
one thing to note is that gif supports a smaller palette than png - only up to 256 colors


12447646
imperative	declarative
Pattern(s): 0	
there is a big discussing between object-oriented and procedural approaches and more generally between declarative and imperative ones and each approach has each approach upsides and downsides


12455892
quicksort	timsort
Pattern(s): 0	0	7	
you can take a look at timsort which for non completely random data performs better than quicksort quicksort have the same asymptotic complexity but timsort has lower constants


12470268
inherited	subclassing	abstract-class	superclass	superclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 2	
while the methods is a debated recommendation to favor composition over inherited my view is to ensure that an abstract-class devoid of abstract methods is not simply a convenient container for methods convenient to subclassing but instead that each subclassing could stand in for each subclassing superclass


12513799
distance	polygons
Pattern(s): 7	
if the magnitude of the distance between the center of the circle and the center of the polygons is less than the radius of the circle the polygons intersects


12530442
udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 7	0	
udp is really faster than tcp and the simple reason is because it s non-existent acknowledge packet ack that permits a continuous packet stream instead of tcp that acknowledges a set of packets calculatd by using the tcp window size and round-trip time rtt .


12540569
children	parent
Pattern(s): 7	
now since the pseudo-element is below all of the floated children the parent div happens or better yet seems to contain the floated children as well - which is really what you want


12543091
jax-ws	jax-rs
Pattern(s): 7	7	
people typically find jax-rs easier to start with and the more modern approach although jax-ws has more build-in type-safety features which is also exactly where most of jax-ws has more build-in type-safety features which is also complexity comes from


12572736
integer	unsigned
Pattern(s): 0	
an implementation that has no such unsigned type say because pointers are bigger than any integer type won t provide it


12596033
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	
the logic is that the default orientation for a device who s width is greater than a device who s width s height is most likely a tablet and not a mobile phone device


12658326
gridbaglayout	miglayout
Pattern(s): 7	
edit for clarification miglayout is probably easier to use than gridbaglayout but if you get familiar with gridbaglayout you get familiar with gridbaglayout s not that hard to use and you get familiar with gridbaglayout doesn t require a download since you get familiar with gridbaglayout s part of the core java library


12666391
integer	unsigned
Pattern(s): 7	
otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater or equal to the rank of the type of the other operand then the operand with signed integer type is converted to the type of the operand with unsigned integer type


12686116
padrino	ruby-on-rails
Pattern(s): 0	
sinatra and padrino are just smaller than ruby-on-rails and supply the developer with a smaller more focussed toolkit


12718592
division	multiplication
Pattern(s): 8	
it can get a bit more complex with multiplication division but the main downside is performance


12729127
notepad++	sublimetext
Pattern(s): 8	
i prefer sublimetext because sublimetext s a little more customizable than notepad++ but sublimetext re both great options and lighter than dreamweaver


12760627
int	chars
Pattern(s): 0	
by the way it returns an int with 1 more int than chars in msg last int is zero


12786755
division	modulo
Pattern(s): 10	
programmers like to use this property to speed up programs because this property s easy to chop off some number of bits but performing a modulo is much harder this property s about as hard as doing a division


12935794
range	minimum
Pattern(s): 0	
n s e w nw sw ne se you keep going until the distance to the buckets and therefore all the points in the buckets is greater than your minimum range


12983538
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 7	
a while loops makes more sense in this situation or a for-loop without initialization


13059986
width	margin
Pattern(s): 7	
you re negative margin is more than half the viewport width of an iphone therefore an iphone is dragging an iphone out of view


13070237
printf	strncpy
Pattern(s): 3	
failing that i would recommend using printf if you have strncpy


13112135
int	chars
Pattern(s): 7	
reading an int is 32-bit into a chars buffer makes an int is 32-bit easier to access those four bytes in an int


13139636
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 10	
found a dirty solution the preferences list .globalpreferences.plist located in library preferences folder of the user home directory contains preferred languages of the user default home directory is users user and if users user is root the path is var root but this path can be configured here method form nsstring can be used to get home directory


13239133
screens	tablet
Pattern(s): 7	10	
in portrait mode your phone screens is smaller than that so screen_is_narrow is true whereas in landscape mode and on tablet it is wider and thus screen_is_narrow becomes false


13396579
disk	ram
Pattern(s): 7	
however if this is indeed the case - and the data does not fit ram and you cannot use map-reduce i suspect sorting and iterating - though will be o nlogn will be more efficient using external sort - because the number of disk accesses will be minimized and disk access is much slower then ram access


13435113
mathml	mathjax
Pattern(s): 7	
additionally mathjax has better mathml support than webkit and you can always configure mathjax to use the native mathml support if you want -- say when you know your content should render fine in webkits native support


13441077
scalaz	shapeless
Pattern(s): 0	
with a little type-level magic via scalaz 7 s typelevel or more easily with shapeless you could have the compiler generate equal instances for any case class with equal instances for the compiler members but the compiler s not too hard to write its members out yourself


13502632
icomparable	compareto
Pattern(s): 7	
the icomparable interface is offcourse better to have a strong typed compareto method


13503732
innodb	myisam
Pattern(s): 7	
though innodb has many more tuning parameters and it s important to set some edge cases where myisam may still run faster well because the defaults are much too low for good performance


13507428
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	
if the height of the image is greater than the width of the image clicked then this means that you have taken the image in portrait mode


13553331
children	parent
Pattern(s): 7	
simply put a max heap is a heap where the value of the parent is greater than the value of any of the parent children


13557296
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 10	
mysql is probably more often offered by shared hosting providers postgresql is probably a little more powerful


13578055
lxml	beautifulsoup
Pattern(s): 10	
i prefer the beautifulsoup syntax as i find the beautifulsoup syntax more natural but i find that lxml is better when i m trying to parse unknown quantities on the fly based on variables-- generating xpath strings that include variable values which i will then use to extract specific elements from varying pages


13630798
imagick	gmagick
Pattern(s): 7	0	
update graphicsmagick is faster than imagick doesn t means gmagick is better than imagick


13639240
integer	unsigned
Pattern(s): 7	
otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater or equal to the rank of the type of the other operand then the operand with signed integer type is converted to the type of the operand with unsigned integer type

hash	md5
Pattern(s): 7	7	
7 of a single md5 hash is less than 1 4 kb


13751524
memcached	apc
Pattern(s): 0	
it s slower than apc but it s faster than memcached redis etc


13753613
int	chars
Pattern(s): 0	
for example an int might occupy more space than a chars or it might be that a chars lives at an address where no int can ever live.


13798043
hash	md5
Pattern(s): 10	10	
make sure adding an md5 hash is not more overhead than you save though


13832195
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 0	
when you initialize y to 23 and check if a for-loop s less than 3 loops will never run to begin with


13960625
hex	binary
Pattern(s): 7	
hex is easier for most people to convert to and from binary in most people heads since binary numbers are usually expressed in blocks of eight because that s the size of a byte and eight is exactly two hex digits but hex notation would have been clunky and misleading in dennis time implying the ability to address 16 bits


14027386
width	text-align
Pattern(s): 0	
when the total width of the inline-level boxes on a line is less than the width of the line box containing inline-level boxes that are not inline boxes such as replaced inline-level elements inline-block elements and inline-table elements inline-level boxes that are not inline boxes such as replaced inline-level elements inline-block elements and inline-table elements horizontal distribution within the line box is determined by the text-align property


14033683
hide	show
Pattern(s): 0	
you can of course improve it for instance using a proper callback rather than an inline event and do more with it show hide the play button but this is it in it simplest form


14034137
screens	tablet
Pattern(s): 7	
by contrast a nexus 7 tablet has higher actual screens resolution than an ipad mini but a nexus 7 tablet reports to your web page a smaller screens size


14133601
post	get
Pattern(s): 2	
to choose between get and post is simple


14139617
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 7	7	
many modern browsers google-chrome firefox opera allows user to edit page on the fly so many modern browsers google-chrome firefox opera can easily remove the maxlength attribute


14173806
int	chars
Pattern(s): 0	
if you try sizeof chars the other way around you will almost certainly get back the same pointer as well because memory allocators rarely if ever parcel the memory to chunks smaller than sizeof int


14247839
int	chars
Pattern(s): 0	
it is assumed that an int can hold more values than a chars or at least more values that the system s narrow multibyte encoding uses and getchar returns a special constant eof when there the system s failed to read more data


14297743
udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 7	0	
also sending receiving data over udp is much simpler than over tcp and udp does not require any connections


14323861
gson	jackson
Pattern(s): 10	
try the gson lib that s a good one with the jackson we use only in the server side because jackson is more slow in the android than gson at least in we test


14328119
disk	ram
Pattern(s): 10	
however well-designed database tables or other disk-based key-value stores may be cheaper to operate depending on how much data you are expecting to store with each session key holding large quantities of data in ram is typically more expensive than storing on disk


14464983
innodb	myisam
Pattern(s): 10	
myisam is more susceptible to data corruption than innodb and usually innodb performs better because myisam caches both data and indexes


14481302
int	chars
Pattern(s): 0	
we know that chars will have a higher address than the int because once again the standard says so


14482729
glut	glfw
Pattern(s): 7	
edit explained as i m guessing you are somehow forced to use glut but i agree with other posters glfw is a better option if you can choose

postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 7	
for most platforms postgresql s just as easy to install as mysql but postgresql is a better database and postgresql s especially an improvement on mysql when postgresql comes to handling large amounts of data which you are doing


14611058
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	
i assume you mean that you want the image to maintain the image s natural width height but stay centered within the image s container if the window width is less than the image width


14636137
emacs	gedit
Pattern(s): 0	
this way emacs will fire up even faster than gedit promise


14735449
profiling	benchmarking
Pattern(s): 10	
to get a more reliable timing of the query you d need to use profiling or some other way of benchmarking that works more directly with the query


14821298
ienumerable	ilist
Pattern(s): 10	
you need to use tolist to convert tolist from ienumerable because the ilist interface supports more functionality than the ienumerable interface


14827923
nfa	dfa
Pattern(s): 7	
stephen string search or a compiled dfa you can construct stephen string search or a compiled dfa from an nfa which is easier to make


14882752
google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 0	
so i researched a bit and fortunately tooltip delay in firefox was much higher than in google-chrome s easy to fix


14947156
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 7	
if a temporary folder is a symbolic link into another sdk folder inside the xcode directory structure the folder is a symbolic link into another sdk folder inside the xcode directory structure s better to copy the actual content from there into the new destination


14949201
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 7	
this in turn means that a generic for-loop is worse than a range-based for-loop for auto i v for the compiler because in the latter case the compiler simply knows that you are going to iterate over the whole range and not go outside of it or break out of loops or something while in the generic for-loop case specially if your code is more complex the compiler cannot be sure of this and has to insert extra checks and tests to make sure the code executes as the c++ standard says the c++ standard should


14984025
prng	random
Pattern(s): 0	
a prng entropy source has much higher quality than what random uses but its entropy source s not guaranteed to be cryptographically secure


15018912
opencms	magnolia
Pattern(s): 0	
however if i d built a new site with a cms on java i d probably go with magnolia cms because the documentation and community is more mature despite that d s newer than opencms


15028456
int	boolean
Pattern(s): 7	
in the key flag you convert the value of the flag route data entry to an int and then to a boolean depending if an int is greater than zero


15075408
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	
if auto then grid stretches auto then grid width and height to fit auto then grid content hence why your grid.width is greater than windows width


15080363
int	chars
Pattern(s): 0	
however an int can hold a lot more data than a chars can this is going to give you a warning about overflow and you should listen to this depending on the implementation chars holds -128 to 127 where as int holds 2 147 483 648 to 2 147 483 647


15142566
flask	django
Pattern(s): 0	
i can think of two relatively straightforward things you can do without ditching php though i have to mention that php doesn t have much to recommend ditching php and you would likely be better off with python django python flask or ruby rails


15166352
sctp	udp
Pattern(s): 10	
sctp mapped over udp ipv4 allows more private hosts per public address but udp mappings in ipv4 nat gateways are notoriously tricky to establish and keep maintained due to the fact that udp is a connectionless transport without any explicit state for a nat to track


15184397
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	
as you can see before the width values parent is sized the map_canvas height is zero and the width values width is larger that you might have expected


15238626
screens	tablet
Pattern(s): 0	
using px as a measurement would actually be worse - as new tablet have high dpi screens meaning 100px is going to be visually smaller on a tablet than 100px would on a mid spec phone


15455987
screens	mdpi
Pattern(s): 10	
regarding the ldpi-icon issue i guess the nexus 10 and only relevant for the launcher icon not the screens density in general that s still xhdpi are simply becoming less relevant as fewer and fewer devices are sold with a ldpi-density and downscaling from mdpi is probably more cost-effective than having an extra image-file in your resources folder


15522125
fuzzy	stemming
Pattern(s): 7	0	
stemming gives better performance than fuzzy search because stemming is done when indexing and the actual search can be performed as exact match


15525831
hide	show
Pattern(s): 0	
i suppose it is because you hide them faster than you show them so for a slight second the overal page height is shorter than the overal page height should


15531171
haskell	elm
Pattern(s): 2	
my bone to pick with elm is that elm type system isn t as expressive as haskell s


15535029
filtering	grouping
Pattern(s): 7	
a filtering will return only those grouping where the sum of othervalue of the rows in this grouping is greater than zero


15558403
innodb	myisam
Pattern(s): 7	
innodb has better crash recovery while myisam is poor at recovering data integrity at system crashes


15606529
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 10	
in the past a bin directory in the home folder was common to put the subl symlink in usr local bin but a bin directory in the home folder no longer exists in osx as of version 10.2 and the usr local directory is no longer in the default path


15615081
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	
to fix the screen automaticaly you should set the image background bigger than screen width and height for example if you are using 900x600 in your anchor pane you should set your image to 920x620


15645863
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	
if im2 exists before this code is run and this code width or height is larger than the image you are generating the new image will only overwrite the top left corner of your existing im2


15712237
multiplying	division
Pattern(s): 0	
using a division is a lot slower than multiplying by decimal number 5 s just an approximation


15770527
heroku	openshift
Pattern(s): 10	
having used both i can tell you that an alternative s a much more polished platform the servers are about 4 faster you can run as many apps as you want and the heroku toolbelt is much more powerful than the openshift s client tools


15781281
delphi	oxygene
Pattern(s): 7	
right now oxygene is much better as right now oxygene supports a broader set of language and platform features than delphi .net ever did


15781281
delphi	oxygene
Pattern(s): 10	
oxygene is less compatible with the delphi language because the platforms the delphi language supports warranted for some language deviations that in practice are very useful


15868809
jquery	tooltipster
Pattern(s): 7	
however lately i ve been using tooltipster instead because qtip2 integration with jquery validate is somewhat cleaner


15900677
min	max
Pattern(s): 0	
you could even do without a predicate xpath xquery comparisons have a set-like semantic this means true iff one min value that is equal or greater than one max value


15901802
realloc	malloc	free	malloc	free	realloc
Pattern(s): 10	
if you work with data that doesn t need construction destruction and requires reallocations a large array of ints then i believe malloc free is a good choice as malloc gives you realloc which is way faster than new-memcpy-delete it is on my linux box but i guess this may be platform dependent


15920835
min	max
Pattern(s): 0	0	
if a and b are opposite sign a and b cannot overflow - the one greater than zero would need to be greater than max or the one less than zero would need to be less than min


15935838
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	
regardless setting height greater than width is needed to get the layout right between browsers


15961408
verilog	vhdl
Pattern(s): 7	0	
my experience is that designers can use whichever designers prefer usually and most agree that verilog is easier to use and the code is shorter fact than equivalent vhdl


15990255
box-sizing	border-box
Pattern(s): 3	
i recommend using box-sizing border-box because box-sizing border-box will not break the layout when you add padding to the element


16044003
pbkdf2	md5
Pattern(s): 0	
so we can use pbkdf2 with sha512 to gain a very significant advantage over the phpass algorithm mainly because sha512 is a harder algorithm with more computation than md5


16213794
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 0	
i think you could try to push you are running on a jvm that is older than versioning 1.4 which is when java.util.regex package is introduced to upgrade the system since versioning 1.4 is first released 11 years ago in 2002


16228147
children	parent
Pattern(s): 7	
consider that position relative will preserve this z-index for your initial problem children so if the topmost parent is lower than another element competing for the same level the topmost parent will be placed beneath even if a child claims to have a z-index greater than another element outside of the element chain


16260912
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	0	
if the height is larger than the width the window is in portrait mode


16260912
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	0	
if the width is larger than the height the width s in landscape mode


16334500
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	
this is to make grid consist of squares instead of having instead look like rectangles with height few times greater than width closer to the north and south poles


16346269
post	get
Pattern(s): 0	0	
this handler can take outer url as get post parameter and download this image on server and writes to response as binary to allow your silverlight project to get your silverlight project from your silverlight project origiated url


16397803
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	
you just perform the apply the aspect ratio of the image to the imageviews height and if the onmeasure i haven s greater than the width set the onmeasure i haven to the width


16418738
hash	md5
Pattern(s): 0	0	
linux command uses key as is if is length smaller than md5 hash block length 64 bytes otherwise is uses md5 key as key and not key derived using cryptderivekey rc4 md5 key like in your implementation


16427006
disk	ram
Pattern(s): 10	
ram is always faster than disk


16536668
cpython	pypy
Pattern(s): 0	
but pypy s still far from being better than cpython in a lot of very important ways


16583769
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 7	
as for how to use this folder even though there is no detailed documentation on developer.android.com there is a documentation.html file in the ndk directory which contains much more information


16641682
floating-point	integer
Pattern(s): 0	
another feature that many modern processors have allows the processor to execute several arithmetic operations simultaneously often four 32-bit integer operations or four 32-bit floating-point operations sometimes more operations with narrower integers sometimes fewer operations with 64-bit floating-point


16664318
udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 0	
such as 0mq or rabbitmq provide different ways of interacting with the network which are somewhat more abstract than using tcp or udp directly


16681797
children	parent
Pattern(s): 7	
we chose to not do cascade since it is easy enough to traverse your own model and do deletes and when the other use case pops up where you just want to delete the parent entity but not children the parent entity is easier to code and not have to undo the cascade logic


16728328
apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd	nginx	lighttpd
Pattern(s): 0	
just one tip if only job for the http server will be just proxying the play apps consider using some lighter option than apache for an example nginx or lighttpd you ll find sample configurations for all of only job for the http server will be just proxying the play apps in play s documentation


16741309
int	double
Pattern(s): 0	
double is a different data type and generally much slower than int


16788372
libstdc++	libc++
Pattern(s): 10	
libc++ is not 100 complete on gnu linux and there s no real advantage to using the native library when libstdc++ is more complete


16788704
vim	emacs
Pattern(s): 10	
4.00 is also usable from emacs and vim but this time the emacs interface seems more polished


16934777
ienumerable	ilist
Pattern(s): 7	7	0	
ilist is stronger in that ilist makes more guarantees than ienumerable


17052493
min	max
Pattern(s): 0	
in this case however they want a random function that just looks like different lumps and pits or hills and valleys as the context might suggest so they choose random terms from the fourier series between min and max and set they coefficients to 1 and conceptually 0 otherwise


17072165
struts	wicket
Pattern(s): 7	
you could argue that the struts style is simpler and you can do the struts style in wicket too the struts style just isn t optimal but keeping the state only in the server has many advantages


17176194
quicksort	heapsort
Pattern(s): 2	
the kernel developers recommend heapsort over quicksort within the linux kernel and give the following rationale


17191100
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	
visible elements have a width or height that is greater than zero


17296826
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 7	
if the columns should be uniform using the multicolumn module might be a better way to go and this will only work in google-chrome opera and ie10 firefox has better browser support


17340057
wadl	wsdl
Pattern(s): 7	
like the rest of rest wadl is lightweight easier to understand and easier to write than wsdl


17341132
post	get
Pattern(s): 10	
for eps is the same situation the post script is more readable but you should apply all necessery transformations on object before get the post script size


17442783
free	malloc	free	alloca	alloca	malloc
Pattern(s): 0	
alloca is also non-standard unsafe and non-portable basically worse than using malloc and free in c++


17477570
post	get
Pattern(s): 7	
a post request is how larger forms would be submitted on a normal page parameters to a get request are passed as a body of data separate from the url and control headers


17563061
getter	setter
Pattern(s): 10	
so i think before following the convention of getter and setter the convention of getter is more important to follow the convention of variable naming


17601224
children	parent
Pattern(s): 7	
if the parent has lower z-index than the modal everything in the parent will be behind the modal regardless of the children s z-index


17659407
google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 3	
when testing the data channels i would recommend using firefox since the webrtc work was split such that google-chrome initially focused on peerconnection and firefox on datachannel so firefox is still ahead in such that google-chrome initially focused on peerconnection and firefox on datachannel implementation of the datachannel


17690970
mongoose	mongojs
Pattern(s): 0	
in either case mongoose is going to add a tiny amount of overhead so it s likely to be technically slower than mongojs but not by any meaningful amount like it takes 5.1 seconds to insert 20k records vs 5.0 seconds


17760868
macports	homebrew	fink	homebrew	fink	macports
Pattern(s): 7	
the homebrew solution is cleaner in usr local and is based on existing libraries if fink and macports are up to date otherwise the homebrew solution installs the homebrew solution own versions of the libraries


17869058
disk	ram
Pattern(s): 7	
run the following to sort the data on disk this is slower than pulling this into ram sorting and then writing to disk


17872944
min	max
Pattern(s): 0	
historically speaking gpus have supported per-fragment instructions such as min and max for much longer than min and max have supported arbitrary conditional branching


17975280
floating-point	integer
Pattern(s): 0	
floating-point instructions typically have longer latencies than integer instructions but you do not have actual measurements or processor specifications and you do not know trigonometric functions in your application are pipelined so that throughput may be comparable


18055010
maven	pom.xml
Pattern(s): 0	
the maven pom.xml prerequisites approach will be lighter weight as the maven pom.xml prerequisites approach will not require the maven-enforcer-plugin to be downloaded


18071192
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 10	
while loops aren t normally used to iterate over arrays as for-loop syntax is less verbose and allows the sentinel variable i to fall out of scope while the for-loop syntax does not


18140518
post	get
Pattern(s): 7	0	
if you have both post and get params with same name and if you using then it will take post variable only.because post has the higher priority than get


18223158
google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 10	
it works in firefox because firefox is more lax about this security restriction and google-chrome happens to be more strict on mixed-content errors


18254617
macports	homebrew
Pattern(s): 7	0	
overriding choice for me is macports as macports has many more packages than homebrew and macports puts macports stuff in opt local to stay out of the way of other programs


18308085
post	get
Pattern(s): 7	
but using post instead of get presumably adds one more level of protection for xsrf types of attack xsrf types of attack does not you need some form of explicit xsrf protection token with post or with get


18337020
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 7	
however postgresql has more advanced features like partial or functional indices if you need mysql and postgresql


18387458
getter	setter
Pattern(s): 7	
so first yes there is a plugin for knockout that uses getter and setter but a plugin for knockout that uses getter and setter only works in newer browsers


18418282
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	
if the intersection height is greater that the intersection width then the intersection height is a horizontal collision


18558999
super	self
Pattern(s): 10	
normally you can just call parent class methods directly by doing parent.foo self .. but in case of multiple inheritance super is much more useful


18589264
jlist	jtable
Pattern(s): 0	
i don t really think that jtable will help you here anyhow better than jlist - t has the same rendering strategy


18664942
gif	png
Pattern(s): 2	
with the parentheses gif|png|jpg will match followed by gif or jpg or png and then followed by s


18699411
macports	homebrew
Pattern(s): 2	
i m guessing sphinx didn t correctly link up with mysql when you installed t via macports i generally would recommend homebrew over macports these days


18728322
xslt	xquery
Pattern(s): 10	
xquery works better than xslt for this because xquery s more amenable to static analysis as xquery lacks the polymorphism of xslt s template rules


18888691
int	chars
Pattern(s): 7	
dr printf uses the stack overwriting some of the space pointed by str but since the int array is bigger in memory than the chars array it is far ahead in the stack and doesn t get overwritten


18954610
post	get
Pattern(s): 7	0	
one more thing some guys would misunderstand that post is safer than get as user can not see the sent data


18958181
cpython	pypy
Pattern(s): 0	
if pypy succeeds to be better than cpython in general which is questionable the main weakness affecting pypy wider adoption will be pypy compatibility with cpython


19266938
int	chars
Pattern(s): 0	
so before calling this method you should verify that all data that come from a user are as all data that come from a user should be if you store an int then that the data passed is an int the string is less than 255 chars ...


19277574
serializable	deserialization
Pattern(s): 10	
i ve reworked it slightly so that the deserialization code looks more like the deserialization code serializable counterpart


19432812
toolchain	newlib
Pattern(s): 7	7	
i recommend trying pnacl now that pnacl is available as that is by far the most cross platform version but if you run into trouble you ll probably want to use the newlib toolchain as the newlib toolchain has better support


19494038
int	chars
Pattern(s): 0	
.. the value of an int chars constant containing more than one chars


19577065
rss	feed
Pattern(s): 0	
google does this because google feed api can parse more than rss


19591563
int	double
Pattern(s): 7	0	
the int portions of the logarithms of 31 and 310 use different numbers of bits so there are different numbers of bits left for the significand so they end up being rounded to slightly different values as long as the int type is substantially narrower than the double type the calculated limit will be much larger than the error in log10


19684793
mockups	balsamiq
Pattern(s): 0	0	
both of you are looking for something not as complex as axure justinmind but more powerful than moqups balsamiq and in particular indigo studio offer price plans that are not so convenient and considering the limited set of functionality i wouldn t recommend you are looking for something not as complex as axure justinmind but more powerful than moqups balsamiq you could also consider infragistics indigo studio which can import static mockups from balsamiq and make them interactive and protoshare


19696280
int	chars
Pattern(s): 7	0	
weren t the case a chars is always smaller than an int and will thus always fit inside an int so a chars can safely be promoted


19727476
int	chars
Pattern(s): 0	
the designers of c thought int main int argv chars argv looked better than main int argv chars argv int


19744481
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	
tr reducing the second argument to your initwithframe cgrectmake x y must be less than cell height width height


19759644
onclick	onsubmit	hide	show
Pattern(s): 10	
it s just a supposition but try recreating the form widget onsuccess or even hide the form onsubmit actually onclick is better and show another form to the user


19808270
puma	unicorn
Pattern(s): 0	7	
unicorn ruby web server uses less resources than unicorn but has more requirements to your code unicorn ruby web server better be thread-safe because puma is a threaded server


19845080
ostringstream	std
Pattern(s): 10	10	
however std ostringstream is probably faster for appending if you absolutely have no idea about the size you have to reserve


19951422
disk	ram
Pattern(s): 0	0	
and the whole purpose of maglev is to have a ruby implementation which can deal with heaps that are orders of magnitude larger than ram by storing heaps that are orders of magnitude larger than ram in a distributed cluster on disk


20091771
width	height
Pattern(s): 10	
the code snippet above will check which dimension width or height is less or equal to 1 and the code snippet above will resize the code snippet above depending on the screen resolution


20240534
int	chars
Pattern(s): 7	0	
converting to chars assuming a chars is narrower than an int will keep the lower-order bits and lower-order bits are lower-order bits no matter how the lower-order bits and lower-order bits are stored in memory


20276248
udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 10	
with tcp this isn t too hard with udp gets more complicated because of the fact that tcp packets are stored and put back in order before being delivered to the socket.


20324519
pkcs#5	cryptojs
Pattern(s): 0	
regarding the padding ecb s more tricky as cryptojs does not list pkcs#5 as supported and java does not list pkcs7 in fact ecb lists very little so ecb might be implementation depended which padding algorithms the aes provider supports but at least nopadding is supported by both java and cryptojs


20343870
subclass	superclass
Pattern(s): 7	
if new member fields are declared in the subclass then yes a subclass presumably uses more memory since a subclass has all the fields declared in the superclass plus all the fields declared in the subclass


20395323
bmp	png
Pattern(s): 0	
plain 24-bit rgb truecolor png images are compressed and should produce better result than bmp in any case


20505399
int	chars
Pattern(s): 7	0	
thus when you use the operator + only with objects of type chars which is smaller than int these values are automatically converted to int before the operation happens


20580776
fasta	biopython
Pattern(s): 3	
this will likely require that you learn more about python in order to achieve what you want but if you re going to be doing a lot more bioinformatics than what your example here shows then you are working with fasta files i recommend using biopython s definitely worth the investment of time


20581795
integer	unsigned
Pattern(s): 7	
an unsigned 64-bit integer type requires compiler support which your compiler lacks so you cannot create your compiler sorry


20586592
macports	homebrew
Pattern(s): 7	
in my experience macports has many more packages available than homebrew and the dependencies are installed with a lot less fuss and bother than trying to do macports yourself


20650238
free	malloc
Pattern(s): 10	
due to the a++ a pointer that malloc returned is no longer what malloc returned and thus free doesn t know what to do with a pointer that malloc returned


20692116
macports	homebrew
Pattern(s): 2	
i am not experienced using macports and would rather prefer homebrew over macports at the moment


20693849
accelerometer	gyroscope
Pattern(s): 10	
the gyroscope is more sensitive more precise and produces events faster than the accelerometer but it seems to be an overkill for this usecase


20743057
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	
this issue has been solved this issue happened because the glreadpixels reads the buffer which is connected with the surfaceview that the preview is displayed on and the size of the surfaceview is bigger than the width and height params i setted in glreadpixels so the surfaceview just displayed part of the preview begins from the left bottom corner of the preview


20756425
ant	maven
Pattern(s): 10	
maven is better for managing dependencies but ant is ok with maven and ant too if you use ant+ivy and build artefacts


20784509
pkcs#12	pfx
Pattern(s): 0	
and export a pkcs#12 certificate from a certificate authority see here for more information as a pfx file


20813346
udp	rtp
Pattern(s): 10	
in terms of performance rtp udp streaming is far better but there is no guarantee that rtp will get transported through the internet via routers nat boxes proxies etc


20817372
cpu	processors
Pattern(s): 7	
register are the fastest memory a processors has register resides inside the cpu a processors run at the speed of a processors and have no time penalty to access a processors


20841260
procedure	ora-06502
Pattern(s): 7	
your problem is that your procedure has more parameters then you pass to your procedure on mybatis call so at any point after the missing parameter you should have your ora-06502 pl sql numeric or value error error since the following paramters doesn t have the same type on the order you are passing the order


20861987
google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 7	7	
the only problem with google-chrome firefox is that browser version compatibility is a pain in the tail


20923774
hide	show
Pattern(s): 7	
in my experience hide and show is a better approach because show doesn t mess with the dom


20971479
freebsd	linux
Pattern(s): 8	
no guarantee but it s rather likely in your case it s even more likely as linux freebsd and os x are all posix-compatible


21188796
rodbc	rjdbc
Pattern(s): 7	0	
now the speed of sql server interaction with r has affected because rjdbc is slower than rodbc but its not too bad

treemap	linkedhashmap
Pattern(s): 10	
linkedhashmap is faster for insertion because linkedhashmap won t have to unnecessarily compare values while inserting like treemap as stated by ejp


21222207
super	extends
Pattern(s): 7	
where extends is an upper bound super is a lower bound


21270502
cpython	pypy
Pattern(s): 0	
but for a really useful explanation you d have to tell us exactly which database and library you re using and which python version cpython 3.3.2 s csv module seems to be a lot faster than cpython 2.7.5 s and pypy 2.1 2.7.2 seems to be faster than cpython 2.7.5 as well but then either one also might run your code faster too and so on


21271895
floating-point	integer
Pattern(s): 2	
the compiler always chooses floating-point over integer calculation if a floating-point value like a double is involved


21344489
uiview	subviews
Pattern(s): 7	
on that add a uiview as a subviews with a white background and arrange the size so that a uiview becomes a smaller rectangle inside your cell so a uiview gets this margin effect


21369252
decltype	auto
Pattern(s): 10	
decltype is significantly more versatile that auto and can always be used in place of decltype


21408336
hide	show
Pattern(s): 7	
it doesn t show at all if hide is called less than 0.5s after show and it show for at least 0.5s this prevents very fast flickering stuff that you might see with naive implementations


21449065
config	ini
Pattern(s): 10	
if you intend manual config it s probably better to choose something else for example ini


21471411
floating-point	integer
Pattern(s): 7	
note that your program may report some numbers as prime if some numbers largest prime factor is very close to some numbers square root if the number is the square of a prime because the conversion of number to a floating-point value may round it down so trsq may end up being less than the square root even less than the largest integer that is smaller than the square root


21496552
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
Pattern(s): 7	
it is probably best to use elastic beanstalk if you are already using elastic beanstalk as elastic beanstalk has better integration to ec2 and other amazon-web-services resources


21647126
lapack	openblas
Pattern(s): 0	
if you are on linux and have chosen blas and lapack from a repo it is very likely that you are on linux and have chosen blas and lapack from a repo are much slower than openblas


21651351
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 10	
you could use system.getproperties user.home which will return the current users home directory which is more likely to allow you to write to the folder


21699076
ati	nvidia
Pattern(s): 10	
there is almost always some driver issue between the only vendors which are still up to date but in general nvidia is better for opengl has bugs in directx implementation and ati amd versions only is better for directx has bugs in opengl implementation


21703040
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 7	
if kernel versioning is less than 2.6 then we recommend to upgrade kernel versioning


21813363
quicksort	heapsort
Pattern(s): 10	
dr don t just repeat the old quicksort beats heapsort it s more complicated


21832859
hash	md5
Pattern(s): 10	10	
the hash idea should work minor note that sha-256 wouldn t present collisions md5 is no longer secure but sha-256 wouldn t present collisions md5 is no longer secure depends on the trade-off if the service involves something really really critical a client-side ssl certificate would be the best way to proceed


21846086
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	
scaling the captured image to fit the uiimageview s height scale by 0.25 means the captured image will be of size 160x284 - its width is smaller the the uiimageview s width


21847850
factors	mean
Pattern(s): 7	
if the factors is smaller than the golden mean 1.6 and the previous allocations are contiguous with each other each other ll eventually add up to a chunk that can satisfy a later requirement


21863094
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 7	
if you want to add a plugin and a plugin versioning is higher than the core mvvmcross versioning use nuget to upgrade all mvvmcross packages before adding the plugin


21893635
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 7	
the solution is to manually include a bower.json thus grunt-bower-install in your html or upgrade to the newer versioning that uses bower properly


21918245
disk	ram
Pattern(s): 10	
obviously reading a block from cache is much more efficient than reading a block off the disk since ram is much faster than disk


22010602
dbcontext	objectcontext
Pattern(s): 10	
there are many reasons why the dbcontext api is better than the older objectcontext api but in your case the dbcontext api may initially feel like a downgrade


22118761
width	height
Pattern(s): 10	
the image s width is no longer the double of the image s width height


22133355
gif	png
Pattern(s): 10	
depending on your animation content you can optimize your gif so this png works s more web device friendly when loading


22164607
qhash	qmap
Pattern(s): 10	
also with the method of using qpair from the other answer this has the particular advantage that you can access elements by rows easily if it matters for your use case you could use different container for different dimensions like if you need one dimension to be sorted use qmap which is sorted by key for that and qhash which is more efficient for the dimension which doesn t need sorting


22191516
integer	unsigned
Pattern(s): 7	
php does not support unsigned integers and php likely that you have a signed 32bit integer which is -1 for all bits set


22202376
equals	compareto
Pattern(s): 0	
in general the javadoc for compareto contract must return a positive zero or negative number if this.property is greater than equals to or less than c.property respectively


22235828
dropbox	icloud
Pattern(s): 8	
instead of dropbox i could use key value store as rest web service which i want to do later but have no time for this for now in my opinion my solution is more reliable than icloud and which is very important i have full control on how my solution s working mainly because my solution s my own code


22244099
ostringstream	std
Pattern(s): 7	
by returning a std basic_stringbuf it s easy to see that std ostringstream uses a stringbuf internally and std ostringstream also provides easier access to the str functions of std basic_stringbuf functions which doesn t exist in std basic_streambuf


22277079
ssl	spdy
Pattern(s): 3	
well if you re willing to buy an ssl certificate or already have one i would recommend using spdy an ssl certificate s available in the nginx-extras package to enable an ssl certificate you just add an ssl certificate to the listen line


22479810
wordpress	joomla
Pattern(s): 0	
i think it would be possible to have a site that is much faster than a wordpress site by using phalcon but i think the tradeoff is no wordpress plugins will work and the more php you use to make i have a custom cms to maintain which i am not sure how to replace with wordpress or joomla etc work the more you erode the benefit of phalcon and you might have well just used wordpress


22490492
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	
if this value is greater than the width height of the above calculation then you need to use this value


22669198
ostringstream	std
Pattern(s): 7	7	
std ostringstream has certainly better properties regarding memory safety as snprintf has better properties over sprintf .


22819227
fgets	atoi
Pattern(s): 7	
so here fgets is reading more than one integer at a time from file so atoi is not getting the int too


22882680
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	0	
i.e max-width kicks in when image width is greater than height and browser height will be calculated proportionally


22888581
quicksort	heapsort
Pattern(s): 0	
in the event that the quicksort starts to degenerate the quicksort uses heapsort which is o n log n worst-case but slightly slower than quicksort on average to guarantee o n log n worst-case runtimes


22942136
hide	show
Pattern(s): 10	
if your hide show logic becomes more complicated you can move your hide show logic into a method on your controller


23026821
spaces	linefeed
Pattern(s): 0	
s will match more than just spaces because this also matches vertical whitespaces like linefeed carriage returns.


23075199
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 10	
it looks like while google-chrome and safari are trying to do the right thing with 0px firefox is sticking closer to the standard

Pattern(s): 7	0	0	7	7	0	
if width is greater than height width is greater than height is landscape


23328020
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	0	
if the height is bigger than the width the height is portrait


23343876
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	0	
when the medium width becomes larger than its height then its would be the default landscape size


23359554
ienumerable	iqueryable
Pattern(s): 7	
so if you working with only in-memory data collection ienumerable is a good choice but if you want to query data collection which is connected with database iqueryable is a better choice as you want to query data collection which is connected with database iqueryable reduces network traffic and uses the power of sql language


23379074
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 10	
therefore the condition of the for-loop is no longer valid and the condition of the for-loop exits loops


23395245
addition	modulo
Pattern(s): 7	
the modulo has a higher operator precedence than the addition operator therefore the case will happen before the addition


23457672
min	max
Pattern(s): 0	
note that if you expect more than one max min then cv minmaxloc is not sufficient since cv minmaxloc returns only a single point


23556803
int	chars
Pattern(s): 7	
and when cout you must explicitly convert to other types like int in order to print it correctly because cout will work weird when printing unsigned chars when unsigned chars value is larger than 127


23688832
flatmap	fold
Pattern(s): 0	
you could also do flatmap explicitly with a fold though i find flatmap less clear than the flatmap approach


23815467

it doesn t matter if second member would be int short or whatever - as long as second member is smaller than double sizeof struct will be 16


23970551
poltergeist	capybara-webkit
Pattern(s): 0	
the poltergeist phantomjs driver s faster than selenium gives better errors than capybara-webkit and is easy to set up bonus you can do things in your tests that need javascript and you ll be smoke-testing your entire stack including javascript


24021418
swift	objective-c
Pattern(s): 0	
swift will incur this penalty in fewer situations than objective-c will for instance method calls to swift-only protocol methods do not hit objc_msgsend but if the protocol is declared in objective-c or if the swift protocol is decorated with objective-c such that the swift protocol can be adopted by objective-c objects as well then method calls to methods in that protocol adopted by swift objects appear to be dispatched via objc_msgsend


24055780
mdpi	hdpi
Pattern(s): 0	
and you know your image at hdpi folder so 4.0 - xxxhdpi 1.5 larger than the mdpi


24078665
swift	objective-c
Pattern(s): 10	10	
and also apple does might not confidently announce that swift is more faster than objective-c in all the cases


24101612
udp	tcp	udp	rtp
Pattern(s): 8	
tcp streaming for audio can be less helpful than udp rtp as you d have to turn off nagling


24173092
quicksort	mergesort

also note that quicksort is generally more optimal than mergesort see this as well which explains why this s taken advantage of when sorting primitives


24198365
macports	homebrew
Pattern(s): 7	
currently macports has many more packages 18.6 k than there are homebrew formulae 3.1k owing to 3.1k maturity


24226189
integer	unsigned
Pattern(s): 7	
if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater than or equal to the rank of the type of the other operand the operand with signed integer type is converted to the type of the operand with unsigned integer type


24264078
rpm	yum
Pattern(s): 0	
i strongly suggest either of the first two options over the latter option as the latter option does not always play nicely with the way rpm and yum handle transactions when more than one rpm are involved


24314853
int	chars
Pattern(s): 7	0	
the source prvalue s stated in the standard that unsigned chars has less rank than int and with this the type of the switch condition will be int which further means


24354764
min	max
Pattern(s): 0	0	
if not we test whether the entered value is less than the min value if it is then we set the value to the min value and if not implying that the value must be greater than the max we set the value to the max attribute


24408656
post	get
Pattern(s): 10	
the only way to hide the get url but the get url s not more secure at all because the get url s easily found out is to use a post request with a form containing a hidden field with the id can be made in javascript


24468043
subtraction	addition
Pattern(s): 0	
in fact has precedence even lower than addition and subtraction so x y+z comes out wrong--an expression means x y+z instead of the x y +z that you d want


24588036
rank	max
Pattern(s): 7	0	
if no rank is lower than no rank number there are no gaps in the table the query returns the max number + 1


24602957
inline	constexpr
Pattern(s): 0	
you may be interested in looking at the constexpr keyword which i think is better than the inline keyword when you can make use of the inline keyword


24655947
getter	setter
Pattern(s): 10	10	
if we put we filter in between these calls either in getter or setter setter is more efficient as it is called only when filters change we modify original filtered list with we filter and return our filter back through the getter


24672602
gif	png
Pattern(s): 10	
for example given gif may be deprecated in a system because png has proven better for the system s users - perhaps because the system s supports better colour depth preserving the colours more accurately or svg might be deprecated because some clients have been found to be using web browsers that won t display t jpeg might be deprecated because the system s s known the images in the system aren t natural photographic images and the format gives visually poor results despite larger compressed files slower processing speed and higher memory usage - lots of possible motivations for making things deprecated


24677242
domcontentloaded	onload
Pattern(s): 10	
remove the onload from your body element using domcontentloaded event instead the onload is less intrusive


24707870
set	bag
Pattern(s): 10	
if your elements are drawn from a small finite set can only be compared for equality then your bag gets much more expensive and i m pretty sure you end up with something like o nk instead


24880258
udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 7	0	
one can say udp has a lower overhead than tcp because udp packets have a smaller header and therefore take less bandwidth to send the payload the data


24960879
addition	multiplication
Pattern(s): 7	0	
the multiplication are the bottleneck of the calculation even though the multiplication may be one instruction a multiplication takes longer than an addition


24967242

since an int is 32 bits wide four times bigger than a chars when the pointer is being decremented the pointer is printing out every fourth chars in the reverse of the string


25000107
content-length	content-type
Pattern(s): 7	
...web api relies on system.net.http library for getting request headers and system.net.http library gives a null for httprequestmessage s content.headers.contenttype in this case and web api sees that content-length is greater than 0 but no content-type header and hence returns a 415 unsupported media type


25113969
memmove	strncpy
Pattern(s): 10	
you can use strncpy instead of memmove but strncpy instead of memmove has a more complex loop condition than memmove strncpy instead of memmove has to check for a null byte as well as the count whereas memmove only has to check the count


25234859
tablet	hdpi	tablet	galaxy
Pattern(s): 7	
in your case whats happening is that your galaxy tablet has a lower pixel density and android down-scales the image from a xxhdpi to whatever density the tablet has hdpi or xhdpi ....so the tablet your image is a 512px image android would down-scale it to 341px for xhdpi or 256px for an hdpi device


25234889
int	double
Pattern(s): 0	
types bigger than double and int are 64-bits


25251777
many-to-one	one-to-many
Pattern(s): 10	
inverse is for bidirectional associations and most often the child s on the same side with cascade but that s because the many-to-one side is much more efficient to control the association than the one-to-many one


25334563
mouseover	mouseout
Pattern(s): 7	
a bar s similar to the solution proposed by ckersch except that a bar has more overhead you re changing the dom every mouseover mouseout but is easier to implement and doesn t change the structure of your svg at all


25338534
children	parent
Pattern(s): 7	
if the parent however is not larger then the parent children you won t notice any difference between those alignments


25338534
children	parent
Pattern(s): 7	0	
again if the parent view is not larger than the parent view children the expansion suffix does not make any difference as well


25340797
implements	extends
Pattern(s): 7	
this is kind-of the functionality you for instance see but you instantly already see that there it s called at an instance and the fact it requires to extends rather then implements pdostatement has more to do with the c-level implementation functionality of that class


25435704
hash	salt
Pattern(s): 7	
the correct hash has a sha-512 salt so a sha-512 salt output is longer than 13 characters

use stl structures in c++ vector map pair usually make your life easier and you have less problems with memory allocator


25587789
udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 0	
if your client connections are more or less permanent and not too many clients are connected at the same time tcp is only slightly worse than udp


25599703

macports	homebrew
Pattern(s): 0	
recent packages does not work on install newer emacs by homebrew or macports


25872121
flask	django
Pattern(s): 10	
now you can get all those same features with flask if you re prepared to do some integration work but the argument can just as easily be made that django is better for beginners precisely because the argument does come with all those things built-in


25878057
width	height
Pattern(s): 10	10	
for this you can create a new transparent png or white 200 200 jpg and place the newly generated image apprioriately i.e if height is less place it vertically centered or if the width is less place it horizontally centered and save that file


25938890
bower	npm
Pattern(s): 10	
even if you can handle front-end dependencies with npm it s better to use bower since it s optimized for this purpose no deep dependencies among other things


25959726
awt	swing
Pattern(s): 7	
in general avoid awt for swing which has much greater power and flexibility although it too is showing its age just less so than awt


26002033
swift	objective-c
Pattern(s): 0	
in objective-c something similar can be done with nsarray s various predicate-based and enumeration methods but they ll be a little more long-winded than they swift counterpart

when the data is on disk titan is faster than disk neo4j cause disk titan has a better disk representation


26029566
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	
getting the width and height takes more work than it s worth especially trying to do it across all devices and a responsive framework gives you so many more options


26049758
hash	hmac
Pattern(s): 10	
the structure of the hmac algorithm makes it less susceptible to attacks on properties of the underlying hash algorithm


26263028
gson	jackson
Pattern(s): 0	
code looks correct and even at code worst jackson should be no slower than gson


26335476
gif	png
Pattern(s): 7	
you should use png instead of gif because png instead offers better compression and features


26399169
rss	feed
Pattern(s): 7	
for example if your screen is 600 pixels wide and if the rss feed string takes more than 600 pixels to display you will not be able to see the end of your rss feed


26400981
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 7	
this is happening because of speed of for-loop which is faster than your time .as loops iterates in time of less than miliseconds and generates values.you can only call values.you when you want to insert single value to database and don t iterate for values


26403076
unsigned	short
Pattern(s): 0	0	
if size_type is defined as unsigned short and int is wider than unsigned short the lhs of your addition will be converted to the rhs and you rely on your addition being performed in the lhs s type


26444752
min	max
Pattern(s): 0	
it works by returning your entry to what it was before - if you enter a key that results in the value being less than min or more that max


26519960
r-tree	quadtree
Pattern(s): 0	0	
i use quadtree more than r-tree and find quadtree more than r-tree super flexible


26663675
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	
but this technique has a disadvantage the default size of your image has to be bigger than the height width of the browser window or container this technique is in


26663944
virtualenv	conda
Pattern(s): 10	
if you are using anaconda conda is a better alternative to virtualenv as you are using anaconda conda manages conda packages which are not limited to just python packages


26916986
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 7	
say your first versioning of application had the databasehelper extending sqliteopenhelper with constructor passing versioning as 1 and then you provided an upgrade application with the new source code having versioning passed as 2 then automatically when the databasehelper is constructed platform triggers onupgrade by seeing the file already exists but versioning is lower than the current versioning which you have passed


26948540
vmware	virtualbox
Pattern(s): 0	
i really miss this feature on virtualbox because i find vmware to be bloated and vmware to be bloated slows the host system down much more than virtualbox does


27025683
bellman-ford	dijkstra
Pattern(s): 0	
your modified dijkstra can perform much better than bellman-ford if you have very few negative edges and or if those negative edges are separated from the rest of the graph by expensive paths

goose	boilerpipe
Pattern(s): 7	0	
goose allows more fields published date author main image in article and a few more than boilerpipe title content


27193974
udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 10	
tcp as you know udp is faster than tcp even if udp may miss some


27206810
swt	swing
Pattern(s): 10	10	
these two are completely different logically speaking and you should choose only one of t to go further with note that swt is more customizable and tries to combine the best from awt and swing while swing is more limited and uses the platform s native widgets


27258637
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	0	0	
...then using the animate on click event you could give the height a value and animation time the width a delay equal o bigger than the height animation time and then the width a delay equal o bigger than the height animation time s value...that should do the trick but the width a delay equal o bigger than the height animation time s more stiff than actually using the ui


27281214
uiview	subviews
Pattern(s): 7	
if you want to add several views and change the background color of you header consider adding uiview that fills header view thanks to autolayout constraints and then all the subviews you would like to have to header view i am calling it customcontentview


27327422
textview	imageview
Pattern(s): 7	0	
this should work as long as the imageview is larger than the textview in all dimensions


27351057
width	margin
Pattern(s): 10	
the second div input-btn-col is covering the div with the select element select-col because it has 100 width and is floating left and it nested div has a margin on the left


27412208
free	realloc
Pattern(s): 0	
if memory is plentiful then you can skip the realloc -- the output buffer will occupy more memory than the realloc needs to do but the realloc will be recovered when the output buffer is free


27416478
affinity	processors
Pattern(s): 0	
so the difference between the two is that if you assign affinity at the thread level you can assign the two to more than one processors and spread the load more than with all threads assigned to one processors


27442513
viewdidload	viewdidappear
Pattern(s): 10	
also don t present modal vc from self at viewdidload at the time of this method execution the vc is often not yet presented the vc viewdidappear is more fitting for such tests


27514972
lodash	underscore.js
Pattern(s): 7	
this is apparently no accident if these are left out of underscore.js lodash composability is better than features


27585861
int	chars
Pattern(s): 0	
your limit is in fact less than that since even if the int are unsigned most tokens in practice would be larger than one chars and many tokens require whitespace separation between many tokens


27591278
children	parent
Pattern(s): 0	
where the parent can have one or more children many but the child can exist without a parent but the parent can never have more than one parent zero or one

furthermore swift is stricter than objective-c when furthermore swift comes to initialisers


27788311
daemons	systemd
Pattern(s): 0	
if you want the systemd to still be responsive just configure slurm to let the systemd believe the systemd has 1 core and 2gb of ram less than the systemd actually has to leave some room for the os and the slurm daemons


27835223
swift	objective-c
Pattern(s): 0	
the swift designers went through a lot of trouble to make sure that it s more than just objective-c without the constraints of c in fact i almost wish the swift designers hadn t said that since it s so often misquoted


27877127
int	chars
Pattern(s): 0	
in our case then our have decltype chars + chars is int because chars s conversion rank less than int so both are promoted to int before the call to operator+


28030333
sse	avx
Pattern(s): 0	
ironically ancient x86 instruction rep stosq performs much better than sse and avx in terms of memory copy


28129987
quicksort	timsort
Pattern(s): 0	
introsort and timsort have both an o nlogn complexity in average and on worst cases which makes introsort and timsort better than quicksort in the particular cases where quicksort is in o n 2


28138669
namenode	hdfs
Pattern(s): 10	
since the namenode is a single-point-of-failure in hdfs the namenode requires a more reliable hardware setup


28143079
public	protected
Pattern(s): 10	
also using private and protected instead of public is more about good programming design than security and i recommend you read about it as well as polymorphism and inheritance


28173741
filtering	grouping
Pattern(s): 7	
filtering on the grouping data is more processing-intensive because the grouping must be completed first


28180356
integer	unsigned
Pattern(s): 7	
otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater than or equal to the rank of the type of the other operand the operand with signed integer type shall be converted to the type of the operand with unsigned integer type


28295873
onclicklistener	onitemclicklistener
Pattern(s): 7	0	
if you still would love to manage onclicklistener i will tell why onitemclicklistener is much better than onclicklistener


28308615
int	double
Pattern(s): 0	
int arguments narrower than int are promoted to int or to unsigned int if the type is unsigned and the type maximum value exceeds int_max and arguments of type float are promoted to double


28341408
width	height	portrait	landscape
Pattern(s): 7	0	
one page is a page of which the width is smaller than the height sounds like this file s a page in portrait but as there s a rotate value of 90 added to the page dictionary it is shown in landscape


28468588
children	parent
Pattern(s): 0	
by the properties of the binary search tree you already know that all children have to be larger than the parent 15 therefore using one of all children instead of the 25 is valid


28586598
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	
if you want the contentview to scroll the width and height must be larger than the width and height of the scrollview itself


28635080
min	max
Pattern(s): 0	0	
one of algorithms that will never predict a value greater than the max or less than the min is the k-nearest neighbor for example


28755045
jscrollpane	jviewport
Pattern(s): 7	
now before you run screaming from the room swing provides the scrollable interface to allow you to provide more information to the jscrollpane and jviewport including the preferred view port size which allows the jscrollpane to be smaller than the preferred size of the view been displayed when the jscrollpane s been laid out and which is what you re interested in how the view should be sized when the jscrollpane is smaller than the view area


28963454
coalesce	isnull
Pattern(s): 2	
however i prefer isnull over coalesce since the latter has an issue if it contains a sub-query


29049334
swift	objective-c
Pattern(s): 0	
swift also prevents our i believe from overriding a parent class s property but also still lets us observe changes to a parent class s property--this is much better than objective-c s approach


29103996
interpolation	splines
Pattern(s): 10	
with a lower order splines that works better but then you lose the advantage of cubic interpolation


29105801
jasmine	sinon
Pattern(s): 10	
you could do thies with jasmine spies but i suggest using sinon becuase sinon becuase supports more functionality


29137974
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 7	
this will restart the site and when the site runs for the first time after that the site will see that the dll versioning is higher than the one in the config files and the db and will kick off the upgrade procedure


29138373
integer	unsigned
Pattern(s): 0	
it might even be bigger than any integer type but if there is some integer type which is the right size and you that integer type will be typedef d to intptr_t and intptr_t unsigned version probably more useful will be uintptr_t


29218730
quicksort	mergesort
Pattern(s): 7	
quicksort has better locality of reference than mergesort which means that the accesses performed in quicksort are usually faster than the corresponding accesses in mergesort


29352184
bindparam	bindvalue
Pattern(s): 2	
i prefer work with bindvalue and not mix work with bindvalue with bindparam


29445974
swift	objective-c
Pattern(s): 0	
still technically yes the library we re appears that an all swift solution is roughly 2x slower than a swift + cocoa solution which should be roughly the same than objective-c + cocoa when compiled with equivalent options iirc


29462704
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	0	
if the width is less than the height then the width will scale the height by the ratio of height to width and leave the width at 4 units -2 to +2


29512737
rsa	aes
Pattern(s): 10	
you could for example generate a random aes key encrypt it using rsa and store it in the output file and then encrypt the file itself with aes which is much faster and doesn t have any problem with large inputs


29523624
16-bit	64bit
Pattern(s): 0	
if the ints are 16 bit only one stack push of 32 bits is needed which is less than a pointer on 64bit architectures but on the ints are often more than 16-bit


29610760
thin	unicorn
Pattern(s): 2	
i often use example in development to choose between unicorn and thin for my rails server


29643115
many-to-many	one-to-many
Pattern(s): 7	
using two one-to-many associations is always better than relying on many-to-many relations


29653715
filtering	grouping
Pattern(s): 8	
please note this approach is much less efficient than grouping and filtering in a dataset query if this approach is based on a database


29687757
int	double
Pattern(s): 0	0	
double doesn t have infinite precision and you can t gain more precision than a double has by converting a double to a bigdecimal like you can t gain more precision with an int when you do which is 0.0 because t widens an int to a double


29744470
int	chars
Pattern(s): 7	
the query returns a because sql server returns whenever an int is converted to var chars and an int length is smaller than specified


29745072
qlist	qvector
Pattern(s): 0	
which brings me to the point - if transaction ids are per savings account transaction ids are per savings account would be sequential in other words you will be better off with the qlist or even better a qvector because it will be a little more efficient since you will only be appending transactions


29767316
min	max
Pattern(s): 0	0	
and if it s lower than min set it to min and if it s higher than max set it to max


29777856
children	parent
Pattern(s): 7	
assuming that the parent has a smaller id than any of the parent children and that the default value of the parent column is null could you order its children this way


29893268
ubuntu	debian
Pattern(s): 7	
recompiling ubuntu kernels is harder -- recompiling ubuntu kernels will require working with debian build tools


29899349
int	boolean
Pattern(s): 7	
since your patterns are just 0 and 1 values you can think of your patterns as numeric values long is a 64bit int which is more than enough which can be converted later to a boolean matrix


29905673
memset	calloc	memset	malloc
Pattern(s): 0	
you would be better served by using calloc rather than malloc followed by memset .. 0 ...


29980399
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	
when getting a color at a position make sure the position 1000 413 is less than the width or height of the image not less than or equal


30088465
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 0	
you want to make sure the code will work when users upgrade more than 1 versioning and that the update statement only runs the one upgrade the code is needed


30134675
width	height
Pattern(s): 10	
so think about the video source file if you can deliver the video source file with a width height that is more suitable for smartphones maybe different files for different display sizes


30139000
int	chars
Pattern(s): 3	
remember that string chars are just int numbers and you can compare string chars or perform a math operations like on usual numbers


30176723
bellman-ford	dijkstra
Pattern(s): 10	
in fact i think it is fair to say that bellman-ford is more similar to dijkstra because of bellman-ford use of iterative relaxation


30279779
division	multiplication
Pattern(s): 0	0	
this will be good idea to put factorial as additional case into primary as parentheses have higher order of precedence called earlier than multiplication division etc in term


30315018
stdout	stderr
Pattern(s): 7	
this also allows you to redirect the stderr into the stdout which makes it easier to read


30324629
min	max
Pattern(s): 0	0	
write a for loop that loops through your array taking the integer value of each item and if it s less than min save it to min and if it s greater than max save it to max


30503351
post	get
Pattern(s): 7	
neither post or get is securer than the other in that way and so if you need security you should use https


30661397
children	parent
Pattern(s): 8	
more ol elements as children of parent ol elements should be within your li items


30673682
children	parent
Pattern(s): 10	
the reduction presented above assumes that the memory used by a parent can be reused by the children when a parent is no longer needed


30706316
osx	yosemite
Pattern(s): 0	
this s true that the yosemite compatibility exists but i ve found that earlier mac machines does not have the propper hardware and you experience some lacks in memory and graphics when upgrading more than one osx


30717974
int	chars
Pattern(s): 7	0	
a chars is smaller than an int so you can return a chars and a chars will prepend zeroes to make a longer number


30762258
swift	objective-c
Pattern(s): 10	0	
swift won t allow you to do absolutely everything that objective-c does but apps that have been already written will allow you to do almost everything and the code will be probably more robust considering that swift is more modern language with stronger typing than objective-c


30765702
arc4random	srand
Pattern(s): 0	
first srand seeds the rand function which is a different pseudo-random number generator with somewhat worse properties than arc4random


30912313
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	0	
the user applies to window objects but also to scrollable frames and elements with the overflow css property set to scroll or auto when the element s explicit height or width is less than the height or width of the user contents


31016042
int	chars
Pattern(s): 7	0	
as chars has a lower rank than int type promotion is promoted to int zero- or sign-extended


31067603
box-sizing	border-box
Pattern(s): 7	
i always have also the box-sizing works with border-box so forgot also the box-sizing works haha and maybe also the box-sizing works a better solution


31090522
setinterval	settimeout
Pattern(s): 10	
btw when you use settimeout or setinterval it is better to pass the timer an actual function instead of a string with the source code for a function


31090647
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	
if the image that s inside has a width that s smaller than the image that s inside height add class portrait


31121609
int	double
Pattern(s): 3	
i would recommend using int type keys long long for the map in first place and trim int type keys for double representation using a fixed precision for division


31123831
passenger	webrick
Pattern(s): 10	
also i use standalone passenger as my integration test server rather than webrick since standalone passenger handles more realistic serving of static files


31165933
min	max
Pattern(s): 0	7	0	
this seems a good use of geom_pointrange but this will make no sense for your example because your avg is higher than your max and on 6 7 your min is higher than your max


31220135
daemons	systemd
Pattern(s): 7	
as a new newbie programmer i find that making daemons over systemd is much easier than over init.d


31321946
addition	multiplication
Pattern(s): 7	0	
since parentheses were used around the addition but not the multiplication we can infer that probably in the addition has lower precedence than multiplication


31355050
inline-functions	inlining
Pattern(s): 0	
using options such as -os for the compiler to tell the compiler to make the code small in other words don t inline-functions unless the code is shorter by inlining than by calling the function and don t unroll loops etc etc - but do inline-functions called only once as that does make the code shorter


31377553
submit	submission
Pattern(s): 7	
if you use jquery s submit method instead you use jquery s submit method does trigger handlers before submission the form.


31476759
sse	avx
Pattern(s): 7	
i know this does not answer your core question why avx is slower but since your ultimate goal is fast popcount the avx - sse comparison is irrelevant as both are inferior to the builtin popcount


31589303
odoo	openerp
Pattern(s): 7	0	
its just a name they choosed its because odoo provides more than openerp for example web site modules


31654207
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	0	
this code is not perfect though because this code doesn t support when height is bigger than width easy to fix though


31666977
subtraction	modulo
Pattern(s): 0	7	0	
with regard to implementation itself also takes advantage of a bit of a non-obvious property of r precedence rules actually this is true of other languages as well such as c c++ and java namely that unary negative is higher than modulo which is higher than binary subtraction thus the calculation for is equivalent to


31707816
hide	show
Pattern(s): 0	
if you re simply looking to hide the value from your cross table you shouldn you re simply looking to hide the value from your cross table you shouldn need anything more than the show hide items menu


31729963
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 10	
if i m not mistaken when capistrano makes the current folder the current folder is actually a shortcut for lack of a better term to the most recent release perhaps symlinked directory is better


31756328
int	double
Pattern(s): 7	0	
there is also the wrinkle that typically a double consists of more bits than an int does - so by printing in this way your code is interpreting random memory to the right of x as data


31867592
children	parent
Pattern(s): 7	0	
you are not presenting one here seem to be trees in which each parent is strictly greater than each parent children


31891715
udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 7	
if the data is critical you should go for tcp which is slower as compared to udp which in fact doesn t guarantee the packets will arrive in order or even if the packets d arrive or not


31914574
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	7	
if image height is more than 1080 resize image width is more than 1920 with 1080 height and maintaining width with original aspect ratio


31996234
superclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 0	
with explicit superclass calling your subclassing can accept more or fewer arguments than the subclassing didn t superclass and can decide the subclassing didn t what to pass when calling its superclass


32032054
free	malloc
Pattern(s): 10	
once the pointed-to next node is free any malloc is no longer valid


32032784
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	
for images with height larger than width whose width s the following line that causes error


32090081
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 0	
therefore the parfor loops simply must be slower than the for-loop because it has to transmit data to the workers for the workers to operate on


32091759
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	
uiviewcontentmodecenter keeps the proportions of the imageview so when you display uiviewcontentmodecenter can show a padding because the image has more height than width or viceversa


32147921
factories	presenter
Pattern(s): 10	
a presenter is better to accept some kind of a view factories or a supplier in general as we can already hold an existing view especially in a gwt case and let a presenter decide when instantiate or accept the view


32190188
swift	objective-c
Pattern(s): 0	
writing swift 2.0 in my professional work my personal opinion is that beta s indeed ready for enterprise applications -- maybe even more than objective-c ever were


32190714
lodash	underscore.js
Pattern(s): 10	
based on why lodash is faster than native foreach post maybe its s justifiable to use lodash in favour of both underscore.js and native foreach to loop


32286351
g++	gcc
Pattern(s): 10	
a more up-to-date g++ gets a more up-to-date g++ right compiling with with usr libexec gcc i686-redhat-linux 4.8.3 cc1plus via g++ -c tst.cpp we get


32596207
cpu	processors
Pattern(s): 10	10	
whenever a processors cpu runs a program a processors cpu stores the line number of the code a processors cpu is executing more formally address pointing to that instruction .the computer stores a processors cpu in a register kind of variable called as stack pointer


32629961
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 10	
and if somebody is running a 6-month old versioning with a known bug upgrade becomes a more acceptable answer if somebody is running a 6-month old versioning with a known bug upgrade are 12 versioning behind


32646938
hex	binary
Pattern(s): 0	
format_int in binary case it loops 4 times then 4 times more than hex and dec cases


32748145
min	max
Pattern(s): 7	
i suspect that a max heap is used instead of a min heap is that a max heap is used instead of a min heap is easier to implement with the less operation


32750659
screens	tablet
Pattern(s): 7	
if you want to force all the views to have the same ration on screens the only way is to give it a size dynamically after you calculated the ratio between the desired pixels and the screens density which is not really a solution what you need to understand is when working with various screens sizes each one suppose to behave differently a tablet screens is expected to be bigger and thus having more room for elements to show up on screens a phone screens is smaller and less elements should be showed on screens you need to adjust your view to support all of a phone screens and the proper way is to write a different layout for tablet and phones or even different layout by screens dpi


32838740
pickle	dill
Pattern(s): 10	
you use pickle might fail dill is more stable


32838740
pickle	dill
Pattern(s): 0	
cloudpickle might be a good idea for your problem as well cloudpickle has better support in pickling objects than pickle not per see better than dill and you can pickle code easily as well


32919551
calloc	malloc	memset	malloc	memset	calloc
Pattern(s): 0	
this means calloc can potentially be faster than calling malloc followed by memset since it can skip the memset if it knows it will already by zeroed


32987720
innodb	myisam
Pattern(s): 0	
there are other optimizations available but general rule is that innodb will be quicker than myisam is even with table growth


33046435
int	chars
Pattern(s): 7	0	
int has wider range than chars and you should check if your int value is in chars range before converting back


33157435
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	
a uibutton has instrinsic height and width constraints are of lower priority than explicit height and width constraints that you provide but if you don t provide any then the intrinsic constraints take effect


33478984
addition	multiplication
Pattern(s): 10	
if you insist on having many nbs you should merge having many nbs through multiplication or addition of logarithms which is the same from mathematical perspective but multiplication is less stable in the numerical sense


33510358
unsigned	short
Pattern(s): 10	
if the mathematical result of the addition is outside the range of float which is unlikely or if the mathematical result of the addition s outside the range of unsigned short which is much more likely then the program will have undefined behavior


33571955
min	max
Pattern(s): 7	
if min and max are integers and min and max difference is less than rand_max then a very easy method is


33673358
ant	maven
Pattern(s): 7	
since ant is more of a scripting tool and doesn t impose structure or lifecycle like maven and gradlew you simply manually invoke ant when you want to use it


33678546
scheme	racket
Pattern(s): 10	
all of racket s languages can interoperate so your language of choice is up to you though the rnrs languages tend to go unused in the racket community #lang racket is much more useful for writing programs than any of the scheme implementations but programs can be useful if you want to write programs that run on different scheme implementations


33724911
multiplication	exponent
Pattern(s): 7	
if the exponent is a known small integer the exponent is usually better to write the multiplication explicitly


33839606
client-side	server-side
Pattern(s): 7	
client-side offers a better user experience and slightly less server load but client-side s at the expense of all of the security concerns that server-side validation addresses


33846308
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	
if you make it transparent or less than full width height then it will appear on top of the content behind it


33896482
kivy	vispy
Pattern(s): 8	
i didn t try this because i m more familiar with kivy s internals and because my end goal was more of a kivy app containing vispy visualisations rather than the other way around


33934128
cobertura	jacoco
Pattern(s): 2	
so you would have to configure your big build to generate a coverage report with the engine you want to use i would recommend jacoco as jacoco is supported out of the box by the sonar java plugin if you want to use another engine clover cobertura etc.. you would have to install a dedicated plugin


33943872
quicksort	heapsort
Pattern(s): 7	
however heapsort is somewhat slower in practice on most machines than a well-implemented quicksort


33943872
quicksort	heapsort
Pattern(s): 7	
the reason heapsort is slower in practice than quicksort is due to the better locality of reference in quicksort where data elements are within relatively close storage locations


34022510
gson	jackson
Pattern(s): 0	
try and change the gson package to one of the better ones out there jackson for example it might solve your problem


34030414
for-loop	arrays
Pattern(s): 10	
in method mergeduplicates implementation foreach executes a closure over every element in the arrays this is typically more straightforward and transparent alternative to old-fashioned for-loop


34159328
qthread	qobject
Pattern(s): 0	0	
finally consider that you can have more than one qthread as well as more than one qobject running on a qthread


34187465
post	get
Pattern(s): 7	0	
i used get because is faster than post if you need is faster than post just to get a list of element for suggestions


34237672
quicksort	mergesort
Pattern(s): 0	
insertion sort for example has an average time-complexity of o n 2 worse than quicksort or mergesort but as an online algorithm it can efficiently sort a list of values as it are received as user input where most other algorithms can only efficiently operate on a complete list of values


34256764
puma	unicorn
Pattern(s): 0	0	
puma will tend to optimize puma by spawning more threads and puma performance should range from no worse than unicorn in the pure cpu case to being vastly better than unicorn in the case of an app that sleeps a lot


34291244
children	parent
Pattern(s): 7	0	0	
min heap in which parent node is always smaller than parent children


34405918
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 2	
if you want to work your way from the top down especially if the subclassing selection depends on the choices made when constructing the superclass then the superclass s probably much better to favor composition over inherited


34413067
free	memcpy
Pattern(s): 0	
you d be better off with memcpy which is probably close to what your compiler gives you for free if you just write your class the normal naive way with no std array and no pointer gymnastics


34516471
jtextfield	jlabel
Pattern(s): 7	0	
because copying text result from jtextfield is always easier than retyping jtextfield from jlabel note that jlabel is not focusable


34538885
gif	png
Pattern(s): 7	
but in that regard it is replaced by png which is generally smaller supports alpha transparency where gif pixels are either fully transparent or fully opaque and most importantly gif images are limited to 256 colors


34560228
hide	show
Pattern(s): 0	
this code does more than just show or hide fabs on scroll this code actually handles a pretty perfect action bar disappears on scrolling effect


34582595
fusedlocationproviderapi	locationmanager
Pattern(s): 10	
the fusedlocationproviderapi offers less battery drain than the old open source locationmanager api


34626803
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 0	
after you upgrade the application such that the versioning number in the app is higher than the versioning number in the database on disk the sqlitehelper code notices and calls the +onupgrade + method with the old and new versioning numbers


34636755
superclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 10	
more mathematically you can think of a class a set of all objects with some similar characteristic and then a subclassing of pets surrounds its superclass and has even more characteristics


34706438
division	addition	division	multiplication	division	modulo	division	subtraction	multiplication	modulo
Pattern(s): 8	
i don t know how division modulo both works but division modulo both s much more complex than addition subtraction or even multiplication


34769393
apache	nginx
Pattern(s): 0	
nginx s configuration files are really simple and nginx s much lighter-weight than apache


34812631
theano	keras
Pattern(s): 3	
i would recommend using theano binary lstm link or keras tutorial for this because their are fairly simple to understand and are well documented


34925635
division	multiplication
Pattern(s): 7	
division though is an iterative process in logic the implementations you see on educational sites verilog vhdl are simply doing the same thing we did with log division in grade school but like multiplication it is much simpler than grade school you pull down bits from the numerator in the long division until the number being checked against the denominator is equal to or larger basically the number can either go in only zero times or one times into the number under test unlike decimal where it can be between 0 to 9 times


34981236
unsigned	short
Pattern(s): 0	0	
so if you tell printf to expect an unsigned short for example then printf will actually expect either an int if int is wider than unsigned short or unsigned int if int and short are the same size


34997173
svg.js	snap.svg
Pattern(s): 7	
if you definitely need svg and want to only use existing elements you may want to look at snap.svg which is raphaels younger sister and shares a lot of the same codebase or another like svg.js


35022155
bluestacks	android-emulator
Pattern(s): 10	
this android-emulator works better than bluestacks


35128233
post	get
Pattern(s): 7	0	
using post data is more secure than get because with get the details would be in the query string portion of the url


35153130
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	
if you set the width and height of the element and set the offset to any size the same size for both left and right or top and bottom it will be centered because the element cannot get any larger than it width and height attributes


35183791
udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 0	
it s unlikely in the extreme that you ll be able to implement udp better than tcp does considering that tcp has been developed and optimized by top experts both in network communication and in the details of your platform

innodb	myisam
Pattern(s): 10	10	
most of the literature that says myisam is better faster whatever then innodb is old literature


35232309
post	put
Pattern(s): 10	
anyway http 405 is telling you that your backend does not support the put method and probably your backend s expecting a post method with the x-http-method-override put http header since post is more standard method in rest than put


35247753
int	chars
Pattern(s): 0	
as per you requirements your int will have no more than 6 chars 999999 and the encoding should be max 7 chars so a xor of 24 bits will do a xor of 24 bits


35290262
imageview	fresco
Pattern(s): 8	
the fresco docs explain how to use drawees and you can see right from the fresco docs xml definition that the fresco docs are much more customizable than imageview


35443030
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	0	
we get this because we height has more distance than we width so we need to do 3 5 a 16 3 16 a 5 3 16 5 a so a 9.6


35448417
free	malloc
Pattern(s): 0	
1 okay so it is technically possible to allocate it as one big blob and then wire up the 20-element array to point into the desired offsets into the blob this convolutes free ing though and usually isn t necessary for most use-cases the performance gains would be negligible and you d still need to malloc a separate array of pointers that address into the 2d blob  you typically only see 2d-blob allocation when data is massively 2d such as image data and access syntax is eschewed in favor of syntax because it s no less efficient than what the compiler would do and doesn t require more than one malloc free pair per blob of data


35459067
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 7	
btw microsoft azure storage explorer in my case showed only some subset of folder which is much worse than displaying duplicated directory so i switched to azure explorer mentioned above and it s worth recommending


35512566

Pattern(s): 7	
vh for portrait orientation since in portrait the viewport height is higher than the viewport height width


35580321
google-chrome	safari
Pattern(s): 0	
it takes longer than google-chrome or safari to load but it does load successfully


35612869
google-chrome	firefox

35628095
union	distinct
Pattern(s): 7	0	
so union is much better than union all with distinct in performance-wise


35700939
swift	objective-c
Pattern(s): 8	
in case the method s helpful since you seem perhaps more familiar with objective-c than swift here s what your swift method would look like if we translated the method back into objective-c


35799291

36529800
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	7	
alternately you could make use of background-size contain it would preserve the aspect ratio but it will leave white space on the left and right if the width is larger or on the top and bottom if the height is larger


36532370
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 0	
salu is used for-loop counter so when you nest they more salu pressure is done and becomes a bottleneck when there are more than 9-10 loops nested maybe some intelligent algorithm using same counter for all loops should do the trick so not doing only salu in loops body but adding some valu instructions is a plus


36561846
nfa	dfa
Pattern(s): 0	8	
the net effect is that the backtracking implementations i like that name better than traditional nfa are slightly more expressive than dfa implementations because traditional nfa can match regexes like which matches three or more word characters repeated twice something that can t be matched by a dfa


36564887
int	chars
Pattern(s): 0	
when you do an arithmetic operation like addition with a value of a type that is smaller than int like chars in your case then that value will be promoted to int and an arithmetic operation is done using two int values


36651979
distance	pdist

as already pointed out in other answers memmove is more sophisticated than memcpy such that other answers memmove accounts for memory overlaps


36738152
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	
thus you can write a script that would look at the width property and act accordingly that being if the width is 32.8 then check the height and apply the logic for if the height is greater than desired see article here

36875756
hive	hdfs
Pattern(s): 7	7	
choice is not easy sometimes we use rule of thumb impala is good for queries without joins if all your data stored in hdfs hive spark has bigger latency but joins are reliable all your data stored in hdfs hive spark has bigger latency supports more data sources and has rich non-sql processing capabilities like mllib and graphx


36922589
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	0	
the javascript comes in only when width is more than the height and then what this does this sets the width of the child to be the height of the element


36943200
coalesce	nvl
Pattern(s): 10	
mureinik has shown you need to provide a default value to replace the nulls which you can do with the standard coalesce function or the nvl function do the same thing in this case but coalesce is more flexible

maybe worth checking out how a simd fork of pillow which claims to have much better performance than imagemagick or plain pillow compare


37343158
post	get
Pattern(s): 7	
the reason to use post for sending sensitive data is that sending sensitive data prevents data leakage via the query string although another way would be to use get with custom headers set although post makes much more sense


37350176
draggable	droppable
Pattern(s): 7	0	
the draggable is covering more than one droppable element and at this point there are multiple event.target.id s being covered

38034768
floating-point	integer
Pattern(s): 0	
it s even possible that you could implement pong using only integer arithmetic which is likely to be faster than floating-point -- but the difference is unlikely to be critical


38056234
swift	objective-c

des	aes	3des	aes
Pattern(s): 0	0	0	0	
edit 3des is better than des in the sense that it s significantly more secure but still less secure than aes but it performance is of necessity significantly worse than aes des or twofish because you re essentially applying des three times


38681676
google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 0	
if you want to take the performance benefit of storing data in the same place each time then pass the variable as argument to the function the performance loss of doing that seems to be within acceptable limits although firefox seems to deal better with firefox than google-chrome


39118792
children	parent
Pattern(s): 7	
also if you don t want the boxes to wrap when the page is too small for the boxes to fit on one line you will need to add white-space nowrap to the parent or make sure the width of the parent is wider than the two children


39183590
min	max
Pattern(s): 7	7	
if min is larger than zero then max is zero belongs to complete category max is naturally larger than zero then

39549983
spaces	delimiter
Pattern(s): 0	
the code makes some reasonable assumptions but the code may fail to detect an escaped field if the code doublequote is followed or preceded by more than 3 spaces before after field delimiter


39599860
pkcs#12	pfx

also settimeout is a better approach than setinterval as you explicitly reset settimeout on each round trip


39792708
children	parent
Pattern(s): 0	
this works because a parent thread will always have an id which is less than a parent thread children


40060306
charts	pie-chart
Pattern(s): 0	
if h is larger than your pie-chart radius you are placing your label outside the charts you should consider a constant r for that with a nice looking line

Pattern(s): 0	
urbg max returns the largest urbg result_type that operator could return strictly greater than min


40189110
unsigned	short
Pattern(s): 7	7	
the variable foo will get promoted to type int because type int can represent all values of type size_t and rank of size_t being a synonym for unsigned short is lower than the rank of int


40223668
post	put
Pattern(s): 7	
what about the question how many items to put on the screen you can give a solution like this for each post give fixed x height and if each post requires more space put read more link on the bottom of the post which will reveal missing part when user clicks


40264503
google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 10	
firefox is clearly less secured firefox deliberately allows something that google-chrome locks down

40329102
integer	unsigned
Pattern(s): 7	
otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater or equal to the rank of the type of the other operand then the operand with signed integer type is converted to the type of the operand with unsigned integer type


40338340
srp	ocp
Pattern(s): 7	
if your classes are internal then it s debatable whether it violates ocp or not but the violation of srp is even worse anyway


40488038
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	
it itself should have a limited width and height that is smaller than it s container


40558886
children	parent
Pattern(s): 10	
you could similarly make children the transient field if explicitly recording the parent relationship is more helpful


40652358
apk	dex
Pattern(s): 7	
so the solution for you would be to have static contents contents of apk like apk manifest file jar file dex file res folder etc ready in a folder create a copy as a temp folder modify resources contents and not names as per user needs then finally create zip of this temp folder and sign zip of this temp folder to have the desired .apk file no need for java complier then


40715077
google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 0	
google-chrome is extremely slow for your code path but grep seems to be 50 faster than array.filter here making google-chrome 900 slower than the firefox run


40734664
int	double
Pattern(s): 7	
and if the value of your double is higher than the range of an int then this can produce undefined behavior


40780913
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 2	
also i recommend you use hashmap instead of subclassing hashmap prefer composition over inherited


40852858
calloc	malloc
Pattern(s): 0	
as written malloc would be better than calloc but the question used calloc and it would not be hard to make it sensible for use with this code too for example a conditional assignment in set_matrix such as


41011604
subclass	superclass
Pattern(s): 10	
in other words if a subclass is more accessible than a subclass superclass then the access modifier of the superclass loses effect


41170490

mockito has been around a lot longer than scalamock and is much more actively maintained because of mockito s much larger contributor base


41360457
int	double
Pattern(s): 7	
with float x the conversion is commonly inexact on many platforms over the range of int as float has not more range than double and is commonly narrower


41422038
children	parent
Pattern(s): 0	0	
the reason we only traverse a tree from the parent to the children is because we are usually searching for a specific node and as long as the binary tree is implemented such that all left children are less than the parent and all right children are greater than the parent or vice-versa we only need links in one direction to find a specific node


41628869
hide	show
Pattern(s): 7	
which means if the time between show call and hide call is less than that minimum time then there wont be any dialog to be show to the user


41630254

for instance strncpy is mostly useless strncpy gives you nothing more than strcpy


41959925
google-chrome	safari
Pattern(s): 10

the console s worth pointing out that in general the foreach loops is more expensive memory-wise compared to the for-loop see here for details


42314024
gruntjs	browserify
Pattern(s): 7	
while gulp gruntjs is very popular for build automation which includes bundling all dependent javascript in file and minifying building and picking only the required files you need task runners like gulp gruntjs or bundlers like web pack in to one file webpack browserify is a better option as one file webpack browserify supports module import


42438617
free	malloc
Pattern(s): 0	
the c++-way here is more readable in my opinion and new and delete are safer than malloc and free


42497336
integer	unsigned
Pattern(s): 7

git-svn	svn2git
Pattern(s): 7	
even though git-svn is easier to start with here are some further reasons why using the kde svn2git instead of git-svn is superior besides git-svn flexibility


42940499
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 7	
your service instances could then check the db versioning and if the db versioning is higher than the db versioning own deployed versioning then back-off from that operation and wait for the upgrade


43054708
int	boolean
Pattern(s): 0	
to be able to express what you were trying to do another operator that takes two bool operands would have to be able to do more than just boolean because right now your has a bool and int around another operator that takes two bool operands


43398750
jasmine	sinon
Pattern(s): 7	
a cleaner approach should be mentioned that sinon provides many more features for smart stubs spies than jasmine so both can be used together


43419785
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	
then when the width or height of control is less than width or height of given size the suitable scrollbar will be shown


43421371

43554894
int	double
Pattern(s): 0	
note that when float values are passed to printf float values are automatically converted to double just as numeric types shorter than int are promoted to int

43932756
qt-creator	clion
Pattern(s): 7	
another alternative that people might mention is clion which is from jetbrains but its closed-source not well supported and whilst its might look nicer than qt-creator its has more or less the same features but is much more resource-heavy and laggy so i d pass on that


44030376
fold	catamorphism
Pattern(s): 7	
you can give clients a type-safe interface in the form of fold but they have to be willing to write all they code in a higher-order style and since fold is a catamorphism a catamorphism becomes harder to look at more than one layer at a time


44056062
int	chars
Pattern(s): 0	
when applying an arithmetic operator each of an arithmetic operator operands is first promoted to int if an arithmetic operator rank is less than int such as chars or short


44081504

min	max
Pattern(s): 8	
it is generally much more expensive than min and max because it needs to maintain internal lists of all values


44387092
min	max
Pattern(s): 0	
this will turn this into a format in the column with which you can then run less than and greater than min and max queries


44389736
janusgraph	titan
Pattern(s): 10	
titan is no longer maintained but has been forked by the janusgraph project which has a lot of active development on it


44542353
int	double
Pattern(s): 0	
the undefined behaviour as identified in other answers is explained on my intel platform with vc as that the f format specifier expects a double on the stack which is larger than an int so when the f format specifier retrieves the value the f format specifier retrieves more bytes than of an int and now assumes the next parameter at a diferent position on the stack causing z to be printed wrong it is not z that is printed


44688938
mp3	wav
Pattern(s): 0	
you should definitely pick mp3 because mp3 are about 10x smaller than wav files of the same duration


44744320
wav	opus
Pattern(s): 2	
now if you prefer wav over opus you could let the mediarecorder away and simply use the webaudioapi pass your gum stream to the mediarecorder and record the data from there


44829697
bison	jison
Pattern(s): 7	0	
indeed your jison grammar would be relatively easy to preprocess a bison grammar file but your jison grammar is easier with jison because you can compute the grammar programmatically and pass your jison grammar to jison as a json object


44885781
jobs	cron
Pattern(s): 7	
and the sem solution will prevent overlapping cron jobs if the cron interval is shorter than the job duration


44970454
memcpy	memmove
Pattern(s): 0	
std memmove may be very slightly slower than std memcpy emphasis added because std memmove has to first check whether the source and target ranges overlap


45020324
serializable	deserialization
Pattern(s): 7	
using the same code for serializable and deserialization is even more of a pain i cannot off hand figure out how


45256543
innodb	myisam
Pattern(s): 0	
in this area i think innodb s change buffer does a better job than myisam s do oracle now


45291116
width	border-box	box-sizing	border-box
Pattern(s): 7	
but the button is less than 15px wide so even with box-sizing border-box the button s width is pushed larger than your percentage


45328140
sorting	filtering
Pattern(s): 10	
edit on 01 29 2018 an article about the material data table has been written and can be seen here the material data table includes server pagination filtering and sorting and is probably more up-to-date than my code below since a lot of people are visiting this post i guess there was a real need for this hopefully this will help you all have fun


45348128
janusgraph	titan
Pattern(s): 2	
if you are just getting started and are just interested in learning about graph databases then i likely wouldn t recommend starting with titan janusgraph as titan janusgraph requires a bit of configuration to get started schemas backend selection etc


45463852
git-svn	svn2git
Pattern(s): 7	
even though git-svn is easier to start with here are some further reasons why using the kde svn2git instead of git-svn is superior besides git-svn flexibility


45522537
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 10	
you should upgrade your node versioning especially since versioning 4 is no longer actively maintained which means that only critical fixes are applied until only critical fixes reaches the end of life for details see lts schedule


45592457
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 7	
if your server versioning is older your server versioning is highly recommended to upgrade postgres anyway to use jsonb efficiently


45776027
int	chars
Pattern(s): 0	0	
basically every chars has always a smaller rank than int and a smaller rank than int can all be represented in an int and so the overload with unsigned chars is not a better match because unsigned chars would involve a conversion from chars to unsigned chars instead of a promotion


45795899
ostringstream	std
Pattern(s): 3	
edited since you chose the second approach i would recommend using std ostringstream than sprintf and using cclog instead of outputdebugstring because you just print std ostringstream out and independent os no need extra arguments


45854712
build.gradle	gradlew
Pattern(s): 0	
please note if you have more than 1 build.gradle files module library and module yourapp you need to add the following code in all gradlew files to make the following code work


45887220
x86	64bit
Pattern(s): 0	
no intel or amd x86 manuals ever guarantee atomicity of anything wider than 64bit except for lock cmpxchg16b so this talk of sse vector loads stores being atomic on some cpus isn t something that you can reliably take advantage of or detect when lock cmpxchg16b s supported


46043074
g++	gcc
Pattern(s): 2	
the -wall option asks for almost all warnings the -wextra ask for some more of i strongly recommend compiling with gcc -wall -wextra -g for c code or g++ -wall -wextra -g for c++ code also add other useful options such and the -g option is asking for debug information in dwarf format these days


46048891
interbase	firebird
Pattern(s): 10	8	
firebird was forked + - 18 years ago from interbase 6 which was opensourced for a short time since then it has diverged and firebird can no longer read interbase databases nor can interbase - as far as i am aware - read firebird databases more recent than firebird 1 or maybe 1.5


46073296
unsigned	short
Pattern(s): 7	
but in case short is a smaller type than int the unsigned short operand is always converted to signed int regardless of the unsigned short operand the short was signed or unsigned


46125270
rsa	dsa
Pattern(s): 0	
after this because there are more options than ssh-dss dsa the client openssh v7 should connect with rsa or better algorithm


46186489
range	minimum
Pattern(s): 7	0	
the unfortunate side effect is that half your circle will be cut off as your circle extends into the range that is less than your minimum value


46259317
for-loop	arrays
Pattern(s): 7	
3 the standard for-loop will execute a function as many times as you define in the parameters and since an arrays is numbered an arrays makes more sense to define how many times you want to execute a function


46344026
pyenv	virtualenv
Pattern(s): 8	
python versions you install using pyenv go into it directory by default pyenv root is .pyenv so are more global than virtualenv


46400849
ubuntu	debian
Pattern(s): 0	
and people do install on people ubuntu system some external libraries so you need to search a lot more than what ubuntu contains and i won t be surprised if ubuntu or debian are large enough to already have conflicting libraries


46459455
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 7	
running a directory from an ide a directory s the root project folder which is harder to deal with


46519058
int	chars
Pattern(s): 0	
in most cases int is a lot larger than chars


46562732
int	chars
Pattern(s): 0	0	
if you write more than one chars inside apostrophe compiler can not convert more than one chars inside apostrophe compiler to chars and will convert to int


46616543
children	parent
Pattern(s): 7	
where the parent node is a smaller value than that of the parent children


46709154
debian	linux
Pattern(s): 0	
the first line in the dockerfile is widely used to have a separated tag with the postfix -alpine in the first line in the dockerfile to indicate that alpine linux is used which is a much smaller base-image than the debian image


46742490
int	chars
Pattern(s): 7	
if chars is smaller then int usually chars is so the structure mystructv1 can be smaller than mystructv2


46757691
children	parent
Pattern(s): 10	
the parent process is probably better to repeatedly wait until there are no more children to wait for


46976533
children	parent
Pattern(s): 7	7	
if that won t help use a small script to add a class to a parent if a parent children is more than 4


47012236
comparator	comparable
Pattern(s): 0	
using just keyfn return a comparable value that matches your requirements is much easier than implementing comparator


47084159
width	height	portrait	landscape
Pattern(s): 7	7	
the program s label changes dynamically so when the width is greater landscape mode the width s label has a different text then when the height is greater portrait mode


47158538
scylla	cassandra
Pattern(s): 8	8	
scylla a cassandra clone which is generally more efficient than cassandra also has similar issues with huge partitions as in cassandra moderately large partitions are fine but similar issues are actively being worked on including re-designing the file format so eventually scylla a cassandra clone which is generally more efficient than cassandra should support arbitrary-sized partitions


47179887
google-chrome	safari
Pattern(s): 0	
figure out how to install selenium with the google-chrome driver safari driver may be faster as the google-chrome driver safari driver js engine is faster


47190769
pthreads	fork
Pattern(s): 10	
pthreads provides a more general interface to the fork system call than any of the other functions discussed here do but pthreads is not portable


47212309
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	
but 3x assets should have a width and height that is 1.5x larger than 3x assets 2x counterparts not 2x larger


47321155
division	multiplication
Pattern(s): 10	
change the half to 0.5 and you should be golden for the math part also multiplication is faster so use the math part instead of division when possible


47341784
inline	inlining
Pattern(s): 7	
but this shouldn t worry you too much as in many cases inline code is much smaller than the original function due to the fact that inlining misses register saving restoring has some parts of inlining removed due to them being evaluated at compile time etc


47398841
floating-point	integer
Pattern(s): 0	
even when the inputs to xcorr are integer values the results which you would expect to be integer values as well can end up having floating-point errors that cause integer values to be slightly larger or smaller than an integer value


47445457
addition	multiplication
Pattern(s): 7	0	
mixing the multiplication operator has a higher precedence than the addition + operator together in single operation could give you unexpected results in some cases


47470338
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 8	
triggers in postgresql have a syntax a bit more complex than mysql because mysql execute procedures as the action


47502088
git-svn	svn2git
Pattern(s): 7	
even though git-svn is easier to start with here are some further reasons why using the kde svn2git instead of git-svn is superior besides git-svn flexibility


47537306
int	double
Pattern(s): 7	
but if the int part is larger than the maximum 64-bit int the int part s not that simple and you need to convert biginteger to float double which hardware doesn t support


47559725
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	0	7	0	
you would then have to swap two sets of constraints one for when the width is less than the height the other for when the height is less than the width in code


47568731
sse	avx
Pattern(s): 0	0	
rep string instructions and especially the non-rep versions re good for code-size but often slower than sse avx loops


47705275
int	double
Pattern(s): 0	
roughly speaking the default argument promotions are the default declaration narrower than an int are converted to int and float values are converted to double


47770440
int	chars
Pattern(s): 7	0	7	
5 print int part with 5 chars if the int part has less than 5 chars fill the int part has with spaces if the int part has has more the int part has will not cut the int part has


47770440
int	chars
Pattern(s): 7	0	7	
2 print decimal part with 2 chars if the int part has less than 2 chars fill the int part has with spaces if the int part has has more cut the int part has to meet 2 chars


47865090
min	max
Pattern(s): 7	
i would handle the case where max - min is greater than maxint64 in which case rand.int63n would fail as you have remarked separately


47893893
post	get
Pattern(s): 0	
also post would be better than get and using a nonce would help prevent unwanted multiple submissions.


48012299
children	parent
Pattern(s): 10	
making the new commit creates that new commit with the current commit as the current commit parent so that the commit that was a head had no children is no longer a head has a child


48025509
int	chars
Pattern(s): 0	
my example will skip the current line if my example contains more than 20 chars before the first comma but cannot prevent int overflows if you specify too long number for id


48112711
uicollectionview	uitableview
Pattern(s): 10	
i made the mistake at first to go with uitableview only to realize halfway that uicollectionview is way more powerful


48162764
min	max
Pattern(s): 2	
since according to the comment all the price records have the same amount you could use the aggregate max or min to just get one of the aggregate max or min and a case expression to choose between max and sum depending on the price_volume_cost_indicator


48172918
inline	inlining	inline-functions	inlining
Pattern(s): 7	
however if the compiler decides that the compiler would rather not inline your static inline-functions either because the compiler think s that inlining is worse or because inlining is impossible then the compiler will have to make a separate copy of that function in each file the compiler s used in


48279920
apk	dex
Pattern(s): 0	
the apk contains the dex - but is much more than the apk


48401319
swift	objective-c
Pattern(s): 7	
minimum deployment target for xcode 9 is 8.0 not 7.0 with coding there is no problem but xcode 9 storyboard add safearea for running layout properly in iphone x also i don t think there is users now running ios 7 regarding swift or objective-c you can accomplish anything with any of users now running ios 7 regarding swift or objective-c but swift is much easier all tutorial now written in swift for new features every wwdc


48435149
int	boolean
Pattern(s): 10	
for a small number of selected elements int indexing is faster than boolean indexing making my method more efficient than tai s method even after tai optimized his code


48870842
int	chars
Pattern(s): 0	
therefore the value of eof cannot be between 0 and 255 which implies that it cannot fit into a chars which implies that it type must be larger than chars for example an int


48983956
setinterval	settimeout
Pattern(s): 10	8	
recursive settimeout is a more flexible method than setinterval


49108936
equals	tostring
Pattern(s): 2	
if you will go this route - you might notice that there might actually be no need to convert number back to string because since you now know number s a number - you can compare number with equals and not tostring .contains .. like you are doing now


49211645
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 0	
converting the for-loop to a while loops is easy but the for-loop is a much safer construct as the for-loop groups the initialization test and increment of the index variable in one clear place


49245198
filtering	grouping
Pattern(s): 7	
what we can see here is concat the arrays into 1 list then grouping by the chars into grouping and then filtering the grouping that contain more than 1 element and in the end revert the chars into list of chars instead of list of grouping


49263298
children	parent
Pattern(s): 7	
the code you have in the question rearranges array elements such that the code you have in the question rearranges satisfy the heap property the value of the parent node is greater than that of the children nodes


49351120
inline	inlining
Pattern(s): 0	
in the case of very small inline functions or a large amount of subsequent optimization the resulting code may be even smaller after inlining since the remaining code if any may be smaller than the overhead involved in the calling the function 2


49351775
children	parent
Pattern(s): 7	0	
the children overflow the children parent element because the children intrinsic height the height of the children contents is larger than the parent s height


49419382
rtsp	rtcp
Pattern(s): 10	
rtsp is more like controlling things for the protocols that actually handle data like rtp rtcp for example


49489810
reactphp	ratchet
Pattern(s): 0	
for that you need to get deeper than ratchet - to reactphp and it eventloop


49494540
integer	unsigned
Pattern(s): 7	
if an operand is an integer that is narrower than an int the compiler undergoes integral promotion as described above to int or unsigned int


49530498
width	height	portrait	landscape
Pattern(s): 7	0	
now an image s time to decide if the camera stored the image as portrait width is smaller than height or as landscape in which case it s your duty to rotate it for display


49535320
kerberos	ntlm
Pattern(s): 10	
ntlm is less secure and negotiate lets the client and server use kerberos if both of the client and server support it - if not both of them fallback to ntlm


49584238
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	
the ideal random location should be spread equally over much less area in question if the height of the box is less than the width then there is less chance of the the sides getting a point


49617767
ring	hiccup
Pattern(s): 0	
if you put some middleware before your wrap-fallback-exception middleware then the laziness will no longer be a problem because the lazy sequence will be realized inside of the hiccup or whatever renderer rather than by ring after all your handlers have finished


49639670
children	parent
Pattern(s): 10	
and with this you can also attach one listener only to the parent is better to have only one event handler instead of 2 or more and the parent will handle when the children are clicked


49665741
int	chars	unsigned	short
Pattern(s): 0	0	0	
note however that the erroneous function does work correctly for types smaller than int signed or unsigned chars and short if types smaller than int signed or unsigned chars and short are indeed smaller than int on the target platform which the c standard does not mandate


49682200
children	parent
Pattern(s): 7	
if parent don t know parent don children and and only the children know of parent don immediate parent there is more work which i ll take you through in three steps


49702119
int	chars
Pattern(s): 0	
when you pass a smaller than int data type as chars is to a variadic function as printf 3 is the parameter is converted to int in case the parameter is signed and to unsigned int in the case the parameter is unsigned


49834893
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 7	7	
major upgrade are based on upgradecode so your application just needs to do a web service call somewhere passing the current productversion and upgradecode and then you need to download any versioning that is higher than your current productversion then install any versioning that is higher than your current productversion


50035849
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 7	
if your tls versioning is less than 1.2 you have to upgrade your tls versioning since the pypi repository is on a brownout period of deprecating early tls


50054485
apache	nginx
Pattern(s): 7	
you can the apache run more than one programmer to listen the same port but if you just want to a map 80 which you open to the public to the backend server you can use a nginx as your delegation server


50061803
keydown	keyup
Pattern(s): 7	
also using keydown is a better idea because if you keep holding the backspace button with keyup the document wont delete the document will delete just one character when you release the button


50162657
coalesce	isnull
Pattern(s): 10	
if all names match don t then use isnull or coalesce but isnull is more efficient


50176807
put	get
Pattern(s): 10	10	
when one says that hashmap get put is o 1 hashmap should really say that the time needed for the get put is more or less constant and does not depend on the number of elements in hashmap so far as far hashmap can be presented on the actual computing system


50201750
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	7	
when an image is scaled an image is done with respect to the top left so an image will always look up if the height is smaller than the prefix or to the right if the width is smaller


50308777
filewriter	bufferedwriter
Pattern(s): 7	0	
maybe contrary to the writer name filewriter is also buffered though its name filewriter has smaller buffer than bufferedwriter so contents are not written to disk immediately


50320618
minimum	max
Pattern(s): 0	
when using the new size std max will basically resize the window to match your object unless the object is smaller than your minimum size


50327546
getter	setter
Pattern(s): 7	
edit following up on the comments above this also means that the properties in the constructor always have to be initialized they can t be computed properties since you can t give they getter and setter that wouldn t use they backing field


50352806
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	
even if an element has a greater width than height or the other way around an element will still become a circle and not an oval


50524225
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	
your implementation was near perfect but the last line of code is redundant as visibilityofelementlocated returns the element once the element is visible the elements are not only displayed but also has a height and width that is greater than 0


50551640
children	parent
Pattern(s): 7	
in case of max heap every parent is greater than max heap children


50568507
hash	salt
Pattern(s): 10	
a rare one amongst a disappointing number that did not hash passwords also hash with the username and some salt which is better


50616894
cpu	processors
Pattern(s): 0	
in the case that a store eventually does become globally visible you have an interesting time-travel type effect the load on the local cpu has potentially seen the store much earlier than other processors and in particular perhaps the store sees the store out of order with respect to other stores on the system
