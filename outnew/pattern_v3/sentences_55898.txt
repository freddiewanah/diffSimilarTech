2905 should be excluded
vim	emacs	vim	emacs
Pattern(s): 
further update just fyi i am not trying to push emacs over vim it s just what i use and it s a great editor as i m sure vim is too
it is daunting at first as i m sure vim is too but the question was about text editors on linux besides vi.
emacs seems the logical choice to me but gedit is a great simple text editor with some nice features if that s all you are looking for

5108 
ubuntu	debian
Pattern(s): 
or ubuntu has some nice gui things that make it easy to control apache mysql php
this article has some of the best ways to lock things down some highlights make sure no one can browse the directories make sure only root has write privileges to everything and only root has read privileges to certain config files run mod_security the article also takes some pointers from this book apache securiy o reilly press as far as distros i ve run debain and ubuntu but it just depends on how much you want to do
i ran debian with no x and just ssh d into it whenever i needed anything

9218
ubuntu	debian
Pattern(s): 
let the nice package maintainers from linux distros such as debian or ubuntu do the work for you
install from the distro s precompiled packages and staying current becomes a matter of issuing the occasional apt-get update apt-get -u dist-upgrade command or using whatever fancy gui tool ubuntu provides

11969
vmware	virtualbox
Pattern(s): 
that being said you should probably try them out with the particular environment and apps you will be using and see which one is best for you
one feature of vmware i really like is the ability to snapshot the system
i do this before every software install and when one of them goes awry i just revert the virtualbox back to the pre-install state
17249
anjuta	kdevelop
Pattern(s): 
kdevelop is a kde project but run on gnome
anjuta is an equivalent project on gnome but i find it unusable for real work
for the rest of the stack gcc make valgrind ddd a gdb ide and python for scripting my code
24174
anjuta	kdevelop
Pattern(s): 
code blocks is also very promising and i like that one best
i hear anjuta is pretty slick for gnome users
i played a bit with kdevelop and it s nice but sort of lacking featurewise
27440
postgresql	mysql	postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
mysql is much more commonly provided by web hosts
postgresql is a much more mature product
there s this discussion addressing your better question apparently according to this web page mysql is fast when concurrent access levels are low and when there are many more reads than writes
29770
vim	emacs
Pattern(s): 
haven t played with both enough yet or tried more types of refactoring but i will do some more hacking with them
in the meantime i ve tried it two tools that have some sort of integration with vim
the first is rope a python refactoring library that comes with a vim and emacs plug-in
29923
bazaar	git
Pattern(s): 
in git you can do the same with playing around in the index staging area but bazaar has a better ui for it
most of the people were reluctant to move over as they have to type in two commands to commit and push bazaar ci + bazaar push
also it was difficult for them to understand the concept of branches and merging no one uses branches or merges them in svn
30197
firefox	safari
Pattern(s): 
here s the relevant documentation for gears workerpool api whatwg has a draft recommendation for worker threads web workers and there s also mozilla s dom worker threads update june 2009 current state of browser support for javascript threads firefox 3.5 has web workers
some demos of web workers if you want to see them in action simulated annealing try it link space invaders link at end of post moonbat javascript benchmark first link the gears plugin can also be installed in firefox
safari 4 and the webkit nightlies have worker threads javascript ray tracer chrome has gears baked in so it can do threads although it requires a confirmation prompt from the user and it uses a different api to web workers although it will work in any browser with the gears plugin installed google gears workerpool demo not a good example as it runs too fast to test in chrome and firefox although ie runs it slow enough to see it blocking interaction ie8 and ie9 can only do threads with the gears plugin installed
35297
bazaar	git
Pattern(s): 
bazaar also had better documentation for integrating with native applications like visual c
i ve had the best luck with bazaar followed by mercurial
never could get git to work correctly
37660
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
i use postgresql and my answer works correctly there i tried it
see the postgresql update docs under parameters expression where it mentions that expressions on the right hand side of set clauses explicitly use the old values of columns
i see that the corresponding mysql update docs contain the statement single-table update assignments are generally evaluated from left to right which implies the behaviour you describe
40699
google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 
you might find a more conclusive answer on the development site dev.chromium.org and some of the developers might be on irc on #chromium on freenode
google-chrome does support the netscape plugin api but that is for displaying certain kinds of content
you seem to be after a extention api really firefox is the only major browser to encourage and support third party extentions to browsing capability that aren t simply new toolbars nothing in the developer documentation points to a browser enhancing api - google seem to want to keep a tight reign on the look and feel of the application
47735
firefox	safari
Pattern(s): 
different browsers implement this differently since it is not a common status code
alas unlike the opera and firefox developers the ie developers have never read the spec and even the latest most secure ie7 will redirect the post request from domain a to domain b without any warnings or confirmation dialogs
safari also acts in an interesting manner while it does not raise a confirmation dialog and performs the redirect it throws away the post data effectively changing 307 redirect into the more common 302
55578
vmware	virtualbox
Pattern(s): 
virtualbox users open a terminal.app on your mac you can find it in applications utilities and run the following sequence of commands replacing input.vhd with the name of the vhd file you re starting from and output.vdi with the name you want your final disk image to have applications q.app contents macos qemu-img convert -o raw -f vpc input.vhd temp.bin vboxmanage convertdd temp.bin output.vdi rm temp.bin mv output.vdi library virtualbox vdi vboxmanage modifyvdi output.vdi compact start virtualbox and create a new virtual machine select the new vdi file you ve just created as the boot hard disk vmware fusion users open a terminal.app on your mac you can find it in applications utilities and run the following commands replacing input.vhd and output.vmdk with the name of the vhd file you re working on and the name you want your resulting disk image to have applications q.app contents macos qemu-img convert -o vmdk -f vpc input.vhd output.vmdk mv output.vmdk documents virtual machines.localized this will probably take a while it takes around 30 minutes per disk image on my 2.4ghz core 2 duo macbook w 2gb ram
start vmware fusion and create a new virtual machine in the advanced disk options select use and existing disk and find the vmdk file you just created

60119
cassini	iis
Pattern(s): 
at this point you will be able to run your localhost over https
cassini does not support https
however you can use iis to do this if your using iis 5.1 download the ms iis toolpack for iis 6.0 it comes with a tool to create self signed ssl certificates
67626
google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 
and it s slow as hell in firefox
works better with opera and google-chrome though. ff3 windows xp ati

67878
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
Pattern(s): 
additionally won t work for your example as it will either work when word-breaking but when not word-breaking not display any hyphens or work when not word-breaking but display two hyphens when word-breaking since it adds a hyphen on a break
your example works as expected in google-chrome safari windows and ie8
the text breaks out of the 150px box in firefox 3 and opera 9.5
70042
bazaar	git
Pattern(s): 
and give me the flexibility i need see my article on git + visual studio
i think bazaar can do similar things and might be better at one thing it can easily support non-distributed central-repository based development

70427
quicksort	mergesort
Pattern(s): 
i m a bigger fan of mergesort than i am of quicksort for these reasons
quicksort has a better average case complexity but in some applications it is the wrong choice
quicksort is vulnerable to denial of service attacks
70430
quicksort	mergesort	quicksort	mergesort
Pattern(s): 
in the worst case they are the same amount of algorithmic time but mergesort requires more storage
wikipedia s explanation is typically quicksort is significantly faster in practice than other θ nlogn algorithms because its inner loop can be efficiently implemented on most architectures and in most real-world data it is possible to make design choices which minimize the probability of requiring quadratic time
quicksort mergesort i think there are also issues with the amount of storage needed for mergesort which is ω n that quicksort implementations don t have
77794
bazaar	git	bazaar	git
Pattern(s): 
it is very easy to lose a commit or ruin a repository especially if you do not understand the inner workings of git
mercurial and bazaar resemble themselves very much on the surface
they both provide basic distributed version control as in offline commit and merging multiple branches are both written in python and are both slower than git
77794
bazaar	git
Pattern(s): 
git well is not for the uninitiated
it is much faster than both mercurial and bazaar and was written to manage the linux kernel
it is the fastest of the three and it is also the most powerful of the three by quite a margin
77943
bazaar	git
Pattern(s): 
git is fastest but all three are fast enough
bazaar is the most flexible it has transparent read-write support for svn repositories and cares a lot about the user experience
mercurial is somewhere in the middle
77945
quicksort	mergesort
Pattern(s): 
with o n 2 worst case that rarely happens quicksort is potentially far slower than the o nlogn of the merge sort
quicksort has less overhead so with small n and slow computers it is better
but computers are so fast today that the additional overhead of a mergesort is negligible and the risk of a very slow quicksort far outweighs the insignificant overhead of a mergesort in most cases
85803
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
we still have few problems with the postgresql one
we did a move from a mysql3 to postgresql 8.2 then 8.3
postgresql has the basic of sql and a lot more so if your mysql do not use fancy mysql stuff you will be ok
86173
jython	pypy
Pattern(s): 
pypy is an experimental interpreter compiler that may one day supplant cpython but for now is more of a testbed for new ideas
jython and ironpython are useful if you have an overriding need to interface with existing libraries written in a different platform like if you have 100 000 lines of java and you just want to write a 20-line python script
not particularly useful for anything else in my opinion because they are perpetually a few versions behind cpython due to community inertia
97431
google-chrome	safari
Pattern(s): 
it is not real ie it s mainly only its rendering engine html+css+js plus web client http and some more protocols control itself has no menu bookmarks etc
google-chrome is full featured browser
so you should be asking for webkit rendering engine google-chrome use developed by safari s guys control
105921
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
or you can use the free tool pgadmin
i like postgresql maestro
i also use their version for mysql
106334
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
in your example you would want something like this select o.id o.address o.otherdetails group_concat concat e.firstname e.lastname as employees from employees e inner join organization o on o.org_id e.org_id group by o.org_id postgresql - edit postgresql 9.0 is equally simple now that string_agg expression delimiter is built-in
here it is with comma-space between elements select o.id o.address o.otherdetails string_agg e.firstname || || e.lastname as employees from employees e inner join organization o on o.org_id e.org_id group by o.org_id postgresql before 9.0 allows you to define your own aggregate functions with create aggregate
slightly more work than mysql but much more flexible
109979
vmware	virtualbox
Pattern(s): 
for myself i stick with vmware workstation 7+ years and vmware server for my linux-hosted virtualization needs
at work it s vmware workstation on windows vmware server on windows and vmware esx on bare metal
i ll probably have another look at xen kvm and virtualbox at some point but for right now compatibility between work and home is paramount
110162
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
mysql is a pretty popular database lots of tools are available and lots of books
sqlite and postgresql are also quite popular and also free open-source

114544
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
these databases are very different - mysql is speed and simplicity postgresql is robustness and concurrency
it will be easier for you to learn postgresql it is not that hard

120052
bazaar	git
Pattern(s): 
difficulty with git has been understanding the implications of the distributed model
i did glance briefly at other dvcses like bazaar and mercurial and they seemed to be somewhat more newbie-friendly
anyway as others have said subversion is probably the easiest way to get used to the version control mindset and get practical experience of the benefits of vcs rollback branches collaborative development easier code review etc
126003
google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 
or you could fire up firefox in full screen mode in a dedicated vnc server instance and use a screenshot grabber to take the screenshot
fullscreen minimal google-chrome vnc server instance no visible ui + you can choose your resolution
use xinit with xvnc as the x server to do this - you ll need to read all the manpages
129279
vmware	virtualbox
Pattern(s): 
you can revert to any previous snapshots and name them
3 it has nat support and bridged networking like the vmware and microsoft products
4 there is no server version of virtualbox but i know it shares an engine with qemu so it may be possible to host your vbox images on qemu
133160
firefox	safari
Pattern(s): 
it pays to have the headers set correctly and it s worth investigating etags
afaik there is no difference on the part of browsers as both firefox and ie will incorrectly cache the response from a url with a querystring in the same way they cache the response from a url without a querystring
in the case of safari it respects the spec and doesn t cache urls with querystrings
133954
google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 
if you are creating a firefox plugin place your code in a xul overlay
if you really want to allow any web page to do whatever it is your plugin does you can establish some mechanism through wich the page can ask the plugin to do the operation with its google-chrome privileges and send the result to the page afterwards

134999
bazaar	git
Pattern(s): 
non-distributed solutions such as subversion don t have that capability
a href rel nofollow noreferrer bazaar a does what you re asking for in terms of working very well standalone and there was a 2007 summer of code project to build a href rel nofollow noreferrer a visual studio integration plugin a which appears to have a href rel nofollow noreferrer produced an at-least-partially-functional product a
bazaar and other distributed tools such as git mercurial darcs and the like are ideal because you can have your repository stored in multiple places ie
135226
firefox	safari
Pattern(s): 
john resig has a good explanation
here s the full version breakdown ie 6-7 support jscript 5 which is equivalent to ecmascript 3 javascript 1.5 ie 8 supports jscript 6 which is equivalent to ecmascript 3 javascript 1.5 - more bug fixes over jscript 5 firefox 1.0 supports javascript 1.5 ecmascript 3 equivalent firefox 1.5 supports javascript 1.6 1.5 + array extras + e4x + misc. firefox 2.0 supports javascript 1.7 1.6 + generator + iterators + let + misc. firefox 3.0 supports javascript 1.8 1.7 + generator expressions + expression closures + misc. the next version of firefox will support javascript 1.9 1.8 + to be determined opera supports a language that is equivalent to ecmascript 3 + getter and setter + misc
safari supports a language that is equivalent to ecmascript 3 + getter and setter + misc
144890
quicksort	mergesort
Pattern(s): 
note that the bit-flipping trick can be used regardless of what sorting algorithm you actually use.
all things being equal i d expect most people to use whatever is most conveniently available and that tends to be quicksort 3
other than that quicksort is known to be very fast on arrays just like mergesort is the common choice for lists
149442
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	safari
Pattern(s): 
much like the safari browser does
at first i believed it was a built-in feature of the wysiwym markdown editor but shog9 is correct it s not baked-in at all but is courtesy of the jquery plugin textarearesizer i was lead astray by the browser was using to check on the editor demo because google-chrome itself adds the expandable functionality on textareas mdash
much like the safari browser does
151912
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
each client will receive the last inserted id for the last statement that client executed
this is the sequence solution for postgresql you d have to do it in a stored procedure or on your application code of course
for mysql the transaction is important not to trip on your own feet in case you re using the same connection for more than one insert
163395
google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 
after noticing that some of you are still trying to get this to work i decided to try a new approach
my results are far better this time around - at least on google-chrome on linux
i no longer have a windows pc available to me so i can only test on google-chrome firefox on ubuntu
173406
firefox	safari
Pattern(s): 
currently i believe that safari is the only shipping browser to support any of these and i believe it only supports the client side databases and local storage parts
edit olliej correction firefox 3 supports the application cache but alas not the client side db

176071
google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 
if the interface does not rely heavily on javascript then it must degrade gracefully enough to be usable in text based and mobile browsers such as opera mobile links lynx iphone etc this includes any necessary optimisations for the screen size informational non-application sites must be at least tested with a screenreader i will put no significant effort into supporting firefox 1 and ie5.5 or below
new functionality must be tested and at least working with upcoming browsers such as ie8 and google-chrome
it s pointless ignoring these as they are both likely to become very popular in the coming months and years
176144
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
Pattern(s): 
also a side effect of targeting safari first ie is likely to be less painful as the webkit team has gone to great lengths to comply with existing practices wherever possible
google-chrome comes last because it s so likely to just work if safari is good to go
edit firefox 2 comes before firefox 3 because its support set is more restricted
195398
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
of course the picture is not so simple innodb tables on mysql have a very different performance behaviour at the load levels where postgresql s better locks overtake mysql s other parts of your platform could be the bottlenecks
postgresql does comply better with standards so it can be easier to replace later
in the end the choice has so many variables that no matter which way you go you ll find some important issue that makes it the right choice
196933
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
Pattern(s): 
but the savings in transferred bytes can be enormous
i ve successfully tested it in firefox 3 msie 7 opera 9 and google-chrome
it apparently doesn t work this way in safari 3
207062
google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 
firefox also has the word google-chrome all over its code base
google-chrome is an application not a window or a directx which you can create as a control
you can however as someone already mention host a webkit control
207062
google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 
a folder called google-chrome can mean any number of things
google-chrome is a general term for the ui of a browser
firefox also has the word google-chrome all over its code base
210096
ubuntu	debian
Pattern(s): 
urgency low sandro tosi debian control - list items lines in description starts with 2 space to avoid reformat on webpages closes #480341 bernd zeimetz debian patches 02_reconnect.dpatch - dropping patch comment in storm which explains the problem
if you are using ubuntu linux there was a patch added to the python-mysql package that added the ability to set that same mysql_opt_reconnect option see here
i have not tried it though
212565
quicksort	mergesort
Pattern(s): 
mergesort this will teach how to merge which is important because there are a ton of speedups you can get by merging two sorted lists together as well as how to divide the problem into smaller sub problems important for dealing with hierarchical structures and also used in quick sort
quicksort though faster is much harder to understand
you need two scanning variables a pivot item etc.
215746
firefox	safari
Pattern(s): 
camino contains native svg support as per its own documentation google-chrome uses an old version of web kit to support svg natively konqueror has svg support via a plugin ksvg2 from 2007 a here is a list of the state of svg support in many browsers
opera has native svg support firefox has native svg support internet explorer does not include svg support natively
safari has native svg support for images and fonts since version 3.1
215746
google-chrome	safari
Pattern(s): 
safari has native svg support for images and fonts since version 3.1
camino contains native svg support as per its own documentation google-chrome uses an old version of web kit to support svg natively konqueror has svg support via a plugin ksvg2 from 2007 a here is a list of the state of svg support in many browsers

220279
cassini	iis
Pattern(s): 
in windows you can find hosts here c windows system32 drivers etc you can go into your web project settings and have it use the local iis as a host instead and then it will work fine
microsoft doesn t allow this on purpose - they don t want you deploying your application with cassini
it s compiled right into its code
237472
vim	emacs
Pattern(s): 
also whichever editor you prefer vim or emacs learn it back forth
if you like vim then get steve oualline s vim book

258093
awt	swing
Pattern(s): 
i don t think that awt is capable of restyling native component peers in a reliable fashion
i know for certain that swt can t and it s a far more sophisticated toolkit than awt
this is part of why it was essentially deprecated in favor of swing back in java 1.2
259460
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
postgresql is more compliant but if you re comfortable with mysql and you re using an orm you should probably use that
i suggest using nhibernate with postgresql
you can do all your testing and development on sqlite so you don t need to have an instance of postgresql running on your dev machine
281685
cassini	iis
Pattern(s): 
the constantly changing port is also rather disconcerting to me
also for each web project in your solution it fires up another instance of a cassini server and each one takes anywhere from 20 to 50 mb of memory
i use iis all the time it s pretty easy to setup and you guys are already doing that.
294744
cassini	iis
Pattern(s): 
here s a link to how this is accomplished debugging asp.net is a bit different though and i m not sure if this will work for you
if you are debugging locally using the light weight web server cassini you can apply this trick to cassini itself
if you are debuggin directly on a web server though inside of iis i don t know how to get this trick to work but hopefully it will lead you in the right direction
299256
firefox	safari
Pattern(s): 
a short tutorial that demonstrates mixing xul javascript and other technologies to update a website
lastly here s a good lifehacker tutorial on firefox extensions add-ons which shows you much of the above for a simple example and then how to package it as an .xpi so others can easily add it to and manage it from their firefox
i don t have any insight into safari but it s based on webkit and there should be some resources on customizing it similar to how you d use xul on firefox
299849
firefox	safari
Pattern(s): 
i see this behaviour on firefox for example not safari for what that s worth
you can reload the page and bypass the cache on firefox using ctrl - shift - r and you ll see the check value doesn t carry a normal ctrl - r will grab the info from the cache however edit i was able to disable this server side on firefox setting a cache control header cache-control no-store this seems to disable the remember form values feature of firefox

301140
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
ecpg will do with c++ that is was not the case for some other preprocessors .
you should have a look at c preprocessors that exists traditionaly with databases ecpg for postgresql pro c for oracle .
which lets you embed straight sql directly in your source files or an orginal system for mysql
312468
firefox	safari
Pattern(s): 
instead if you want to read the inside size use clientwidth clientheight instead of offsetwidth offsetheight or measure the offsetwidth of a block inside the one with the scrollbar
document.body.offsetwidth returns the innerwidth value from left hand side to the left side of the vertical scrollbar in firefox
not for me it doesn t it returns the same value as ie opera konqueror and safari
320820
awt	swing
Pattern(s): 
however awt and swing objects allocate some amount of native resources that need to be freed
furthermore the awt thread treats the windows as top-level objects preventing them from being garbage collected and the jvm from terminating
thus when you are done with your window you need to dispose of it which frees the native resources that it has allocated
323809
firefox	safari
Pattern(s): 
dammit that was the property i was looking for
as the others said you can use firebug and that will sort you out no worries on firefox
chrome safari both have a built-in developer console which has an almost identical interface to firebug s console so your code should be portable across those browsers
326953
postgresql	mysql	postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
mysql exempts schema modifications from transactions
i have a postgresql background so that s an obvious thing to do begin a transaction do some stuff commit or rollback -- postgresql isn t picky about what do some stuff is
you can find a few bugs on this if you look through mysql s bug base
342137
cassini	iis	cassini	iis
Pattern(s): 
i ve had problems with security thread.currentprincipal etc on cassini that just disappeared when i started debugging against iis
probably not relevant to this discussion but be careful testing debugging on cassini
its threading model is different from iis
343797
bazaar	git
Pattern(s): 
basically id does not make any sense with bazaar git and other distributed source code management tools
having automatically generated id tags that show a sensible version number is impossible to do with dscm tools like bazaar because everybody s line of development can be different from all others
so somebody could refer to version 1.41 of a file but your version 1.41 of that file is different
349968
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
you can certainly make a case against mysql since some of the most important features in regard to data safety have been added only recently
if you re concerned about that use postgresql instead
as for the language you write your app in php has definitely proven to be able to run extremely large and complex systems
350855
anjuta	kdevelop
Pattern(s): 
looks promising
then there are some others where i cannot tell you how they are since i ve not tested them including anjuta for the gnome desktop and code blocks written with wxwidgets it s quite cross-platform
if all you want is a gui for the compiler and a symbol browser you could also use geany which is very fast and includes an embedded terminal like kdevelop
353563
cassini	iis
Pattern(s): 
you will also need to add a script mapping in the application configuration for .jss to the aspnet_isapi.dll in windows microsoft.net framework vxxxx directory
iis6 doesn t do the intergrated pipeline that is intrinsic to cassini and is default in iis7
edit details in iis manager open application properties
356920
google-chrome	safari
Pattern(s): 
if you have the necessary resources i would advise to look into fixing it up
google-chrome uses webkit a fairly standard rendering engine
safari uses it also and it doesn t sound like webkit is going away
373684
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
Pattern(s): 
i ve noticed that there can sometimes be problems where using a font like arial it shows up fine in firefox google-chrome ie but on safari it can cause a line to wrap because the font is slightly bigger
safari uses mac fonts but google-chrome would use windows fonts
i ve noticed that there can sometimes be problems where using a font like arial it shows up fine in firefox google-chrome ie but on safari it can cause a line to wrap because the font is slightly bigger
376065
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
Pattern(s): 
then apply ie-specific fixes
hopefully it ll render ok in google-chrome and safari
the reason is that there are fixes available to make ie work properly but not many to make firefox behave badly
384640
bazaar	git
Pattern(s): 
basically id does not make any sense with bazaar git and other distributed source code management tools
as i ve written before having automatically generated id tags that show a sensible version number is impossible to do with dscm tools like bazaar because everybody s line of development can be different from all others
so somebody could refer to version 1.41 of a file but your version 1.41 of that file is different
402883
google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 
including a script tag which would load fire off your javascript code
for a basic extension you would place your code in the google-chrome content directory of the extension
you would hook this content into firefox using an overlay
408830
awt	swing
Pattern(s): 
finally you might also want to check out swt the gui toolkit used for eclipse and an alternative to both awt and swing which is somewhat of a return to the awt idea of accessing native widgets through java
awt is a java interface to native system gui code present in your os
it will not work the same on every system although it tries
408830
awt	swing
Pattern(s): 
features of widgets that aren t the same on every platform might not be supported or worse they might work differently on each platform
people used to invest lots of effort to get their awt applications to work consistently across platforms - for instance they may try to make calls into native code from java
because awt uses native gui widgets your os knows about them and handles putting them in front of each other etc. whereas swing widgets are meaningless pixels within a window from your os s point of view

postgresql	mysql	postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
mysql has improved a lot with its later versions but postgresql still beats it in every category
for any application that wants to use an open source database the hands-down answer is postgresql
it s a lot more enterprise-ready than mysql not to mention that it follows the sql standard a lot better

vmware	virtualbox
Pattern(s): 
there is also sun s virtualbox which is free and the latest version is rather nice but i haven t looked at how slow disk operations are yet
with vmware disk operations are slower
for php development i doubt it would be a problem but you d definitely notice it if you are compiling a large c++ project

bazaar	git
Pattern(s): 
it will allow you to check out code from your subversion repositories develop independently with local history and check your code back in to subversion as and when you need to
take a look at bazaar
it s rather less daunting than git and has a useful-looking interface to subversion repositories via bzr-svn

firefox	safari
Pattern(s): 
normal or break-word. this is currently supported in ie safari and firefox 3.1 alpha
with older and current versions of firefox there is no standard way google was my friend of doing it
some suggest using a small script that adds in the middle of the word

firefox	safari
Pattern(s): 
on the plus side it s trivial to just use the constructor that takes a string instead
you don t even have to convert the numeric month into a string on firefox at least so i was hoping a naive implementation would work
however after trying it out it works successfully in firefox chrome and opera but fails in konqueror invalid date safari invalid date and ie nan

cassini	iis	cassini	iis
Pattern(s): 
edit and now 6 1 2 years later i d recommend iis express instead
you can try the cassini web server
edit and now 6 1 2 years later i d recommend iis express instead

firefox	safari
Pattern(s): 
firefox is just better for web development and i prefer safari overall
firefox lets you use different profiles
each profile can have separate preferences themes and plugins

ubuntu	debian
Pattern(s): 
there s a really good article at debian package a day about it
it does require kernel patching although ubuntu already has the patch applied i m not sure about any other distributions.

postgresql	mysql	postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 
mysql is easy to set up fast for oltp and generally takes the approach of doing few things and doing them well
postgresql is kind of the opposite -- it s a database researcher s favorite playground which means it has a dozen different join strategies storage engines advanced optional packages and all kinds of stuff
it s slower than mysql when doing things mysql does well and blows it out of the water when doing things mysql just doesn t know how to do see above with hash joins

vmware	virtualbox	vmware	virtualbox
Pattern(s): 
click here to download pre-built virtualbox images akin to vmware virtual appliances
vmware requires you to submit your contact information to download vmware server
sun s virtualbox gets the job done and you can just download the application without registration or hassles

quicksort	mergesort
Pattern(s): 
mergesort is still a pretty good solution for large data sets or other data structures like linked lists as your experiments confirm
one of the advantages of quicksort for relatively small array sizes is just an artifact of hardware implementation
on arrays quicksort can be done in-place meaning that you re reading from and writing to the same area of memory

quicksort	mergesort
Pattern(s): 
you can see both of these behaviors in your example implementations
as a result for relatively small datasets quicksort is more likely to get cache hits and therefore just tends to run faster on most hardware
mergesort is still a pretty good solution for large data sets or other data structures like linked lists as your experiments confirm
